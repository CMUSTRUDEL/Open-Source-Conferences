00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,280
red hat

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,639
basically helping teams uh work more

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,280
effectively together

00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,400

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,040
we all need as human beings and as a

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,360
project

uh matthew i really appreciate that um

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,199
so yeah hi and welcome to the first

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,159
session

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,920
um of the day on the last day of nest

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,560
and i'm sure many of you got to take

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,720
part in

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,479
lots of different hackfests and

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,159
community quizzes and

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,400
different sessions and that it's been

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,240
really great i've really enjoyed it

00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,920
and so today we're going to look at

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,000
resilience and explore

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,360
explore it a little bit and around how

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,880
we can help ourselves

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,560
and each other so ethan is going to help

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,360
out she's volunteered she should be on

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,200
the call here

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,360
is going to keep an eye on the chat so

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,079
if anybody's any questions or anything

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,439
add them on to the chat and if sure if

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,720
it will capture those

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,640
and then at the end of the session if

00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,439
you've any time at all then we can go

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,680
through those

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,840
if not i'll definitely reach out on a

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,840
breakout session or somewhere in chat to

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,200
address those questions

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,680
so we want to um on this session today i

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,759
would go

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,880
through i suppose different aspects of

00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,880
resilience and why

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,960
and why it's important but it would be

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,479
good for yourselves to possibly take out

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,119
a notepad and pen or

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,960
or open up another tab and on your

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,000
screen and start kind of jotting down a

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,560
few things that might

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,720
resonate with you around possible things

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,160
that you could take on board to try and

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,959
improve things in your own lives

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,959
so before we kick off i just want to

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,120
introduce myself a little bit more

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,760
and so some probably most of you have

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,160
never heard of sarah finn

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,280
and i've been working with cpe so the

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,840
community platform

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,800
engineering team since november last

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,000
year

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,480
as their agile coach and trying to to

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,319
work with the team like matthew said um

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,959
on addressing challenges that they might

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,640
have

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,000
and trying to get them to come together

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,440
to find solutions

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,280
and that includes all their different

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,720
stakeholders within the community as

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,959
well

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,720
i'm from ireland um in the sunny

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,879
southeast the oldest city

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,160
in in ireland in watford and it's living

00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,120
up to its name today

00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,599
sun is absolutely split in the rocks and

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,000
if i

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,800
if i get to watch a liverpool match on

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,920
any day i'm happy out a keen liverpool

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,080
fan as well

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,599
and i have a lovely family as well

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,480
you'll see a picture of those and a

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,519
great um

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:16,959
dog that i love to walk um so for me

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:19,360
like team is team ism is the cornerstone

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,360
of how we get things done and create a

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,440
sense of happiness

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,959
and also taking time out to do a little

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,440
bit of self-discovery

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,920
so my own um self-discovery journey

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,000
probably really happened about 10 years

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,080
or so when i really needed to

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,040
build on my own resilience and build on

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,959
my own um

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,879
strengths inner strengths to i suppose

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:42,239
allow me to to progress

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,680
um at that time we were in a global

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,760
recession myself and

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,239
alan had just returned from australia

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,159
and and we had just had our daughter

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,519
um addison and both of us were

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,640
unemployed at the time

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:57,519
so it was a difficult um time to be in

00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,159
at that point we did take some time out

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,120
to pull

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,799
the covers over our head and to blame

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,040
the banks blame everyone else

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,920
and but then you know we came around and

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,080
kind of said

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,280
we are the captains of our own ship we

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,120
need to make positive

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,959
and we need to have positive thinking

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,519
and be a little bit more optimistic

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,199
and take our own um actions that we need

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,400
to take to build on our resilience and

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,079
to allow us to

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,519
to move forward so that's from a

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,880
personal perspective

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:27,360
and then as i work with teams the

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,360
inclusion of of teams building on their

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,919
resiliences is a huge thing

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,199
within an agile team as the teams are

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,240
sometimes asked to

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:38,240
think outside the box and try to change

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,120
a slightly way of working to be more

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,040
collaborative

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,120
so their minds need to be open quite

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,000
regularly to constantly continually

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,479
improve

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,120
over time so building their resilience

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,199
and

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:53,360
strengthening their inner resources

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,360
definitely helps on that journey as well

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,680
so resilience what is it resilience is

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,919
the ability to adapt positively

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,800
in the face of adverse adversity and

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,560
change

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,080
so there's always going to be change

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,960
there's always going to be uncertainty

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,280
in the world

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,880
but how we view that change and how we

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,360
view that uncertainty

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,199
is part of our resilience if we look at

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,919
it as a positive as a more of an

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,759
opportunity then we are we're building

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,280
on our resilience over time

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,199
so it might be worthwhile kind of

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,479
jotting down what does resilience look

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,800
like for you

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,560
is it you know that you can absolutely

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,280
take on any challenge that comes your

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,840
way

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,759
and or is it that you you reach out and

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:38,160
collaborate with people quite regularly

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:40,960
and have an optimistic mindset

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,840
important to note is being resilient

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,759
doesn't mean

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,360
that a person won't experience

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,000
difficulty or distress

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,600
so there's no one that that is unique

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,919
and that does not experience

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,199
difficulty or distress in their lives

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,440
even billionaires

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,960
even people that have the that that

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,160
would look like have to have the best

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,639
lives possible

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,759
they experience difficulty and distress

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,560
as well

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,000
but by cultivating resilience it is

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,800
possible to navigate

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,440
our emotions so to be aware of our

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,360
emotions

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,840
how we're feeling why are we feeling

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,479
that way and to learn from them

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,440
so how how will i how will i action this

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,680
feeling

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,440
is it something that i can do to to make

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,000
things better for myself

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,199
and harness inner resources to adapt and

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,319
move forward

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,880
constructively so ensuring that i'm

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,919
making

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,000
keeping my um mental health and

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,720
well-being and on a on a good

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,400
a good supply so that when things change

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,880
that i have the resources

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,440
and to allow me to to move forward

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,440
positively

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,319
so this board is meant to be as chaotic

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,440
as it looks

00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:55,120
because we have never been in such

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,319
an era whereby a lot of things are on

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,280
our plate at the moment

00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,440
there's a global pandemic and that has

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,400
caused us to shift our structure our

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,520
routines

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,400
our way of living overnight and it has

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,440
caused us

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,599
to to shift in our mindsets and some

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,240
people have kind of knuckled down and

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,280
kept

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,400
plowing away um hoping that you know

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,759
things think that

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,759
there's a vaccine that will come out

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,520
tomorrow and everything will be fine

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,520
and there's others that are trying to

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,440
adjust a little bit more to it to kind

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,160
of ease themselves into it

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,560
and to take it easy be a bit

00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,639
self-compassionate

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,560
and but there's lots going on there's

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,080
lots going on that that's not giving

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,160
ourselves a break

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,440
giving our minds a rest from everything

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,919
that we're trying to process

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,039
on a daily basis so it could be that

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,680
you're working from home

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,160
you're trying to juggle child and home

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,280
and

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,120
homeschool help you have toddlers asking

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,280
why all the time you have a dog that

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,039
wants to go for a walk every second

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,879
and you have a boss that's saying you

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,599
know time for something new or whatever

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,080
that might be

00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,520
every week or every day and our

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,280
colleagues or our friends

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,199
you know it's there's always something

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,879
to digest and trying to get your your

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,120
head around as well

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,440
also we've been nev we've never had so

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,599
much communication which is brilliant

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,520
in one sense and in other sense we

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,479
really need to protect yourselves around

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,039
it

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,400
so for example we have our our mobile

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,120
phones we were on our

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,639
laptops quite a lot and now that you

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,319
know we're working from home and

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,000
and that can kind of sometimes continue

00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,840
into into all hours

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,599
uh which shouldn't be the case but we

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,719
definitely have um

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,519
an option to to view information at any

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,279
point

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,360
which can just be overwhelming and

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,279
eating into our well-being time and

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,519
where we need to try and

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,560
ensure that we're working on ourselves

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,600
and giving ourselves

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,640
some headspace also with markets

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,880
fluctuating

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,240
um all the time as well it kind of

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,040
leaves people might be feeling

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,040
scared about what that might mean and

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,720
also with revolution and change and

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,080
protests that are happening all around

00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,800
around the world which

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,200
is amazing to see people come together

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,880
and

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,640
you know to really rally around

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,399
something that means that means that is

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,399
important to them

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,160
but again it's something that we need to

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,920
uh to digest

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,920
so all of this can be a little bit

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,959
overwhelming if we're not minding

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:19,360
ourselves a bit more

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:22,080
so if we don't support ourselves to

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:25,360
adapt to our ever-changing world

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,440
which in reality is it is here to stay

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,200
we've never been in such a fast-paced

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,160
environment with all the technology that

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,760
we have

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:36,880
and if an event happens in china to

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,480
tomorrow you know our world and

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,560
people are making changes they're making

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,360
opinions or whatever that might be and

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,600
what's happening

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,959
from from other sides of the world so

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,279
this is it you know this

00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,160
is this is the normal way of life now so

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,720
we just need to

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,760
to mind ourselves a bit more because if

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,519
we don't do that

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:58,160
what inevitably happens is we all become

00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,480
burnt out and i thought this was a good

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,279
illustration to to show what that might

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,760
look like uh whereby you know we're not

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:08,800
looking after ourselves our bodies

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,160
our ideas are very few uh we don't see a

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,320
light at the end of the tunnel

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,839
and we're hiding under this at some

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,640
point uh time is

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,600
is ticking away and and just feeling in

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,399
a very stuck

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,880
place um of keep being on that hamster

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,880
wheel

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,880
and without actually coming up for air

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,959
so what might burnout look like so

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,760
burnout

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:33,680
and i have experienced this myself um

00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,079
numerous times and i still have to go

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,680
back and really work on on trying to

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,880
help myself and build build the

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:44,560
resilience um but burnout usually starts

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:46,640
um with sleep problems so we're bringing

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,399
um all the all the information that

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,399
we've gathered throughout the day

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,240
and i've come across a stat on it a

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,839
couple of days ago to say that

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,600
our brain actually um tries has 30 000

00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,200
thoughts i think a day

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,640
which is phenomenal i really need to

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,040
look into that to see if that's a good

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,839
an

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,720
accurate fact and but sometimes then we

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,360
can bring those

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,880
uh to into our bedrooms with it and then

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,640
it can disturb our sleep

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,519
when we're not getting a break or we're

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:16,560
not switching off on time

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,519
it is um can we can suffer from being

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,440
able to focus

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,040
so things are taking a little bit longer

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,200
than usual usual

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,880
we are low or an irritable mood and a

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,800
lot of that can feed in from from the

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,440
sleep problems if we're not sleeping

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,560
we're not able uh to open up our minds

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,279
to new ideas

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,800
new suggestions and because it takes a

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,480
bit more effort because we're extra

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,880
tired

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,760
and we can experience conflict so with

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,360
that

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,600
um you know we could become a little bit

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,320
defensive a little bit angry

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,839
um around people having different

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,639
different opinions

00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:53,200
uh performing basic tasks become harder

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,519
become exhaust exhausted over time

00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,240
so some days you might have at the start

00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,160
of this pandemic whereby we were we were

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,200
all kind of um asked to work from home

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,480
and a lot of people would have worked

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,560
from home already

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,480
um but we might have thought yeah you

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,320
know we can handle this we can keep on

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,040
top of everything that comes with

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,160
working from home and but over time we

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,839
could probably see ourselves

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,760
deteriorating a little bit

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,440
and in regards to our tiredness being

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,320
able to manage things

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,279
um and all that so we can you know when

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,240
it's needed

00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,680
to to be online maybe for you know more

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,279
than your eight hours or whatever that

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,920
might be in your working day

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:32,000
and that's okay in very small

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,399
exceptional circumstances but it can't

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,839
be

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:38,240
um it can't be prolonged we could suffer

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,639
from anxiety and panic attacks

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,920
feel empty or lacking an emotion so we

00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,959
start withdrawing

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:48,399
um negative self-talk or we blame others

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:50,800
so we internally um doubt ourselves

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:54,320
uh feel we're not good enough or are we

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:56,079
and we we project that on onto others

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,040
we withdraw emotionally from family and

00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:01,760
friends with inability to make decisions

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,600
um i have been in a shop when i at the

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,839
height of a burnout uh

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,839
when a couple of years ago and i think i

00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,760
remember being there for like

00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,399
a good five minutes trying to decide

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,639
what chocolate bar to buy

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,399
so it could come down to that it could

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,000
really paralyze you and that would have

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,560
so many decisions

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,600
it just becomes overwhelming and lose

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,760
motivation

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,720
a reduced initiative reduce initiative

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,240
and creativity

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,320
so again you kind of shrink into

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,839
yourself a little bit and we start to

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,079
feel a little bit stuck

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,680
so as you can imagine when some people

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,639
might say oh i think you're

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,120
you're burnt out it's it's a serious

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,519
thing

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,279
and because it affects so many so much

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,440
so many aspects of your life

00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,880
and that you really need to look at ways

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,160
of protecting yourself

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:50,240
from experiencing that

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,199
so if you're taking if you're not taking

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,320
care of yourself

00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:56,399
it is normal to feel burnt out so it

00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,279
doesn't mean that you're not able

00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,000
for the workload or you're not able uh

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,880
to manage

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,680
family life or care for your relatives

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,839
or

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,360
you know what whatever that might be it

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,160
does not mean that at all

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,839
all it means is that you need to take

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,959
care of yourself you need to build in

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,880
those resources

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,160
mind yourself mind your health your

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,320
mental well-being

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,199
to allow you to be able then to take

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,040
care

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,560
and of of your work and what you're

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,760
doing your family

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,920
and so on so how do we recover

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,720
um or prevent ourselves from becoming

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:33,199
burnt out

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,320
you build on your resilience so you can

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:37,360
either decide

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,360
to go down the normal path of keeping

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,079
your head down the comfortable path

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,120
everyone feels comfortable on on the the

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,199
path that we take

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,959
every single day even though it might be

00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,920
hard even though we might be tired and

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,240
exhausted

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,120
it we default to that it's an easier

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,680
thing to do

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,199
instead of actually taking action uh to

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,680
try and resolve it

00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,320
or we can decide that no this is our

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,120
this is

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,199
our cutoff we need to improve on

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,800
ourselves to improve our lives and

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,880
people and other people's lives

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,800
so we might take a slightly different

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,440
route and take small actions

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,480
towards building um on our resilience to

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,360
allow us

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,199
to be more receptive to change and more

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,760
receptive to things that are outside of

00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,760
our control

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:27,839
so who are these resilient people and

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:30,240
what do they do

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,759
so first and foremost they acknowledge

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,800
change as a constant

00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,680
and seek to find the opportunity so they

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,040
no longer

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:42,079
um see change as an obstacle or

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,839
as um something that you know

00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,279
they have to kind of put up with and

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,600
they're not happy about

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,320
they see changes all right okay you know

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,160
this could be so

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,920
a new adventure that we we could go on

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,519
or a new solution to something

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:57,759
so it's to seek to find the opportunity

00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,040
they recognize that change takes time

00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,120
and effort

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,959
you could get up tomorrow morning and

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,040
decide to take a walk

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,639
and which is excellent and you think

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,279
right this is this is going to set me up

00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,120
for the day

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:11,040
and it will set you up for the day but

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,120
if you don't take a walk for the rest of

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,720
the week you will slowly go back to the

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,639
to the old patterns of

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,560
of kind of feeling a little bit low in

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,519
yourselves so definitely it takes

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,759
practice

00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,639
and time set goals with realistic

00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:27,920
expectations

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:30,079
so we are um within our our psyche we

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,040
like to achieve things we like to feel

00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,959
valued

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,880
and and that we we're offering something

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,720
of value or to our society and to our

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,720
community and our family and our

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,360
workplace

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,959
but sometimes our goals can be too large

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,720
and we feel like we're never going to

00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,680
reach them or we're kind of failing a

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,600
little bit

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,000
so i would ask that maybe you would sit

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,440
down and maybe draft up a few goals that

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,839
you would like to tackle

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,440
in a month then bring it down to a week

00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,440
and then bring it down to a day

00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,880
maybe it's two maybe it's two small

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,720
tasks each day

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,480
that you would like to achieve and when

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,880
you achieve them at the end of the day

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,839
you get a sense of accomplishment so you

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:10,000
can celebrate yourselves a little bit

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,600
value their contribution and those of

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,600
and those of others

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,439
so they feel they they believe in

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,439
themselves they value themselves and in

00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,000
what they're doing and they also ensure

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,400
that they

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,720
they support and value others contribute

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,559
contributions as well

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,959
they recognize they are accountable for

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,880
their behavior and happiness

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,000
so they recognize that for them to be

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,240
happy it's not

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,919
up to somebody else to make them happy

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,840
whether that's their partner

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,440
uh whether that's their children in in

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,799
the the goals that they have or the

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,840
aspirations for them

00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:43,919
whether it's work it's up to them to to

00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,000
make the changes to make them happy

00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,240
to change their behavior in whatever way

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,840
that might be

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,160
accepting of their own strengths and

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,080
weaknesses and ask for help

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,400
so they accept that they're not perfect

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,720
they don't know all the answers

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,880
and and they ask for help when when they

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,799
don't know those

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,039
they view a challenge or a disagreement

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:07,919
in a more positive light

00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,720
so if for example um i had a new

00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,520
solution

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,720
uh that was going out tomorrow and and

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,120
someone said

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,559
you know what sarah that's not actually

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,160
that's not actually as great as you you

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,679
think it is because we we have another

00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:23,039
solution here that just doesn't

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:25,679
that does that um activity just as well

00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,799
i might say when i'm in a bad place oh

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,720
you know like you're

00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,640
i might go negative about it and maybe

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,039
have a little rant and race

00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,200
but if i'm after really minding myself

00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:37,039
the the few weeks before

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,480
and and kind of building on that and

00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,400
believing in myself

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,919
my response to that might be okay what

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,679
are you thinking here do we need to

00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,520
tweak or change it or we do we need to

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,039
go back to the draw on board around it

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,720
so you're welcoming them into the

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,160
conversation you can see the value in

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,679
that and the opportunity

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,840
from another part another person's

00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,559
perspective you create a positive

00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,559
narrative

00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,840
narrative with optimistic thinking

00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,400
patterns

00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,600
so again you're you're defaulting to to

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,799
be positive

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,640
um and again it's it's it's it's yes

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,000
we're being realistic we need to be

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,160
realistic around things

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,320
but let's look at the opportunity that

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,480
kind of that can emerge from this

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,160
reflect and learn from their experiences

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,919
and action and change

00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,360
so yeah we're going to fail things

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,799
aren't going to go to plan

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,640
all the time a lot of the time they

00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,799
don't go to plan at all

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,400
um and that's good you know we learn

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,520
from that and we move forward but just

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,520
don't forget

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,720
to action them so to put things in place

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,520
and what you'd like to tweak

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,679
and going forward they have emotional

00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,679
intelligence and emotional agility

00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,360
so their emotions do not control them

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,160
they learn from their emotions

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,919
so if they're feeling overwhelmed they

00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,840
they kind of ask themselves why am i

00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,520
feeling overwhelmed today is there a lot

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,160
on my plate is there something i could

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,240
do

00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,360
to try and reduce this feeling do i need

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,280
to reach out to

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,799
my manager and my colleagues and see if

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,960
we can come together

00:19:54,799 --> 00:20:00,240
around maybe reducing or prioritizing

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,240
the workload that's there

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:06,720
so let's look at some actions we we can

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,640
take today for a better tomorrow

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,159
so like building a muscle increasing

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,039
your resilience as i've said

00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,799
takes time and effort to do it so you

00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,000
need to get up every day if if you

00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:19,120
decide that your

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,640
your um action is to get up every day

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,320
maybe put on some music while you're

00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,080
having a little bit of breakfast and you

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,000
do that one day a week

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,000
and yes as i said you'll have a good day

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,559
but try to do it you know for a full

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,960
week

00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,640
and or a month and see how things go so

00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,400
it takes a little bit of time and effort

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,039
and you will always default

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,880
to the normal route the the route that

00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:42,159
you've always traveled that path

00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,679
so you need to actively um engage with

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,840
doing positive actions

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:49,520
yourselves so focus on four core

00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,440
components build your connections

00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,600
so make sure that you have your support

00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,000
network try a little bit of face-to-face

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,919
time i know that's quite challenging now

00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,600
uh with the soap with social distance

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,960
distancing and some people are still in

00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,440
in lockdown as well

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,280
but try your best to to build those

00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:08,640
connections and always put

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,880
the relationship first foster wellness

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,960
so look after your body look after your

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,679
health and make sure what what you're

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,720
putting in

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,400
is good embrace healthy thoughts so put

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,159
things in perspective

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,400
and you know is the worst thing that

00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,720
could happen actually going to happen

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,120
um or what can we put in place to maybe

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,600
uh reduce the the impact of that

00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,280
and find a purpose we all need a purpose

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,080
in life and each day

00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,919
sometimes when we are you know in this

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,640
challenging environment now

00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:40,080
um we might struggle to possibly find

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,320
our purpose each day

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,360
but if we set a goal and possibly the

00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,000
night before for

00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:48,000
for the day um ahead we have that

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,799
purpose and we get up and we can we can

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,559
try and achieve that

00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:55,280
so there's just some practical tips and

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,400
techniques that i jotted down here on on

00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,400
two slides

00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,080
and i have been on a few resilience uh

00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,400
programs over the years

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,400
and found them really really valuable

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,960
and but one thing that i noted was there

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,919
are very

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,640
high level things that you might do and

00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,480
i just thought

00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,400
i jot down a few practical things that

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,520
you could actually take away today and

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,360
maybe try

00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:18,080
and i've um just highlighted three of

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,640
them uh in no way with no priority

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,880
but just things that that that popped up

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:26,400
so accept that you will have bad days

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:28,960
don't overthink it and take a break

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,799
give yourself a break uh rest and

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:34,720
reflect on it the next day

00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:36,640
so again stop striving for perfection

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,159
you will have bad days just keep

00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,960
thinking of the progress that's been

00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,200
made

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,960
take a break you know just think of

00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,080
talking to yourselves like a best friend

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,120
would talk to you

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:49,919
and go easy on yourself

00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,400
set a shut off time and stick to it and

00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,480
so

00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,559
from the the few sessions that have been

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,919
um been to on nest

00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,120
and you know i've got to know and i've

00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,760
got to know over the last couple of

00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,760
months

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,919
that um you know the fedora and the

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,840
centas community there's no sunset time

00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,760
but all the different time zones

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,679
that everybody's working in it's always

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,159
on there's always someone there

00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,960
which is amazing it's it's amazing and

00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,440
to see

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,720
but definitely it kind of pulls us in

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,120
then to possibly

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,039
you know working at long hours or our

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,720
hours that are eating into our sleep

00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:23,760
time and into our downtime

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:26,400
so try set a shut off time for yourself

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,159
and stick to it um you will you will

00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,280
find new found down time to do other

00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,440
things you enjoy

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,480
and you need this to be fresh and open

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,320
the next day

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,159
so if you're continuously on that

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,919
hamster wheel of work

00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,520
or for you know a hobby that you're

00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:42,640
really passionate about

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:44,000
and by contributing to the project this

00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,000
is absolutely brilliant

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,120
it's great but you if you don't get a

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,720
break from that

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,640
things become a lot bigger than they

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,279
actually are so you definitely need to

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:56,400
prioritize getting some time away

00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:59,760
from the computer uh to actually enjoy

00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:03,200
other things stop striving perfect

00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:05,440
perfection be human be real become

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,200
self-compassionate and believe what you

00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,440
and others can give each day

00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,760
is good enough we're all good enough

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,480
nobody expects any more so please stop

00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,480
putting

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,799
uh your you know yourself under that

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,799
pressure and trying to be that superstar

00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,240
you're good enough as you are anything

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:25,120
that you can contribute

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,120
and is is ideal and it adds value

00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:28,640
practice gratitude and so think of three

00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,720
things you're grateful for

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,480
before going asleep that's really helped

00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,880
me it could be small things like i had a

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,200
really good coffee today or a cup of tea

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,960
have fun have a laugh you need to have

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,120
that if you can't laugh

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,520
we're in a you know it's it's it's not

00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,600
good so watch a funny movie

00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,640
there's lots of funny shows on netflix

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,039
and things like that

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,720
and we had the cp cpe pub quiz and bingo

00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:53,039
which is great crack i share a

00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,480
silly joke of the day as well and put

00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,559
things in perspective

00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,400
is this thing i'm getting worked up over

00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:01,039
life or death

00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,679
very little i would hope is actually

00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,159
death

00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:07,200
so park it leave it to the following day

00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:10,080
see how you feel then

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,600
so how can we support each other we can

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,679
listen to each other

00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,720
protect your relationship first be

00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,640
respectful

00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,559
have a regular sync with your mates and

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,080
your teammates you know discuss how

00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,960
you'd like to work together and support

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,400
each other

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,000
give positive feedback we always default

00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,600
and to when we experience something

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,400
negative that we need to tell people

00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,480
about that

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,760
you know to ensure that maybe they don't

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,760
go through the same thing

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,200
or that that we need to to fix something

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,640
but let's try and default to giving a

00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,840
little bit of positive feedback so if

00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,760
you like something

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:42,640
tell somebody they'd be delighted to

00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:45,520
hear ask someone else for help

00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,159
encourage others to try new things offer

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,640
help

00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,000
and become open to each other's ideas so

00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,960
ask questions get a little bit

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,760
inquisitive

00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:57,120
around how people are doing and and get

00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:59,279
involved a little bit more

00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,120
so the question is to you now what

00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,840
positive steps will you take going

00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,960
forward

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:08,840
to support yourself and others and

00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:10,400
throughout the rest of 2020 and into

00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,400
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,840
so thanks for taking time out to attend

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,679
today and

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,520
for even just attending this session

00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,960
you're already on the path to positive

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,600
change

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:25,840
so i'll open the floor if there is any

00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,840
questions around that

00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:36,960
hi hi marie jumping on is

00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:38,720

00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,159
yes she wasn't meant to be there now

00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,840
maybe there was no question so if

00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,159
there's no questions that that's totally

00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,000

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:04,400
all the different ways that we unwind

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,080
uh some strategies on how different

00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:10,159
people disconnect from

00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:12,240
