all right i think we'll get started so

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,440
we are three minutes past the hour

00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,639
um for those of you joining the call and

00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,240
you're going to see six people on the

00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,360
screen but if you double click on the

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,040
slide deck

00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,400
if this happens to be your your first

00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,320
presentation at nest

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,840
you'll get a full screen view of it just

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,000
to tell people that

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,680
so thank you very much for taking the

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,599
time to join our little session

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,039
and have a good morning good afternoon

00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,760
good evening and good night wherever you

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,800
are

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,599
um and let's get started so this is the

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,920
cpe

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,280
year in review so we wanted to put a

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,000
session together

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,160
to one let you know what your cpe team

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,600
um has been doing for the last year

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,200
and we're pretty much going from flock

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,960
to nest to try and keep it

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,280
a continuous story and hopefully we get

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,160
to do this next year in person

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,079
um your presenters today are myself lee

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,280
griffin and i'm the engineering manager

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,760
for cpe

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,600
and pierre evan who's our technical lead

00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,160
and ether maloney our product owner and

00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,920
i leave

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,280
ethan pierre introduce themselves when

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,640
they get to their relevant sections

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,040
within us

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,240
and i want to kind of begin by talking

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,960
about the scope

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,320
of the team and but before we do it out

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,119
let's have a quick reminder of the

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,680
mission that we have so the cpe team

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,640
um services both the fedora and the

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,479
cento west

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,799
communities so we're actually split

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,479
between and two communities that have a

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,680
very close relationship and a lot of

00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:27,040
overlap

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,240
so our main goal is to provide systems

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,600
administration

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,360
in and around the infrastructure and

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,479
release engineering that helps go

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,920
towards

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:37,600
and producing these um outputs which end

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,880
up being operating systems as well as

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,799
the services that

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,240
run in that production line and a lot of

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,720
other services in between as we're going

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,920
to see going through the presentation

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:50,000
and we also deal with application uh

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,079
maintenance so there's a specific set of

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,040
apps that we have been designated as the

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,280
owner of

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,079
and we try to provide maintenance there

00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,960
including upgrades and bug fixes and so

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,960
on

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,880
and then the last part is we're a gun

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,479
for hire our team for hire if you want

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,479
to call it that where we actually build

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,319
out initiatives so this is where

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,000
um the fedora and the center west

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,039
communities can come to us with a

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,520
request

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,239
uh to utilize the fact that we have

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,800
full-time

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,480
and very talented software engineers and

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,000
infrastructure folks available

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,599
to try and produce something new and

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,520
cool that will ultimately help the

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,360
ecosystems that we work in

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,840
so that's pretty much the three kind of

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,360
pillars that the team is built upon

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,800
and you might have noticed on the first

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,640
slide and you'll certainly notice on the

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,440
the bottom right of every one of them

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,519
there's a logo so we have a logo since

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,440
we um turned up last year

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,440
and we were actually a little bit

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,360
surprised when the facebook

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,200
and client platform engineering team

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,360
turned up with their cte logo

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,599
so we were somewhat inspired by that and

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,440
we wanted to get a strong identity

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,959
and there's a lot of symbolism in this

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,480
and i won't spoil it too much and i'll

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,239
try and let people guess where some of

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,680
the symbolism is coming from and

00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,760
you can hit that up the chat and they'll

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,239
reply to it as the call goes on

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,000
um but i do want to take the time to to

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,680
call out mo duffy um and

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,680
her creative ability to pull this

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,760
together it's been a fantastic effort

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,120
the team absolutely love it and this is

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,319
really the first time we're getting to

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,000
unveil this

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,440
um more publicly so you're going to see

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,440
it on a lot of our

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,159
outputs in the coming months and years

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,319
so um in irish because i know mo has a

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,200
um i love the irish language uh gaurav

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,319
mila matagot

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,840
uh marine so the

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,519
scope of responsibility is just

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,640
something i want to touch on here

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,640
um as i said in the the earlier slide we

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,280
do look after services

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,280
and last flock and believe it or not for

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,280
the team of our size we maintained or

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,080
we're on the hook for

00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:46,159
130 plus services and that means we're

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,000
responsible for the life cycle of them

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,440
from bug fixes to upgrades team

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,760
enhancements

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,920
and we had to do a lot of soul searching

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,720
to go through those applications

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,319
and retire some apps that really should

00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,439
have been retired a long time ago these

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,000
are applications that were still on

00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,799
fedora

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,560
too and in some cases they'd fallen over

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,519
and not been restarted and nobody really

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,480
missed them

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,239
and in other cases we looked at unifying

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,360
the services that we have on both the

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,000
centre west side

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,320
and on the fedora side one example of

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,799
that was the the pace service which now

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,000
redirects to the centos paste

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,960
so in the last year um we've managed to

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,160
reduce

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:29,360
our focus shall we say our footprint

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,840
to look after 56 applications that we

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,520
have designated as run and maintain

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,199
by that we mean we look after the

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,800
service life cycle

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,320
as well as bulk fixes upgrades

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,840
enhancements and any kind of requests

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,320
that come in particularly community

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,639
contributions which we always love

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,800
um we have 35 other applications that

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,400
are within our infrastructure where we

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,840
provide power and ping

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,520
and that's a really cool way of saying

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,600
that we'll host them only for the the

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,080
community or for other teams

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,840
and potentially within red hat that work

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,479
within the community

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,840
and what does that mean it means we

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,360
don't understand the code base

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,440
uh we probably don't even have

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,720
permissions to go and make changes in

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,520
that code base

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,600
and if it falls over or hiccups somehow

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,039
we'll try and restart it and if we can't

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,560
we'll have to tap someone on the

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:18,639
shoulder and ask them to get involved

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,400
that is still a huge footprint and as

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,800
you can see and you'll see in a minute

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,960
the number of people we have in our team

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,280
and one thing we've really struggled

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,000
with

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,120
is how do we reduce that number because

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,520
invariably

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,560
an application in here is useful to some

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,919
people

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,840
and we're going to have to have some

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,280
difficult decisions with the community

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,000
over the coming year

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,280
because a big blocker is our friendly

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,240
data protection

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,840
and laws which is gdpr and it means we

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,919
can't gift an application to someone

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,759
because if we try and gift it to someone

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,680
we lose the data now all of these

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,520
applications are open source so anyone

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,919
in theory can take it and run it and so

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,840
on but the real value in a lot of these

00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,080
applications is the data that they hold

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,120
and we have no way of gifting an

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,520
application

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,800
without having to go in and surgically

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,400
attack the data

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,560
and which is is just so difficult

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,160
so we'll give a call to arms later on to

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,280
see how people can help with this and

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,440
and what that looks like from a

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,319
conversation and maybe in the q a people

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,080
might have questions around this for us

00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,600
so that's one half of the decline the

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,280
other half is infrastructure

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:27,680
um because we look after two sets of

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,199
infrastructures and we kind of broke it

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,680
out here so people can see it so in

00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:34,880
fedora we have 117 physical

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:37,360
and 250 virtual systems now since

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,440
our color mover data center move and we

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,600
have multiple xvms that are hopefully

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,039
getting migrated to openshift pods

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,280
and we haven't counted them in this

00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:48,240
number uh centos

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:51,280
is 147 physical servers and said to us

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,039
ci is 278 now the ci is a shared service

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,039
between center west and fedora

00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,400
which a lot of our community use day in

00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,960
day out

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,880
the obvious scope of responsibility here

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,160
is regular maintenance making sure up to

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,160
date with patches

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,840
and you've seen the the boot hole

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,599
vulnerability last week that had our

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,639
team working very busy behind the scenes

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,080
to make sure

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,720
all of our servers and all of our

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,039
infrastructure and was up to date

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,520
we also look after every single thing

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,720
from silk the nuts to borrow a well used

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,039
american phrase

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,479
and including the networking the layouts

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,280
of the data center

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:27,039
and cooling backups hardware upgrades

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,639
warranties you name it to deal with the

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,840
lifecycle of the server

00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,840
it falls under our team

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,680
and the last one before i'm going to

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,319
pass it over to maybe the more meaty

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,880
section

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,479
um is the team composition so the team

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,240
has actually grown over the last year

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,000
we've had several new hires

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,680
and we've expanded our infrastructure

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,520
team with two new hires

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,440
and we've replaced some team members in

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,879
our development side as well that kind

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,400
of stayed more or less levels so we're

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,039
really up maybe two

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,479
net new infrastructure folks uh we

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,919
created a product owner role

00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,240
and that's who you're going to hear from

00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,280
in a couple of minutes and we expanded

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,360
the management team

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,960
because people need people management

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,960
within red hat as a company and that's

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,879
allowed us to expand that out

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,800
and to give those folks good career

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,400
paths and good career opportunities

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,319
so the breakdown is on the slide i'm not

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,360
going to read it out and we'll share the

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,879
link in the chat

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,440
if pierre hasn't done it already to the

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,280
pdf if you want to refer back to this

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,120
but that's the rough breakdown of people

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,720
that we have within the team

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:29,520
so it's 27 to 28 people all in

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,960
and and it's not evenly divided so that

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,640
means if we have a software engineering

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,560
effort we can't throw 28 people at it

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,320
for example we only have 14

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,800
and as you'd see in a couple of minutes

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,320
um that effort is split across multiple

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,000
initiatives and multiple things that we

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,800
own

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,240
okay i want to pass it over to pierre

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,519
and pierre i'm happy to keep sharing

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,160
just give me a shout when we want to

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,279
change

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:54,000
slides sure uh

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,640
so i'm pierre schumacher as pingu and

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,360
probably

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,399
better known as pingu uh as we've seen

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,399
yesterday in the

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:04,640
pub quiz if you missed that um so i'm

00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,320
i've been in federer since 2007 i've

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,000
been in red hat for about seven years

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,360
and i'm now the team lead of the

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,080
cpa team uh which is basically the only

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,360
team i've been

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,959
at uh since i joined reddit so i'm going

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,720
to run you through a little bit of

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,000
what we've been working on over the last

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,120
year uh

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,680
we'll start with the first one uh right

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,839
getting

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,519
uh so if you remember last year we were

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:31,519
in the middle of implementing this

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:32,800
uh and it landed basically late 2019

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,440
uh we already gave a couple of

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,160
presentations at devconf as well as them

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,160
about

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,519
about it about how it works and the

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,279
process there

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,959
both videos are online if you want to

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,839
check them out

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,600
but basically it was it was an important

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,600
initiative for us because i think it was

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,240
one of the first initiative that we

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,440
approached

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,360
as team that ended up being multi-months

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,720
i could even say multi-years but uh

00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,240
because of the different

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,560
iterations that it went through but the

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,120
last iteration was the one that

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,240
finally succeeded which ended up being

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,440
approached as a team

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,320
multiple people in the team were

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,880
involved in that it's an episode being a

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,560
very much a multi-system uh initiative

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,399
because we had to implement things in

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,320
the package in koji and body

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,079
in federal ci and then coordinate with

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,480
you know green wave and weather db

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,920
what uh the core of the getting

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,720
mechanisms here

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,399
um so we involve people uh outside of

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,959
our team as well of multiple people

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,600
within our team to be able to reach that

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:33,440
and then the end result is that we have

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,480
we are able to gate right packages

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,959
before they land

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,320
in the right build route in a way that

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,880
is fully automatic

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,480
and transparent to packagers you know if

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,560
everything goes well

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,000
we've also added a couple of fixtures

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,839
which are nice outside

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,320
of rawhide such as the

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,360
the on-demand the on-demand side tags

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,680
which are

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,120
can be used on stable releases as well

00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,320
which also makes things like

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,640
a fit package chain build working nicely

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,720
instable releases

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,680
so that was the the first big one that

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,600
we started one

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,680
very focused on fedora very focused on

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,160
ride but it also gave us the

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,920
one of the first base to how do we want

00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,480
to work as a team or that we want to to

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,519
progress

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,760
things on that front and the next

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:23,040
initiative

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:25,440
at least that's your clue thank you

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,880
next we started basically in january

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,920
this year

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:33,120
is nogging so noggin replaces our

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,440
fast account system fast too uh as a

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,279
reminder first started in 2008

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,760
the first commit i went back to check it

00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:42,800
yesterday was from toshio

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:46,240
in 2008. it's python show only

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:49,440
it's runs turbo gear one uh for memory

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:52,480
i don't even think it runs 1.1 1.2

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:55,360
and it definitely doesn't run chocolate

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,200
2 who also exists there is no way to

00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,600
port this to python three

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,279
uh we used to run it on rail six and

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,040
then we tried to migrate it to rail

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:06,320
seven and we did not manage

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,720
uh so we are now running it in openshift

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,320
on a roll six container and the nice

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,079
thing is that royal six is uh well

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,680
python two is already out of fla

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:17,440
out of uh uh support

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,519
since the beginning of the year and real

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:23,600
six is getting out of support

00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:26,480
uh in fall uh 2020 so it's

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,519
nogging is uh was basically a very

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,200
important project

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,800
for us to to work on um so we are moving

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,160
to a more modern platform

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:39,600
it's basically a free ap on the back end

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,959
and noggin is the is built on the top of

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,279
it and it's basically a

00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,079
self-service or community portal to free

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,079
apa

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,120
uh adding a lot of the future that free

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,519
ipa

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,279
does not provide uh such as you know the

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,959
possibility of changing your password

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,880
yourself

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,399
but we also rely on a lot of the feature

00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,240
that free ipa provides such as

00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,440
two-factor authentication

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,600
we currently have two-factor

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,320
authentication but it's only ever used

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,320
or useful

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,680
for people who are in the sysadmins are

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,560
and actually have shared access to the

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,120
machines

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,800
uh if you you know want to login in any

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,320
of our web app you don't have to

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,560
we don't have two-factor authentication

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,079
support well that is something that's

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,519
going to change uh

00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,519
underneath in front at least noggin

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,279
itself will support 2fa and then we'll

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,760
need to see how we can explain this to

00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,760
our

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,839
different applications and then we know

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,800
we have things which are you know python

00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,399
3 of course

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,800
but we are seeing which are kind of nice

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,480
and they have become standard since uh

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,880
since first year was since flash was

00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:38,160
created things like unit test

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:40,240
flats did not have any it's

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,399
built from the start to be able to be

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,480
deployed and run in open shift

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,680
it uses flask as a framework as a side

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,600
effect

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,360
this has also been a multi-month and

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,880
multi-team effort

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,639
definitely multi-months it started in

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,279
january and we are looking to deploy

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,000
this in

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,680
in fall currently being working on

00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,800
deploying this in staging and projection

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,360
involved

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,279
multi-team because cp has been

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,199
collaborating a lot with the ipa folks

00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,639
and we are very uh

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:09,120
appreciative of everything they have

00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,800
been able to uplift

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,040
there are numerous things they have done

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,680
to to free ipads itself or to

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:18,000
an extension to it for for our needs so

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,920
that was a very nice of them to

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,600
to help us and basically to be able to

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,160
to work on that

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,000
um the nice thing about that project is

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,880
also multi-communities projects

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,079
because that it affects federal but it

00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,920
also affects centers

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,519
and then as a matter of fact santos is

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,800
going to be using the same nogging

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,480
instance as federer

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,560
which means you as federal community

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,199
member are going to have a centers

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,440
account

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,760
in the same way then santos community

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,519
member will be getting a

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,040
account so you know if you want to

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,639
contribute to anything on centers you'll

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,040
you'll be using the same uh

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,560
the semicond system if centos folks want

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,560
to contribute anything to federer

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,839
they'll be using that exact same icon

00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,199
system

00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,199
but it's not the only communities that

00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:01,440
are involved the open source community

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,279
is actually looking at deploying noggin

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,279
and by the look of it they may actually

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:08,079
be the first one deploying login

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,560
not us so that's very nice to see that

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,040
uh

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,000
something we're building is going to be

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,000
uh reused

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
uh you know outside of the family

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,920
although it remains the rpm family but

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,399
it is outside of the derrick family

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,279
uh many thanks to neil gompa and the

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,800
open sous

00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,320
heroes i think that's how they call the

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,519
stress uh

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,440
you know for everything that they are

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,800
doing and they are looking at they have

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,480
already done the packaging work so

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,880
that's also something which is nice

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,000
uh and they have been reporting bugs on

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,440
an issue so that's a

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,199
it's a nice collaborative they fought

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,279
there so you can say we've

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,639
we moved from from right getting which

00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,519
was very

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,320
very centric to nouging which is already

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,360
involving

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,880
a bit more communities uh but we also we

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,480
also

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,480
read that basically reddit still this is

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,639
our paycheck so one of the third project

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,600
that i'd like to put forward

00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,360
and leave that's your queue now oh it's

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,639
not following

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,120
you can hear the keyboard he's typing

00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:05,759
his email

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,320
ah there we go so one of the bigger one

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,759
is

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:11,360
a center stream uh so the way i would

00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,279
the phrase on the stream is basically

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,079
red hat's effort to open

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,120
its build pipeline uh to open up the way

00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,160
it builds

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,399
rail and uh so it's basically the public

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,920
v

00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:26,160
a public view to uh the the next role

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,079
dot y release so federer remains that

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,199
that x release the the mix the next

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,440
version of rail

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,320
is based on federer the next minor

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,639
version of file

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,079
will be based on center stream uh that

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,240
is definitely a military monster force

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:41,519
it's starting in fall 2019

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,759
uh it's going to end up uh probably

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,920
running into 2021 somewhere

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,600
uh differently multi teams because uh

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,440
well it's involved cp

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,199
for for a number of things since we also

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,360
look after centers but it

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,560
involves a large number of people also

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,880
internally there are no

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,680
you know i i can't comment on the number

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,360
of teams

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:03,120
involving there but i actually uh uh

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,720
you know the people involved in there

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,959
have a full agenda

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,559
and the ends are full with meetings and

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,160
trying to gather the inputs for everyone

00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,079
and moving that forward so it's a it's a

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,919
really big project that is

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:17,039
impacting communities as well as the

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,720
business side of our team

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,240
but that's not uh we haven't we haven't

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,160
worked on only these three projects we

00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:27,199
actually worked on some more

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:30,559
so we have worked on dnf counting which

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:32,880
uh much uh matthew miller uh

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,720
gave a you know spoke about in the in

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,799
the in the site of federer

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,039
uh better statistics based on the

00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,520
company value that dnf sends about once

00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,280
a week

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,360
uh when you retrieve the repository

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,880
metadata um

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,799
it's something you can configure you can

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,240
opt in opt-out it's you

00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,480
you can opt out basically you're

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,520
obtained by default uh you have no

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,919
personal information sent also any other

00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,280
than

00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,400
the edge of your system and that's

00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,480
basically said only about once a week

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,559
if you haven't touched the way your

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,600
default configuration or default dns

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,840
works

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,280
uh we've we're still working on the

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,919
fedora messaging so

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,120
we do have a message best called for the

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,280
message as was

00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,679
used on the xero mq technology we're

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,480
moving to a federal messaging one

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,400
that's based on rabbitmq mqp technology

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,840
with arabic ngo server

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,000
there is still some work to be done the

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,520
number of applications have been ported

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,520
so actually most of our applications

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,440
today are running federal messaging

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,880
but we did the minimum the minimal

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,320
amount of work to do that

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,240
which is uh porting directly now we need

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,679
to add message schemas and this is a

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,960
requirement to be able to replace

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,799
something like fmn

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,400
or to upgrade our data gripper

00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,080
applications both of them

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,760
are actually need to be able to

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,760
translate the json blob

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,600
that is being sent on the on the message

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,160
base to something which humans

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,559
can understand and that's where the

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:57,039
message game has come into play

00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,799
we've also introduced uh something

00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,320
called toddlers that you may have heard

00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,039
about yesterday if you were at the pub

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,720
quiz

00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,160
uh it's a bunch of small programs

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,679
running around so it's

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,480
basically it's meant to be a plug-in

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:11,440
based uh federal messaging consumer

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,480
uh where we we are able to consolidate

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,440
more of the code base

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,120
to to we've been able to retire so far

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,799
at least two projects

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,320
and there is a third one that will be

00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,160
retired just because of

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,360
we are leveraging the toddler framework

00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,840
and and uh

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,840
and running this easily uh something it

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,160
does currently basically if you're uh

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,520
in the federal bugs group in fast uh you

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,000
have certain privileges

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,600
in bagzilla uh that is toddler that

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,799
sinks everybody in the federal bucks

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,559
group in fast should have these

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:41,039
privileges in bagzilla

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,799
uh when you do a success successful

00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:45,039
build in koji we flag

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,880
the corresponding commit on this gate

00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:49,200
this is a toddler doing that

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,720
uh if you run if you open a pro request

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,440
on this gate ci runs

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,880
ci sends a message toddler gets this

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,160
message and flagged the proquest with

00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,520
the result of that

00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,520
ci run the next one that we are going to

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,039
be working on is going to be syncing the

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,880
assignee and cc lists

00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:06,559
from this git to boxilla it's sorry we

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,000
have already we we've written that piece

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,919
of software but it's uh

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,320
in a dedicated project you need to get

00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,159
code base with a dedicated open shift

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,000
we just want to move that into a toddler

00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,080
so that we have a one place where we can

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,760
scale uh all of these

00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,000
and that's that's basically a step

00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,080
toward retiring a fat message

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,840
the the so far the tube project that we

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,320
have retired with address were fed

00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,799
message based

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,240
and that's some of the projects we

00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,640
worked on then we also worked on

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,480
epl8 setting up the initial build

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,840
environment setting up the build root

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,280
and the initial work to get

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:43,760
module support we we worked

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,600
mb box which is module built in a box

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:49,919
that's a way of deploying

00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:52,480
koji mbs in an open shift environment

00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,559
uh easily and that was something that

00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,280
the centers folks are using for centers

00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,559
eight

00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,120
and that's something that they are

00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,960
interesting in to for center stream

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,400
uh but it needed to be updated it needed

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,280
to be

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,960
you know moved to a more easy to an

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,320
easier way to deploy as well as an

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,480
easier way to maintain it

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,600
a newer version of uh koji and mbs for

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,200
example

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,440
so that's also something that we worked

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,120
on um you may remember

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,720
we spoke about rpm autospec we're

00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,440
speaking about there is a talk about it

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,240
tomorrow

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,000
again um which the goal of there was to

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,159
get rid of changelog and release field

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,400
in spec files not in rpm only in specs

00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:31,039
files and auto generate them

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,240
in the koji uh when you build the the

00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:35,360
source rpm

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,799
um we're going back to we're going back

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,480
to discuss that tomorrow it's still a

00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,919
proof of concept it's still available

00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,360
well it should be available in staging

00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:44,480
once we're studying is

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,400
back uh but stuff but yeah we are

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,000
we're eager to your input on that and if

00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,159
we should continue

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,240
to work on this or not we worked on

00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,000
something called monitor getting

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,080
and what's basically uh it's an

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,520
end-to-end testing of the entire

00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,080
packager workflow

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,760
with the idea of being able to say how

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,640
well is the package or workflow working

00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,280
is it working at

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,919
one point and being able to to easily

00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,880
find out

00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,919
where it's broken you have to realize

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,000
that um

00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,080
well you have to the package of workflow

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,679
actually involves more than 10 systems

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,880
smaller than application from fat

00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,880
package to this git

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,480
koji body i have not list them all here

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,280
but they are we have counted them they

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,520
are more than 10

00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,360
which are involved uh we're only testing

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,039
the appy pass

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,039
we're not testing the you know every

00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,400
single combination but it does give us

00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,320
an idea on how well these 10

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,320
applications are working together

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,000
uh as well as the instead of having a

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,600
single point while nadjas can tell us an

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,799
application is running for

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,520
95 of the time uh well monitor getting

00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,679
is

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,039
giving us an idea of how is the entire

00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:48,400
workflow uh

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:50,159
behaving so on the top of that

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,840
we've also done something very very

00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:55,840
small and i'll let ifa go on this next

00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,840
slide

00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,520
yeah so as you can see we have gotten

00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,600
through

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,159
a bit in the last year i've only been

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:07,280
privy to the last nine months of it but

00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,000
even still there has been a lot probably

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,360
the biggest of

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,520
which is our data center move in case

00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,919
you didn't realize uh fedora

00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,039
moved data centers this year i know it

00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,880
was really

00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:21,360
like under the radar nobody really

00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,400
noticed but we have a couple of fun

00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,760
figures for you

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:28,159
on the small project and i'm using small

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:31,679
with a heavy dose of sarcasm

00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:34,320
the team were moved 107 servers

00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,840
76 servers were retired there was 31

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,039
affected services and i didn't include

00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,720
staging and that one because i just

00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,480
happened it in me to count how many

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,520
things are affected by that

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,120
23 weeks of overall moving 20 transit

00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,120
days between all of the hardware

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,799
12 months of planning and executing

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,440
eight immediate team members from red

00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,919
hat i t

00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,039
and cpe and i'd like to thank you you

00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,440
can sing this

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,480
um i would like to just pause on this

00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,799
part

00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,480
because we actually had a great help

00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,880
from red hat i t there was a number of

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,559
people

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,200
closely involved with us throughout the

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:06,880
whole process they gave us priority they

00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,159
were on hand we had several meetings

00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,159
several touch points

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,360
and they aren't going to get their names

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:16,159
all wrong but

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:19,760
tom wilson chris adair seth chevark

00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:22,159
a couple more um matthew gagochi

00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,400
and apologies anybody in this but thank

00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:27,279
you hugely for that

00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,640
we also had three data centers in the

00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:32,559
finish we moved from

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,919
phoenix and we put stuff in 2 and rdu so

00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,880
it wasn't enough to just move from one

00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,600
to the

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,799
doing an extra one we had three managers

00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,159
managing

00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,320
two assisted means holding down the

00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,120
entire operation one product owner

00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,640
praying and

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,240
all we were short was the partridge in a

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:50,799
pear tree

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,799
so that was um that was that

00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,960
thank you for everybody as well for your

00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:56,880
patience and your considerations and

00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,320
your understanding through that mammoth

00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,240
task

00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,600
and you know on the top of that with a

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,640
number of projects and on the top of

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,520
that there is you know

00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,240
business as usual you know requests from

00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,720
the community

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,600
hardware failures uh drive network

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,440
issues

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,520
uh so what you see on the slides here is

00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,840
the one year basically

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,440
the screenshot is from yesterday the

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,559
fedora issues

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,039
the ticket tracker on pacquiao and the

00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:24,720
graph

00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:26,240
at the top there as in blue bars the

00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,559
number of tickets that were opened that

00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,080
week and in pink the number of tickets

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,840
that were closed that week

00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,360
and you can see some weeks we had more

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,000
tickets closed and open and some weeks

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,720
we had

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,039
more tickets opened and closed uh but

00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,279
the

00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:40,880
the bottom graph is quite nice to see

00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:43,600
it's the number of tickets that are up

00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,320
that have been opened in that were open

00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,760
in the

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:49,679
issue tracker over the during that week

00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,679
so you can see we started the year with

00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,640
about 140 tickets opened

00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:56,720
in the backlog and about spring this

00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,360
year we actually managed to go down to

00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,799
knight t

00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,720
i think i've seen even lower than 90.

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:04,080
it climbed up a little bit more during

00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,960
the color move

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,679
go figure people are busy and things

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,360
break so

00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,760
we actually report them and we used to

00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,760
get to track if they are solved or not

00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,520
and since the current move we actually

00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,679
uh back on track to to

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,799
go under the android number of tickets

00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,600
and try to go to

00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,919
to go down from there so congratulations

00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,240
to

00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,840
smudge and uh and kevin fenzie there who

00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,520
are definitely the the two running

00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,240
points on the on running that side of

00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,320
the

00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,600
of the team uh they are doing a great

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,279
job at this and uh you know

00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,200
if you send them you know nirik plus

00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:37,279
plus and smooch plus plus they'll love

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,840
the cookies

00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:39,840
that's it for me

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,400
so i guess i'm up how to work with us so

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,720
lee had spoke

00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,159
uh in his slides about how we're

00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,400
changing the way we work how we're

00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:57,279
trying to be a bit more visible with

00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,640
a little bit more structure so i've put

00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,120
together a couple of slides not going to

00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,360
spend

00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,039
too long on them because i want to save

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,600
time for our question and answer session

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,400
but

00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,840
primarily the why who and how so why did

00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,840
we make these changes

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,279
and when i came into the team they had

00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,640
done some forerunning with

00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,720
the team previously with the other

00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,159
managers of that people were reaching a

00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,799
point where they just needed to have a

00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,120
very

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,000
a more structured day-to-day and that's

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,679
hard given that

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,039
you know everybody is in a community

00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,799
setting and you know

00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:26,559
other people have day jobs and this is

00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:29,279
our day job but you know it's

00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:30,960
it's not a 24-hour day job so it was

00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,799
important for the team to feel that we

00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,360
have structure and we can pre-plan the

00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:37,039
work so that they know what's coming

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,960
it was also important to set

00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,600
expectations for our team stakeholders

00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,679
so

00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,799
believe it or not we have people that we

00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,799
have to answer to and

00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:47,120
you good folk here are our one of our

00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:49,600
stakeholders so it's important for us to

00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:51,279
have your expectations so you know what

00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,200
what we're doing why we're doing it and

00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,880
what to expect from us

00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,120
and following on from that is to

00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,720
establish clear goals that our project

00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,120
teams can deliver on so the work that

00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,039
we're

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,159
giving ourselves to do in x amount of

00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,200
time the teams

00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,880
all feel comfortable that they can

00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,320
achieve and that they can do that and if

00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,200
they can't they

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,960
they're empowered and they have the

00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,640
confidence to say oh hang on a minute

00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,559
what do you do

00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,320
but thankfully they are seeing rock

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:17,440
stars and they are able to do

00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:21,279
anything that is thrown their way

00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:24,080
so the who that talk and discuss

00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:25,840
and scope and weigh up the options for

00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,000
the projects that we work on and i'm

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,240
just speaking on the projects

00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
the big scale projects not the not the

00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,360
bug fixes not anything the sustain

00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,919
teamwork do this is projects that

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,000
require

00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,440
multiple people a couple of couple of

00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,240
weeks maybe even months

00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,200
and they need to be pre-planned who

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,399
decides

00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:46,480
what happens when we've come up with

00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:49,120
a review team of sorts and they're

00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,559
broken into the cpe review team so that

00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,799
would be the management uh

00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:54,320
lee griffin and carl and stephanie 98

00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,440
and also paul friels is our senior

00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,600
manager

00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,520
our team leads uh so here she ran for

00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,000
the fedora side and brian stinson heads

00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,880
up the

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,760
center west side and then myself i get

00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,240
to say too

00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,840
but we form one voice then it's

00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,039
important that we understand that what

00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,679
the community needs are

00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,080
so we have a fedora rep matthew miller

00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:13,840
is

00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,320
primary on that one and marie norton and

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,159
ben cotton also have helped them too

00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,000
but i know that they also then speak for

00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:23,200
the wider council and

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,840
the community we also have two

00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,480
which is rich bone as their community

00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,600
architect

00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:32,880
and brian exobeard i believe is also

00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:35,679
going to be wearing that hat too

00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,240
we also do have to adhere to the

00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:38,320
business

00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,840
because we are then paid for this at the

00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,520
end of the day so it's important to know

00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,039
that we're on the right track there too

00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,840
and it's a balancing actually there's a

00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:46,960
fine line to be in and that business rep

00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,200
is brian exobeard

00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,960
so while we're walking a fine line i i

00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,279
do have to take my hat off to

00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,919
beck's wearing two hats sent to us on

00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:58,799
the business side too

00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,399
so they'd make up our decision makers

00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:02,720
seats at the table for our quarterly

00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:05,120
planning exercises

00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,399
the how you can submit your ideas and

00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,000
i'll speak a little bit more to that in

00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,480
the following slides but just so you

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,480
know

00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,840
how you can let me know that you would

00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,360
like something like

00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:16,559
the team to work on something is you can

00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,480
always email me in lonely redhat.com

00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:20,320
we do have a project template but it

00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,240
isn't a google doc so feel free to just

00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,600
write your ideas into a regular email

00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,919
send it off to me and

00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,039
we can discuss it a bit more you can

00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,039
open a ticket

00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:30,320
if you're not sure if what you want the

00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:33,679
team to work on is

00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:35,679
a bug fix or a small enhancement or

00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,799
could it be a little bigger just open a

00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,440
ticket as normal

00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:40,960
the sustaining team are getting very

00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,640
very good for

00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,960
uh triaging they're going to be looking

00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,480
out for

00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,399
running this enough that they know that

00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,440
if things are a little bit bigger could

00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:51,039
need a bit more attention they'll bring

00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,919
it onto me and triage it so

00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,960
if you don't know let us figure it out

00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:58,559
you can always message

00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:01,679
us on hashtag redhat cbe or you can

00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:03,279
dm me directly at amalone on freenode or

00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,840
you can always join my weekly office

00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:07,840
hours they are on a thursday at 1300 utc

00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,279
at fedora meeting one a couple of people

00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,960
have been joining which is great

00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:12,240
but i'm always hanging around there for

00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,240
an hour if there's anything you want to

00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:19,840
ask or talk about

00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:19,840
next slide please sharon

00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:25,679
i apologize i'm getting the surname

00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,440
wrong an intern that was working with

00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,840
marie in the fedora project

00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,880
has put together a fantastic um

00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:35,919
infographic for us on our processes

00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:38,159
thank you yeah massive karma to smear

00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,360
it's it's beautiful my next light is

00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,240
going to look like a bag of

00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:44,000
compared to it

00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:47,120
sorry i couldn't help it so

00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
this is our formal initiative process um

00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,240
it is going to be

00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,440
published published on uh docs that i

00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:56,080
feel for especially

00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:57,679
cpe you did but

00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,440
but i just wanted to highlight that we

00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:00,080
have been working with fedora we have

00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,120
had

00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,080
fantastic help and like look that's so

00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,840
cool

00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:08,000
but it does encompass the business side

00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:10,559
and the uh the community side and i'm

00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,960
aware this is a community

00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:14,880
stuff distracts me and where this is a

00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,399
community uh

00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,399
conference so i'm going to speak a bit

00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:21,279
more on the community side

00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:21,279
next slide john

00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,480
so community edit of that as you can see

00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:27,200
that's my bag of compared to the

00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,760
other one

00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,679
it is nowhere near as nice but i hope it

00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:34,320
kind of does it justice

00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:36,080
and i know marie and mo and snare are

00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:40,240
probably like this

00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:42,799
at home and i'm sorry but anyway

00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,000
so as i said in a previous slide if you

00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:45,919
are a

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,039
if you are a community member and you

00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:49,279
have an issue

00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:50,080
you'd like the cp team to work on to

00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:53,120
spoil it

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,000
in the normal channels so um yeah thank

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,080
you

00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,080
so find it normally it flows into our

00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,559
sustaining team they review it

00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,840
during their twice daily stand-ups if

00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:03,039
they think it's something that they can

00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,200
action they will

00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:06,720
just move it straight down into their

00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,240
their tracker or if they think it's

00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,679
something a little bit bigger

00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,360
they will triage it to me so i'll

00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,960
usually get tagged or i'll get an email

00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,679
or i'll get a google chat going

00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,399
hey maloney check this out and then i go

00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:18,350
holy

00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:20,320
lee what does this mean but no

00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:23,039
[Laughter]

00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:25,279
um i will review it and then it goes

00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:27,440
into the scoping phase so

00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:29,279
more than likely you will get an email

00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,960
or something from me if you're the

00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:32,720
requester just asking for some more

00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,640
information if we feel we need it

00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,720
we'll start walking through the process

00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,320
i will then move it into a google doc

00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,760
to capture it more formally and we will

00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,159
walk through the requirements through

00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,480
the

00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:44,159
the estimated timeline what kind of

00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,279
skill sets may be needed to complete

00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,919
this task

00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:49,360
and then we will move it to the review

00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:51,760
with

00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,840
review with the cp management team the

00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,919
cpa review team initially

00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,120
if the cpe management team feel that it

00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,559
is something that we should be

00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,880
considering if the

00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:03,120
wider review team are saying yes this is

00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,440
absolutely something that we should be

00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,799
addressing for communities we'll move it

00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,879
then on to

00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:11,280
a more formal project brief and we add

00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:13,040
it to our backlog for qp voting

00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,560
if when we're reviewing it by the review

00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,280
team and it's deemed as something that

00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,040
is either

00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,280
just not meeting our mission statement

00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:22,000
it's not

00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,879
really anything that we could complete

00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,119
or

00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:26,879
just not happen we'll let you know the

00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,440
ticket will be closed it'll be updated

00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:30,960
and

00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:33,280
the requester or the filer will know

00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,079
so that is it in a nutshell if you have

00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,599
something big

00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,760
file a ticket it'll flow through the

00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,919
rest of that

00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,839
back in jul the start of july you may

00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:45,520
remember that i had sent out an email

00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:47,040
to announce uh announced list

00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,639
and this is some of the feedback that i

00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,760
got so i had sent that gorgeous

00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,000
infographic that

00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,200
samir created for us along with a lot of

00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,960
text around

00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,879
why we're doing this what we consider

00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,119
big what we consider bug fixes and we

00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:02,320
wanted your feedback on it

00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:04,800
it is very important for me

00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:07,520
who is kind of the gatekeeper of

00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,280
projects for all the world to understand

00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,560
what the community wants what we're

00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,760
doing that could be better what we're

00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,280
doing that you like and what we're doing

00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,240
that you think is useless just leave it

00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,920
out all together

00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,359
so these were some of the points that i

00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,960
got uh can you

00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:20,800
continue to communicate clearly and

00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,720
regularly on project updates

00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,839
uh less acronyms and abbreviation and

00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,359
cons

00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:29,280
did you see what i did there uh publish

00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,160
the team member time zones on docs at

00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,200
fpo that's

00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,880
for cpe

00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,880
and help to help define our working

00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,400
errors and that was actually a really

00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,880
good point and it was quite an obvious

00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,400
one

00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:44,000
and i thank you i think martin was the

00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,920
one who had messaged me that

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,320
privately so that is something that we

00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,720
can absolutely action

00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,640
um also publish the workflow diagram to

00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:55,280
a docsis cp and then have

00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:56,000
something filtered that relates to who

00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,280
you're coming

00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,880
what area you're coming from if you're

00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,320
coming from a fedora community

00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,240
contributor space

00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,920
this is what really you need to look at

00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,440
if you're coming from a red hat business

00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,160
unit space this is this is where you

00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,119
should be kind of

00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:11,440
filtering your request to people seem to

00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:13,520
enjoy the office hours

00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,040
and also they're requesting a public

00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,680
tracker for bugs as well which

00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:20,000
i know bingo has been working on and may

00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:23,200
be speaking about already

00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,160
so it's good well no not too bad

00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,040
next slide this is my last slide you'll

00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,040
be pleased now

00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,359
um a couple of key dates for your diary

00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,079
so following on from my email about the

00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:34,720
engagement

00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:36,240
are some of the members from cpe team

00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,920
led by one of the managers and

00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,119
has put together and actually little has

00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,680
stitched the whole thing together thank

00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,320
you very

00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,280
has stitched together a survey so our

00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,200
survey says

00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,560
please complete it by august 30th it's

00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,960
been sent to the devil and

00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:50,079
in for lists if you haven't seen it

00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,079
please check there

00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:53,440
and filter it and complete it's closing

00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,920
by then

00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,079
september 9th is the new initiative

00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,359
submission deadline for cte so if you do

00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,640
have something that you'd like us to

00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:05,040
consider working on

00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:07,760
uh please email me file a ticket

00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,240
but do it before september 9th which is

00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,640
to

00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:13,760
uh no one's wednesday's tomorrow but i'm

00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:15,599
a month ahead of myself

00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,000
so you have a little over five weeks for

00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:20,240
that uh september 18th

00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
thanks luna and september 18th is when

00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,839
where the cpe team are going to host our

00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,320
quarterly planning sessions so

00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:28,160
by submitting ideas suggestions by

00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,760
september 9th it will allow our team to

00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,800
have two weeks to review them and see

00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,520
how much work

00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,440
is involved in them and we can then

00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,200
confidently add them to our backlog and

00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,359
put them for consideration to the wider

00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,200
review team then for voting

00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:43,760
september 30th is where quarter three

00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:46,079
ends so we have a number of

00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:48,160
starting from q2 and they are going to

00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:50,960
be running to completion or certainly

00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:53,680
what we want our goals to have been

00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,640
we want them to be hit by then and then

00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,480
october 4th

00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,760
is when cpu will recognize when our

00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,680
quarter four begins

00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,520
and the projects that we will have

00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,599
reviewed on september 18th

00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,560
and voted on as yes the most important

00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:08,000
we must do

00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,000
will start and kick off then

00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:13,760
and i think that is me finished

00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:15,520
yeah thanks fifa and thanks peter for

00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,359
the overview of the projects as well

00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,800
i think what's worth calling out just to

00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:19,599
briefly go back to the slide for a

00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,760
second

00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:23,839
is these are key dates that will help us

00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,359
line the teams up get the right level of

00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:27,119
analysis done

00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:28,400
so that we can actually ship something

00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,880
and deliver it so

00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,400
12 months ago at flock and i gave a

00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,880
presentation about

00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,720
the process we were trying to put in and

00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,079
open source agile i think was the

00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,400
official title of it

00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:41,760
and since then and and just to call here

00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,880
she's on there to call it on the screen

00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,880
we had sarah

00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,560
join the team so sarah finn is an agile

00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,560
practitioner within the team

00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,920
and it's helped the team just get into

00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,920
that mode of delivery

00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,000
because it was becoming frustrating for

00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:56,079
the team and i'm sure for the community

00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,839
to work on something and get it so far

00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,680
and then get your attention pulled to

00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:01,119
something else so we kind of set a

00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,119
mantra out

00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:04,320
and ripple probably has several memes

00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,160
about this now

00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,760
um about stop starting and start

00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,960
finishing so to try and get stuff

00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,200
shipped and over the line

00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,640
usable for our community and that's why

00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,800
we have dates like this this is where

00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:17,760
this kind of process came from

00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,200
and we are going into our third full

00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,200
quarter of it which you're in at the

00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,920
moment for q3 we're on a calendar year

00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,520
quarter

00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:27,680
and in q2 and we hit 100 delivery so 100

00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,920
of what we wanted to deliver in that

00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,839
three-month window was completed

00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,200
and that gives a lot of confidence and

00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:35,200
hopefully to the community

00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:37,119
and certainly to our team that if you

00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,560
ask for something and if we say we're

00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,320
going to work on it in

00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,760
quarter whatever that you're going to

00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,200
get it at the end of the quarter and i

00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,160
think that's a really important

00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:48,000
um note to call out now there are all

00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,480
the positives and i just want to kind of

00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,640
end

00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,000
um on just some of the future challenges

00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,200
and this is not meant to be negative for

00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,560
anything like this at all

00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,079
but this is where the team are

00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,960
constantly moving towards we're

00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:58,800
constantly

00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,640
resetting the horizon goal moving

00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,240
forward to try and tackle new challenges

00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,520
and add more value and to our

00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,040
communities

00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,880
and something that we want to start

00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,520
tackling and we've already begun this

00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,520
process

00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,720
and you've heard the word sustaining

00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,920
team mentioned by

00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:15,440
boat ethan pierre which probably should

00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,119
have given a couple more slides on that

00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,880
or maybe a dedicated talk

00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:20,960
but the sustaining team is really

00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,040
capturing the lights on or the business

00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,520
as usual work that we're actually doing

00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:27,520
in both fedora and center west

00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,800
it's actually heavily tilted towards

00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,480
fedora at the moment

00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,640
and because that was where a biggest

00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,240
scope of responsibility with 130 plus

00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,240
applications were

00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:38,079
and that was trying to get a handle on

00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:40,000
just what do we do every day

00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:42,000
um where is the source of our pain

00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,319
where's our contention coming from

00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,040
it's to avoid gut feelings to say that

00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,560
we're

00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,640
we're working in this area because we

00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,400
think there's problems and it's helping

00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,520
us gather stats and gather some

00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,720
information

00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:56,800
um about what's going on and to help

00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,960
inform where we need to put some effort

00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,319
so the packager workflow analysis that

00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,960
pierre mentioned

00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:04,640
and is something that has come from the

00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,480
the sustaining initiative from listening

00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,240
to the community from observing

00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,520
various bug reports and now we're

00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,680
investing time to see

00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,520
is this actually a problem and what is

00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,240
the actual output that has to come from

00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:17,359
us

00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:20,480
but right now um out of our 20s

00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:21,920
24 actual active developer assisted main

00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,520
documentation folks is really what's

00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,319
available to us

00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,680
um it's over 50 percent of that team is

00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:29,520
literally keeping the lights on

00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:32,880
primarily for fedora

00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:35,359
and that is a huge number and

00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,640
it's questionable what value that's

00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:38,480
actually bringing

00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,319
when you look at the rising number of

00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,079
tickets and it's great to see the trend

00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:44,160
going downwards and bugs

00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:46,400
but every 10 bugs we fix we're getting

00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:49,040
eight to ten bugs opening up again

00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,720
and that's pointing towards instability

00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,480
that's pointing towards technical debt

00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:54,720
that's pointing towards

00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,480
um just the age of a lot of our services

00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,359
that we inherited and not only the code

00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,839
base

00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:00,960
so by having greater than 50 of our team

00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:02,960
working on these things

00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,640
it's given us a little time to innovate

00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,920
and build new things which i know is

00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,440
what the community want

00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,040
and the software engineers that's

00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,560
exactly what we want to do as well we

00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,280
want to build stuff and ship it out as

00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,200
well

00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,200
so technical debt is going to become a

00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,599
focus for us in the coming year

00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:20,319
retiring fed message retiring older

00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:23,599
applications modernizing the stack

00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:25,280
and the recent colo move and for all the

00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:26,560
fun of the 12 days of christmas song

00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,560
that we had for it

00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,000
it nearly killed our ability to service

00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,240
the project um

00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,359
we hit so many problems going through it

00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,040
you would have seen

00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:36,400
the various mail shots the daily and

00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,520
weekly updates that were going out

00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,280
towards the end

00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:41,440
and that put incredible stress and

00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:43,520
strain uh on both smoog

00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,839
and kevin to try and get that over the

00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,280
line so we're trying to get more people

00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:49,280
skilled up to be able to service and

00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,280
work on these areas and obviously

00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:53,040
address some of the root causes that

00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,560
cause this instability when we try to

00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,680
bring all of our service stack back

00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,440
online

00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,960
and that means we're going to have to

00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,560
engage and have higher conversation

00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,920
higher conversations and make hard

00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,400
decisions to possibly retire

00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:07,200
applications amalgamate applications

00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:09,119
um or see can we bridge that gdpr gap

00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,240
somehow and get more community

00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:13,359
involvement

00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,640
and one goal and target that we've been

00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:15,440
saying for a long time but it's

00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,200
certainly

00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,280
on our agenda with this technical debt

00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:21,359
reduction is to make this more

00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,480
community available to service and to

00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:24,720
try and lessen

00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,480
the need for cpe to be a roadblock on

00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:29,599
some of these requests

00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:31,359
and so getting more help on the workload

00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:32,960
always appreciated you see the

00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:34,880
initiatives you see that we have them

00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,720
tracked or publicly available

00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,400
and it's been fantastic particularly on

00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,640
the noggin project where we had a couple

00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,560
of

00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,160
community contributions very early in

00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:44,400
the cycle and then

00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,760
as the work matured we got a hell of a

00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,760
lot more work which was called out

00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,839
already when open susie and neil and the

00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,599
guys working around that area

00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:53,520
that's fantastic and we love that and

00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:55,119
please keep staying involved but if we

00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,000
can get more help on the lights on

00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:57,920
workload

00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,920
that will give us more opportunities to

00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:03,119
work on fun stuff and really move those

00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:05,200
initiatives um to another level

00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:07,200
uh better communications i think that's

00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,000
something that we always strive towards

00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,480
and over the last

00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,760
year we've introduced um the weekly mail

00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,240
shot from ifa

00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:16,240
and we now participate on the fedora

00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:18,079
council i think he has presented twice

00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,119
at this stage and just about what cp

00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:21,680
you're doing

00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:23,119
um we tried to hold office hours we try

00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,520
to get as involved as we can on the

00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:26,880
mailing this we're always on irc

00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:29,359
and this is something we want to keep

00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,040
continuing and we did learn a lot of

00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:33,200
lessons from the git forge odf

00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,079
um we want to try and do these things in

00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,400
the right way

00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:37,200
there were mistakes made and we put our

00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,040
hands up

00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,400
and we're happy to say we made those

00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,040
mistakes and we want to try and address

00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,200
them

00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,960
and two points out of that from from my

00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:47,040
perspective is way more higher touch

00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,800
points on the comms are needed here

00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:50,720
and we did have a very tight

00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,400
communication cycle with some of the

00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,920
internal stakeholders particularly the

00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,440
appointed counsel reps

00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,119
but we definitely needed more direct

00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,640
feedback with the community fesco and

00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:59,760
others during that process

00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,440
and that's something we definitely

00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,319
address going forward when we run the

00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,440
next odf

00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:05,280
because i think it's a really good

00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,200
framework and it's something that brings

00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,560
a lot of benefits to communicating in

00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,640
that style

00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:12,720
and we just sent a mail to the devil

00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:14,400
tread uh in the last two or three days

00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,680
we've got a survey that we want people

00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,720
to take on

00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:20,640
and let me just paste the link in here

00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,839
i'll get it in a second if pierre or if

00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,160
you could maybe grab it

00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:25,920
and paste it in and we want you to

00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,800
complete the survey and there's 59

00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,400
people on the call

00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,920
if we even got half of those people

00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,440
responding and it'll only take you 30

00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,200
seconds to go through it

00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,880
and give us our feedback because that

00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,319
shapes our communication cycle and that

00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,400
gives us that um

00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:40,160
that ability to to evolve and become a

00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,599
better team

00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,720
and we do want to involve you more in

00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:44,480
our commons in our planning that is

00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,000
exactly the way we had if on the call

00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,000
otherwise it would be just pierre and

00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,560
myself talking about projects and

00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,560
challenges and so on and but you see how

00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:55,839
public we're making our workflow you see

00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:57,119
the opportunities for community members

00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:59,920
to effectively

00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:01,520
and put a proposal together that can get

00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:03,599
backed by the rest of the community

00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:05,520
and taken on by cp and deliver something

00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:06,560
of value that means something to you and

00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,240
the community

00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:10,319
so let us know what is working let us

00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:11,119
know what we can improve and let us know

00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:12,880
what you want

00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:14,480
our team to focus on in the coming

00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,920
quarters and we will do our level best

00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,920
to engage with you

00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,839
and give you the time that you deserve

00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:22,079
to have that opinion heard

00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:24,079
and if we can help we can help and if we

00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,520
can't we'll certainly help you evolve

00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:27,680
that conversation

00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:28,960
and and try to get that proposal into a

00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,880
better shape that we can bring it

00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:33,599
forward

00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,480
and that i think is it from our side so

00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:37,520
we're going to hit the

00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,000
open q a section and our email addresses

00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,599
are there

00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,359
absolutely reach out connect with us on

00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:42,880
social media we're around

00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:44,720
the virtual conference for the next two

00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:47,040
days as well

00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:48,800
and i do want to take the time again to

00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,480
thank everyone for turning up to this

00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,760
and for the support you've had for the

00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,599
cpe team

00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:55,280
and and working with us through some

00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:56,240
very challenging issues in the last

00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,480
couple of months

00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:00,240
and we're here doing our best and we

00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,599
hope we're being good servants to go to

00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,480
the fedora project and he and the

00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:04,240
community

00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,319
so on behalf of the team thank you very

00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:08,960
much and we'll start taking the

00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:11,599
questions momentarily from ben

00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,079
see you've uh very cleverly used up all

00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:14,480
of the

00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:15,839
the time slot with the presentation

00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,880
we'll throw a couple questions in here

00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:20,000
real quick

00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:22,160
um first was from nick is there still a

00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,640
gdpr concern if things are moved to

00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:25,680
communa shift or fedora's aws account

00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,760
and thus are still

00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:29,599
hosted by red hat but are primarily

00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:33,440
maintained by community members

00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:36,240
yes so gdpr um views a data controller

00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:38,000
as someone a data processor and a data

00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,480
controller i can't remember which one is

00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,319
which

00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,000
but effectively if we host it we fall

00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:43,760
into one of those categories

00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,160
and we are on the hook and we would have

00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:48,319
to work with the application maintainer

00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:50,079
to set up proposals and mechanisms but

00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:50,960
ultimately that application maintainer

00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:53,119
steps away

00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,079
that falls on us as a team and it's

00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:56,800
something that is

00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:59,520
rather complex and legal and and you

00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:02,079
would be frightened to know what gdpr

00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:03,920
um considers to be private information

00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:05,520
the badge that we're assumingly getting

00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,520
for turning up the nest

00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:09,119
it's classified as a gdpr footprint

00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:11,200
because it self identifies something

00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:13,680
about me at a specific period in time

00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:15,520
so things like that make this hugely

00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,559
complex just to lift and shift an

00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,640
application to

00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:21,680
commute shift and wash our hands of it

00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:24,720
from the cpe team

00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:26,079
all right uh so the next question um is

00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:29,599
there an update on

00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:32,880
git lab or the timeline or scope of that

00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:34,800
so the update is there is an open ticket

00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:36,720
with a number of technical challenges

00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,720
that are related to the fesco

00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:40,240
points that were well made and well

00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,680
received by the team

00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:44,000
and and we're working through it up with

00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:46,800
gitlab and there is an open

00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,160
and ama with the git lab team early

00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,760
september ifa will

00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:52,480
possibly drop the date into the chat

00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,839
here uh it's an open conversation an

00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,240
ongoing conversation

00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:58,079
and i'm hoping towards the autumn slash

00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:02,720
winter time that we start getting some

00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:05,680
timelines and clarity around that

00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:07,200
the um the session with git lab i can

00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,920
actually speak a little bit more to it

00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:11,200
now

00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:12,000
um so both myself uncle malverno have

00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,079
been speaking

00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,599
and liaising with naruti sanchez who's

00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:18,640
the senior community

00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:21,440
manager from gitlab

00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:23,440
an ask me anything panel session on

00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:25,760
thursday the 10th of september

00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:27,760
through my office hour slot we're going

00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:30,559
to change it to a half an hour

00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,960
difference so instead of when do i start

00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:34,319
and

00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:35,280
1300 utc it's going to be 13 30 utc for

00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:37,599
an hour

00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:39,040
uh about two weeks and ahead of the

00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:42,079
session we're going

00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:45,599
we're gonna have a document

00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:47,440
or a survey nurse is looking after that

00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:49,520
side of things that people can fill out

00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:52,079
i'll send out on behalf of our team

00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:53,359
and people can submit their um most

00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:54,800
asked questions

00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:56,640
they are hoping that it's going to be a

00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,480
very engaging hour

00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:00,400
but they are going to have some answers

00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:02,480
prepped based on what the community feel

00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,599
are most important to that too so

00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,520
that should have been a date for your

00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:07,839
diary too but mark it down now

00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:10,800
thursday 10th of september ask me

00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:10,800
anything with gitlab

00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,440
all right um so nick said i thought ospo

00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,000
was going to take over some of the apps

00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:21,359
that cpe is dropping

00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,760
question mark could you repeat that

00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:25,119
again

00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:26,880
ben sorry i got a glitch yep nick said i

00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:29,040
thought ospo was going to take over some

00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:31,280
of the apps that cpe is dropping

00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:32,079
correct so ospo is stepping in and

00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,520
taking over

00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:35,200
i think it's between eight and ten

00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:37,520
applications um

00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:39,599
and we're working in a transition period

00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:41,359
with them that obviously doesn't solve

00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:41,839
any gdpr problems because it's still

00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:44,160
part of

00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:46,240
the red hat ecosystem and but they're

00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:48,400
going to take on some of that ownership

00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:50,480
and i think the first couple of apps

00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:52,720
might have been transferred already

00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:54,400
and just a point on the gdpr and i know

00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:56,480
what type it in the chat and we are

00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,760
heavily engaged in legal honor and i

00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,920
know marie is involved in those

00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,520
conversations and rich bowen as well

00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,119
and for about the center western fedora

00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,880
site to see can we get a path forward

00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:07,440
from a community's perspective

00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:09,119
ospo is a great and bridge for this but

00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,800
i know we got some fantastically

00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:12,480
passionate people in the community

00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:15,200
that are well capable of minding these

00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:18,640
applications and once we can untangle

00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,640
the gdpr aspects

00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:23,520
so setting aside the data center move

00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,359
how has the change

00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:27,440
the team's scope and processes in the

00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:29,440
last year affected team morale and

00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,119
burnout and productivity

00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,960
so as the manager i don't think i can

00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:35,440
answer this because

00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,720
it's like blink if you're under grs guys

00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:38,319
i'll pass this to pierre

00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:41,839
as the kind of tech lead i think you're

00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:41,839
probably best placed to take that pier

00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:47,200
you're muted you're muted here

00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:53,359
we ought to have a t-shirt that says

00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:56,880
that um i think you made it

00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:58,160
the i think this is a journey i think

00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,760
this is a journey that we have not

00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:02,880
completed yet

00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:05,280
and as every journey and kind of changes

00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:06,240
it gets uh it gets worse uh before it

00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:09,520
gets better

00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:12,000
uh the end result is to have to give

00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:13,440
the possibility of to everyone in the

00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,880
team to step out

00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:19,520
you know on the weekend to take time off

00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,160
actual time off not you know i'm

00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,160
officially

00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,680
picking my pto because my manager told

00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:25,599
me that i have to spend my pto but i'm

00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,000
actually working just as a volunteer on

00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:28,400
you know

00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,680
as much time as i normally do on the

00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,440
being paid

00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:33,520
so we actually want to have the freedom

00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,839
and we want people in the team to not

00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,880
feel

00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:38,559
guilty or feel like they can't move away

00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:40,240
because they are needed

00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:41,599
so we want to increase the the

00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:44,000
collaboration we want to

00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,960
to spread the knowledge so that you know

00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,920
you

00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:49,119
you the expert do not become the the

00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,960
point of failure

00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:52,559
uh because you're the only expert so we

00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,280
want to be more experts in the team

00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:56,240
rather than

00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:57,839
having us people specialize there um so

00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:59,359
that is this is the end goal i think

00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:00,079
this is the past we want to go and i

00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:02,000
think everyone

00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:03,359
would like being able to you know step

00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,880
away from the keyboard lock the

00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:07,119
lock door screen you should always lock

00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:08,720
the screen um and just go

00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:10,480
go to a barbecue and you know if the

00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:11,760
phone rings because the server is done

00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,440
well you know it's going to be handled

00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:16,079
by someone else and you trust

00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:17,280
that they will have the knowledge that

00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:19,680
doesn't mean that we won't

00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:20,400
you know have to call people in when

00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:22,880
something

00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:24,480
dooms happens and uh and we actually

00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,920
need someone who is more expected to

00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:27,680
that but we don't want

00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:29,440
the expert to be called in at every

00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:31,839
single hours of the day and night for

00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:32,960
first level or second level uh issues

00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:34,880
basically

00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,640
yeah so that's that's the end goal but

00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:38,559
this is this is a chance it's a chance

00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,960
so now we've dancing it's a change to

00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:40,800
our

00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:42,000
people and especially the people who

00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,480
have been in the team for a long

00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,000
time have are used to work we used to

00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,760
have a lot of independence we used to

00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,319
have a lot of independence on how

00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,359
we organize our work on selecting what

00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:53,280
we work on

00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:55,200
and suddenly we need to take other into

00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,680
account we need to we work as a team

00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:58,240
which is

00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:59,920
great i mean loving to work as a team

00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:01,599
having people to bounce ideas

00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:03,040
being able to see work progress because

00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:04,720
you know that as soon as you have a

00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,559
progress open someone will go and

00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:08,960
review it and you know you will review

00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:10,960
someone else and work will flow

00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:13,200
so it's much smoother and it goes it

00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:16,160
does gives a good experience to work in

00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,720
in a team in the in this dynamic but it

00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,480
is

00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,920
it is a transformation it is a change it

00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,720
is something that we need to add

00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:24,240
to um accept it is also something that

00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:26,160
we need to adjust uh

00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:27,760
everything that lee wants to see is not

00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,119
necessarily something which would be

00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:31,599
applicable to the team

00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:32,960
uh so there it's going to be an ongoing

00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:36,079
communication between

00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:36,559
uh where are we we haven't we have an

00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:38,400
end goal

00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:39,760
uh the discussion is going to be how we

00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,599
get there and

00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:43,040
it won't be the direct pass that some

00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:43,680
people would like us to do it will be

00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:47,599
something

00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:48,960
that goes around and around and you know

00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:50,559
there is a pretty flowers over there

00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:52,720
that we want to go and check before we

00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:56,000
reach that end point there

00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:57,760
so yeah there is uh i think moral it's

00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,720
going to depend on a lot of things the

00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,880
color move has been

00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:02,000
a drain on the energy and on a lot of

00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,359
people

00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,440
some of this large project they

00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:07,119
basically rely on two people

00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:08,559
you can't have a project this i rely

00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:09,680
only two people without burning them

00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:12,079
down so

00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:13,760
yeah when i when i say send them cookies

00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:15,440
you know send them cookies

00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:17,839
kevin smooch definitely deserve all the

00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:19,440
cookies you can get them

00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:21,280
they have been leading that project so

00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,799
they are yeah they are

00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:25,200
there there is fatigue there is burned

00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:27,440
on there is uh there is a spec there

00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:29,359
uh but the hope is that you know with

00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:30,079
two more season wins in the team david

00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:32,400
and mark

00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:34,079
and they should be able to be there and

00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:36,960
end all the day-to-day work

00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:37,440
and then let kevin and smooch be able to

00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,839
do the

00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:41,599
the more in-depth work we needed and

00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:44,000
then mark and david will on board and

00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:46,559
learn on how to do the the more in-depth

00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,559
work as well

00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:50,480
i hope i didn't say anything too crazy

00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:53,760
there i'm looking at you friends and lee

00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:56,960
uh they seem to be smiling so i guess

00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:58,960
i didn't miss too much and

00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:01,599
i will add for people who are red hat

00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:03,680
employees you could also send smooge and

00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:06,079
kevin reward zone points

00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:06,880
i'm sure they would also appreciate that

00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:09,520
um so

00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:11,520
next question is is there a timeline for

00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:13,200
retiring fed message and will there be

00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:17,119
help for people who have fed message

00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:20,640
consumers to convert to fedora messaging

00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:22,799
i can take that one the timeline yes

00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:24,960
as soon as possible it's not going to

00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:27,599
happen tomorrow

00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:28,640
the tube the tube major roadblock which

00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:30,559
i see

00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,839
for returning fed message are going to

00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:33,920
be fmn

00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:35,599
and that are greater data number they

00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:37,440
both have the same requirements

00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:40,000
we need to have federal messaging

00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:41,520
schemas on every single application that

00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,480
published to the bus

00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:45,680
this is an ongoing effort data gripper

00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:47,280
needs

00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:49,119
there there is two approach we can take

00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:52,000
to the attack report is either we

00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:53,359
upgrade the current stack but that means

00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,920
that we are maintaining something that

00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:57,280
we have

00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:57,760
built for ourselves or we try to replace

00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,440
it by

00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:01,440
something of the shelf that can provide

00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:04,400
the same uh functionalities

00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:06,480
uh and potentially doesn't have doesn't

00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:09,839
put us on the hook to maintain it

00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:13,359
um so data gripper is as

00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:16,319
a pretty big pre requirements

00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:18,480
uh to film such schemas to be done

00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:20,319
before it can get moved on but that

00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:22,319
potentially is something which is uh

00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:26,000
which would be

00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:28,799
fine to to do and easy to easy

00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,319
to do the fmn on the other hand is going

00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:33,440
to be a fairly large project

00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:35,280
it's going it needs to have the ui

00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:37,040
resync it needs to be re-synced from a

00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:39,599
technology perspective from a ui

00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:42,799
perspective from a ux perspective

00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:45,680
it's pretty uh demanding

00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:47,920
from on technology side being able to do

00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:50,640
notification on erc being able to do

00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:52,000
email certifications at the level of the

00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:54,160
entire project

00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,720
as well as being able to let people

00:57:54,160 --> 00:58:00,319
manage which notification they want to

00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:02,240
to have so it's pretty complex tax uh

00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:04,559
so that one will will require some work

00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:06,640
and the bold estimate that we have for

00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:09,599
that is at least six to nine months

00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:11,359
for fmn so that gives us you know if we

00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:12,640
start working on this in next quarter

00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:15,119
that gives us a

00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:16,720
fed message retirement by potentially

00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:18,799
the end of 2021

00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:20,559
but uh i wouldn't put my hand on i

00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:22,319
wouldn't put my hand

00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:24,160
i wouldn't bet my hand on that basically

00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:26,960
but that's i think that's the timeline

00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:29,280
we can uh hope for

00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:30,319
as to whether there is whether there

00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:33,200
will be help to

00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:34,880
migrate feminists consumers uh it's

00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:38,079
pretty straightforward to do

00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:41,119
i'm happy to help anyone who was

00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:41,119
who is in that situation

00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:44,720
there is the deferred messaging

00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:47,040
documentation on read the docs is

00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:50,480
actually fairly complete

00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:52,799
so it's easy

00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:54,240
kevin fenji is just specifying uh just a

00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:56,160
small data point to give an idea about

00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:56,799
that a number data record the database

00:58:56,160 --> 00:59:00,640
behind

00:58:56,799 --> 00:59:03,760
has almost 600 gigabytes

00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:05,520
of uh in one table so you know just a

00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:09,359
little bit of data too

00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:10,720
to process uh so yeah federer messaging

00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:12,640
has a lot of documentation on our

00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:14,240
support including from fed message and

00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:15,680
i'm happy to help anyone who is in that

00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:17,040
situation

00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:19,839
the sooner you can get started you know

00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:19,839
the better it is for you

00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:23,119
and the last question on the list is

00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:24,640
from paul

00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:26,160
who wants to know if there's an irish

00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:30,880
equivalent for the phrase

00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:33,119
soup to nuts what does that mean

00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,799
so i think i said full whack and then

00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:38,359
paul outdid me with uh

00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:41,359
the whole kitten caboodle is definitely

00:59:38,359 --> 00:59:41,359
