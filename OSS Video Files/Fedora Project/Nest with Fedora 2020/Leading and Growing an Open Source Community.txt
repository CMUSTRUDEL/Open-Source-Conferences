	00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:07,040
okay

00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:09,760
so i think we can start now um so

00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,559
uh a quick introduction uh my name is

00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,759
sayak

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:17,039
i work as a senior software engineer at

00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,279
um and apart from my professional work i

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,560
am

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,279
also a community evangelist uh an open

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,840
source

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,640
enthusiast and i've been dabbling around

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,119
uh

00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,000
multiple open source communities for the

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,519
past decade

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,600
um that includes fedora as well as a few

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,000
other open source communities out there

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,120
and yeah this is a topic that is very

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,440
near and dear to me

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,440
and also one that i've been working with

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,719
a few other folks in redhat and

00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,440
in developing um so yeah i will be uh

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,600
talking about

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,960
uh leading and growing an open source

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,840
community

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,559
and uh probably uh by the end of the

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,680
session

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,360
i would be able to share like maybe this

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,719
will be really helpful for some

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:03,840
people out there watching this so

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:07,200
uh let's get on to it uh

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,600
so what is an open source uh project

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,040
and uh community leadership in general

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,000
right so this is a question that comes

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,600
up a lot uh

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,880
and surprising are not really

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,439
clear about this so as contributors

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,720
to a project become more familiar with

00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,360
how the project works

00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,840
they may uh at times wish to become more

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,759
active in helping the community grow

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,040
and ultimately uh this usually means

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,040
that they'll be taking on more

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,439
responsibilities in that project

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,720
uh today uh the idea is that we'll be

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:40,000
discussing

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:43,280
this in more details what it means

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,880
that is uh what does it mean to lead

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,759
an open source project and or community

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,360
the fact that contributing to an open

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,119
source project and

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,360
leading in that project are two

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,439
different modes of engaging with that

00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,119
project uh is something that we will be

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:02,640
exploring a bit more

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:05,680
and yeah let me let me uh explain

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,720
why uh

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:12,879
so as a contributor uh

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,480
when you inc when you want to assume

00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,160
increased responsibilities and as a

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,959
contributor to an open source software

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,959
project

00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,000
uh your duties to the project may be

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,599
more or less

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,879
straightforward uh things like fix bugs

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,640
answer questions in the projects

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,120
communication channels

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,720
and etc there can be a lot of things

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,800
that you can do

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,160
but when assuming a position of

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,200
leadership in the project

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,519
your role becomes more comprehensive

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,519
you may drive technical direction begin

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,720
speaking with authority for the project

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:48,080
in uh public venues such as conferences

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,360
like this one um initiate programs to

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,080
recruit or

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,560
more project members and even at times

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,560
like

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,680
change the projects processes and

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,800
policies

00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,360
uh so in short you you are now assuming

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,200
more uh responsibilities for a project's

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,560
success or failures

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,480
and that becomes a core part of your

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,200
role

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,560
so the question that comes up next is

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,200
why do it

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,280
why take on responsibility for a project

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,760
and community success

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,640
um and there are many answers to this

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,280
reason uh

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,480
there are many answers to this so the

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,599
reasons might

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:32,319
uh range from organizational needs

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:33,519
to your personal fulfillment uh so as

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,920
you consider taking

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,959
on a leadership position in the project

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,239
um

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:43,040
like maybe take some time to think about

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,519
uh your motivations for doing so uh

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,319
maybe

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,440
having a good understanding of why you

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,760
want to lead

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,840
will help you choose the best places for

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,799
your uh

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,040
for you to apply your skills and maybe

00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:00,000
also your interests within the project

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,439
uh it can be anything it can be like a

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,200
conflict resolution or

00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:07,760
better issues processes which can make

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,720
help you to make sure that uh users are

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,480
getting help

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,879
more quickly and frankly it's no secret

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,200
that

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,560
leading an open source project has many

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,799
tangible benefits

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,759
uh some of these are already listed here

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,880
but

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:26,400
when it comes to seeking employment

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:29,440
and also in your personal uh

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,960
careers you know it provides a sense of

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,360
personal fulfillment

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,040
um many individuals usually choose a

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,000
leadership position for the simple

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,240
reason that

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,320
they they appreciate their social

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,479
connections in the projects community

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,919
and want to be of greater service to

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,639
others in the community they want to

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,680
have a higher

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:50,720
impact within the community so

00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,639
this was kind of a round off of

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,000
what where we want to go with the

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,040
session today

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,840
um and uh

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,400
let's let's probably uh look at our

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,639
goals

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:06,960
for today's session um

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,120
so in this uh presentation we will

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,560
explore our leadership in open source

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,960
projects

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,320
the responsibilities leaders have the

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,199
transition pathways

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,039
from a contributor to a leader and some

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,039
ways in which excellent leaders can help

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,520
their projects avoid common social

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,199
challenges

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,280
broadly our goals for the day are to

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,240
understand uh coming common challenges

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,320
associated with

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,400
expanding maintaining uh and

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,199
popularizing an open source project

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,240
uh exploring new steps uh exploring

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,600
steps that uh

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,280
new community leaders can take to begin

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,360
addressing those challenges and

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:47,520
identifying steps leaders can

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,520
take to achieve project success

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,400
before we start one additional note here

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,280
i cannot uh guarantee that you will

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,759
probably leave

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,919
our time together today uh equipped with

00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,400
everything that you could possibly need

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,039
to know about uh be being a project

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,199
leader

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,479
or community leader because every

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,280
project is different

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,319
and i don't i i frankly don't know every

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,560
bit of advice

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,319
that can help you lead each of these

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,440
different individual projects

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:17,600
uh and then it's up to you like you will

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,639
need to translate this advice into your

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,000
own context

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:24,080
so what we are going to do today is uh

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,280
we will be examining the most common

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,759
avenues for

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,479
meeting the challenges uh new leaders

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,960
face

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,160
and uh general pathways uh for getting

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,520
started uh

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:39,280
that not just me but a lot of people uh

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:41,280
who have a lot of experience within uh

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,520
open source communities in general have

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:47,680
found to be the most fruitful for them

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:51,599
so in many cases we have uh

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:54,880
a lot of other components and uh

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:57,120
a lot of other uh let's say

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,800
topics that we can talk about but for

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,919
now for the purposes of this session

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,800
uh maybe let's stick to the overview

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:06,080
that

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:09,280
i just shared so

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,680
uh we will begin by stressing

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,800
that anyone interested in assuming a

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,440
leadership

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,000
role uh in a community a driven project

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,039
will need to

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,880
begin asking three fundamental questions

00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:25,440
about that project

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:27,840
uh this include like how will you

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,440
expand the project maintain the project

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,960
and popularize the project

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:36,000
so what do these questions mean

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:38,880
so how can uh we would be actually

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,240
uh exploring how can you expand the

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,919
project and that is

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,319
add contributors and increase

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,280
participation in the project maintain

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,879
the project

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,759
that is ensure that your growth is

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:52,479
sustainable and that the project stays

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,080
on course on the pursuit of its mission

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,479
and vision

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,199
and how can you popularize the project

00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,720
that is

00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,479
how can you increase the project's

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,800
visibility make it an

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,759
appealing destination for your users and

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,319
contributors

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,599
and keep it relevant in an ever-growing

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,759
ecosystem

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,759
so the remainder of our session today we

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:15,759
will focus on each of these

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:18,240
three questions so let's begin

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,960
with the the challenge of expanding the

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,960
community

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,080
that is uh increasing community

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,800
participation and

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:28,319
contribution so

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,400
i would be like throughout the session

00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,840
i'd be uh highlighting some of the

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,360
common challenges that we

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,919
face in uh with each of these aspects

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,519
and uh talking about these challenges

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,279
they can be social challenges or they

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,640
can be technical challenges

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,760
uh so coming back uh to this slide uh

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,399
we will be talking about the social

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,600
challenges so one of the biggest uh

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,519
factors the one of the biggest

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,040
challenges that a lot of people face in

00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,680
this aspect is

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,200
undocumented insider information or

00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,640
maybe folk wisdom

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:03,120
so excessive and undocumented insider

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,519
information or what we call folk wisdom

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,240
uh at times makes newcomers lacking

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,519
context

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,279
and feel excluded you know i think

00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,560
most of us have been in that situation

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,279
wherein we

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,399
try to contribute to a new project we go

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,200
in there and

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,480
we find ourselves confused by what a lot

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,399
of people over there are talking they

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,560
are probably using a lot of community

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,040
jargon that we don't understand

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,040
and the problem is because we don't have

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,080
that insider information

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:35,600
uh when we start it becomes difficult

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:37,680
uh to contribute to that

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,120
the next thing is unwelcome social

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,000
dynamics

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,839
so then this is a very important point

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,160
like how welcome do we feel

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,000
new contribute is like how welcome do we

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,519
make new contributors feel

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
uh perhaps uh like the project might not

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,240
be as

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,399
inclusive at it as it could be perhaps

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,440
there are a lot of places a lot of

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:03,760
uh points which we could focus on to

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:07,600
improve the project's social dynamics

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:09,839
uh then the there comes the

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,880
issue of undifferentiated contributor

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,839
base

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,920
right uh communities lacking a diverse

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:19,279
contributor base may not seem

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:22,560
welcoming to newcomers especially those

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:25,839
from underrepresented groups maybe uh

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,440
we mean diversity along all of these

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,760
accesses when we talk about

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,480
uh an under differentiated contributor

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,360
base

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,880
uh and we while we talk about diversity

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,800
it's not just about

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,079
uh diversity in any one particular

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,480
section but rather

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,399
diversity in the types of skill sets

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,160
maybe uh vendor diversity

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,680
number of industries uh that are

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,959
represented within this

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,079
contribu within this community uh gender

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,959
diversity

00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,440
racial diversity geographic diversity

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,760
like

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,040
you name it and there are a lot of

00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,240
places where

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,240
we can talk about diversity um and

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,160
when working to grow on your community

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:08,079
it if it appears that the community is

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:10,800
not only comprised of the it should not

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:12,320
look like that the community is

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,079
comprised of only one type of

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,040
contributor

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,399
people who are not like the existing

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,360
contributor base

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,560
might feel like they are not comfortable

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,480
so

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,200
that becomes a very uh big factor when

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,560
it comes to

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,240
newcomers to the project then

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,839
going along these lines the next big

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,480
challenge is uh

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,680
language barrier so communities that

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,680
communicate in only

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,839
one language can be really intimidating

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,640
for those who don't speak that language

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,880
and

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,000
a lot of this can be seen in a lot of

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,519
major uh

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,240
communities out there uh especially

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,959
regional communities uh there are there

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,240
might be

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:58,800
like your project might be based out of

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:03,360
a certain country or a certain region

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,360
wherein most of your contributors are

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,200
accustomed to talking in one particular

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,279
language but if you want to really

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,200
globalize your project or

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,120
expand the reach and if you want to have

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,880
as many contributors coming into that

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,279
project as possible

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,639
you need to make sure that your

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,200
potential

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,839
new contributors don't feel left out

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,000
because

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,160
they cannot cross that language barrier

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,360
and this becomes a very important social

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,880
challenge

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,360
um anyways uh let's move on uh to the

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,480
next

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:38,079
section of challenges and these are

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,680
technical challenges so

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,680
the there are a lot of technical

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,720
challenges that uh

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:48,000
community members uh feel uh like

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:51,120
come across when they want to start with

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,639
a new community uh and this these

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,959
include a lot of points let me

00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,240
take you through each of these points

00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,760
one by one

00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,920
so lack of clear onboarding and getting

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,800
started documentation

00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:07,040
uh surprisingly this is a very common

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,519
issue that a lot of newcomers face

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,440
a lot of communities don't have a proper

00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,560
clear documentation on ways to get

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,399
started

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,639
for newcomers and this can be a big

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:19,680
deterrent for newcomers

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:22,000
um next

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,040
like aligning contributors with project

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,279
needs

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,320
uh again a big problem that a newcomer

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,440
might face that

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,800
hey i have certain skills uh to which i

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,279
want to contribute

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,120
but i cannot understand what the

00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,839
appropriate domain would be

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,240
for me to contribute within the project

00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,519
and

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,920
that becomes a big challenge so how do

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,079
we

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,519
counteract this this is this is a very

00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:50,959
common uh

00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:54,240
issue and this is something that most uh

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:56,480
community leaders should be aware of and

00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,959
make a conscious diff uh effort to

00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,959
mitigate

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,920
next comes the issue of finding

00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,120
contributors with specific domain

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,360
knowledge

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,519
finding additional contributors with

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,240
specific domain knowledge of specialized

00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,680
use cases

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:16,880
at times can be really difficult

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:19,120
you might have people uh who have

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,720
domain knowledge of a certain technology

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,800
but how do you

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,360
how do you map those people to those

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:28,399
specific use cases

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,160
um that that at times again is a

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,440
very big technical challenge that a lot

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,440
of community

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:37,279
leaders face uh project code basement

00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,600
may be directed at a specialized use

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:42,320
case a project may be

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,440
relatively niche but locating additional

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,000
contributors

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,680
who share its typical use case might be

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,519
really difficult

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,279
and then there is the challenge of

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:54,000
unintended use cases

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,720
so your users might be applying a

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,480
project's

00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,880
software to situations that the

00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,920
project's founders had not initially

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,959
considered

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,800
so in that case the project's founders

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,600
might be limiting their outreach for the

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,160
project

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,120
how do you tackle that uh this is

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:13,440
another

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:17,760
very common technical challenge that

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:20,959
the community leaders need to be really

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,639
aware of and take concrete steps to

00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:26,079
mitigate

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,639
so anyways with that let's move on to

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,759
the next

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:32,639
uh section uh of the

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:34,800
presentation so let's talk about

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,360
contributor pathways

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,880
so every project and community will need

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,320
to address

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,320
these challenges that we are talking

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,279
about in ways that that are most

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,399
effective for them

00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:47,519
however uh in general we suggest uh

00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,920
beginning to address

00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,560
these challenges by examining your

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,160
project's

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:57,920
contributor pathways uh how

00:15:54,160 --> 00:16:01,440
we will go through them uh eventually

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:04,720
so opportunities for uh volunteers

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,560
begin lending their talent uh

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,480
so of the opportunities for volunteers

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,240
to be lending their talent

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,720
to an open source project are called

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,759
that project's contributor pathways

00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,360
so the greater the number of project the

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,000
contributor pathways your project

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,600
features

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,680
the more likely it is to recruit

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,040
participants with various skills

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,959
required for

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,440
that project success so when you are

00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:30,160
talking of ways to expand your project

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:33,440
focusing on contributor pathways is a

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,440
great place to begin with

00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,440
so let's let's take a look at some of

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,320
the

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,320
uh contributor some of the most common

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:46,320
contributor pathways

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:48,000
um so before we continue just uh

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,519
list pause for a second and i just

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,880
wanted to like

00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,279
like am i going too fast uh i i'm trying

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,399
to

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:57,360
cover a lot of content over here so i'm

00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,079
trying to

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,680
i might be going really fast through

00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,839
most of the content of the slides

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,520
so if anyone feels that i'm going too

00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,160
fast just let me know on the chats i

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,280
have

00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:11,280
it open over here oh thank you

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,120
so okay uh coming back to the slides

00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,679
again uh

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,439
first here are some pathways with a

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,120
social focus

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,439
things like documenting software and

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,400
processes onboarding and mentoring new

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,079
members

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,839
localizing content into various

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,160
languages copywriting

00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,760
managing social media and organizing

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,600
events

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,160
does your project offer new and existing

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,640
contributors opportunities to contribute

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,360
rewardingly to or maybe even take

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,440
ownership

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:44,480
of work in each of these pathways

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,039
these are things that you should be

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,559
probably

00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:50,799
taking a look at next

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,480
let's examine some pathways with a

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,720
technical focus

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,080
these include like adding new features

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,840
and documentation

00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:01,840
fixing existing bugs and driving issues

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:05,360
refactoring existing work to improve it

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,080
performing currents improving user

00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,440
interface

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:11,919
and user experience release engineering

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:15,039
creating and maintaining project roadmap

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:17,600
code and user interface

00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,400
so again ask yourself does your project

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,520
currently offer

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:24,080
new as well as existing contributors

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:26,320
opportunities to contribute rewardingly

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,960
to or maybe even take ownership of

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,760
the work in each of these pathways if

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,760
not

00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,440
the one general way to begin expanding

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,799
your project is by making

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:39,440
a concerted effort to formalize refine

00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:41,600
document and advertise this contributor

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:45,039
pathways

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,960
uh so yeah next

00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:49,360
let's uh come to the challenges

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:52,480
associated with maintaining a project

00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,320
so you have a great open source project

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,320
how do you make sure that you can

00:18:54,320 --> 00:19:00,880
sustain its growth

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,880
as our expansion efforts exceed

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,919
so again what are the common challenges

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,679
that you face

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,120
um additional infrastructure and

00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,880
overhead may be

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,880
adding additional tooling and

00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,600
infrastructure

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:18,160
to your project can create additional

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:21,280
work of coordinating participants

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,160
uh that is basically the time you spend

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,679
enhancing your

00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:27,200
project's code this might be for smaller

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,120
leaders

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,120
who may have to take a lot of work

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,919
responsibilities for deploying and

00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:37,520
maintaining these systems in addition to

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:39,919
also coordinating the volunteer work

00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,280
the next thing comes to preserving

00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,600
community intimacy

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,120
uh preserving the intimacy that makes a

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,080
community so appealing

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,120
uh requires more care as the community

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,320
expands

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,200
so fewer people may really know one

00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,600
another

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,360
and when this happens the community

00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,480
social bonds weaken

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,480
how do you take care of that

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,640
then the next big challenge comes to

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,159
keeping

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,240
a growing number of participants

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:11,039
informed so

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,720
as your community grows keeping all

00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,159
participants informed about the

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,240
project's developments

00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,159
it takes up a lot of more time and

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,440
effort if the community is

00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:24,720
really large and that

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:27,679
can take up a lot of uh efforts on

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,640
the community lead leaders part as well

00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,960
um

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,159
managing competing visions for the

00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,880
project

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,720
again like as the community grows

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,600
competing visions for the project

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,200
make create a contributed tension so you

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,480
need to make sure that

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:47,360
the vision for the project is always

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,120
clear and there are no competing uh

00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,200
visions

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,240
because that can be a big challenge

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,720
especially to new

00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,760
new contributors it becomes really

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,640
difficult to understand

00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:02,240
okay how do i go about this as a new

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:04,640
contributor if the visions are not clear

00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,440
architecting and scaling a vision and

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,520
mission

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:12,640
for the project so a lot of projects

00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:14,080
begin as personal hobbies and a lot of

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,600
times they don't have

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:19,600
explicitly clear uh defined community

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,799
mission and vision statements

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:25,600
without this the project just

00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:27,520
isn't ready to scale well so it's very

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,960
important that you have

00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,640
a very clear

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,799
mission and mission statement for your

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,080
project

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:41,120
so let's talk about governance models

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:43,360
uh every project and community will need

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,000
to have these to address challenges in

00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,320
ways

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,440
that are the most effective for them

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,320
however

00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,679
in general we suggest uh beginning to

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,080
address these challenges

00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,600
by examining your project's governance

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,679
models

00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:00,720
what are these governance models again

00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:04,240
we'll come to them in a little while

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:06,960
so the specific combination of rules

00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,760
and customs that define who gets to do

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,400
what

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,799
and also how they're supposed to do it

00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,240
is called a project's governance model

00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,080
uh the better you understand the

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,760
project's governance model the greater

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,559
your chances of successfully

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,200
helping your project evolve so as you're

00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,280
looking for

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,799
ways to help sustain your project's

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,640
growth and success

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,400
it's highly recommended uh that you

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,280
begin by examining your project's

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,280
governance models

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,159
so every uh project has a governance

00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,720
model even the ones that

00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,159
say that they don't actually do have a

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,559
governance model

00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,720
so uh let's begin by pinning uh down

00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:46,880
some specific details of the way the

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,760
project is running today

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,240
uh so as you can see in the slide like

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,240
there's a

00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,080
here's a list of six types of open

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,840
source governance models

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,720
we don't really have the time now to

00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:02,320
explore the individual models however

00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:04,480
it's suffice to say that

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,360
to say here that you know knowing your

00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,679
project is

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,039
running and who is making the decisions

00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,960
is a perfect way to begin

00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,320
uh thinking about making the project

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,640
more sustainable

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,640
if the project relies on too few people

00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,280
and if these decisions aren't being made

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,039
in the most

00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:24,240
effective way then uh begin by

00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:27,679
addressing these issues uh

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,760
so the this

00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,880
i just want to clear this on the very

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,000
onset that uh

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,679
the goal of this slide is not to offer a

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,360
thorough description on the models

00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,480
themselves but the point

00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:43,200
is kind of to you know set the table for

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,240
uh would be community leaders uh by

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,000
explaining that

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,159
a project's government's model should be

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,720
the first step of the ladder that

00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,480
uh you need to focus on when playing

00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,880
that plays a very large role in that

00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,880
project

00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,120
so dimensions of governance uh

00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,880
fundamentally

00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,720
you will need to begin thinking about

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,679
the various rules that people play in

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,919
the community

00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,840
and the various policies and procedures

00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:10,720
that govern and direct

00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:12,320
people in these roles so roles are

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,520
specific to functions

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:17,039
uh that contributors perform in and for

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,520
the project

00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:22,640
rules have rights responsibilities and

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:24,960
expectations associated with them

00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,080
make sure that these are explicitly

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,840
documented

00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,440
uh the next thing is policies and

00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,960
procedures these are

00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:35,760
specific rules and processes that

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:38,000
direct people in particular roles and

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,400
define the limits of

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,320
acceptable behavior for the project its

00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:45,279
best practices

00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:47,200
and other things so make sure that these

00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:50,000
are also explicitly documented

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,760
uh like simply documenting rules

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,720
policies and procedures will

00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:58,000
uh go a long way in helping your project

00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,000
become more sustainable

00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,799
um finally uh let's explore the work of

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,960
popularizing a project

00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,640
uh how do you increase the project's

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,960
visibility making it an

00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,080
appealing destination for your users and

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,919
contributors

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,279
and keeping it relevant in an

00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:16,559
ever-growing ecosystem

00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:18,080
right so again as before

00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:20,480
uh let's go through the common

00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,799
challenges that people face

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,600
so increased competition for

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:27,440
contributors

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:30,080
time attention and energy uh

00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,720
competing uh contributors time attention

00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:35,200
and energy is more difficult than

00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,840
ever as uh the number of open source

00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,279
projects

00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:41,679
increases globally uh and

00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,720
this is a trend that has been growing

00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,480
over the years

00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,400
uh ten years back there were probably

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,279
not as many open source projects as we

00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,440
have now

00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,559
so the projects nowadays are actually

00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,840
competing

00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:55,919
with each other for the the time and uh

00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,159
efforts of those potent of that

00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:00,480
potential

00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:02,400
group of people who actually contribute

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,320
uh who have a meaningful contribution to

00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,400
that project

00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,840
at times community materials are

00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,559
available in a limited number of

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:12,640
languages

00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:14,400
so as projects become popular when

00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,720
when these projects are they connect

00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,279
with uh diverse groups of

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,080
contributors but often project materials

00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,440
are only

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,919
available in a limited number of

00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,840
languages and if your community is

00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:28,880
probably not communicating

00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:31,520
communicating in say english many people

00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:34,240
may not even be aware that it exists

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,440
uh and this is something that i was also

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,360
talking about a bit

00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:41,520
earlier so yeah

00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,559
the number of languages that your

00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,919
communities

00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:49,360
uh materials are available has a direct

00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:53,200
impact on your community's

00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:55,440
number of active contributors uh

00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,200
growing threat of maintainer burnout as

00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,279
a project becomes more popular

00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,720
maintainers might experience burnout

00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,039
when you're trying when they're trying

00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,880
to

00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:09,279
like keep pace with it um

00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:12,080
and again this is also a very real uh

00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,799
major factor that we see in play uh with

00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,320
a lot of

00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:18,799
communities nowadays uh next we come to

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,440
uh the point of mismatched expectations

00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,399
between

00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,919
enterprise users and hobbyists so you

00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:26,159
know

00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:27,279
many uh popular open source projects are

00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,279
relied upon by

00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:31,039
really large enterprises but they are

00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:34,080
actually maintained by volunteers

00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:35,120
uh who are leading to a mismatch of

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,159
expectations

00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,039
between users and the developer

00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,279
hobbyists

00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:42,799
uh what happens is uh users who may

00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:48,320
expect enterprise

00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:50,880
a great support for this project uh

00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,080
might not always get the same uh and

00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,720
this is because

00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,520
these projects are at the end are being

00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,440
maintained by

00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,120
developer hobbyists who are working in

00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,760
their spare time it's not their

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,159
full-time

00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,200
job now to take care of these projects

00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,200
but still

00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,279
they are spending a considerable amount

00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,480
of their time and efforts in maintaining

00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:10,720
these projects

00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,679
um when people are using the projects

00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,520
for enterprise

00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:16,159
work but the software is maintained by

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:18,080
hobbyists there can be an expectations

00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,960
mismatch and that leads to a friction

00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:23,360
within the community

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,039
proliferation of platforms for user

00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:28,000
engagement

00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:28,720
finding the best ways to reach your

00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,960
potential

00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,240
users and contributors can be time

00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,720
consuming

00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,679
given that many people choose to consume

00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,919
information

00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:39,279
and the users now expect to hear about

00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:42,320
things on

00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:44,159
social media and maybe reddit facebook

00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,880
and twitter instagram whatever

00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:49,279
and maybe the tech crunches and so on so

00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:53,679
figuring out where to meet people

00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:56,480
where they are and when you are but

00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,960
uh for a small number of people probably

00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,399
uh

00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:03,279
it's it's difficult so how do you

00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:03,679
feel like how do you manage these how do

00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:06,480
you

00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:08,240
manage how much proliferation of

00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,360
platforms do you have for user

00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,480
engagement how do you

00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:14,159
engage these people on so many different

00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,919
platforms

00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:21,279
right so um

00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:24,320
yeah moving on uh to

00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:26,480
reward models so

00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,399
as uh with the other challenges that we

00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,120
uh talked about so far

00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:33,440
uh we could discuss many ways to begin

00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:35,760
addressing popularization challenges

00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,679
but in general uh you know we have found

00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:40,559
that focusing on a project's reward

00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,720
models uh is a great place to begin

00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,960
so let's talk about reward models for a

00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,960
bit

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,200
so uh strategies for acknowledging and

00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,360
honoring

00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,520
various contributions to an open source

00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,320
project are called the project's reward

00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,559
models

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,399
uh the more uh models your project

00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:00,240
constructs the better it can engage

00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:02,640
participants with different motivations

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:05,760
for contributing to your project

00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:08,080
so for example here uh four uh

00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,360
common reward models spotlighting

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,399
community contributors

00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:15,200
swag meet the community features

00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:16,000
community awards so each of these models

00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,440
aims to

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,919
connect with a certain set of

00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,559
motivations uh that the participants may

00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:24,000
have for

00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:26,880
contributing to a project everyone

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,640
contributes to a project for a reason

00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,200
and the most popular projects are those

00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:33,039
that make contributors feel rewarded

00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,320
valued and respected for their

00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,679
contributions

00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,520
generating those feelings and

00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:40,320
contributors is a great way

00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,679
to build your project's reputation and

00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,880
as a rewarding and

00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:48,080
welcoming place for contributors to uh

00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:51,039
put their time and effort in so

00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,840
let's let's unpack this a bit more right

00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,399
uh

00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,960
spotlighting community contributions so

00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:58,240
using

00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:00,159
points badges uh we i think

00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,159
yesterday only we had a lot of sessions

00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,559
on federal badges right

00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,240
leaderboards uh charts and publicly

00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:09,039
identifying uh contribution

00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,840
reward party uh contributions uh they

00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,679
actually

00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,200
uh reward your participants by

00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,320
visualizing the magnitude of their

00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,720
contributions it's

00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,000
it's always a great feeling for uh a

00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,440
contributor to an open source

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,360
project to know to be able to see uh

00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,480
their work being highlighted somewhere

00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,399
in a certain

00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,600
way and this is a great option for

00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:30,399
connecting with people who

00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:32,240
tend to value opportunities to show off

00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:35,600
their technical prowess a bit

00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:38,559
it always feels nice right for the

00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:40,080
the contributors uh next meet the

00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:43,279
contributor features

00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:46,159
so running blog posts or video series uh

00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:47,039
to spotlight contributors reward

00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,039
participants

00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:51,919
by helping them grow their personal

00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:53,679
brand and their professional network

00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,960
this is a great option for you know

00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:58,159
connecting with

00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:02,159
people who see community participation

00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:04,880
as an opportunity to uh gain visibility

00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:07,279
uh and at times even find uh work or

00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:10,720
employment opportunities for themselves

00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:12,720
so it's it's it's a great platform and

00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,360
it's also a very encouraging platform

00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,320
for

00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,799
newcomers to come and contribute in

00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,039
because

00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:20,640
they know that at the end of the day if

00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,799
they do some meaningful work

00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,720
their their work gets highlighted and

00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:28,000
that's a very big

00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:30,000
motivator for new contributors

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,240
then uh there comes the the point of

00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,640
swag who does not like them right

00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,240
like giving contributors various items

00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,399
that uh signify

00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,080
uh their affiliation with the community

00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:43,120
things like shirts hats

00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:46,480
keychains like you know things like

00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:49,840
uh small tokens like even a mug

00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,679
or something like this they they allow

00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,120
the participants to feel a sense of

00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:55,200
connection with the project

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,880
and this is a great option for

00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,799
connecting with people who see

00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,320
community participation as central to

00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:02,320
their identities

00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,000
as a fundamental part of their identity

00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,159
building work right

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,159
and also it allows them to show off

00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:10,640
their connection with the community

00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,679
when interacting with other people uh

00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,399
and

00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:17,519
that makes that membership uh in the

00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:20,640
community a part of their own identity

00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:23,200
so yeah um

00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,159
then uh comes the point about uh

00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,360
community awards

00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:30,320
like allowing community members to

00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,360
like recognize and award others among

00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,519
themselves

00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,559
helps communities to develop shared

00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:37,200
identities

00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:38,000
and social bonds and these bonds are

00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,519
really important

00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,240
for any open source or any community in

00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,159
general

00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,600
so this is a great option for connecting

00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:53,840
with people who

00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:53,840
seek community participation as a way

00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,760
each other allows them to continually

00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,159
identify

00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:08,079
and also reinforce shared and communal

00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:11,200
values and identities

00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,200
so yeah

00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:18,159
coming to the next steps uh so this the

00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:19,679
there's an overview of the the three

00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,079
general kinds of challenges that you're

00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,679
going to

00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:25,359
face as you assume a leadership role

00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:27,119
that is expanding the community

00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:29,359
maintaining the growth sustainably and

00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:31,919
popularizing a project along the way

00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,560
uh it can see that we are almost out of

00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:34,560
time but

00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,000
let's take a moment to review uh what

00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,599
might come next for you

00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,359
uh things like gathering community

00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:42,800
feedback and measuring your success

00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:45,040
right so uh

00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,280
first let's talk about uh gathering

00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,440
feedback

00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,320
leading an open source project uh means

00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,240
that

00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,119
you me you're making yourself uh

00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:58,320
available to address community ideas

00:34:55,119 --> 00:35:00,880
uh concerns and more uh this

00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,520
feedback uh it is very critical to your

00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,960
success

00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:06,000
and it's also a measure of how much

00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,960
success that you have

00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,320
the relative success that you have and

00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,560
you know you're trying to position

00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,920
yourself as the party who is the most

00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,079
likely to

00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,680
act on community feedback so you'll need

00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:21,280
to come continually

00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:22,960
collect this feedback so

00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,880
here we have highlighted some of the

00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,440
most common methods for that

00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,400
and this include open feedback forms

00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,200
these are like

00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,240
easily accessible always on forms for

00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,440
collecting

00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,640
uh written feedback from your users and

00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,200
contributors

00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,720
uh there are five side chats uh i don't

00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,880
know how many people over here are

00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,000
familiar with the concept of fire chats

00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,520
for chats

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,560
but these are usually uh these might be

00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,119
pre-recorded

00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:52,400
or casual interviews with project

00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,800
maintainers or

00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,839
other important leaders who discuss

00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,960
about the project's

00:35:55,839 --> 00:36:00,960
mission vision and strategy uh

00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,560
then there are community calls uh

00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,760
community calls usually

00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,880
are live audio video gatherings uh where

00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,320
community members

00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,800
get to uh speak uh like firstly they can

00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,880
join

00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,079
and they can speak directly with the

00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:18,240
project maintainers and

00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:21,200
this is these go this goes a long way in

00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,079
increasing communities bond as well as

00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,079
clarifying

00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,280
the community's uh vision and mission

00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:28,880
strategy

00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:31,359
uh then there is community q a so

00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,240
these are usually community driven uh

00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:34,560
ema

00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:36,320
or ask me anything style events in which

00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,800
uh community members

00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:41,200
submit and vote on questions for the

00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:44,560
community leaders

00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:47,760
so yeah and

00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:50,000
then uh there is uh the

00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,760
and then you need to be able to measure

00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,800
the success of your work

00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,480
within the community so depending on

00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,960
your situation this could be important

00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:01,280
for

00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:03,119
two reasons one is community uh

00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,440
like communicating the success with the

00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:08,480
community how will you narrate your

00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:11,839
community's success in achieving its

00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,480
mission and objectives you need to be

00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:15,440
able to

00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,160
help your community measure its progress

00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,440
chart

00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:22,079
its accomplishments and stay focused on

00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,920
those achievements how will you do that

00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:25,040
um then there is the challenge of you

00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,800
know

00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,079
communicating success with your

00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,560
organization's

00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,200
uh stakeholders how will you explain the

00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,520
value of

00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,960
working with your community to others in

00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,280
your organization

00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,000
so if you're leading a community because

00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,079
a project

00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,320
is integral to your organization then

00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:45,359
you need to be able to explain

00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:47,200
the value of you the work internally too

00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:48,839
and that to uh the organizational

00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:52,160
stakeholders for your

00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:52,160
project so

00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:57,520
here are like i'll be talking about a

00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,760
few potential metrics that

00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,520
you might track pertaining to technical

00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,280
contributions we don't have much time

00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,160
over here so i won't go into the details

00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,920
of this

00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:10,000
but just to give you a general idea uh

00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,200
you might attract metrics around code

00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,480
commit uh

00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:16,079
new designs contributed uh the number of

00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,200
issues that have been filed or maybe the

00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:20,880
number of code reviews that you have had

00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:24,160
how many pull requests have been there

00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:27,920
to your code base and so on

00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:30,160
every project has different uh

00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,359
like metrics that they want to focus on

00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,920
based upon how

00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:35,760
technical they are or what type of

00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:39,119
contributor base they have

00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,960
but in general these you know

00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:42,480
like these are some of the points that

00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,040
you might want to track

00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,800
uh metrics around your technical

00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:50,400
contributions

00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:52,160
uh and again here are some uh

00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,000
potential metrics that you might want to

00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,320
track uh pertaining to

00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,480
non-technical contributors so uh you

00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:01,760
know gathering feedback and

00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,079
measuring success is really important

00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,760
and

00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:05,839
once you have determined how you are

00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,960
going to begin addressing leadership

00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:09,680
challenges

00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:11,520
these will be your next steps um so

00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,079
again i won't go into the details of any

00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,839
of these

00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:19,119
points uh for now but uh

00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:19,599
maybe uh you can you can explore this

00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,720
with

00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:24,320
your uh with other people within your

00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,800
community and based upon that come up

00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,040
with

00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,119
metrics around identifying a

00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,920
non-technical contributions and

00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:32,880
this might include things like you know

00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,240
how many

00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,400
how many people are contributing to your

00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,200
project where those people are based out

00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,760
of

00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:41,040
um what is the diversity and inclusion

00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,720
statistics for your pro

00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:45,680
for your project then how many views are

00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,240
there to your

00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:49,599
to your community's uh home page and so

00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:52,640
on

00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:53,040
so yeah i think uh we have covered most

00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,839
of the

00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:58,000
the topics over here uh maybe we can

00:39:55,839 --> 00:40:01,839
summarize uh all of these

00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,839
uh in general so

00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,640
yeah so by you know choosing to lead an

00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,920
open source

00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:12,720
project uh you can

00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,520
assume an increased responsibility for

00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,480
that project's

00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,480
success or failure

00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,359
people choose to uh lead open source

00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,520
projects for various reasons including

00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:25,599
organizational need a sense of

00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:29,680
responsibility to the community

00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:31,839
or personal and professional fulfillment

00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:33,359
new community leaders face challenges

00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:35,280
related to expanding

00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,400
maintaining and popularizing their

00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,800
projects

00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,880
and they can begin to address these

00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,560
challenges by examining their projects

00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:45,680
contributor pathways

00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:47,680
governance models and reward models

00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,960
and finally uh they'll also need to

00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,960
determine the best

00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,319
ways to gather feedback from their

00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,079
communities and

00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:56,400
communicate the value and success of

00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:58,640
their work to various stakeholders

00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,640
so

00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:05,440
so i think i have been able to

00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,720
cover most of the points that i wanted

00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:10,240
to talk about

00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:12,560
and uh so that's mostly it

00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,839
for uh the content that i wanted to

00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,640
share with you

00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:18,319
um and but before ending uh the

00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:22,000
