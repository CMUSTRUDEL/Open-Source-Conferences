so those of you who are expecting a very

00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:17,439
big technical Tech Talk kind of a thing

00:00:15,209 --> 00:00:18,789
this is my first time being back in

00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:20,710
front of a white board at my old alma

00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:22,599
mater so I'm going to get all

00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:27,599
professorial on you and bust out some

00:00:22,599 --> 00:00:35,170
white boarding if that's all right so

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:38,890
firstly I am remedy with an underscore

00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:41,590
on Twitter you can also find me as d

00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:43,480
cause an IRC which is this cryptic

00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:46,059
jumble of text over here which is a

00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,379
real-time messaging system that is used

00:00:46,059 --> 00:00:50,379
by free and open source software

00:00:47,379 --> 00:00:52,269
developers all over the world the server

00:00:50,379 --> 00:00:54,910
that I'm connected to is free node and

00:00:52,269 --> 00:00:56,859
that is the one that is specifically for

00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:58,809
free and open source software projects

00:00:56,859 --> 00:01:01,899
to host their chat rooms so how people

00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:04,259
here are slack users a bunch so like

00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:08,560
this is like the og slack right so

00:01:04,259 --> 00:01:11,790
there's a number of things we're going

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:16,329
to talk about today first thing is

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:20,400
communication channels the second thing

00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:20,400
is infrastructure

00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:27,939
this is not a very dark marker I'm sorry

00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:30,659
about that let's try the green one the

00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:38,079
third thing well the second thing is

00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:40,110
going to be on boarding and the last

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:44,530
thing that we're going to talk about is

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:49,450
licensing which I'm sure a lot of folks

00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:51,670
here are interested in yes so show of

00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:55,569
hands how many people have a github

00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:57,340
account that is almost one hundred

00:01:55,569 --> 00:01:59,110
percent of the people in the room so I

00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,369
have good news for you on the

00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:02,229
infrastructure side and on the

00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:03,849
communication side a lot of you folks

00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:06,220
are already plugged in to the number one

00:02:03,849 --> 00:02:07,899
open code Forge that is the center of

00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:12,280
the open-source development universe

00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:14,829
right and github actually has some tools

00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,030
that you can use to pick a license when

00:02:14,829 --> 00:02:17,860
you go and create a new repository

00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,329
there's a drop-down of different

00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:22,299
licenses that are popular that you can

00:02:19,329 --> 00:02:25,390
pick look at me I'm already jumping to

00:02:22,299 --> 00:02:28,450
licensing but we'll go over some other

00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:31,389
resources outside of that once we get a

00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:35,410
little further along so starting with

00:02:31,389 --> 00:02:38,799
communication like I mentioned IRC is a

00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:42,400
place where you can find almost any open

00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:45,190
source project and the way that you find

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,440
them is you're here you use a chat

00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:49,870
client of some kind you can even use web

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,329
chat free no net if you don't install a

00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:54,459
client locally on your machine and you

00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:57,400
can just be like who has an open source

00:02:54,459 --> 00:03:00,090
project that they like anybody in the

00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,090
audience over here

00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:08,420
so you're going to make me join that

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,900
channel huh all right good thing I'm

00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:15,740
wearing a cloak so we'll go /join pound

00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:17,150
MITM proxy and sure enough there are a

00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:21,860
bunch of people in here and I'm the leaf

00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:23,600
immediately and yes so almost any open

00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:25,580
source project that you can think of you

00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,140
can just do /join name of that project

00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,370
and there's a pretty good chance that

00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:31,430
there are people in there hanging out

00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:33,470
now the nice thing about IRC is that it

00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:36,080
is both a synchronous and asynchronous

00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:38,090
communication channel meaning that

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,370
people can talk in real time when they

00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:42,410
need to but most open source developers

00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:44,030
and project leads and maintain errs who

00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:46,220
are really serious about doing this kind

00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:47,480
of stuff they have bouncers or other

00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,460
ways that they stay present in that

00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,320
channel all the time so they can come

00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:54,140
back and find your messages and then

00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:55,880
answer them but that means that you

00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:58,130
should probably also stay in the channel

00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:00,140
if you hope to get answers so one of the

00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:01,520
main things about communicating and this

00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,140
happens a lot with new people is there

00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,610
like great I found this IRC channel I

00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:07,340
found the place I'm looking for I came

00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:09,200
in I said hey I'm new and I need help

00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:11,390
with this thing and then nobody said

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,430
anything so I left it's basically like

00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:14,870
opening the door of a room and yelling

00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:17,060
into it and then slamming it shut and

00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:18,470
running down the hallway right like if

00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,440
you want to get answers from the

00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:24,140
communication channel stick around

00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:27,590
generally speaking hour or two is a good

00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:31,160
sort of baseline but if you can stay

00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:32,960
overnight it's good because IRC open

00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,820
source communities are global

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,320
communities right you're not just

00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:38,120
dealing with people in the eastern or

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,590
western time zones in the u.s. you're

00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,540
dealing with people all over the world I

00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:43,520
take IRC meetings at two in the morning

00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:46,370
I take IRC mornings at six in the

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,650
morning right I mean it really any time

00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,480
of day you can end up talking with

00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:52,070
people and it's really cool in a big

00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,840
project because let's say it's three in

00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:55,250
the morning or four in the morning and

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,290
you're hacking on something you're going

00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:59,930
to trace back well I can hop in the

00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:01,760
channel and France is just waking up or

00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:03,919
India is in the middle of breakfast and

00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,870
you can get answers pretty much 24 hours

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:08,180
a day if the project is big enough so

00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:11,330
IRC is a major communication channel and

00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:14,960
it's a great place to find folks who are

00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:15,689
working on open source now this goes on

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,939
onboarding

00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:21,409
little bit but there's this particular

00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:26,009
channel that is SuperDuper helpful and

00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:32,819
it's called open hatch and if I can

00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:35,489
spell open hatch right now there are 77

00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:39,089
people hanging out open hatch and open

00:05:35,489 --> 00:05:41,610
hatch is bills itself as the open source

00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:44,669
communities welcoming committee their

00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:47,189
whole purpose is to find people just

00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:49,110
like you who are coming to hackathons

00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:50,399
for the first time or starting to

00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:52,439
contribute to projects for the very

00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:55,589
first time and they are here to answer

00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:57,869
questions all the way from where do I

00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:59,279
start and they're they're waiting

00:05:57,869 --> 00:06:01,259
literally for you to come in and say

00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,659
hello they have a bot that greets you

00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:04,919
when you come in and ask you if you have

00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:06,989
a particular question and tries to

00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:08,489
direct you in certain places so if

00:06:06,989 --> 00:06:09,779
you're brand new open source and you've

00:06:08,489 --> 00:06:12,239
never done this kind of stuff before

00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:14,999
open hatch is a great place to start and

00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:17,369
they have a whole website as well where

00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:19,739
you can check out different projects

00:06:17,369 --> 00:06:22,889
will submit their bugs and issues to

00:06:19,739 --> 00:06:25,019
open hatch as being sort of new user

00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:26,939
friendly or new contributor friendly so

00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:28,679
you can find lots of easy fix bugs to

00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:31,110
onboard yourself to get involved in the

00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:32,369
bigger project so let's say that you

00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:35,729
know you're really interested in this

00:06:32,369 --> 00:06:37,499
desktop software but you know you don't

00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:39,479
want to pull down the hundreds of Meg's

00:06:37,499 --> 00:06:41,639
of source code and have to dive in all

00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:45,209
by yourself right you want to be able to

00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:47,249
go through a person who can guide you to

00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:49,729
the places where the bugs are easier to

00:06:47,249 --> 00:06:52,759
fix and there's an on-ramp for you now

00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:55,889
that's real world stuff they also have

00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:58,889
bounty programs and they have exercises

00:06:55,889 --> 00:07:02,759
and they have missions so that it will

00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:04,139
help you get the standard pieces that

00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:07,619
you need to do open source development

00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:10,739
things like generating encryption keys

00:07:07,619 --> 00:07:12,419
or signing stuff with gpg keys or

00:07:10,739 --> 00:07:13,919
getting get set up in revision control

00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:16,349
set up on your laptop or your

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,449
development machine they have a number

00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:22,259
of bounties and missions to help you get

00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:24,389
on board at open source so open hatch is

00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:26,129
a great communication channel it's full

00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:27,929
of people who want to help and there are

00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:29,399
some really established hackers along

00:07:27,929 --> 00:07:29,639
with intermediate folks and folks who

00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:31,530
got

00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:33,449
their start via open hatch who are now

00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:35,729
contributing as members so if you're

00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:37,349
interested in mentoring open hatch is

00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:39,689
also a great place for you to hang out

00:07:37,349 --> 00:07:43,080
I'm an open hatch all the time I stay

00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:47,729
there i'm also in like seventy seven ish

00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:49,499
IRC channels at any one time so as i

00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:52,020
don't recommend you do that necessarily

00:07:49,499 --> 00:07:55,770
my job is to sort of be a community lead

00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:58,020
so that's why I'm there so much I guess

00:07:55,770 --> 00:08:01,199
did everyone see my introductory

00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:02,789
presentation today at the kickoff okay

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,740
so for those of you weren't I totally

00:08:02,789 --> 00:08:06,750
skipped the introduction part of this so

00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,580
my name is Remy to cause maker and I'm

00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:10,830

00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:12,360
called red hat and red hat is the

00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:15,029
leading provider of open source

00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:18,750

500 red hat is a ridiculously amazing

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,699
organization to work for I'm thanking my

00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:36,149
lucky stars every day that I get to do

00:08:32,699 --> 00:08:39,779
it and I've been a fuss contributor for

00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:43,199
a dish nine ish years I've been a fedora

00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:48,269
user for about 10 or 11 and i've been a

00:08:43,199 --> 00:08:49,949
linux user for about 14 so i've been

00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:53,070
doing this kind of stuff for a long time

00:08:49,949 --> 00:08:57,060
and I'm a hack adem escribe what I do so

00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:59,730
I was here at RIT my background is

00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:04,440
mostly in politics and business and

00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:07,500
communications and public policy I have

00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,990
this side interest in open-source

00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:12,089
development because i think that the

00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,620
internet and technology are sort of this

00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:16,649
discipline that applies to everything

00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:19,170
else and the open source is not just

00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:21,660
about code open source is a production

00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:24,959
process that's like saying that you know

00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:26,250
the assembly line is about cars right if

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,510
you're going to write a book about Ford

00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,010
you're not just going to write about

00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:31,440
cars you're going to write about how

00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:33,540
specialization had changed the way that

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,160
people build things open source is

00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:37,589
changing the way that people build

00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:40,019
things and it's not just software and as

00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:42,269
we get more and more software integrated

00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:43,500
to every other industry that we have the

00:09:42,269 --> 00:09:45,810
importance of understanding this

00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,130
I cannot stress to you enough and you

00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:49,470
all are here at hackathons you're

00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:51,000
already at the forefront of this kind of

00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:52,590
stuff you are here on your own time

00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,450
doing the stuff that you're interested

00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:56,130
in and I applaud all of you for being

00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:57,960
here especially for hanging out here in

00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:59,880
this room I mean obviously I'm a little

00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,680
biased but you know this open source

00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:04,100
stuff is bigger than me too and it's

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:07,800
really important for you as students as

00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:10,710
potential career folk as entrepreneurs

00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:14,930
as whatever the reason why I still use

00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:18,120
open source is because it's free as in

00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:20,250
gratis meaning there's no cost so all

00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,800
the code that i right I release it other

00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:26,400
than that for free which is exciting and

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:29,160
it's also free as in freedom like Libre

00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:31,620
meaning that anybody can do what they

00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:35,040
want with it after I have released it

00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:36,990
and we'll get into the spectrum of rules

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,560
that go into that when we get to the

00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:43,170
licensing part so I'm going a little bit

00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:45,240
over arching leave with this but they

00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:49,230
give you a good context of what open

00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:55,190
source is about etc where I come from in

00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:57,750
case you missed my introduction so

00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:59,940
another communication channel besides

00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:03,030
IRC which is asynchronous and

00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:05,240
synchronous is mailing lists I'm people

00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:08,490
here are subscribed to a mailing list

00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:11,820
how people here have email accounts like

00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:13,380
everyone right so mailing lists are

00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:15,510
another standard place that projects do

00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:18,060
a lot of communication sometimes that's

00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:20,520
you know hooked up to the repository

00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:22,320
itself and sometimes it's a hosted

00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:25,230
instance somewhere sometimes just one

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,180
person's inbox but ideally a public

00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:28,650
mailing list gives you a public record

00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:32,130
to have conversations where you can

00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:34,320
start to collect all of the history of a

00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:37,200
project and all of the members of a

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,600
project so that when someone is like hey

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,610
I'm asking this question you can go back

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,160
and say here's the answer we already

00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:45,180
answered it on the mailing list or

00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,560
here's a conversation that might bring

00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,780
some light to what you're doing right

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:52,230
mailing lists aren't just a place where

00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:54,090
you are trying to do a one-time thing

00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:55,680
mailing lists are trying to gather a

00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:56,490
history of the project so that you don't

00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,290
have to

00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:02,310
reinventing the wheel over and over

00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:03,779
again so if a project has a mailing

00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:06,270
lists and you're interested in it I

00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:07,950
recommend it another way that you can

00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:10,260
keep up with projects you care about is

00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:12,600
on github people probably use the star

00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:17,130
quite a bit for projects that they want

00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:19,050
to follow yes well also there's like a

00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:21,779
little eyeball there where you can watch

00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:23,940
a project and that will actually send

00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:26,760
you email updates anytime issues are

00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:28,649
filed or commits are pushed so if I have

00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:32,550
a project that I'm the lead developer on

00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:34,709
I you automatically get watch status on

00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:36,990
github repos that you create but if

00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:39,209
you're like a core developer that

00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,950
doesn't necessarily happen so if you

00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:43,170
care about a community and you want to

00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:45,180
stay up with it you should subscribe to

00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:47,820
their repo and try to follow along now

00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:49,290
if it's a really active project that

00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:52,410
might be a lot of email to go through

00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:54,899
and I'm sorry I'm sure all of you have

00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:56,850
plenty enough email to read already but

00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:59,250
for the stuff that's really important

00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:01,140
following the source code itself is its

00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:04,620
own communication channel that is

00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:06,029
definitely worth it and especially if

00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,850
you find people who are writing good

00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:11,100
code and using revision control in a

00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:13,020
really effective way so people who are

00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,329
using really verbose commit messages

00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:18,360
people who do really fine grain commits

00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:19,860
where they're committing not just one

00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,190
file at a time but they're committing

00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:24,959
different sections of the file you know

00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:29,040
commit logs are the new documentation

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:31,230
right the actual way that you create the

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,850
code is its own communication channel

00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:35,910
and you are signaling to other

00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:37,920
developers way more on how you do your

00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:39,630
get commits then if you were putting in

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:44,790
line comments in your code in some cases

00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:47,370
because dev and ops the line is blurring

00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:48,750
and the way that you deploy code and the

00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:51,060
way that you store a code and the way

00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:53,370
that you replicate your setup that's

00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:56,190
just as important these days people

00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:58,170
aren't splitting the roles anymore all

00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:00,750
of us are expected to do both in this

00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:03,899
new world of containerization and what

00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:07,260
not just like random aside how many

00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:09,209
people here have heard of docker okay I

00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:10,100
do a lot of tech conferences and it's

00:14:09,209 --> 00:14:12,440
like

00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:14,959
oh my god containers it's ridiculous I'm

00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:18,110
kind of glad to not see so many hands

00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:20,029
look up containers and docker on some

00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:21,589
other time because that's a direction

00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:23,959
where the industry is going that's very

00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:25,579
interesting to keep up with but that is

00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:29,620
outside of the scope of today's talk a

00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:39,560
little bit so for communication channels

00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:42,560
IRC mailing lists commit logs sometimes

00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:44,779
projects have slack channels too I would

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,389
also throw get er in there if anybody

00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:52,540
has use that anybody heard of get er or

00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:52,540
use it cool couple people alright so

00:14:53,889 --> 00:14:59,089
there's nothing more frustrating as a

00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:02,899
new contributor than to dive into a

00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:04,550
giant piece of software that doesn't

00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:06,769
have any documentation doesn't have any

00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:09,949
issues and nobody's answering your

00:15:06,769 --> 00:15:11,810
questions so understanding how to

00:15:09,949 --> 00:15:14,209
communicate with open source communities

00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:16,689
is pretty much the prerequisite even

00:15:14,209 --> 00:15:19,069
before knowing how to code i would say

00:15:16,689 --> 00:15:21,019
understanding community architecture is

00:15:19,069 --> 00:15:25,579
just as important as understanding the

00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:32,259
infrastructure which brings us to

00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:35,209
infrastructure so how many people here

00:15:32,259 --> 00:15:38,600
maintain an open source library or run a

00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:41,769
project we have any project school nino

00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,769
what about you which ones

00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:23,650
awesome awesome and so where do you host

00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:25,120
that great great and what about Doc's

00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:38,370
are they hosted with the source code as

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:38,370
well awesome all right anybody else

00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:51,150
nice some reverse engineering kind of

00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:52,740
stuff way solid you should check out a

00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:58,920
project called PI recite written by a

00:16:52,740 --> 00:17:02,850
RIT alum L Mackin so yeah you said get

00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:04,670
lab calm and where do you host the code

00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:08,970
for that reverse engineering library

00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:15,630
cool so use github anybody else hosting

00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:16,650
your code elsewhere how about Doc's do

00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:20,160
you have your docs hosted in the same

00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:25,290
place cool so maybe you have like a

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:28,470
readme alright so the nice thing about a

00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:31,020
project like github is that you can put

00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:32,850
a readme right in inside of it and

00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:34,440
github also gives you a wiki so that you

00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:36,210
can create documentation to go right

00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,980
along with your source code it's really

00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:39,810
nice to have your code and your docs in

00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:41,070
the same place along with your

00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:44,280
communication channel and your issue

00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:46,890
tracker the thing that made github so

00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,390
great in my opinion is that they

00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:49,860
connected these three different pieces

00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:51,510
of infrastructure that used to be

00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,100
separate so you have to run your own

00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:54,870
mailing list you just have to run your

00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,760
own issue tracker and you set to run

00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:59,040
your own source code hosting and github

00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,110
rubbed all of them together and put a

00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:03,240
nice fancy UI layer on top of it and

00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:06,450
made it social which is something that

00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:09,540
sourceforge the other preeminent source

00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:12,630
code Forge prior to github was not doing

00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:15,750
so you get a lot of bang for your buck

00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:18,450
with github they're very open source

00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:20,220
friendly they do private repositories if

00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:21,870
you need them I think if you are

00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:24,360
participating here as a student they'll

00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:27,720
give you free private repos we go to

00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:32,130
education github com you can get a bunch

00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:34,620
of extra free stuff so in the case that

00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:39,120
you want to host your docs somewhere

00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:45,000
else there's a website called read the

00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:46,710
docs org I believe and they will build

00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,350
your documentation from your source code

00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:51,210
for you with hooks so that when you push

00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:52,800
the github it'll just automatically

00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:54,690
build some nice documentation for you

00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,370
and there are a lot of projects that

00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:58,909
host there and the other thing i like

00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:01,159
about read the docs is that

00:18:58,909 --> 00:19:02,509
they are a documentation community so

00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:05,330
they are interested in helping you

00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:08,419
become better documentaries of your code

00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:09,950
they also run workshops as well as a

00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:11,330
conference every year called right the

00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:13,070
docks where they bring together

00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:15,109
documentation experts from all over the

00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:16,460
world and help people figure out how to

00:19:15,109 --> 00:19:19,580
communicate better with perspective

00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:24,379
developers to improve contribution very

00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:28,849
exciting project so what about apps

00:19:24,379 --> 00:19:34,340
anybody here written apps cool what kind

00:19:28,849 --> 00:19:36,080
of app iOS apps so where where do you

00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:39,769
push that code when it's in production

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:42,609
do you host anything no what about web

00:19:39,769 --> 00:19:45,769
apps anybody developing web apps in here

00:19:42,609 --> 00:19:49,669
yeah like cool so where do you host your

00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:51,919
websites right on so self hosted bare

00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:55,759
metal like under a desk somewhere maybe

00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:58,549
yeah cool so I'm just going to write it

00:19:55,759 --> 00:20:02,149
bare metal where else are people hosting

00:19:58,549 --> 00:20:04,729
their their apps AWS how many people

00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:07,009
here have used amazon web services wow

00:20:04,729 --> 00:20:11,950
that's a lot of people all right so

00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:16,309
amazon web service is expensive or cheap

00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:19,340
but not free yes all right so Amazon Web

00:20:16,309 --> 00:20:21,279
Services is a great place to host very

00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:25,580
super web scale and all of that business

00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:32,349
but it costs dollars anybody else host

00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:32,349
their website somewhere else mm-hmm

00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:44,540
dreamhost I heard a sure what's the

00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:46,280
story with Asher okay I thought for a

00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:49,880
time it was free as long as you're under

00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:56,720
a certain amount of traffic 30 days free

00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:58,280
trial okay okay good to know well that's

00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,010
great if you're trying to experiment and

00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:03,250
deploy something safer hackathon right

00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:07,340
what about other things anybody else

00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:09,740
digitalocean very cool startup I think

00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:11,960
they sponsored this and there's some

00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:13,880
digitalocean credits that are being

00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,440
awarded possibly for a prize is that

00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:20,210
right am I making this up I might be

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:24,580
making this up okay so they're bluehost

00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:27,550
too so these sort of companies like

00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:33,160
dreamhost and digital open and bluehost

00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:35,710
those are all IAS yes

00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:39,200
infrastructure-as-a-service all right

00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:43,400
let's all right let's talk about the

00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,780
cloud so there's actually not just one

00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,950
cloud there's a bunch of different kinds

00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:54,280
of clouds and I'm not going to spend a

00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:57,500
lot of time on this but is saas pas

00:21:54,280 --> 00:22:01,310
you're all pretty tech-savvy so just in

00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:03,740
case is infrastructure-as-a-service SAS

00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:06,050
its software as a service and passes

00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:08,630
platform as a service and there are a

00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:11,330
bunch of you know whatever you want as a

00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:16,060
service startups that are coming along

00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:19,370
but digital ocean blue host and

00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:20,630
dreamhost are like okay here's a place

00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:24,770
for you to install an operating system

00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:28,610
in and run it and make a machine Asher

00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:30,770
is platform so they have a platform

00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:34,100
where you can push in my main am I

00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:36,940
getting this right okay they're probably

00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,940
combination so

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:46,810
cool ok so then they're a combination of

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:49,380
them ray AWS and Asher and then you've

00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:54,730
got a couple other ones like Heroku and

00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:57,460
open shift so Heroku started as like a

00:22:54,730 --> 00:23:10,900
straight up Ruby app hosting website and

00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:15,940
it's free to you still I believe ok nice

00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:18,820
not guaranteed down time ouch ouch

00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:21,160
that's a hard selling point maybe if you

00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:22,600
like make up enough Heroku accounts can

00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:25,240
you say oh can you schedule the down

00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,350
timer you don't have truth no sorry

00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:29,380
that's probably gets the terms of

00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:31,420
service anyway so Heroku is a great

00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:33,340
place again where if you're a developer

00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:36,040
and you're like I don't want to think

00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:37,180
about what deployment of what machine I

00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,140
want to do I don't want to think about

00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,580
ports I don't want to think about

00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:41,890
firewalls I don't want to think about

00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:44,440
networking I just want to write code and

00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:47,860
ship it and have it running somewhere

00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:52,480
else platform-as-a-service spots like

00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:55,810
Heroku are good another one which I use

00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:58,330
quite a bit even before I was working

00:23:55,810 --> 00:24:00,250
for the company is open shift an open

00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:03,340
shift is Red Hat's platform as a service

00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:06,070
and you can also because it's open

00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:08,230
source run your own openshift instance

00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:09,790
on your own machine if you wanted to

00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:12,970
provide a platform as a service to

00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:16,120
people within your organization but you

00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:19,210
can get three gears for free and a gear

00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:22,780
is basically just a an arbitrary bucket

00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:26,440
so I run on a static blog for instance

00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:28,810
and on one gear I have the static site

00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:32,490
on another gear I have a load balancer

00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:34,720
and on a third gear I have a database

00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:36,430
not for the static site but for the sake

00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,820
of argument for the conversation let's

00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:42,160
just say so they have cartridges where

00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:44,770
you can be like I want to run a Python

00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:46,660
web service and you click it and it sets

00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:48,490
up a Python environment that is ready

00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:51,460
for you to just get push into

00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:53,530
you and deploy your app it's very

00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:55,840
effective at doing static sites and

00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:58,330
doing small web applications and large

00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,670
ones if you get to the point where you

00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:03,010
need lots of resources and you get your

00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:07,900
company or your project goes to the moon

00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:10,030
so that's a big list right and I can't

00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:12,460
go into all of them in detail but

00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:14,920
hopefully some of you can check out some

00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:16,840
of these spots digitalocean is very

00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:18,280
security minded they're very forward

00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:22,929
thinking they're big into container

00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:24,490
stuff too so you can get a lot of very

00:25:22,929 --> 00:25:28,330
interesting hosting opportunities from

00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:30,370
them savvy it's probably enough about

00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:33,220
infrastructure because I think the thing

00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:37,440
that most people want to get into is the

00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:40,059
onboarding and licensing stuff so

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:45,370
onboarding I already started talking

00:25:40,059 --> 00:25:47,500
about it a little bit so the industry

00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:53,230
has a problem the software industry

00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:55,840
right we have a serious deficiency of

00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:59,230
qualified applicants all of the time

00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:01,000
right US government needs to hire a

00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:02,950
hundred thousand security professionals

00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,990
to help keep the country safe they're

00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:07,809
only going to hire 10,000 this year

00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:10,300
because there's just a gap in the talent

00:26:07,809 --> 00:26:12,309
pool students are graduating from

00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:14,200
college and we still need to hire more

00:26:12,309 --> 00:26:17,170
engineers all the time into all these

00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:19,510
positions and well we have this other

00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:21,940
problem where the pipeline of talent

00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:23,950
going into the industry does not reflect

00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:27,670
the demographic makeup of the average

00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:31,059
population so how do we get these gaps

00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:33,100
figured out one of them is the

00:26:31,059 --> 00:26:35,770
traditional model here right we're in

00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:38,230
the ivory tower or at least the gym of

00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:41,309
the ivory tower where people come

00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:44,260
together to get formal education but

00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:46,270
open-source development does not rely on

00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:50,309
formal education in fact it happens

00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:52,929
largely outside of it so there are many

00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:54,220
formal and informal channels where you

00:26:52,929 --> 00:26:55,960
can get open source development

00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:58,510
experience and just straight-up

00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:00,790
development experience without having to

00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:02,290
enroll full-time as a matriculated

00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:05,000
student

00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:07,210
anybody here gone through like a code

00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:14,140
camp or a training course of any kind

00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:14,140
which one which one is it

00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:42,420
internal drive tech camps cool anybody

00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:42,420
else cool as local high school

00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:56,029
anybody else cool computer camp anybody

00:27:53,429 --> 00:28:00,720
here go to computer camp over a summer

00:27:56,029 --> 00:28:03,499
yeah okay so these are all sounding

00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:06,960
mostly like high school k through 12

00:28:03,499 --> 00:28:09,679
what about post-secondary anybody done

00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:14,159
anything outside of school all right

00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:17,159
here we go so there are a number of

00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:20,609
organizations one of them a very popular

00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:21,659
one is called google Summer of Code how

00:28:20,609 --> 00:28:25,710
do people here if heard of a company

00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:27,960
called Google before yes so what they do

00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:30,570
is they go to the open source community

00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:34,559
and they say hey all of you project

00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:37,859
leaders submit your organization to this

00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:41,639
program and if you have enough cool

00:28:37,859 --> 00:28:44,820
projects will accept you and you have to

00:28:41,639 --> 00:28:47,429
hire somebody who's a student and Google

00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:52,019
we Google will pay them to work on your

00:28:47,429 --> 00:28:54,119
open source project so so if you're a

00:28:52,019 --> 00:28:57,749
student looking for paid work in open

00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:58,879
source google has over 180 organizations

00:28:57,749 --> 00:29:01,710
that were just announced this week

00:28:58,879 --> 00:29:03,149
fedora being one of them where you can

00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:05,970
go to get paid to work on open source

00:29:03,149 --> 00:29:07,769
full time and it's an eight week 10 week

00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:11,429
program I believe and it runs over the

00:29:07,769 --> 00:29:15,349
summer google Summer of Code if you

00:29:11,429 --> 00:29:18,960
google it you'll be able to find it

00:29:15,349 --> 00:29:21,179
another organization it helps to onboard

00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,899
new open source contributors with paid

00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:27,269
opportunities is called out Ricci and

00:29:23,899 --> 00:29:29,009
outreach he really is one of my favorite

00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:31,679
it was formerly called the genome

00:29:29,009 --> 00:29:35,849
outreach program for women and genome is

00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:38,909
a desktop environment in Linux and they

00:29:35,849 --> 00:29:41,869
recently changed it to be beyond just

00:29:38,909 --> 00:29:45,330
women so now the goal is is to get

00:29:41,869 --> 00:29:47,970
underrepresented communities involved in

00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:51,149
open source and it works very similarly

00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:54,529
to Google you get paid a stipend to work

00:29:51,149 --> 00:29:57,570
on a paid internship full-time based on

00:29:54,529 --> 00:29:58,520
projects that are proposed by open

00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:00,050
source

00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:03,860
not even companies open-source

00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:07,700
organizations and projects so HP and

00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:10,270
NASA and Google and red hat and a bunch

00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:13,760
of other people all sponsor these slots

00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:16,520
so that people can get hired into these

00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:18,350
open source projects and learn about

00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,880
these things as an intern so that

00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:24,050
hopefully they can go on to get more

00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:27,950
jobs outreach he is amazing if you're a

00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:31,520
gal or a female identifying person or an

00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:33,290
underrepresented person in the u.s. you

00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:36,620
can apply and that's open right now and

00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:38,210
we have applications open for that the

00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:40,700
only slot that's available for fedora is

00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:44,510
a kernel hacking position so it's a

00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:46,310
little bit hardcore but we will continue

00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:52,960
to be doing more slots in the future

00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:52,960
question out reaching with a why

00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:58,850
outreach with a why on it org I think or

00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:02,420
if you search for outreach II you'll be

00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:05,180
able to find it very awesome okay so

00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:08,600
those are formal talent pipeline

00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:11,980
programs internship programs but there

00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:15,110
are also a couple of other things too so

00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:18,770
I'm not going to talk about all of them

00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:21,230
but in the big cities like new york and

00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:23,630
chicago and LA and san francisco in a

00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:25,940
few other places you have these sort of

00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:29,420
hacker schools that are popping up which

00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:31,640
do you know three to twelve week

00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:35,030
intensive boot camp programs where you

00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:36,800
can go and sometimes it will be you know

00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:38,480
a scattershot introduction to all the

00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,980
programming languages sometimes it's

00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,680
focused specifically on a particular

00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:45,500
language or a particular stack but to

00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:47,420
name off a few folks like hack bright

00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:49,130
Academy in New York City is very

00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:51,470
well-regarded along with hacker school

00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:55,010
there's a flatiron school which has

00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:57,170
spots in New York City as well as

00:31:55,010 --> 00:32:00,950
Raleigh and a few other places in the

00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:03,170
south if you look around for hacker

00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:06,080
schools they are there and it is a great

00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:07,930
way for you to spend a little bit of

00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:10,670
time and probably a little bit of loot

00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:12,290
also but it's worth it especially

00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:14,210
because they have

00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:16,220
lots of Statistics often about their

00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:18,020
onboarding rates to get people hired so

00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:20,330
if you're looking for jobs or contract

00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:21,830
or freelance work and you're like I'm a

00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:23,990
front end designer I really want to know

00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:25,340
about react Jas I go to higher school

00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:27,260
they have a three-week course on react

00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:31,130
Jas and they have a client who's waiting

00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:34,310
for react jes developers reacts jess is

00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:37,940
open-source broth you buy facebook thank

00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:39,530
you for sponsoring and that's a great

00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:40,790
way to onboard yourself to figure out

00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:45,740
how to get involved in open source as

00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:48,260
well so I don't want to go on too much

00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:50,120
more about it because licensing is

00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:51,920
something that a lot of people don't get

00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:54,350
to talk about in a formal setting or

00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:55,820
informal setting i guess like this so

00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:56,900
i'm going to move on unless anybody else

00:32:55,820 --> 00:33:00,800
has anything to add for onboarding

00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:03,650
resources and open source going once

00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:08,020
going twice i'd also throw onto that

00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:08,020
list open hatch yes

00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:24,159
lime connect awesome I'll have to look

00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:29,110
that up all right the last one I almost

00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:38,440
I'm running out of room over here yeah

00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:44,730
let's just do it all right is there any

00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:49,809
way to make this one turn off all right

00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:51,309
so open source licensing this is going

00:33:49,809 --> 00:33:53,049
to be basically a lightning talk i'm

00:33:51,309 --> 00:33:56,590
going to try to go through it in 10

00:33:53,049 --> 00:34:01,240
minutes so we have 10 minutes of QA all

00:33:56,590 --> 00:34:05,700
right it's a little bit of history and a

00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:09,369
little bit of legal stuff but of course

00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:11,859
it always starts off the same way I am

00:34:09,369 --> 00:34:15,730
NOT a lawyer and this does not

00:34:11,859 --> 00:34:19,060
constitute legal or financial advice as

00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:21,280
my official disclaimer I'm not a lawyer

00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:24,730
I am NOT your lawyer this is not legal

00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:27,369
advice if you have something that is

00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:29,339
really important that money is on the

00:34:27,369 --> 00:34:32,399
line or you're starting a company

00:34:29,339 --> 00:34:36,520
absolutely seek professional legal help

00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:38,770
this is just me giving some educational

00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:40,839
resources for you to learn more and a

00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:44,740
little bit history so with that out of

00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:47,550
the way let's talk about licensing let's

00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:47,550
talk about copyright

00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:57,720
in the United States as soon as you

00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:00,000
commit something to a tangible form you

00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,800
own the copyright to it that moment that

00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,330
you write on the back of the napkin at

00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,250
moment that you open the terminal and

00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:06,990
you write the first line of code the

00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:10,140
first time that that comes from your

00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:11,880
brain into reality you own it you have

00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:15,210
copyright and you have exclusive

00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:17,370
copyright that means that in an

00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:19,590
exclusive view of property rights you

00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:22,140
are saying this thing is mine I have it

00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:24,390
and you can't have it but what does this

00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:31,590
have it what are these things there's

00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:34,620
actually a bundle of Rights so you have

00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:37,470
the right to modify it you have the

00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:41,070
right to distribute it you have the

00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:44,820
right to redistribute it and in the case

00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:49,650
of dramatic and musical you have the

00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:50,910
right to perform it there are probably a

00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:52,860
few other ones that I'm forgetting at

00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:54,570
the moment but when we talk about

00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:56,550
copyright it's not just whether you own

00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:59,220
something or not this is how publishers

00:35:56,550 --> 00:36:00,870
and authors make money right they will

00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:04,380
always be the person who wrote the book

00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:06,690
but they afford the distribution rights

00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:08,850
to the publisher in exchange for some

00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:10,830
revenue they're taking some of their

00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:12,840
copyrights and giving them away to

00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:14,550
somebody else and that's a business

00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:20,670
model that works in lots and lots of

00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:26,780
industries so in software there's the

00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:26,780
exclusive view and the inclusive you

00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:33,640
once upon a time there was a hacker

00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:36,160
named Richard Stallman anybody heard of

00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:38,380
this guy Richard Stallman all right so

00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,630
RMS as he's affectionately known in

00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:42,220
software community he's a personality

00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:44,320
you can look up whatever YouTube videos

00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:46,960
you would like take it or leave it the

00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,400
guy is a polarizing figure within free

00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,680
and open source software and he does a

00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,900
lot of really good work and the first

00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:56,200
thing that he did was he wrote a printer

00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:58,960
driver and this printer driver because

00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:01,030
computers were so new the term for it in

00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,700
economics is a pre-competitive economy

00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:05,050
so everything was so new that a market

00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,430
hadn't even been established and people

00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:07,930
weren't even figuring out how to compete

00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:10,450
against each other yet everyone was just

00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:11,770
sharing everything they had the moments

00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:13,780
they built it because it was so

00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:16,960
complicated and so new that nobody knew

00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:19,900
what was going on so Stallman wrote this

00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,970
printer driver and a company said hey we

00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:23,560
really like this printer driver can we

00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:26,350
use it in our software he said

00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:28,600
absolutely here it is so they sold it

00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:31,810
now I'm paraphrasing citation needed

00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:35,530
this is a story look it up definitely

00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:37,870
but TL DR he gives him the printer

00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:39,220
driver the company sells the software he

00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:41,200
sees that the company has made some

00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:43,480
improvements to the software he says hey

00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:45,430
I see you made some changes to my thing

00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,440
that I wrote can you send me those so

00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:49,360
that I can include it with mine and the

00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,850
company said no come he said absolutely

00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:53,380
not we're selling this thing and it's

00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:55,840
better than yours and that's how we make

00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:57,520
money Stallman was pretty upset about

00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,810
this because you know he wrote it and

00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,690
somebody else is making the money from

00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:05,400
it so he said never again this is never

00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:10,120
going to happen to me again so this

00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:11,980
copyrights bundle he said in an

00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:13,960
exclusive view of property you say

00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:16,810
nobody else has the right to do these

00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:18,460
things but an inclusive view you see

00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:22,720
that everybody has the right to do these

00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:25,930
things as long as they release it under

00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:28,960
the same terms that I do and this hack

00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:31,410
around copyright is what created free

00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,410
software

00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:39,250
is a serious legal contribution it

00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:42,400
requires copyright to exist open source

00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:44,050
is not anti copyright it requires it you

00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,000
have to have copyright for open source

00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:48,670
and free software to work now the

00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:55,320
difference as we move along in history

00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:59,770
is that Richard Stallman refer to his

00:38:55,320 --> 00:39:04,840
type of licenses as copyleft as sort of

00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:06,700
a play on words the copyright as more

00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:08,349
software was built and as the market

00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:11,430
sort of figured out how to deal with

00:39:08,349 --> 00:39:13,750
this stuff there came up on other

00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:15,670
innovations and intellectual property

00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:21,910
and a whole bunch of other license came

00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:30,190
about and they generally fall somewhere

00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:32,550
on a spectrum of permissive it's a

00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:32,550
copyleft

00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:40,560
so the license that richard stallman

00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:42,390
wrote was the new public license which

00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,360
is a recursive acronym or the general

00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:49,050
public license sometimes referred and

00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:50,460
then over on the left here there are

00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:53,130
some other kinds of licenses that you

00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:58,380
folks might have heard of such as the

00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:59,940
MIT license bsd license there's a story

00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:02,340
behind the bsd license which i should

00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:04,830
accompany the Stallman story with but in

00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:07,890
the sake of time I'm just going to TL DR

00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:09,300
it and say a university and AT&T Bell

00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:12,480
Labs were working together on an

00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:14,670
operating system and out of commercial

00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,830
interests they wanted to split it up I

00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:18,660
know I'm going to ruin it I don't want

00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:23,160
to ruin it further reading homework all

00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:25,380
right but suffice it to say there's a

00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:28,470
class of license that says the

00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:31,710
differentiating factor is the sort of

00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:38,370
viral Clause as they colloquial return

00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:41,220
it or the forever free Claus the one

00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:44,400
that says you have all of the same

00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:47,160
copyrights as I do as long as you agree

00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:50,120
to share it the same way with everyone

00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:54,120
else it's like the Golden Rule license

00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:55,770
what permissive licenses say is i'm

00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:58,380
going to give you all these copyrights

00:40:55,770 --> 00:41:05,300
and you can do whatever you want with

00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:05,300
them so you can have the freedom to

00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:10,010
close

00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:21,150
so all popular licenses in this family

00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:27,350
include the apache 2.0 license and MIT

00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:34,800
bsd over here on copyleft we have

00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:41,280
Creative Commons share alike and over

00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:44,910
here we have Creative Commons not share

00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:49,460
alike so this is a really good licensing

00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:49,460
resource for you creativecommons org

00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:56,430
licenses and this is really great

00:41:55,020 --> 00:42:00,260
because it refers to things that aren't

00:41:56,430 --> 00:42:04,020
just code this includes audio files

00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:08,250
graphic content sprites all those sort

00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:13,860
of things if you want a real comparison

00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:15,360
of all the licenses not just this

00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:18,360
whiteboard one there's a website called

00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:19,830
TL DR legal and you can actually look up

00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:21,540
each of the different bundles of

00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:23,340
copyright and different kinds of

00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:26,040
stipulations that these open licenses

00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:27,210
have and you can find the ones that are

00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:31,830
tagged that way so you can pick the ones

00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:40,550
that you really like I believe it's open

00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:44,070
source org slash category / license

00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:45,840
someone check me on that URL but this

00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:47,550
has a listing of all the OSI compliant

00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:49,470
licenses which are the ones that I'm

00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:52,670
hoping people in this room are going to

00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:54,810
use so the OSI is a non-profit and

00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:56,730
they're helping to keep track of the

00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:58,440
open standards in the community so if

00:42:56,730 --> 00:43:01,230
someone released the software under an

00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:03,000
open source license they see if that

00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:04,590
license have ever gone to court and if

00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,110
that license has ever gone to court and

00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:11,150
it's been upheld as legal or is

00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:11,150
relatively understood in the community

00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:20,720
okay open sourced I work / licenses so

00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:23,060
they keep track of all the ones that

00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:25,880
sort of carry legal weight right because

00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:28,010
there are a lot of licenses you can just

00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:30,380
make up right in other industries people

00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:33,140
make up contracts all the time right

00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:34,910
there's a there's a license that's the

00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:36,530
free beer license that says that you're

00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:38,210
allowed to use my code as long as every

00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:41,000
anytime you ever see me you buy me a

00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:42,980
beer right there are contracts that

00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,320
celebrities have that say I won't

00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:48,200
perform at your venue unless you give me

00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:50,180
X Y or Z royalties or you write this

00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,800
kind of a thing about me or we won't

00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:54,860
perform at this venue unless there's all

00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:57,590
brown M&MS in the bowl right you come up

00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:59,120
with any haywire ridiculous license that

00:43:57,590 --> 00:44:01,640
you would like because you know what all

00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:04,040
of these bundles of copyrights are yours

00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:06,320
to decide the biggest thing I want you

00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:08,150
to come away from here is that copyright

00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:09,680
is not a binary thing it's not either

00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:13,460
something that you throw over the wall

00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:15,560
wholesale or something that you keep for

00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:18,350
yourself forever you can pick and choose

00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:20,570
what parts of your project you can pick

00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:22,310
what's parts of your license you can

00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:23,960
pick and choose and do what you will

00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:25,670
because you wrote it and you are an

00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:29,210
author and you should take control of

00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:32,060
your own copyrights that's my plea that

00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:35,900
is my plug I'm very interested I'm a

00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:40,280
pluralist right all through this

00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:41,960
spectrum of fuss free and open source

00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:46,480
software there are all different

00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:48,890
licenses and each project and each goal

00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:52,520
sometimes one kind of a license is more

00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:54,470
important than others I tend toward the

00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:57,860
copy left side of things right I'm an

00:44:54,470 --> 00:45:00,230
academic I'm very fries and freedom kind

00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:01,490
of a person that's what I do but I've

00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:03,800
released plenty of stuff under the

00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:05,240
Apache to license it all depends on what

00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,950
community you're trying to reach and

00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:09,200
what your goal is and the cool thing

00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:11,510
about permissive licenses is that

00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:13,070
they're always like guaranteed to be

00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:15,200
open source for one generation then you

00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:16,970
have the freedom to close but you can

00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:19,100
always take something that's permissibly

00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:21,590
licensed and licenses under the GPL

00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:24,290
afterwards because that's part of the

00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:25,970
beauty of a permissive license so as

00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:26,450
long as you're participating in the open

00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:29,570
culture

00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:32,780
it comes down to more so of mindshare

00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:34,490
and what the rest of the development

00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:36,230
community is doing and who you are

00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:38,630
trying to reach if you're going into a

00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:40,550
software community like javascript where

00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:45,020
MIT and apache licenses are very

00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:46,760
Premanand prevalent then if you use a

00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:48,349
lot of copy lefted stuff you're going to

00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:51,500
turn off a lot of the JavaScript

00:45:48,349 --> 00:45:52,880
community Facebook's official policy at

00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:55,220
least the last time I heard James Pierce

00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:57,859
talk about it when he keynoted was that

00:45:55,220 --> 00:46:00,200
they defer to the standing culture so if

00:45:57,859 --> 00:46:01,849
they go into a project and the community

00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:03,730
is contributing under license that's the

00:46:01,849 --> 00:46:08,480
license that they're going to continue

00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:12,230
most companies do that it all depends on

00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:17,260
what your goal is for me I want there to

00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:17,260
be and I'll try to cut this off quick

00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:23,119
this has been a holy war okay this is

00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:26,869
something that people get very intense

00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:28,700
about in the community if you care about

00:46:26,869 --> 00:46:31,460
this stuff often times people will argue

00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:33,770
one side or the other my ultimate

00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:39,819
argument now that I'm in the enterprise

00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:43,329
is you want to avoid this over

00:46:39,819 --> 00:46:45,800
differentiation it's a ridiculous

00:46:43,329 --> 00:46:47,930
sounding word it's very long hard to

00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:54,160
write on a whiteboard but basically it's

00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:56,960
this cell phones computers servers right

00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:59,960
the more and more stuff that goes into

00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:04,460
making it all the way from making the

00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:06,490
metal have electricity run through it to

00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:08,900
the various layers of the OSI model

00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:13,760
going all the way up to the top to wear

00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:15,800
you as an app developer are writing your

00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:18,680
layer that goes on the top of it on the

00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:20,720
top of the platform right that is where

00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:23,200
you as a developer provide your value

00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:25,339
and that is where you as a business

00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:30,890
differentiate yourself from your

00:47:25,339 --> 00:47:33,829
competitors the more stuff in this stack

00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:36,680
that's free as in freedom the more

00:47:33,829 --> 00:47:38,930
commodity it is right IBM doesn't have a

00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:41,630
special kernel that they run vs

00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:43,460
android most people are using mainline

00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:46,339
kernel as the base for the stuff that

00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:48,890
they built so that means that if we can

00:47:46,339 --> 00:47:50,210
all agree on this part of it then just

00:47:48,890 --> 00:47:53,660
these top layers is where we have to

00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:58,480
spend our money to be a business but if

00:47:53,660 --> 00:48:01,490
you don't do that then it turns out that

00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:04,069
you have to invest in a lot more of the

00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:06,559
stuff in the stack which means that to

00:48:04,069 --> 00:48:08,119
get to the app point well now we have to

00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:09,349
write our own display stuff and we have

00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:10,640
to come up with our own hardware specs

00:48:09,349 --> 00:48:12,829
we have to do all these things that cost

00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:14,480
a lot of money so instead of just

00:48:12,829 --> 00:48:15,650
innovating at the top of the stack where

00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,599
you can provide your value in

00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:19,250
specialization as an organization you

00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:21,380
have to recreate all the wheels to get

00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:23,240
there it's very expensive it wastes a

00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:25,460
lot of time and we only do it so that we

00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:28,099
can fight in the court about it it's

00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:30,349
ridiculous that's the argument for

00:48:28,099 --> 00:48:35,420
enterprise that's the argument for

00:48:30,349 --> 00:48:39,050
engineering organizations at scale all

00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:41,119
right I'm not here to tell you which

00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:44,059
license to pick I'm here to tell you

00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:46,480
that there are a spectrum of licenses

00:48:44,059 --> 00:48:49,280
and that they fit different reasons and

00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:51,799
you should consider them and I still

00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:53,180
have about seven ish minutes left so I'd

00:48:51,799 --> 00:48:55,240
like to take this time to answer any

00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,240
questions

00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:13,250
okay the really cool thing about open

00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:15,590
source is self selection it's it's so

00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:17,120
crucial right you're a company and

00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:19,010
you're like I want to pay people a ton

00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:23,540
of money to work on this cat dating

00:49:19,010 --> 00:49:26,240
website right and you're like okay well

00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:29,270
cat dating like four cats not people in

00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:30,860
cats right so I don't know maybe there's

00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:33,560
like some San Francisco company I don't

00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:34,790
know about but either way right you want

00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:37,550
to build this thing that you think is a

00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:39,800
good idea but the community could be up

00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:41,750
in the air so you use salaries and

00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:43,580
incentive to draw developer cycles an

00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:45,380
open source you don't have that an open

00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:47,180
source people contribute to the projects

00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:49,310
that they are most interested in so if

00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:51,830
you have a real problem it's called

00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:54,740
scratching your own edge if you're like

00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:56,120
I had this Lake bug that keeps coming up

00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:58,810
or I have this piece of software that i

00:49:56,120 --> 00:50:00,980
wish i had or a script that I wish did X

00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:02,480
there's a pretty good chance that

00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:05,060
someone else on planet earth is having

00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:06,920
the same problem as you and as long as

00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:09,380
your public about it and you're released

00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:11,120
early and often those people will find

00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:13,970
you and if you make yourself available

00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:15,680
on the IRC servers with mailing lists

00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:17,210
that have proper descriptions and you

00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:19,010
list yourself on github where lots of

00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:21,710
developers are there's a good chance

00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:23,420
somebody will find you at that point it

00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:24,860
comes down to culture whether or not

00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:26,600
people will come with you and keep doing

00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:28,910
it or not and the merit of your idea

00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:30,920
there are a lot of different reasons why

00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:32,600
people contribute to open source but for

00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:34,130
the most part it's to solve their own

00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:36,020
problems and scratch their own itch

00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:38,840
that's why I work on the less that I do

00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:41,030
because it's so us that I use on my

00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:43,070
computer that's how I got started I run

00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:44,990
this Linux thing and the deeper I got

00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:47,930
and using it the more interested in I

00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:50,240
got and helping to keep it running so I

00:50:47,930 --> 00:50:51,350
know that's like not quite an answer to

00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:53,780
how do I get lots of people to

00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:55,220
contribute it would be create a positive

00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:57,260
learning environment with clear

00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:59,060
onboarding ramps have really good

00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:01,250
documentation make sure there's somebody

00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:04,520
dedicated to talking to new people that

00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:05,600
don't just say rtfm or get out you want

00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:08,270
to make sure that you engage with these

00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:10,580
people and bring them along slowly and

00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:12,980
have lots of small tasks they make it

00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:15,290
easy to get to bite off bigger chunks of

00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:19,600
the project that's my best quick tldr

00:51:15,290 --> 00:51:21,690
answer that question other questions

00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:21,690
you

00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:46,859
so it's really easy to go from

00:51:44,190 --> 00:51:50,190
permissive copyleft it's difficult to go

00:51:46,859 --> 00:51:51,330
from copyleft too permissive and I'm not

00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:53,220
a lawyer and that's a better question

00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:56,250
for people who are experts in this sort

00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:59,150
of thing but generally the answer is you

00:51:56,250 --> 00:52:03,930
have like imagine it's a timeline right

00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:05,670
so here you are if you want to switch

00:52:03,930 --> 00:52:09,660
your license we're going to do this

00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:11,820
really quick so everyone who's ever

00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:14,280
committed to a project any contribution

00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:15,540
no matter how small you need that

00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:19,290
person's consent if you're going to

00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:20,880
switch the license so many projects will

00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:22,590
have a contributors license agreement

00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:25,290
that says when you contribute to this

00:52:22,590 --> 00:52:26,970
project you agree to these terms or you

00:52:25,290 --> 00:52:28,890
assign your copyrights this overarching

00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:30,660
entity so like a good examples of Python

00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:32,730
Software Foundation if you want to

00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:35,070
commit code to the Python programming

00:52:32,730 --> 00:52:37,050
language when you do that you sign an

00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:38,820
agreement that says I agree that I'm

00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:41,790
signing my code up underneath this

00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:43,680
license and that the Python Software

00:52:41,790 --> 00:52:45,210
Foundation if they choose in the future

00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:49,380
to change the license they have my

00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:52,080
permission to do that on my behalf lots

00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:54,570
of big software projects do it in fedora

00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:55,920
I think the way ours works says you can

00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:58,260
use any of this list of approved

00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:00,540
licenses which is mostly OSI licenses

00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:02,700
with a few others and if you don't

00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:07,470
specify a license at defaults to the MIT

00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:08,940
permissive so if you have say three

00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:11,609
people in a project and you want to

00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:12,780
switch from GPL too permissive you need

00:53:11,609 --> 00:53:14,460
all three of those people's permission

00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:17,010
to do it if you have a hundred people

00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:19,680
you need one hundred percent of that 100

00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:20,910
people to switch it so it's something to

00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:23,609
think about in the beginning of your

00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:26,670
project is what license to pick because

00:53:23,609 --> 00:53:27,840
afterwards untangling that and finding

00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:31,250
people as they disappear into the

00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:31,250
internet is a difficult thing to do

00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:39,170
right so I think again not a lawyer if

00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:42,200
you're going to have a permissive

00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:43,910
version then the open GPL version needs

00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:45,380
to stay here and it depends on how much

00:53:43,910 --> 00:53:48,920
of it you're basing your other project

00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:50,570
off of again this is a technical very

00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:52,430
complicated legal question that you need

00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:54,350
real software lawyers to answer it's

00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:56,500
easy to go this way it's hard to go that

00:53:54,350 --> 00:53:56,500
way

00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:12,110
ok

00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:30,040
right well here we get into like what is

00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:31,780
the software is the metadata about how

00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:33,550
the software change the software is that

00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:37,390
the source code or is it the source code

00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:39,400
itself right and it gets crazier when

00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:42,670
you think about containers and images

00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:44,830
and snapshots and again there's a bunch

00:54:42,670 --> 00:54:48,070
of layers to this stuff that you need to

00:54:44,830 --> 00:54:50,950
be fluent in the law and the law isn't

00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:53,440
even fluent in tech in most cases enough

00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:54,760
to really make as informed decisions on

00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:57,760
this as I would like which is why I

00:54:54,760 --> 00:55:01,690
preach technological literacy to the nth

00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:03,340
degree I really wish everyone would do a

00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:05,740
little bit of programming I love

00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:07,600
code.org for what they do they're trying

00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:09,220
to bring computer science education to

00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:11,950
everyone not necessarily one's gonna be

00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:13,840
a computer scientist but you know and

00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:15,580
with it I hope licensing comes along so

00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:16,840
that eventually the lawyers who do this

00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:18,130
stuff have enough of a computer

00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:19,570
background where they can make the

00:55:18,130 --> 00:55:22,390
decisions about how that stuff works

00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:24,400
because hey man that's a great question

00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:31,300
and if you have questions like that if

00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:39,720
you send an email to license at FSF org

00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:43,510
or help at sflc dot org these are two

00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:45,970
nonprofit legal organizations who's here

00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:47,650
to help open source projects figure out

00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:51,840
these kinds of questions there's also

00:55:47,650 --> 00:55:51,840
the software freedom Conservancy

00:55:55,340 --> 00:56:02,410
who can similarly help and there's also

00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:02,410
software in the public interest

00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:07,040
hopefully someone else is writing this

00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:12,170
down in a much less chicken scratch in

00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:14,060
kind of a way great and a number of

00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:15,830
other umbrella organizations that will

00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:17,540
provide legal and organizational

00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:19,430
administrative support for open source

00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:22,700
projects so that you can spend your time

00:56:19,430 --> 00:56:24,500
coding and not doing paperwork check

00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:27,080
them out they're very good and they'll

00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:31,550
usually answer questions like that over

00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:33,080
the email privately we're getting really

00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:39,050
close i can probably take one more

00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:42,670
question any takers going once going

00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:42,670
twice okay

00:56:48,890 --> 00:56:51,460
huh

00:56:53,799 --> 00:56:58,189
thank goodness i have not right i have

00:56:56,779 --> 00:57:01,150
not been to court over software stuff

00:56:58,189 --> 00:57:01,150
before I've

00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:13,520
so questions of software patents google

00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:16,750
v oracle is going to the supreme court

00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:19,069
right now talk about copyright of AP is

00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:22,730
bilski is a very important software

00:57:19,069 --> 00:57:25,250
patent case vmware is being sued in

00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:29,410
germany right now over GPL violations of

00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:35,000
their kernel or alleged i should say

00:57:29,410 --> 00:57:38,720
this stuff does go to court and mostly

00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,829
round patents which are a different

00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:41,480
thing than what we talked about today

00:57:39,829 --> 00:57:44,119
and i am would need a whole nother hour

00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:45,589
at least to even go into that part of it

00:57:44,119 --> 00:57:48,680
let alone trademarks and some other

00:57:45,589 --> 00:57:49,940
stuff any last me two questions i'm sure

00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:53,390
there's somebody else that needs to be

00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:55,339
presenting here any minute or not if

00:57:53,390 --> 00:58:03,800
there's no one else after i will stay

00:57:55,339 --> 00:58:08,210
until people's questions are done great

00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:14,869
so we have a sorting hat type of an app

00:58:08,210 --> 00:58:19,700
called what can I do for fedora dot org

00:58:14,869 --> 00:58:23,569
and it's kind of like a choose your own

00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:26,720
adventure style website where it says I

00:58:23,569 --> 00:58:28,490
like design yes or no I like coding yes

00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:29,810
or no and you answer more and more

00:58:28,490 --> 00:58:32,000
questions and drill down farther and

00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:34,220
farther until eventually you land in a

00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:37,369
place where it might be interesting for

00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:39,470
you as a contributor site is very useful

00:58:37,369 --> 00:58:41,540
to get general interest and information

00:58:39,470 --> 00:58:46,450
if you really are interested oak

00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:50,089
question what can I do for fedora org

00:58:46,450 --> 00:58:53,300
yep there are also these onboarding

00:58:50,089 --> 00:58:54,890
ramps that I was talking about I work on

00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:58,069
a team in flora called the community

00:58:54,890 --> 00:59:02,569
operations team and the IRC channel that

00:58:58,069 --> 00:59:05,180
we hang out in is Fedora com ops which

00:59:02,569 --> 00:59:08,569
is short for community operations but or

00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:11,119
a dash com ops on freenode so if you

00:59:08,569 --> 00:59:13,220
join IRC I'm d cause you can find me in

00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:16,550
there and I'm happy to help walk you

00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:20,290
through verbally and figure out Fedora

00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:23,500
dash com ops comm

00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:25,810
oh PS we also have a mailing list you

00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:37,750
can join com ops that list that for do

00:59:25,810 --> 00:59:39,130
our project org mm oh PS yes Fedora dash

00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:40,270
join is another one where people are

00:59:39,130 --> 00:59:42,280
waiting to help on board new

00:59:40,270 --> 00:59:45,100
contributors to I would also recommend

00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:46,630
open hatch as another general place to

00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:48,550
get help about fedora questions too

00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:52,360
there are a lot of Fedora people there

00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:58,540
to other questions from the etherpad or

00:59:52,360 --> 01:00:04,450
elsewhere we good alright so I'll end

00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:09,000
with like a few things one it is a very

01:00:04,450 --> 01:00:11,890
exciting time to be a developer really

01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:18,430
software is eating the world there's no

01:00:11,890 --> 01:00:21,880
question about it and understanding what

01:00:18,430 --> 01:00:25,930
you own for the things that you create

01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:27,990
is crucial to your freedom your personal

01:00:25,930 --> 01:00:31,810
individual freedom financially

01:00:27,990 --> 01:00:36,220
intellectually and otherwise this stuff

01:00:31,810 --> 01:00:37,870
is dense it's confusing sometimes the

01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:39,610
good news is just like all the other

01:00:37,870 --> 01:00:41,590
parts of open-source there are a lot of

01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:43,540
really smart people who figured out a

01:00:41,590 --> 01:00:45,640
bunch of this stuff already and luckily

01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:47,680
we can stand on the shoulders of giants

01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:50,520
and pick some of these OSI approved

01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:52,570
licenses and trust for the most part

01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:55,990
that they are going to work the way that

01:00:52,570 --> 01:00:58,600
we think they are so check out TL DR

01:00:55,990 --> 01:01:02,080
legal for like a full inventory of all

01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:03,370
the ones you can also look at the

01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:06,520
websites for the software freedom

01:01:03,370 --> 01:01:11,110
Conservancy the open source org all of

01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:12,760
the other licensing and legal resources

01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:15,330
that were listed here they're great for

01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:15,330
that kind of stuff

01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:23,620
but outside of the licensing questions

01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:28,230
it's going to get really weird you know

01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:31,000
we are we're looking at things like

01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:34,960
cryptocurrency right now and consensus

01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:37,480
based AI right so there's a court case

01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:40,720
an art gallery in Sweden or somebody

01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:43,600
wrote software that would write software

01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:46,780
that would buy things off of the Silk

01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:48,640
Road and then they would put him on

01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:51,790
display in an art gallery and it turned

01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:53,110
out that like some fake passports and a

01:01:51,790 --> 01:01:55,570
bunch of drugs showed up on the doorstep

01:01:53,110 --> 01:01:58,300
and they put it up in the gallery and

01:01:55,570 --> 01:02:01,060
the Swedish government as soon as the

01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:04,000
gallery was done came in and they wanted

01:02:01,060 --> 01:02:06,580
to arrest somebody so who you arrest you

01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:10,810
rest the author of the code you arrest

01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:14,130
the person who was at the front of the

01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:16,690
gallery putting on the show is the AI

01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:18,820
arrest able is the computer that was on

01:02:16,690 --> 01:02:21,880
because it be confiscated right what

01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:25,090
about autonomous organizations that buy

01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:26,860
and sell other organizations with crypto

01:02:25,090 --> 01:02:31,420
currency that's anonymous that you can't

01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:34,540
trace who owns it who's liable what if

01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:36,490
it's AI that creates new corporations

01:02:34,540 --> 01:02:40,900
and there's no humans even involved in

01:02:36,490 --> 01:02:42,960
it all of a sudden this licensing stuff

01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:46,060
that seems very far removed from reality

01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:47,310
becomes really important in figuring out

01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:49,570
the questions of governance

01:02:47,310 --> 01:02:52,420
constitutional freedom all kinds of

01:02:49,570 --> 01:02:54,940
stuff that we haven't even started to

01:02:52,420 --> 01:03:00,040
look at yet so if you're interested in

01:02:54,940 --> 01:03:02,350
politics check out code one of my

01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:04,830
favorite books is code and other laws of

01:03:02,350 --> 01:03:10,050
cyberspace by Lawrence Lessig and

01:03:04,830 --> 01:03:10,050
basically the moral of that story

01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:20,860
that's a capital C promulgation and

01:03:18,250 --> 01:03:25,930
decollete promulgation and declarative

01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:28,300
syntax are the same thing aka big c code

01:03:25,930 --> 01:03:31,810
talking about what the law is out loud

01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:36,190
and instantiating the rules that govern

01:03:31,810 --> 01:03:38,200
people is becoming the same thing as the

01:03:36,190 --> 01:03:40,090
software that people use on the voting

01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:42,940
machines and the things that they use to

01:03:40,090 --> 01:03:47,530
access the court documents you all have

01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:50,640
an immense immense ability to affect the

01:03:47,530 --> 01:03:52,750
world around us and it is my hope that

01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:54,880
with this great power comes great

01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:57,610
responsibility and that you will use

01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:59,110
your powers for good and as long as you

01:03:57,610 --> 01:04:00,970
are willing to release your stuff under

01:03:59,110 --> 01:04:02,620
free and open licenses and participate

01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:05,320
in this community of practice that

01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:08,050
raises all boats with the tide there are

01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:10,300
folks like me and others who are here to

01:04:08,050 --> 01:04:11,590
help you so as long as you want to use

01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:14,650
your powers for good and you want to

01:04:11,590 --> 01:04:16,300
pick some license here and do open

01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:17,830
source development I want to help you do

01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:19,240
that I want to help you do that here at

01:04:17,830 --> 01:04:21,220
this hackathon and I want to help you do

01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:23,350
that outside of this hackathon because

01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:26,050
this is raising the digital standard of

01:04:23,350 --> 01:04:29,470
living for everyone I'm an activist

01:04:26,050 --> 01:04:32,950
right I'm not here just because I like

01:04:29,470 --> 01:04:34,360
to do computer stuff I'm doing the thing

01:04:32,950 --> 01:04:37,750
that I think will make the most

01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:40,450
difference before I'm gone and that's

01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:43,720
why I really like that forever free

01:04:40,450 --> 01:04:46,000
Claus and I think that's where I want to

01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:48,160
end it you can come find me at the booth

01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,080
I will be here for at least another two

01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:52,090
hours or so I'm happy to answer any

01:04:50,080 --> 01:05:00,790
questions you can get a hold of me addy

01:04:52,090 --> 01:05:06,940
cause at fedora project org to cause it

01:05:00,790 --> 01:05:09,750
red hat will also find me and I see one

01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:09,750
more question in the back

01:05:17,509 --> 01:05:20,349
ok

01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:24,780
you

01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:42,780
security through obscurity google it ask

01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:45,240
bruce schneier what he thinks about

01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:47,790
hiding the security flaws to see if they

01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:49,950
don't exist it's like pretending there's

01:05:47,790 --> 01:05:51,540
not a hole in the fence if you put a

01:05:49,950 --> 01:05:54,329
blanket over it no one will know it's

01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:56,790
there the only way to know that the

01:05:54,329 --> 01:06:00,059
holes aren't there is to fix them and to

01:05:56,790 --> 01:06:02,339
tell people where they are I mean you

01:06:00,059 --> 01:06:05,309
know that I'm obviously a little biased

01:06:02,339 --> 01:06:07,170
but security through obscurity is not an

01:06:05,309 --> 01:06:08,910
effective model for protecting people

01:06:07,170 --> 01:06:10,470
when critical infrastructure is in place

01:06:08,910 --> 01:06:12,089
I don't know about the stuff with the

01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:14,579
operating systems and China and all that

01:06:12,089 --> 01:06:16,619
I know that Korea has their own linux

01:06:14,579 --> 01:06:18,329
based OS right and there are other

01:06:16,619 --> 01:06:22,020
countries that have national os's as

01:06:18,329 --> 01:06:24,420
well this is wild stuff wild stuff very

01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:27,599
interesting so if you're going to go out

01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:29,970
there and use your powers use them for

01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:32,160
good and if I can help you I really

01:06:29,970 --> 01:06:35,900
would like to do so thank you all and

01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:35,900
