hi everybody i'm matthew Miller I'm the

00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:11,980
Fedora project leader and we're doing

00:00:08,769 --> 00:00:14,740
virtual summit from here my backyard in

00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:16,570
Somerville Massachusetts my daughter is

00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,910
serving as the camera person here it's

00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:20,529
gonna interview me for a few questions

00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:22,720
kind of like if somebody came up at the

00:00:20,529 --> 00:00:24,670
fedora booth that summit and talked to

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,240
me about something here's what I'd say

00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:32,950
um that's our dog Tia she's an important

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:36,220
part of this interview as well okay okay

00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:38,170
what is fedora fedora is a project where

00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:40,030
we work together to build an operating

00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:42,190
system or make it easy for other people

00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:45,490
to build operating systems that solve

00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:47,160
problems for their users so we work on

00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:49,690
collecting a bunch of software that

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,640
developed in the open source world out

00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:53,410
there in the environment and we put it

00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,330
into packages and we put those packages

00:00:53,410 --> 00:01:02,080
into convenient ways for users to

00:00:55,330 --> 00:01:04,299
consume so that includes a bunch of

00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,670
others as well but our KDE plasma

00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:09,009
desktop and other things the different

00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:11,140
people in the project work on desktop

00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:13,990
environments to users it also means

00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:15,609
fedora IOT I think we may be coming up

00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:17,109
with a fancy name for that but as of the

00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:20,020
time of this recording it is called

00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:22,719
fedora IOT and that's for edge computing

00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:25,060
and devices and all that kind of stuff

00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:29,740
so we have those kind of things and then

00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:31,929
also people we also have things like the

00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,520
Python classroom lab or the Python

00:01:31,929 --> 00:01:35,560
robotics lab which are basically

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,200
specialized operating systems made for

00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:40,030
those use cases for example I think it's

00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,909
been a while but the robotics lab was

00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:45,429
used to win World Cup robotic soccer for

00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:47,350
a while which is pretty exciting and the

00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:49,329
Python classroom lab is used to quickly

00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:52,719
set up a classroom for teaching that

00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:56,020
programming language so we have what's

00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:57,429
the goal of fedora the goal of fedora is

00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,020
I talked about this a little bit to make

00:01:57,429 --> 00:02:00,490
an operating system to make it easy for

00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,829
people to make an operating system but

00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:04,810
as specifically we want to do that in a

00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:06,130
community way or everybody can work

00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:10,330
together and we make something that we

00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:12,250
all own together so Red Hat sponsors the

00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:14,960
Fedora project but red doesn't really

00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:20,390
own the thing that is the community that

00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:23,480
immunity owns fedora the community owns

00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,470
fedora and it is a community project and

00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,820
that's kind of part of the part of the

00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,230
goal is to have this community

00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:30,260
involvement and make something that we

00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:32,930
together all work on and it's ours but

00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:35,690
nobody really owns it so that's that's

00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:39,020
Fedora how do Dora Red Hat Enterprise

00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:41,630
Linux and said to us all relate so yeah

00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:42,710
we've got a complicated ecosystem right

00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,990
where we've got Fedora

00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:47,060
which serves as the upstream project we

00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:49,460
are the place where all of these other

00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:52,220
little bits of software so Co systemd

00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:55,270
the Linux kernel tulip C programming

00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:58,010
languages applications the gnome desktop

00:02:55,270 --> 00:03:00,680
IOT stuff all that all comes together

00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:03,290
and we integrate it into one thing and

00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,030
then it flows from there to our other

00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:07,750
downstream operating systems and I

00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:10,280
talked about our admission being about

00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,960
making making them easy for people to

00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,510
make operating systems and so obviously

00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:17,480
our downstreams relat cent OS are an

00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:19,940
important part of that exciting thing

00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,850
we're doing now is sent to a stream so

00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:24,230
the idea is that fedora is this place

00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,580
where you can be engaged in the

00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:28,580
community it's a community owned

00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:31,570
distribution Santo a stream is something

00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:34,730
where red hat it is a red hat moderated

00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:37,460
operating system where things flow from

00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:39,320
fedora into into there and then red head

00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:41,120
engineers make the decision and it's

00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,610
done transparently in the open in an

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,920
open source way you can take patches you

00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:48,050
can contribute but ultimately red

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,450
engineering owns the decisions there and

00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:52,430
then ultimately red in an enterprise

00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:55,270
linux gives the product which is if you

00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:58,250
need the value add the red out ads which

00:03:55,270 --> 00:04:01,400
this conference virtually or in person

00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:03,260
will tell you a lot about if you need

00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:07,280
that which a lot of people do red hat

00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:08,000
provides that support what do you do in

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,630
the project

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,930
I am the Fedora project leader which

00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:16,609
means I joked when my kids were doing

00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:19,820
things for English class a couple years

00:04:16,609 --> 00:04:22,310
ago I write persuasive essays I listen

00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:24,050
to people and what I tried to do because

00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:26,150
it is a community project I'm not a

00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:28,820
dictator I can't tell anybody what to do

00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:30,800
I can't make orders and what I try to do

00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:32,510
find out how people could work better

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,210
together what people in the project are

00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:37,010
working on and how we can kind of move

00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:38,930
all in the same direction so we can get

00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,760
more done working together try to help

00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:43,520
the community work smoothly and I work

00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:46,220
with another number of other people the

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,080
day to day Marine Arden who's our Fedora

00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:51,560
Community Action an impact coordinator

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:54,440
the F cake who helps work on community

00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,820
building Ben Cotton's Program Manager he

00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,650
works on making sure that we actually

00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:00,410
stay on schedule and ship things on time

00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:02,840
and you know get our announcements when

00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:04,280
we need to and then other people in the

00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,050
fedora Council that's our leadership

00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,640
body we all work together but I work

00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,290
with all those people day to day and the

00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,880
rest of the community to make sure

00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:12,530
everything's going smoothly and in a

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,450
good direction and you know we have a

00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:17,450
strategy and we execute on that kind of

00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:20,000
thing what kind of people were confident

00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:22,640
oh so many different people all around

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,260
the world so it's about it's kind of

00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,180
hard to estimate because that's such a

00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:28,520
wide project and because you know

00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:30,830
there's nobody on the payroll but about

00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,960
4,000 people work on flora to some

00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:36,260
degree every year and maybe two to three

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,900
hundred people are the core constituency

00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:42,380
of the project and that's web designers

00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:43,940
that's writers that's some programmers a

00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:48,700
lot of people doing packaging that's

00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:51,170
this integration work Quality Assurance

00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:53,390
and then kind of the task to get the

00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:55,100
distro out so lots of people doing lots

00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:56,390
of different jobs all around the world

00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,600
in different parts of the world South

00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:01,940
America India other parts of Asia North

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,830
America Europe Czech Republic is where

00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:05,930
we have read as a big office there so we

00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:08,930
have kind of a big following but also

00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:11,210
other parts of Europe so it's a global

00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:13,220
project and a lot of people contribute

00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:14,030
in lots of different awesome ways to

00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:17,750
different areas

00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:19,640
is there any exciting fedora news yes we

00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:22,250
actually have a bunch of exciting things

00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:24,260
going on one thing the fedora IOT

00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:26,900
edition is launching so this is going to

00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:29,870
be our premier solution for running on

00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:32,540
small devices not not tiny like sensor

00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:35,930
level devices but home gateways or also

00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:41,060
even out in the world in industry

00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:41,400
gateway devices that can be used for you

00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,780
know

00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,610
nation control and those kind of things

00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:46,889
and that's I'm going to be the upstream

00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:50,400
for something a Red Hat product that is

00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:54,000
I think rel core OS edge is going to be

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,860
the product and so Fedora IOT serves as

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,550
the innovation engine for that so that's

00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:02,070
pretty awesome also our friends over at

00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:04,590
Lenovo the laptop people are shipping

00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:06,930
some laptops with Fedora pre-installed

00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:09,210
on it which is awesome Fedora is

00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:11,610
available from some small places which

00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:15,330
are also exciting cool and I appreciate

00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:18,660
them but it is just really neat to see

00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:20,910
it being shipped out of the box on a you

00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,680
know major laptop vendor and the people

00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:24,419
at Lenovo but awesome to work with

00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,430
they're very excited about doing this in

00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:28,500
an open-source way this isn't some sort

00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:30,900
of modified half proprietary operating

00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:33,620
system this is the real purified or

00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:36,750
workstation coming to you from Lenovo so

00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,099
that's really exciting I think there's

00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,509
some of those people are around here at

00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:42,080
this virtual summit you could talk to

00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:42,080
