Publication date: 2015-08-26
Playlist: Flock 2015
Description: 
	Want to be effective remotely? That doesn't mean you work all the extra hours not spent in a car. But with so much of the world out of one's control, and always moving quickly, how does one cope? Just like the ninja, one must be a master of both oneself and one's arsenal. It's a combination of focus, prioritization, tools, and awareness. This presentation is about bringing these factors together to achieve an added measure of enlightenment and success as a remote ninja.
