Title: Flock 2015 - Remote 忍術 (Ninjutsu) - Paul Frields
Publication date: 2015-08-26
Playlist: Flock 2015
Description: 
	Want to be effective remotely? That doesn't mean you work all the extra hours not spent in a car. But with so much of the world out of one's control, and always moving quickly, how does one cope? Just like the ninja, one must be a master of both oneself and one's arsenal. It's a combination of focus, prioritization, tools, and awareness. This presentation is about bringing these factors together to achieve an added measure of enlightenment and success as a remote ninja.

alright welcome everybody I'm Paul

00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:11,580
fields and I'm a manager at Red Hat I

00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:15,360
managed the Fedora engineering team of

00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:18,119
whom I see several members here which I

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,160
was saying 20 really on I can't tell

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:21,990
whether to be amused or horrified by

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,930
that because these folks really know how

00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:27,060
to get it done early so I've learned

00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,529
something by working with them I've

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,080
learned something from working in fedora

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:33,960
before I join red hat and dumb and also

00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,329
I owe a debt of gratitude to John Paul

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,420
Stroh is a good friend of mine and

00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:41,700
probably one of the best effectiveness

00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,860
gurus that I've ever met I've never met

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,420
anybody who's more devoted to like

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,820
figuring out not only how to help

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,070
himself work smarter and better but also

00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,050
to help other people and I what what

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:55,280
little that I've picked up over my years

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:57,449
on a red hat a lot of that came from him

00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,629
so I'm going to try this new office

00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:03,840
remote we're going to see how it works

00:00:59,629 --> 00:01:05,549
awesome um so so i have a question i

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,530
guess i'll just look for show hands for

00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:10,110
these things on how many of you have

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:13,260
trouble staying focused during your

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:15,600
workday at home a lot of people so on

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,189
and i'm not looking for strategies for

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,110
productivity write you one of you want

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:20,970
to make more value in a day and that's

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,500
really what it's all about it's not

00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:26,250
necessarily just about being able to

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:28,590
produce for our employer right but also

00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,840
for our cells right when we're more

00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:33,140
productive when you're doing good work

00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,500
and you know you've created good value

00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,570
how would you say that makes you feel

00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,950
much better I so when you get done for

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,630
the day and you know you've had a great

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,520
day I don't know hopefully most of you

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:46,590
are like me your cycle i rocked it today

00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,899
and then you know you can go and

00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,020
completely enjoy yourself in your

00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:52,119
downtime because you

00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:54,579
no we're not worried about how am I

00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:56,590
going to make up for what I didn't do

00:01:54,579 --> 00:01:58,509
today tomorrow right and instead you're

00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:00,460
thinking man I really kick butt and I

00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:02,229
hope I can keep that up tomorrow right

00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:05,560
now I'm going to enjoy this other time

00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:07,899
of my life so yeah so I'm kind of talk

00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,280
about some of those things here the main

00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:11,260
thing that I want to get across the

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,450
folks here and I'm not going to be able

00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:16,599
to cover obviously every strategy that

00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:18,280
exists but I'm going to try and cover a

00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:20,920
few things that I think are important

00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,329
and the rationale behind them and I'm

00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,069
going to leave some time at the end so

00:02:22,329 --> 00:02:25,959
we can maybe talk about your tips right

00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:28,810
because it's not all about what I do I

00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:30,400
realize that my approach works for me it

00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,349
may not work for everybody you may not

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,579
work for some of you at all or you do

00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:35,980
have to kind of find your own way but

00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:39,880
you want to understand why and what

00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:42,370
you're trying to do for for me that he

00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:45,370
really is that you focus on your

00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:47,500
approach to working remotely your

00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:50,079
approach to being productive it's not

00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,780
necessarily about a tool and that isn't

00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:55,750
to say that tools aren't important right

00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:58,660
but the thing about a tool is it's not

00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:00,549
going to solve your productivity issues

00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:02,980
because the fact because of the fact

00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:05,350
that it exists right it's only being in

00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:07,900
being able to use it and being able to

00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:11,019
be mindful without abusing it all right

00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:13,780
so what you have to do in order to

00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:16,329
really maximize your productivity is

00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:19,900
commit to changing your mindset right

00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:21,810
you have to really be mindful about what

00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,190
your viewing during the day and

00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:25,560
and be mindful about what you're doing

00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:27,690
during an hour and be mindful what

00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,580
you're doing sometimes minute to minute

00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:32,190
especially when things are very

00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:34,440
distracting um and this is not

00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:36,420
dissimilar from fitness now now I you

00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,190
know obviously i'm not a paragon of

00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:42,300
fitness no one's ever going to mistake

00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:46,650
me for you know Clive Owen or you know

00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:48,269
or Josh Moyer I guess but but but I you

00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:51,420
know one of the things that I that I

00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:53,040
found came from my trying to be more

00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,600
mindful that for activity was also being

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,910
more mindful about myself upon her body

00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:59,239
and so you know there was a period of

00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:01,049
time where I lost about 40 pounds

00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:03,060
actually I lost a little more than that

00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:04,650
but a little bit of his crept back and

00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,720
trying to get a handle on that so it's

00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:09,299
always a battle but I found that the

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:13,110
mindset was the most important thing

00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:14,340
rights to to stop thinking about my self

00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:16,859
negatively and about what I could

00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,540
accomplish negatively instead starting

00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:20,760
to embrace just positive things right

00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,229
and little things one at a time and if

00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,479
you do that for productivity that will

00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:26,310
work for you to write it's not to say

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,780
that it that it's not a struggle it's a

00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:29,910
struggle for me also to be productive

00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,410
day to day sometimes can be very

00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:34,350
difficult when things are distracting

00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:36,270
but you take each hour and each day as

00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:38,840
it comes and realize that if you didn't

00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:41,340
do the best job an hour ago or yesterday

00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,470
every single hour every single day is

00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,150
another chance to turn it around that's

00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:46,740
a great thing about productivity you can

00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:49,760
always do better and even if you fail

00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:52,770
before you can get it right next time

00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,000
okay so why would you want to do this

00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:57,330
now I'm going to I'm going to steal a

00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,080
little bit here from from franklin covey

00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:03,120
because i feel like they explain why you

00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,680
would want to embrace productivity why

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,240
you would want to think about the things

00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,760
that you're doing day to day instead of

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,510
just acting like a conveyor belt for

00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,680
tasks and so the way they do this is by

00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:15,449
graphing basically

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,550
kind of things that happen over course

00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:19,770
the day the kind of issues or situations

00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:21,780
that arise that you have to deal with

00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:23,880
and this goes for everybody it doesn't

00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,949
matter whether you're a fry cook at

00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,620
McDonald's or you're a knowledge worker

00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:30,270
or you're a senior executive somewhere

00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:33,030
or whether you're a business owner all

00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:34,740
of these things apply equally right and

00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:36,509
so the way this graph words is basically

00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:40,320
to think about these four quadrants in

00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:41,400
terms of importance and urgency and

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,259
remember that those are two very

00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,270
different things something can be very

00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:49,080
important but it may not be urgent that

00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:51,570
you get it done right away so here are

00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,099
some examples so I'm going to want to

00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:54,990
talk about what these things are so

00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:57,900
something that's not important in not

00:05:54,990 --> 00:06:00,410
urgent typically this is trivia right

00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,820
busy work it's it's stuff that you're

00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:04,380
basically wasting their time on who has

00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:07,110
of some examples of things that might be

00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:08,430
wasting their time work is work Facebook

00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:10,919
and Twitter those are the excellent

00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:13,410
examples unless of course your primary

00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:15,360
job right is as a social media maven it

00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:19,020
might be important then but for most of

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,930
us it's not so they both expense report

00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:24,090
seeing I actually I would I would tend

00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:25,590
to disagree with expense reports I wish

00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:27,479
I would typical that important because

00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:28,860
you don't want to pay for those expenses

00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:32,520
but I would also say it's not urgent

00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:33,810
that you do it right now right I but but

00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,570
that's I think that was a great point

00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:40,650
thanks Lance maybe was maybe meeting

00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:43,560
this ago it's also meetings in there too

00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,820
yeah absolutely all right I'm so an

00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,389
example of something that's not

00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:50,039
important but is urgent right what kind

00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:52,590
of thing to be not important but it's

00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:55,259
urgent what about when somebody comes by

00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:56,320
your desk and like does it drive by

00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:58,300
meeting that you were

00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:01,210
they have because you're in the middle

00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:03,250
of something else an interruption I what

00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:04,690
I call the SCP right someone else's

00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,100
problem right it's someone else's

00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:08,080
problem they brought it to you because

00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:10,570
they really just don't want to handle it

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,790
they want to give it to you and I know

00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:15,010
we have at least one other manager in

00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:17,350
here and i'm sure you know the harvard

00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:19,080
monkeys right somebody's already is

00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:22,240
always trying to give you their monkeys

00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:24,790
as a but it's not just as a manager if

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,610
you can lead anything at all this can

00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:29,590
happen as well and so meetings right

00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:32,260
someone urgently needs to meet with you

00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:34,360
but it's they may think they need to

00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:36,370
urgently be with you but it may not be

00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,320
that urgent for you right what it may

00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:39,670
mean is I haven't really figured out

00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,050
what to do here and rather than writing

00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:43,180
an email it's a lot easier for me to

00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:45,580
come grab 30 minutes of your time now

00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:47,830
that may be disastrous for you because

00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:51,700
you're in a zone and you know you just

00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:54,430
got popped out of it pastries in the

00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:56,320
kitchen yes urgency a virtual that you

00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:58,720
get the pastries the waiters here maybe

00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:03,160
not important though right especially

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:05,440
your maid definitely not important okay

00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:07,600
what about things that are very

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,000
important and very urgent those are

00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:12,280
these are emergencies right true

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,050
emergencies these are things that really

00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,910
are your job to handle something

00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:18,520
critical came up what's a good example

00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:20,320
of this anybody oh my dear something's

00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:24,130
on fire in the infrastructure security

00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:26,080
problem right you didn't plan it it came

00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:27,700
up urgently right but it's very

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,840
important that you handle it when it

00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:33,930
says something with a real short

00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,930
deadline ok any other examples

00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:38,900
on and finally there are these things

00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:40,729
that are important and not urgent right

00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:43,250
things that it really is important to do

00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:45,530
their have very high value but they

00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:51,040
don't need to be done right now what do

00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:52,940
a lot of us do with those things we do

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,010
procrastinate right we put them off

00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:59,030
right what happens when you put things

00:08:55,010 --> 00:09:00,890
like that off too long yeah they can

00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:03,380
become urgent exactly they can they can

00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:04,760
easily move into this next quarter other

00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:06,860
things that have that they can wither on

00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,990
the vine right so some of the things

00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:10,570
that are examples very strategy and

00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:12,380
planning but this isn't just about

00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:14,840
strategy of what you're doing a word

00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:17,750
think about planning your family

00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:19,700
vacation right I would say that that's

00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,930
important but not urgent it's important

00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:23,660
to your family that you spend some time

00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:26,360
with them and do something fun over the

00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:27,620
summer or week but it's easy to put that

00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,570
off because you have so many other

00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:31,580
things going on right we all say that to

00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,900
ourselves sometimes well there's so much

00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:35,390
going on right now I really can't think

00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:36,860
about this and you may be right right

00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:38,780
this is not to say that you're not if

00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,100
you're not absolutely right what I'm I

00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:43,120
guess what up the pitch that I'm making

00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:47,210
is that making time that is important

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:50,240
relationships I think of all kinds both

00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:52,310
at work at home your spouse or

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,220
significant other your kids your parents

00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:57,440
relatives friends those are all

00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:59,120
important to write not urgent because

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,090
most of those people are not intruding

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:05,360
on your work day but if you don't deal

00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:07,610
with those relationships and instead put

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,410
it always put it off till tomorrow bad

00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:11,090
things happen right I mean not to get

00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:13,100
too you know goofy or sentimental about

00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:14,720
it but you know no one ever died on

00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:17,310
their hospital then and said I wish I'd

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,340
spent more time at the office

00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:23,310
that never happens well they get just

00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:26,700
but that person be very sad and lonely

00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:28,230
so I don't want to be that person so

00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,420
what do you do with these things Wilfred

00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,950
again for these trivial things avoid

00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:34,380
them these are things that you want to

00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:36,990
avoid things that are not important but

00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:38,820
are urging right those are things where

00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:40,350
somebody else is kind of creating an

00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,060
issue for you that's not important to

00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:44,610
you but it's urgent maybe only to them

00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:46,980
you want to limit those you can't always

00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:48,240
stop those right like and I'm going to

00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,770
I'm going to pick on Denny since she's

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,300
here right if Denise comes to me with

00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:53,160
something that you know is really

00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,660
important because you know maybe her her

00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,430
manager or some other manager came to

00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,890
her and she has something to give to me

00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:00,779
and I'm not saying this has happened

00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:03,390
when I don't make a career limiting move

00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:04,800
here my presentation but you know Denise

00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:06,720
making me something and for me it may

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,730
not be giving up the urgent so I'm going

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,279
to try and limit those things so I will

00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:13,350
you know try and do them as I can right

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,700
but you know not every single thing that

00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:18,360
comes around it's going to take my

00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:20,339
attention right now important or I'm

00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,140
sorry important urgent things these are

00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:24,000
things that you need to manage right and

00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:26,760
it doesn't mean that you don't do them

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,860
right you may be personally involved in

00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,210
actually handle is what you have to

00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,700
manage them in other words you have to

00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:34,350
see what needs to be done right now and

00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,850
separate that from the things that need

00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:38,700
to be done maybe a little further out to

00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:40,170
handle that crisis and some of it is

00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,820
going to be working with your team

00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:43,740
working with other people that you know

00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,120
working with other contributors all

00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,800
right to make sure that they get handled

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,420
but it doesn't necessarily mean you knew

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,670
every single piece of yourself and

00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,950
finally the things that are important

00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:53,600
not urgent diesel

00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:56,470
term things the things that are really

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:59,180
give value to your life and to your work

00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:03,290
are the things that you want to focus on

00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:04,490
and make sure you have time sears and i

00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,930
have some examples the great thing is

00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:07,130
you guys kind of called out a lot of

00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:08,840
these which is very like you know

00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:10,940
Facebook down here in the trivia pile

00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,290
where I am I'm reorganizing files how

00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:15,530
many people like have you ever gone here

00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:16,670
like your folders in your in your system

00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:19,340
are just like oh my god this is a

00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:20,540
god-awful mess and how am I ever going

00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,980
to like I don't know how I'm going to

00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,390
find documents so you start spending

00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:26,180
time shifting diggers won't let this go

00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:29,090
there I have done that once Orleans it's

00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:32,480
the worst so not important to write All

00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:34,430
Hands QA right can probably go I can

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,790
probably go watch the video of that

00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:40,280
later by their sure phone call from mom

00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:42,080
right I this is a joke right some of

00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:45,140
your calls from Bombay be very important

00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:47,000
right so we all of them but you know

00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:49,010
your mom may call you with something

00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,900
that she thinks is really urgent it not

00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:54,380
be like what am I going to make for your

00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:55,940
party this Saturday but you know that's

00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:57,920
a really good question but I can call

00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:59,540
you at six tonight and we can talk about

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,180
it then but right now I'm like in the

00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:04,400
middle of a crisis so I'll get back with

00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:06,800
you and one of those crises might be

00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:09,110
like you know outages sick kid at school

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,940
there that's important energy that the

00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:14,090
manager but these important not urgent

00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:16,340
things again this is where you want to

00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:18,470
spend more of your time if you want to

00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:20,420
feel good about what you're doing things

00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:22,250
like you're making a career plan where

00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:25,010
do I want to be in a year or two years

00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:26,900
or five years from now on how am I going

00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:28,400
to architect this project what what are

00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:30,080
the long what are the long-term goals

00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,060
for this project how am I going to road

00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,690
map this out so that we actually have a

00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:36,060
chance of completing

00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:37,260
on time Who am I going to involve I'm

00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:39,750
thinking about big things like that

00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:41,940
hacking I'd also say hacking whatever it

00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,380
is that you're hacking is important not

00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:45,330
urgent that's where you get in your zone

00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:47,730
and you're really working on something

00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:49,950
that you that you needed to complete

00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:51,240
right but it's very easy to put off

00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:53,550
because you have other things going on

00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:56,010
the crises so this and that's where you

00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:58,710
really in that zone so this if you if

00:13:56,010 --> 00:14:00,360
you want to be productive then one of

00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:02,670
the things that you would want to do is

00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:05,220
try and maximize the time you spend here

00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:07,380
in this focus area this area of

00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:09,630
important things that are not urgent but

00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:11,280
the more of them you get done the more

00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:16,080
everything else in your life will fall

00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:18,600
in place all right so how can we

00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:20,970
increase that focus well to me it's

00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,440
three things managing your time managing

00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:24,030
your environment and managing your

00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:28,470
attention those are the things that it

00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:31,080
worked for me on these these these areas

00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:32,910
do bleed into each other a bit right

00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,320
like you might say well is it managing

00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:36,180
my attention with only managing my time

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,860
well I think of that a little

00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:40,560
differently I think about managing time

00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:43,860
is like actually managing time itself as

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,660
a resource on whereas managing

00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:48,120
environment is sort of managing those

00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,950
things that are external to you that

00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,260
affect how you deal with that time and

00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:54,120
managing your attention is managing

00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:57,210
what's internal to you yeah managing

00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:59,340
your mindset so that so that you can

00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:02,400
increase the effectiveness of those time

00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:04,170
rocks does that make sense

00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,490
alright so if everybody buys into that

00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:10,620
hopefully the rest of this is going to

00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:14,070
make sense so managing your time just

00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:15,660
check my time so one of the things you

00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:18,590
can do to manage your time is think

00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:20,670
about when you get your best daily focus

00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:23,490
when's the time of you best flip this

00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:25,710
over them don't move the boat over to 10

00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:28,020
minutes after you wake up you're on this

00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:29,940
era time does is it the same all day or

00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:33,750
do you have and fully years of the month

00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:35,970
I'm done 40 so what I really was saying

00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:38,340
is i am going to work 40 minutes in a

00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:41,280
day and then I can do all nothing but my

00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:43,620
best work right right now that doesn't

00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:45,840
mean that but yeah there but there are

00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:47,700
those periods right um it's sick John

00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,680
what about you work what's when's your

00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:52,550
best time to focus during the day when

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,550
you find you getting this

00:15:55,390 --> 00:16:01,560
yeah yeah

00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,560
I had the

00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:14,690
yeah yeah so so eleven o'clock but but

00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,940
so that interesting for you that's also

00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:18,500
kind of early in the day right or would

00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:20,720
be early in your day if you could make

00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,940
it that way right not for those pesky

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:26,690
meetings you know and a lot of people

00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:28,850
actually answer very similarly you know

00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:31,700
morning times are good times I think

00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:33,380
that more more often than not people say

00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:36,070
that some of their low times are after

00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:38,630
lunch for usually a couple hours and

00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:42,590
usually a bit of a resurgence towards

00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:44,660
the evening interestingly these are also

00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:46,850
the times where we are at least that

00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:48,590
those those high energy times are the

00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:50,870
times where we are less likely to come

00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:52,820
in contact with other people interesting

00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:54,560
right because you get in and their first

00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:56,510
thing is you can kind of figure out what

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,030
you're doing when are you going to sign

00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:00,260
on you know to IRC what are you going to

00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:01,970
you know pull your email or something

00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:03,890
you can make those decisions or in the

00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:05,660
morning as things happen during the day

00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:08,089
you get drawn into stuff that we didn't

00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:09,410
plan necessarily but still you need to

00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:11,510
spend time on if you to spend your

00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:13,459
attention on but it's harder than to get

00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:14,990
your internal focus because you're

00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:18,260
really been thinking about things that

00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:22,550
you're doing for or on behalf of or with

00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:24,650
other people okay but thinking about

00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:27,260
when you have your best your best focus

00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:28,610
is important because that's the time you

00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:30,410
know again we're talking about managing

00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:33,230
time that's when you want to set aside

00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:36,560
some blocks of time to do these you know

00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:39,110
get this this this golden this golden

00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:41,030
quarter to write this golden area of

00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:43,040
focus you want to do that during the

00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:45,350
time that's best for you I actually

00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:47,380
start work pretty early usually a lot i

00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:50,110
think a lot earlier than then people

00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:52,840
zone or you know or in this field line

00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:54,850
field and starting early like that helps

00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:57,940
me because I can get an hour or two

00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:59,770
hours out of the day we're really no one

00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:02,080
is sending anything out yet they're kind

00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:03,430
of still linking my loving and that's a

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,770
great time for me productive

00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:08,260
unfortunately like John it's also not my

00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:10,060
favorite way to live I would I would

00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:12,310
love to actually start later i'm not a

00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:14,440
morning person either by i found that

00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:18,010
that that what I can get out of it helps

00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:20,760
me so great although like John early

00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:23,650
morning meetings sometimes make that um

00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:25,600
so but but again the idea here is that

00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:27,600
you want to set aside some time it makes

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,250
sense for you for that focus work and

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,800
when you set aside time it's not

00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:34,800
necessarily about taking an hour every

00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:37,780
day to think about your career right

00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:40,990
because inevitably that becomes wasteful

00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:42,700
or it can become it can easily turn to

00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:44,290
well I'm just not sure what's happening

00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:47,290
today it's very easy that to become a

00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:48,100
little bit self defeat sorry uh it's

00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:51,280
very easy for that to become

00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:53,680
self-defeating so really when it comes

00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,300
to very long term plans you're not

00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:57,310
talking thinking about an hour per day

00:18:55,300 --> 00:19:00,010
that you guys spend on this but it might

00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:01,960
be an hour a week or an hour or a couple

00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:03,940
hours every month that you want to think

00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,260
about long-term plans right if I'm

00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:08,170
thinking about what I need to get done

00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:10,080
this quarter at Red Hat I'm usually

00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:13,000
going to spend an hour or so a month

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,890
seeing how I did look and maybe not all

00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,450
at once but spread out over a few weeks

00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:19,510
to see how things are coming together

00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:21,910
right and over in over a year I may

00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:25,720
spend a few hours every year thinking

00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:27,570
about it's my long-term plan for you

00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:30,100
know our finances at

00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:33,159
you know what what are we going to do

00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:34,929
about you know handling college for my

00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:38,470
dog for my oldest daughter things like

00:19:34,929 --> 00:19:40,059
that each day I'm going to spend a few

00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:42,100
minutes thinking about what are the

00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:43,929
things that I absolutely must that I

00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:46,119
absolutely have to get done today in

00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:48,850
order to feel like I created great value

00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:51,039
and I'll map those things out and by

00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:53,499
doing that it gives me a little bit of a

00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:55,210
road map for the day right and then when

00:19:53,499 --> 00:19:56,470
I have those things crossed off at the

00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:58,570
end of the day because I was mindful

00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:00,940
about it I feel what a better about my

00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:03,879
work right doesn't always happen though

00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:05,470
right I'm unsuccessful at that more you

00:20:03,879 --> 00:20:08,169
know more often than I probably want to

00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:11,019
admit but having a plan means that i can

00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:12,940
at least judge how i did and not say i'm

00:20:11,019 --> 00:20:15,609
not sure how well i did today I'm not

00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:18,159
sure I focused on at least I know I can

00:20:15,609 --> 00:20:20,559
think about what I did it be successful

00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:23,559
or when I failed that right try and do

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:25,090
better tomorrow so one way it is is you

00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:27,759
know managed by a sprint period you know

00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:30,070
you might in order to focus better you

00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:32,049
might chop up your time into several

00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:33,879
one-hour periods or maybe 30 minute

00:20:32,049 --> 00:20:35,619
periods or whatever works for you some

00:20:33,879 --> 00:20:38,769
jobs that may not be possible you may be

00:20:35,619 --> 00:20:40,779
do you know either either splitting the

00:20:38,769 --> 00:20:42,309
day up like that may not be possible or

00:20:40,779 --> 00:20:44,769
you know you may need to find a time

00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:47,679
slice that's different depending on what

00:20:44,769 --> 00:20:51,220
your what kind of granularity your focus

00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:53,769
needs to come in so how do you do this

00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:55,960
how do you manage the time well for one

00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:57,940
thing you have to have a calendar if you

00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:00,580
don't keep a calendar you're going to be

00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:04,359
a true so you have to keep a calendar

00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:06,639
and best case scenario have one calendar

00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:08,710
having one calendar for work one

00:21:06,639 --> 00:21:11,440
calendar for home life one calendar that

00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:13,720
you know your kids are on does not work

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,539
right at least it doesn't for me because

00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:18,549
you're never going to be able to easily

00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:20,649
make commitments to people without

00:21:18,549 --> 00:21:23,080
having to check a lot of things at once

00:21:20,649 --> 00:21:25,419
and it means that it takes you more time

00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,380
to figure out whether you can commit to

00:21:25,419 --> 00:21:30,580
something

00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:32,890
that that uncertainty can make you less

00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:34,570
sure of your own effectiveness right so

00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:37,510
being able to manage everything in one

00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:39,040
place really that's all I also refer

00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:41,410
believer that some people call this

00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:44,860
cheating and I think that that's asinine

00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:47,890
I think the absolutely makes sense to

00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:51,400
block and pre-scheduled time to do focus

00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:53,410
work so for example friday after well

00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:57,190
now i'm going to spoil my secret here

00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:58,870
but friday afternoon I block for hours

00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,250
in the afternoon every Friday alright

00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:02,410
it's not because I want to slip off the

00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:06,250
pub and have an early beer it's because

00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:08,980
huh that's right that's what I and I

00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:12,370
fully I fully support you and I'm all

00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:14,520
for beer um but for me what i've found

00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:17,590
is that over those that four hour period

00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:19,780
that is the time period we're more often

00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:22,060
than not i found that people were coming

00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:24,070
to me with those not important but

00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:26,440
urgent things that they're trying to

00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:28,900
offload so that they can have a weekend

00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,160
for your worrying about them my job is

00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:32,350
not for them to have a worry free

00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:34,990
weekend my job is to get my job done and

00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:37,060
do it well and hopefully i have a worry

00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:39,340
free weekend right and you know and if

00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:40,960
it's if it's again if it's not urgent

00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,580
for me to handle and I know that it's

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:46,330
not urgent I don't it can wait till

00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:48,730
Monday so on so I like to block that

00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:50,650
time and I use that for things that I

00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:52,570
kept that I have to focus on him for one

00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:55,240
thing I can use it to clean up if I

00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:57,610
didn't have a great week I now have some

00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,110
time I can recover right and if I'm

00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:01,270
doing a good job if I've had a great

00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:02,650
week often I'll remove the block and say

00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:05,230
okay if somebody's going to call me

00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:06,820
today and really need my attention I can

00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:10,650
do that in good conscience because I was

00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:10,650
really productive last videos yeah

00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:24,200
I'm sorry Oh what do you do if you get

00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:26,809
if you get a call yeah yeah well so

00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:29,299
there are ways of that so you know you

00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:31,880
talk about taking a call right and as a

00:23:29,299 --> 00:23:33,260
remote person I do have the option of

00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,630
picking up or not picking up the phone

00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:37,580
right and it does depend on who it is

00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:39,500
like I'm not going to lie i mean if

00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:42,020
Denise calls me directly i'm picking up

00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:47,000

00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:48,830
other hand well know you're always

camera copy on the other hand if it's uh

you know rock group i might not pick up

00:23:55,910 --> 00:24:00,860
the phone necessarily it depends on

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,660
what's going on right if we're if we're

00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:04,100
on a short deadline and you know

00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:05,870
someone's calling from a product team I

00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:07,309
certainly want to take that call on the

00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:09,590
other hand if I'm getting you know if

00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:11,840
it's somebody that I have never spoken

00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:13,429
to I can't really identify who it is on

00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,950
the caller ID and like I don't know what

00:24:13,429 --> 00:24:17,270
that person isn't why they'd be calling

00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:19,160
chances are I won't pick it up right

00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:20,330
announced it on stick be working on what

00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:23,570
I'm working on because I know that

00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:25,280
they'll send me an email or yeah

00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:26,750
absolutely because I well the other

00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,940
thing is as you build relationships

00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:31,630
where I you know how much someone you

00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:34,280
know how well someone values your time

00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:36,530
right and this isn't I don't mean to

00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:38,570
sound like I place a higher value on my

00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:40,700
time or that my time somehow has more

00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:42,620
value than anyone elses to me it does

00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:44,870
but they may really have something

00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:46,850
important but as I get to know people

00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:48,320
right they know whether or not it's

00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:52,040
worth calling on a Friday afternoon a

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:54,140
handoff a monkey right so city s

00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,370
relationships absolutely affect it but

00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:57,380
you know this is one of those things

00:24:55,370 --> 00:25:00,230
that you can actually take charge of and

00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:03,290
and I and I admit it's hard to do it

00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:04,730
doesn't come easy but you do have the

00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:05,570
power to do this this is one of those

00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:10,130
things that you can

00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:12,260
that sorry I keep squeezing the the

00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:14,030
front here um also these pro maduro

00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:16,940
timers are really useful to is anybody

00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:18,140
use Pomodoro method for hacking yeah we

00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:20,150
want to explain that for people just

00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:22,400
since I'm tired of the acting actually

00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:24,530
you sound long time something for

00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:27,680
example talked about and you're trying

00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:30,650
to focus on the task of it doesn't come

00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:33,560
out and then after them you have like

00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:38,470
five days or gray and then another like

00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:41,330
hour window starts a family knows

00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:43,460
absolutely yeah so just so the camera

00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:45,500
will pick it up so yeah the explanation

00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:47,840
was perfect which is you basically are

00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:50,270
slicing up your your work period into

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,610
specific times and you sprint during

00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:54,050
that time towards an a specific goal at

00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:55,670
the end of that time you take a short

00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:57,350
break and then you come back again and

00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:59,480
it's sort of enforced you can actually

00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:01,820
get a plug-in or I'm sorry an extension

00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:04,580
for no three that it's a it's a pomodoro

00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:07,040
timer and it will actually it will

00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:08,660
actually lock your screen so you have

00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,880
not take any more keyboard input so you

00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:13,190
can get up and go take a break so in

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,020
forces that screwed mentalities it's not

00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:16,490
useful I don't really do this a lot but

00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:19,940
I've heard other people tell me that

00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:22,370
it's useful alright so that was time

00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:23,780
environment on how do you manage the

00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:26,210
environment what distractions do you

00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:28,430
have I find that if I uh if I have a

00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:30,290
clean desk and a clean desktop on my

00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:31,760
computer I work so much better because

00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:35,180
I'm not thinking about what that thing

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,770
is why it's here so and I feel like a

00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:38,600
physical desk doing this with your

00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:40,640
physical does come how many people would

00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:45,830
agree with this statement when my desk

00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:47,480
is clean I feel like I'm awesome I feel

00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:48,650
like that and if that's not just say

00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,730
that my desk is clean all the time if

00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:52,650
you went to my office right now you

00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:54,690
would cringe it's my office faces it

00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:56,100
right now but I also know that once I

00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:58,200
clean that up when I clean that up after

00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:00,300
I return it's going to be great I'm

00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,760
going to feel great about that so it's

00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:04,590
it's a great way to keep a simple and

00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,420
clean work environment really really

00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:09,660
helps your your focus because you're not

00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:12,990
being distracted by things and this goes

00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:15,150
for a first sound too right if your

00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:17,310
remote you have the hopefully have the

00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:18,600
option may be to control sound in your

00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:19,770
environment you might do that in a

00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:23,010
number of ways you might do it by

00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:24,600
playing music that helps you focus you

00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:26,340
might do it by not playing music because

00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,260
you like silence you might do it by

00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:30,120
wearing noise canceling headphones if

00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:32,460
you're in a shared environment or if

00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,930
you're in a coffee shop right you put

00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:35,550
those on it allows you to isolate a

00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:37,440
little bit of that if that helps you you

00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:40,140
need to find what works well for you

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,870
what I found works for me and you know

00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:44,790
this is this is just me I i do not work

00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:46,770
well in silence because what I find is

00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:48,420
that when I guess when something makes a

00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:51,000
sound around me and it could be my wife

00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:52,950
coming downstairs it could be one of the

00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,050
kids tromping across the floor it could

00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:57,450
be a lawn mow er starting up next door

00:27:55,050 --> 00:28:00,350
that sound really breaks me out of my

00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:02,670
out of my zone so I cover it up with

00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:04,770
music that has no words and usually

00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:07,230
music that I'm unfamiliar with and that

00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:08,580
way I can't start you know humming along

00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:10,560
way that are saying because I know it

00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:12,480
well and you know it works for me is

00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:14,040
like a pravas ation of jazz order

00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,510
soundscapes or something like that where

00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:17,190
I don't know what's happening it just

00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:20,940
kind of covers up mine

00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:25,770
that silence that's just modified houses

00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:28,500
wonderful playlist in focus Spotify is

00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:30,870
so Spotify deep focus playlist yeah i

00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:33,000
i'm actually i'm using google music now

00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:34,680
for that too they have their radio

00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,110
stations and so I started to discover a

00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:38,730
lot of things that are working but yeah

00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:41,010
I find a playlist that you like things

00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:42,570
that you um alright so what are some

00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,890
tools to manage your environment well I

00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:45,900
covered with a little bit of this

00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:47,310
already which is you know have a desktop

00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:49,020
without icons this is what I love about

00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:50,400
the note 3 is I can't put anything on

00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:52,170
the desktop anymore i know that was

00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,080
something that they originally took away

00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:56,580
but it's been great for me because it

00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,500
now i don't think about things that are

00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:01,020
sitting on my desk topping or it's only

00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:02,910
there a hold what I'm working I put away

00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:04,710
windows i'm not using i keep a

00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:06,300
wastebasket in my office so i don't have

00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:09,060
to get up and break out of my zone to

00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:11,010
throw something away i turn off

00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:13,080
notifications if I really need to focus

00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:15,870
right I have a notifier so and somebody

00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:17,640
pings me online on IRC I'll see it if I

00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:20,010
really need to focus for a little while

00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:22,590
I'll turn that off right and that way I

00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:24,270
can't be in a local oh because you know

00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:27,000
again there are a number of ways people

00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:29,550
can find me like you know I'm a term

00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,990
iirc no fire all but my phone is on it I

00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:32,550
know if somebody reaches out for me by

00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:34,980
cell phone it's going to be important

00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:36,690
because most you know let's let's be

00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:39,480
honest most of us are out the door of

00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:41,700
red hat the IT sector don't pick up a

00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:44,639
phone to call me more

00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:48,240
just you know engage lightly and so if

00:29:44,639 --> 00:29:50,029
somebody calls me I know it's wrong so

00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,340
again use silence music or Noize

00:29:50,029 --> 00:29:54,990
whatever works for you so finally there

00:29:53,340 --> 00:30:00,090
is managing attention this is that of

00:29:54,990 --> 00:30:03,120
that inner inner peace p IEC inner

00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:06,649
factor and hopefully there's also inner

00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:09,149
peace inner penis come through handle

00:30:06,649 --> 00:30:12,000
the most difficult part of managing your

00:30:09,149 --> 00:30:13,950
attention is being mindful like edits

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,529
and it's about reaching this balance

00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:19,919
between being mindful of what you're

00:30:16,529 --> 00:30:21,630
doing and not continually going to a

00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,010
metal level where you're questioning

00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:25,710
constantly what you're doing because

00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:27,360
that can interrupt you just as much as

00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:29,880
not being mindful at all so it's about

00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,139
striking that balance running knowing

00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,149
what you're doing of why and then being

00:30:31,139 --> 00:30:38,580
able to let it go and get in the flow

00:30:33,149 --> 00:30:41,820
and do it I'm taking an inventory I what

00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:44,549
helped me a lot was for two weeks and

00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:47,429
this was probably the after i worked at

00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:49,950
Red Hat for about six months I realized

00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:52,169
I didn't feel like I was getting as much

00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:53,909
done as I was capable of and so what I

00:30:52,169 --> 00:30:57,240
started doing is for two weeks i tracked

00:30:53,909 --> 00:30:59,250
my time and so if I got done checking

00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:01,529
email for example I would write down at

00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:04,590
this point I finished checking email and

00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:05,510
then I did this with a Apple I didn't

00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:07,610
wouldn't happen with that

00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:09,590
you know who called hamster and I was

00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:11,090
tracking my time with that and then at

00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:13,250
the end of a few weeks I went back and

00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:15,590
looked at it and saw how my time was

00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:17,930
being spent and I was shocked to find

00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:20,900
out how much time I was wasting for

00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:22,610
example checking email right it was a go

00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:24,320
to was very easy to go pull email

00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:26,720
instead of working on this you know

00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,980
important but not urgent thing I would

00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,420
go reading though because it was a way

00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:32,420
of procrastinating was a way of not

00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:35,360
facing so I had to kind of admit that to

00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:37,310
myself and then realize okay I need to

00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,750
fix this I need to do better how how am

00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:42,010
I going to do that how am I going to Rio

00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:44,690
portion my time so that it works better

00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:46,220
contact switching if you have to switch

00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:48,440
context it takes you out of the zone

00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:50,780
right this is again you know when you

00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,880
have those drive-by meetings or you know

00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:54,320
or somebody walks by your cube or you

00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,550
know you get a phone call and hope

00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,680
you're working from home and you get a

00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:59,960
phone call from I don't know your

00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:02,410
landlord or the guy who comes and trim

00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:05,060
your bushes or something like that so

00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:06,620
managing managing your attention knowing

00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:11,450
what that context switching has been a

00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:13,280
cost you is important and finally avoid

00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:15,170
non related tasks during the course of

00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:17,210
this time so this again part of managing

00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:19,190
attention is taking responsibility for

00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:21,710
your attention it's taking

00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:22,850
responsibility for your mindset and if

00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:24,530
you're going to be concentrating on

00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:26,200
something really do it you have to

00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:28,550
really commit to it and that means

00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:30,620
knowing i am during the next 30 minutes

00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:32,270
i am not going to go check email i am

00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:34,100
not going to do these other things that

00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:35,390
could cost me you know time that i

00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,770
really want to be spending on this other

00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:39,770
thing and so sometimes that means

00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:41,690
putting off the maybe a quick you know

00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:43,880
quick hit are the little adrenaline

00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:46,100
vault door or the little you know the

00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,390
little parts want that you might get by

00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:50,119
going to facebook and saying how many

00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:51,379
people just like your post or something

00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:52,399
have to put that off in favor of

00:32:51,379 --> 00:32:56,959
something that's going to have more

00:32:52,399 --> 00:33:00,919
lasting value and you know again I this

00:32:56,959 --> 00:33:03,129
this this really it this whole idea of

00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:07,489
just to me a parallel so much the

00:33:03,129 --> 00:33:09,259
struggle that I go through for physical

00:33:07,489 --> 00:33:11,659
fitness and it's all without you know

00:33:09,259 --> 00:33:13,849
it's it's such a big analogy between

00:33:11,659 --> 00:33:15,919
this this mental fitness and the

00:33:13,849 --> 00:33:18,259
physical fitness and again it's not that

00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,779
I do a great job of it but I really do

00:33:18,259 --> 00:33:22,399
try and I think other people can speak

00:33:20,779 --> 00:33:24,319
to the problems that they've had their

00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:26,719
doing that and think about bringing that

00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:29,119
same kind of idea to how you're mindful

00:33:26,719 --> 00:33:31,159
about what you're doing so again it's

00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:34,849
not about doing a perfect job it's not

00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:36,319
each day trying to do a good job okay so

00:33:34,849 --> 00:33:38,179
what are some tools that you can use to

00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:39,979
help manage your attention this is

00:33:38,179 --> 00:33:42,199
difficult because the only attend this

00:33:39,979 --> 00:33:44,629
attention this mindfulness is really

00:33:42,199 --> 00:33:46,249
from from eternal but there are tools

00:33:44,629 --> 00:33:49,189
that you can get that will allow you to

00:33:46,249 --> 00:33:51,469
express your mindfulness and track it

00:33:49,189 --> 00:33:53,149
and and what's important is not that you

00:33:51,469 --> 00:33:54,829
are mindful yesterday but that you have

00:33:53,149 --> 00:33:57,379
the ability to prove to yourself that

00:33:54,829 --> 00:34:00,079
you were mindful right it's giving

00:33:57,379 --> 00:34:01,999
yourself the evidence to know that you

00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:03,739
did a good job and that will help boost

00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:07,099
your confidence and it will help get you

00:34:03,739 --> 00:34:09,139
on a treadmill of doing the wrong task

00:34:07,099 --> 00:34:12,230
and to-do list if you are existing

00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:14,659
without a to-do list a real really

00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:16,700
honest to-do list a task list if your

00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:18,169
existing without that there is no

00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:20,659
possible way to be fully productive

00:34:18,169 --> 00:34:22,669
because you have to be able to track

00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:24,510
what you've done in order to prove

00:34:22,669 --> 00:34:27,540
yourself that you're attaining

00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:29,310
term goals for short-term goals what I

00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:31,649
like to do is I'll take a piece of paper

00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:35,370
or a little you know no pad that I leave

00:34:31,649 --> 00:34:37,409
open on the one on one or the other body

00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:39,090
above my screens that tells me what my

00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:42,179
goals are for today some people really

00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:44,760
like to wipe those things down in a

00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:46,710
physical notepad that that's great you

00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,899
know use whatever tool works for you but

00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:51,720
have a short-term goal for a time period

00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:53,820
by the end it by the end of this hour or

00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:56,280
by lunchtime I'm going to have completed

00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:58,650
the following thing right poor things

00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:01,530
right and then that helps you focus how

00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:02,970
am i doing it's 1030 moon is coming I'm

00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:04,860
going to lunch at noon it means i have

00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:06,480
not even its left you'll be surprised

00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:10,170
with that adding time pressure yourself

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,490
will make you achieve all right and i

00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:13,230
was something I do on the computers i

00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:14,790
maximize the app that i'm using so i

00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:17,250
don't drift from place to place or look

00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:19,320
oh look I let that browser open with

00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:21,510
with facebook open maybe I should go

00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:23,430
close that oh oh it's on the screen

00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:25,230
maybe I should look at this you know

00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:27,780
it's real easy to fall into that trap on

00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:30,000
i just as bad as any wonder that so i

00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:34,830
tried maximize the app I'm using so that

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:37,620
I stay where I need to be or tap umm so

00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:40,080
so task list now I'm going to draw on

00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:42,900
some ideas here from David Allen who is

00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:44,880
a master at this and he he does simplify

00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:47,340
this a bit but it's a really good place

00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,260
to start thinking about things of things

00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:49,850
that you have to

00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:51,610
right for any task that you have

00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:53,900
anything that you're supposed to do

00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:55,700
there are three decisions that you can

00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:58,370
make with it you can defer it you can

00:35:55,700 --> 00:36:00,770
delegate it or you can do it all right

00:35:58,370 --> 00:36:03,080
and this is and so this is about getting

00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:05,750
those short-term things done so that you

00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:07,250
are achieving a more internal so if it's

00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:08,600
something that you're supposed to do you

00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:09,800
really need to do it well you're not

00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,300
gonna be able to do it a few minutes

00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:14,120
it's going to take much more time than

00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:16,340
you need to defer you defer that right

00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:17,870
the next thing is if you're not if

00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,010
you're not responsible for it or at

00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:21,170
least you're not responsible for the

00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:23,210
next thing you delegate it and delegate

00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:25,070
doesn't mean that you you know call

00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:27,290
someone who works for you and have them

00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:28,640
doing it might be that you're you're

00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:32,300
looking for something from a teammate

00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:33,680
but for Denise a but for other sometimes

00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:35,420
it doesn't necessarily work going oh

00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,830
yeah everybody not work but it may not

00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:39,470
work like Sam working on that vacation

00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:41,450
project and I need to know you know what

00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:42,890
is my wife where does she want go to she

00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:45,440
want to go to the beach or just you want

00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:47,690
to go to the mountains I can't I can't

00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:50,090
tell so she's responsible next step so

00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:51,440
I'm going to tell her you decide which

00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:52,730
of these do you want to do and then get

00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,520
back to me and then I'll take it from

00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:57,170
there to the next step right so that

00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,000
there would be an example of delegating

00:36:57,170 --> 00:37:01,250
right I'm not truly delegating there

00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:05,150
because of course I work for her and not

00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:06,410
vice versa finally if I'm responsible

00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:08,030
for the next step and it's only going to

00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:09,560
take me a few minutes to do what let's

00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:12,010
say five minutes or ten minutes what it

00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:13,740
makes sense do it just do it right now

00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:16,590
get it done

00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:18,840
right so that sounds are easy what is

00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:21,119
what do I mean by deferred do I mean put

00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:23,400
it off forever no that's not what defer

00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:25,500
me what it means is that if this is a

00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:27,119
big project you need some time to focus

00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,070
on it and complete it so you're going to

00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:31,140
look at it as one of those focused tasks

00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:32,880
it might be that you don't understand

00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,960
what to do next there in order to make

00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,600
progress so you're going to use that

00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:38,580
focused time to break it down and figure

00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:40,170
out what you do need to do next maybe

00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:42,210
some of it you're not really responsible

00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:44,310
for but if you don't know that it's

00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:47,280
going to sit in your box and wore your

00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:48,840
task list forever and no progress but if

00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:52,280
you break it down and figure out who is

00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:55,619
you can start to make some progress on

00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:57,540
and again this differing things this

00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:59,940
means that sometimes that that thing is

00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:01,770
going to fall into that golden not

00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:04,290
golden quadrant that golden quarter of

00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:06,660
being important but not urgent so you're

00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:09,450
going to spend focused time on it now

00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:11,460
and this isn't say that if something is

00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:14,430
a big project if it's a critical or an

00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:16,710
urgent thing it's it's actually okay to

00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:18,660
make an exception to defer it to make an

00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:20,609
exception of the deferral normally the

00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:21,750
defer thing is yeah I'm supposed to do

00:38:20,609 --> 00:38:23,880
this but it's going to take me more than

00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:25,560
a few minutes well obviously if it's

00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:28,500
critical if it's like the infrastructure

00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:30,119
breaks down you know I expect that Kevin

00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:32,160
fence is not going to go well it's

00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:33,750
kapron gonna take me 40 or 50 minutes to

00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,400
diagnose this so I'm just going to put

00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:38,700
them off because that's just too big lug

00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:39,930
beers yeah yeah beer is beer sounds so

00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,670
much better and it only takes me five

00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:44,520
minutes to drink a beer that's something

00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:46,109
I should do whereas 50 minutes to

00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:49,280
troubleshoot this I should defer that

00:38:46,109 --> 00:38:49,280
now you're

00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:54,410
exactly so yeah so it is ok obviously to

00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:56,600
make exceptions for this for this quick

00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:58,910
because I'm sorry to say but fortunately

00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:00,740
you well within reason you can't drink

00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:02,600
beer longer term sheet I'm not saying

00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:07,160
you should because I'm just saying it's

00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:08,570
physically possible to do it ok task us

00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,250
how do we get tools for this well

00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:12,230
they're all over the place a lot of

00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:14,300
people are into you know these card

00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:16,160
systems like trouble or Tyga or can

00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:18,890
board or whatever they whatever any

00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:20,630
those they're used for methods like ham

00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:22,400
ban and scrub and things like that but

00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:23,750
you can use them on a personal level as

00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,730
well you can get an app for your phone

00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:28,070
or whatever whatever strikes your fancy

00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:29,960
a lot of people on my team and I use

00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:32,210
this to task warrior which is a command

00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:34,820
line utility it's super super duper for

00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:36,740
keeping project and task list there's

00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:38,540
all sorts of cool things that like Ralph

00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:40,730
Dean has made all these little hooks

00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:42,230
that allow you to get your bugs and

00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:44,630
other things that just come into your

00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:46,700
task list so you can easily get get

00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:48,740
through things quickly there's even a

00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:50,630
there's an a synchronization server out

00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:52,700
there called in da a.m which allows you

00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:55,790
to get it on any mobile client and

00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:56,810
synchronize across multiple systems but

00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:58,520
you may not need something like that

00:39:56,810 --> 00:40:00,860
maybe you're looking for just a little

00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:02,990
scratch pad ever know or remember the

00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:04,310
milk or google keeper whatever you

00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:06,380
decide work for you might be as simple

00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:08,540
as a paper notebook yes thank you

00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:10,820
perfect pierre just held up a paper

00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:12,170
notebook you know paper no but if you're

00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:14,090
and if you want to get me a no real

00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:15,710
history would get like where's moleskine

00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:18,299
notebooks me talk about how it's got

00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:21,059
like an organic you know whatever

00:40:18,299 --> 00:40:25,829
skin of the immature dog on the outside

00:40:21,059 --> 00:40:28,259
never disley is that joke the naugahyde

00:40:25,829 --> 00:40:30,359
johansson references anyway yeah so

00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:34,619
anything from a paper up to something

00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:36,509
automated it works for you okay so we

00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:38,160
talked a lot about these tools now I'm

00:40:36,509 --> 00:40:39,929
going to shift gears just a little bit

00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,630
in the few minutes we have left oh wow

00:40:39,929 --> 00:40:44,279
really to talk about something that

00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:45,630
someone asked me about which is I'm

00:40:44,279 --> 00:40:47,849
remote and this is all great

00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:50,519
productivity stuff is great but how do I

00:40:47,849 --> 00:40:53,400
make sure that like as a remote person

00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:55,499
that I'm not just inwardly facing like

00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:57,059
how do I focus outward how do i how do I

00:40:55,499 --> 00:41:00,179
deal with the team these are some

00:40:57,059 --> 00:41:02,670
examples of building or no trust right

00:41:00,179 --> 00:41:04,170
building building your productivity is

00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:05,849
not just about what you can do it's also

00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:09,029
about what you can enable others to do

00:41:05,849 --> 00:41:10,739
or what you can help others with so the

00:41:09,029 --> 00:41:12,900
things that you the tools that you use

00:41:10,739 --> 00:41:14,759
here are not anything that is that's

00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:16,979
going to be a shock to anybody it's

00:41:14,759 --> 00:41:19,259
keeping up with them on showing interest

00:41:16,979 --> 00:41:21,599
and being interested in what people are

00:41:19,259 --> 00:41:23,249
doing it might be you know this doesn't

00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,989
happen necessarily on every team some

00:41:23,249 --> 00:41:26,910
teams like to do like a google video

00:41:24,989 --> 00:41:29,189
call they have regular communications

00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:32,130
channels and fedora we desire c for this

00:41:29,189 --> 00:41:33,359
on your manager if you're a remote guy

00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:35,160
if you're not having a regular

00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:36,839
one-on-one with your manager you're

00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:38,609
doing it wrong because they cannot

00:41:36,839 --> 00:41:40,259
possibly understand the value of

00:41:38,609 --> 00:41:43,230
doing when you don't have a chance to

00:41:40,259 --> 00:41:45,420
talk them so if your manager has put off

00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:49,259
doing that get them to schedule

00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:51,210
something let's see and also if you

00:41:49,259 --> 00:41:53,130
manage somebody you should be doing it

00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:55,259
for them as well so I guess I that one

00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:57,089
way is from you to your manager if you

00:41:55,259 --> 00:42:00,210
are a manager you should be doing this

00:41:57,089 --> 00:42:02,789
um communicate effectively and concisely

00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:06,170
if you're a remote person and you write

00:42:02,789 --> 00:42:10,349
enormous like 8 paragraph emails stop it

00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:12,930
stop it it's that is it's it's the worst

00:42:10,349 --> 00:42:15,269
thing ever for communication to at least

00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:16,680
to your manager right if your order to

00:42:15,269 --> 00:42:19,019
people on your team if you want to build

00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:20,880
remote trust you have to be concise lay

00:42:19,019 --> 00:42:23,730
out the problem oh sorry tonight wasn't

00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,440
a cell phone that wasn't meant to be

00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:27,299
personal and actually so funny thing is

00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,339
I used to write these really long emails

00:42:27,299 --> 00:42:31,019
i'm sure Denise you remember and I've

00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:32,999
gotten way better in the last few years

00:42:31,019 --> 00:42:34,970
because I realized I was not getting

00:42:32,999 --> 00:42:39,089
what I wanted out of the email which was

00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:41,339
attention and and and a response right

00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:42,779
that's what I want I want somebody to

00:42:41,339 --> 00:42:44,670
understand what I'm telling them and I

00:42:42,779 --> 00:42:46,999
want them to be able to respond so to do

00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:50,130
that I had to change my communication

00:42:46,999 --> 00:42:51,450
and finally whether you're a manager or

00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:53,460
whether your personal affording your

00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:55,289
manager deliver what you commit to if

00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:57,150
you say you're going to do something do

00:42:55,289 --> 00:42:59,009
it that's as simple as that if you're

00:42:57,150 --> 00:43:00,809
not getting done then figure out what's

00:42:59,009 --> 00:43:02,200
keeping you from them and maybe you need

00:43:00,809 --> 00:43:04,690
to discuss that with

00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:06,700
that that's a great way to talk you know

00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:09,810
to a manager well one and I've again

00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:11,980
experienced that from both sides now

00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:16,800
that sounds like a Joni Mitchell some

00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:16,800
doesn't it yeah absolutely go Denise

00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:27,130
perfect yeah perfect so just so the

00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:28,960
camera might picks it up Denise made the

00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:31,030
point that if you're not going to get it

00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,250
done it's okay to admit that just don't

00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:34,089
wait to the last minute to do that all

00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:36,280
right you don't want to wait until the

00:43:34,089 --> 00:43:39,420
devil on say I couldn't get it done if

00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,420
it's important yeah

00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:46,750
enough

00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:53,930
yeah there that's that's actually a

00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:55,970
really good point there's someone else's

00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:58,850
problems those can actually mean

00:43:55,970 --> 00:44:00,560
political capital or personal it can be

00:43:58,850 --> 00:44:02,600
building your personal brand right as

00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:04,400
somebody who can solve a problem so it's

00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:06,290
not the city you should never solve

00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,120
anyone's problems right the whole idea i

00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:09,350
think that was limit right like i said

00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:11,600
that the right way to handle those is

00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:12,950
limit in other words if that if handling

00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:14,810
that person's problem is going to be

00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:16,610
well it's going to be easy for you if

00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:18,590
it's not going to be easy but it has

00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:20,300
value for you or if you were trying to

00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:21,890
build that relationship or your personal

00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:23,570
brand with it absolutely need to do it

00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:25,280
on the other hand if you don't limit it

00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:27,530
you could end up solving everyone's

00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:30,290
problems except your attorney so there's

00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:31,670
there's a balance to be struck and I'm

00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:33,740
running a little bit over so I'm going

00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:35,360
to try and scoop is so the remote water

00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:38,090
cooler it's all about building

00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:39,950
relationships and and speak up if you're

00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:42,200
if you're were Lodi and you're not

00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:44,540
getting what you need let people know

00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:46,220
right don't be afraid to be the squeaky

00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:48,320
wheel because that's how has we're

00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:51,110
modi's we could be a ball and I say this

00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:53,750
as somebody who has you know is on the

00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:55,010
remote side so sometimes has to speak up

00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:57,020
and say how am I going to learn about

00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:58,850
this is there going to be a dialing are

00:44:57,020 --> 00:45:00,230
we you know are we having a video call

00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:02,510
for this because I'm not in the same

00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:04,790
place with some of these folks right but

00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:07,490
when you do that you prepare to really

00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:09,470
participate right if you make a big deal

00:45:07,490 --> 00:45:11,450
about going to a going to a remote like

00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:12,980
a remote call in and then you show up

00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:15,500
and you basically start your computer

00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:17,730
doing other things you're not building

00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:22,170
up trust that way so

00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:24,540
to do your authority is it so some

00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:26,670
resources getting things done by david

00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:29,160
allen well worth reading won't take you

00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:32,310
but a couple hours it's not about

00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:33,690
applying his method for beta but it will

00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:35,310
teach you about how to make their

00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:37,950
decisions about things and how you

00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:40,109
organize them time management for system

00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:42,300
administrators legendary but really good

00:45:40,109 --> 00:45:44,670
and it directly influences how people

00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:47,340
can work really well hi to you I got a

00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:48,660
thumbs-up from kevins and there are

00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:51,570
websites out there that are great work

00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:54,450
awesome calm is a fun one and finally

00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:56,270
here are some tips but I'm going to I'm

00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:58,380
going to steal three minutes just to see

00:45:56,270 --> 00:45:59,820
I'm going to grab like the first three

00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,650
people who put up a hand give you one

00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:06,840
tip that's helped you as a remote person

00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:08,880
anybody yes sir your work keep your

00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:10,770
workspace and your rest space completely

00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,450
distinct I absolutely agree with that I

00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:14,460
have a home office and it has a door

00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:15,869
that door closes when I'm done for the

00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:17,850
day and I spend all my time in the rest

00:46:15,869 --> 00:46:21,619
of the house so that is my office and

00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:26,100
when I leave the office on the phone yes

00:46:21,619 --> 00:46:28,080
sorry no if you can manage it don't put

00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:30,030
work email on your phone I would agree

00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:32,369
with that too because again I'm when I'm

00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:34,320
at work I can easily reach my email at

00:46:32,369 --> 00:46:35,940
all times when I'm gone from the house

00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:37,710
my phone is with me because I'm doing

00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:39,660
something before with my family or

00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:42,359
friends band or whatever the case may be

00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:44,070
if someone needs me they will call me if

00:46:42,359 --> 00:46:45,930
it's urgent they will call so they will

00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:47,910
be able to elbow elevate that from

00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:50,220
something that I need to handle it

00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:50,910
something too oh my god this is Bernie

00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:52,859
you have to

00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:56,670
let down right people will make that

00:46:52,859 --> 00:47:00,200

office even if it's in your house as if

00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:10,430
you're going to work dressed for the

00:47:08,329 --> 00:47:12,740
office like no bathrobe and fuzzy

00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:14,030

00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:18,710
mindset of being a being at work right

00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:20,000
than being in that professional context

00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:22,130
so it's about setting up that space

00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,630
excellent those are awesome tips I know

00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:27,349

00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:28,730
if you guys want to share them um you

00:47:27,349 --> 00:47:31,280
know I'm not sure exactly what you do

00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:33,530
just does anybody have an idea for like

00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:36,020
how we might went out to do that after

00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:37,430
this yeah I was just set up like a wiki

00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:39,290
page maybe on the Fedora wiki if you

00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:40,790
guys want to now let's call it like i

00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:43,130
guess i'm going to call our remote tips

00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:46,190
i'll set up a page for that abilities

00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:49,590
and i'll put it on me on the slack the

00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:51,290
URL on the slack day as far as you

00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:54,320
Janet's

00:47:51,290 --> 00:47:57,590
problem is don't forget acoustic

00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:59,540
patterns don't step and don't be afraid

00:47:57,590 --> 00:48:01,400
to step out in in other words it stopped

00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:03,590
being productive right now just don't

00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:08,900
forget okay because you still that you

00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:10,880
basically bring ya set up limits set up

00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:12,500
limits right everybody has days that

00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:15,080
they have to work longer than others it

00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:18,470
happens and that's okay but if you're

00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:20,120
doing it all the time chances are number

00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:21,530
one you're not it's because you're not

00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:23,870
making time for something that you

00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:26,090
should care of family friends whatever

00:48:23,870 --> 00:48:27,260
or number two you're not working

00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:28,580
effectively during the hours you have

00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:30,650
and you're trying to make up for it by

00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:32,480
working longer and I did that for like

00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:35,840
the first two years of right a door so

00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:37,880
you know sometimes mmm rice on the other

00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:41,290
times experience and need to stop

00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:41,290
working evenings even though

00:48:41,309 --> 00:48:49,640
yeah yes sir in which we are fun what we

00:48:44,739 --> 00:48:51,470
need to do service Indians nine my time

00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:53,299
yeah that's an excellent point if you

00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:55,579
work across with a team that is across

00:48:53,299 --> 00:48:57,160
many time zones you may feel pressured

00:48:55,579 --> 00:49:01,099
to be there more often than you should

00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:03,019
sonos I want to because all night you

00:49:01,099 --> 00:49:05,180
live them yeah I mean we don't we don't

00:49:03,019 --> 00:49:07,700
just run the night where I kind user

00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:09,260
yeah you work on it if you keep working

00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:10,549
on a team not necessarily just because

00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:12,680
you want the work but because you also

00:49:10,549 --> 00:49:14,089
liked the people there right most people

00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:15,650
will leave it's not because of the work

00:49:14,089 --> 00:49:17,960
it's usually because of the people often

00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:20,269
a manager but also can be co-workers and

00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:22,250
use and by the same you know turn that

00:49:20,269 --> 00:49:23,990
around people often stay because they

00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:25,190
love their co-workers sorry we do want

00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:27,470
each other because we build a

00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:28,460
relationship with each other and so you

00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:30,319
know you may feel what you feel

00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:31,880
obligated because that but everyone

00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:34,519
needs to realize that we all have limits

00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:36,740
and we all need our down time as well so

00:49:34,519 --> 00:49:38,480
ya think about again if you if you

00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:40,670
maximize your productivity during the

00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:42,829
time that you're there you can limit the

00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:45,980
amount of times they are you can limit

00:49:42,829 --> 00:49:48,440
the number of times or the or the the

00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:51,270
number of times you have to stay longer

00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:55,060
than you plan right hopefully not doing

00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:58,470
again work work smarter not harder all

00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:58,470
