Description: 
	You've heard of Kerberos, right? True single sign-on with lots of configuration, synchronization and pain. False. It is now easy to set up, has a long history of interoperation with Windows, and even supports OTP. Come learn about the significant improvements made to Kerberos in the last few years and catch a glimpse of where Kerberos will be in the future! We'll also talk software, frameworks, and language bindings that you can use today to call forth the three-headed guardian of the underworld, Kerberos.
