all right I just started recording so my

00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:11,759
name is Aaron i work for yahoo v-neck

00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:18,270
geographer more than what four years now

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:20,670
I I also contribute to a federal project

00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,830
and not that active anymore but then I

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,050
still send bug reports of these people

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:28,830
because I mostly work earning sellers

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:32,219
these days at the fo and I also work on

00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:33,480
the OpenStack team now so I do a little

00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:39,140
bit of contributions to OpenStack

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:42,300
project as well so this dock is about

00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:45,870
how to customize you know anaconda like

00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:50,550
add your own custom patches and how to

00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:52,559
rebuild anaconda for fedora I have done

00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:56,820
a couple of a lot of patches for

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:58,949
onaconda because one thing is like okay

00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,420
it is challenging to work on anaconda

00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:02,969
because the first thing you search on

00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:06,720
the internet for onaconda you get is

00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:08,580
this one so it's really a distracting

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,030
experience like you keep clicking this

00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,830
and then no it never goes away I don't

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:17,850
know whether the Anaconda does care

00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:25,440
experience the same thing but yeah it

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:27,930
happens so why we should a monotonic on

00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:30,210
a lot of people never even use an econo

00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:34,640
these days that they just use fed up to

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,640
upgrade their software and distribution

00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:40,530
so why so if you're building remixes so

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:43,050
you might want to replace the name of

00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:47,310
the installer with your own branding and

00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:49,200
own name and if you're adding new

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,990
package down a counter runtime so why we

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,420
need to do this so at yahoo so we have

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:57,180
like several 100 hundreds and thousands

00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,250
of service and most of the heart in a

00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,930
hardware comes with like four hard

00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,460
drives and most of them comes with more

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,800
than four car drives like you have

00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,270
multiple hard drives the moment you have

00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,630
multiple hard drives it comes with a

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:13,440
raid controller card and the raid

00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:16,350
controller kind of comes with its own

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,630
Trail utilities so the person the

00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:20,630
property the project that wants to

00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:24,840
deploy to this hardware they want the

00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:26,940
harder i configured so only way to do

00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,209
with anaconda right now is to either

00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:31,980
include that harder utility in the kind

00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:34,830
of run time so that they can run their

00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:36,600
whatever free scripts you know and

00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:38,489
configure the harder right in the way

00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:41,820
they want and then install the operating

00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:44,400
system so this is one of the things that

00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:46,650
we we can in our you can include your

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,540
custom utility in the Anaconda runtime

00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:52,980
where you want to do something in your

00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:57,420
post or pre scripts so I don't know why

00:02:52,980 --> 00:03:01,550
I this people can answer nunna kind of

00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,550
never added harder right support I mean

00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:16,090
yeah I mean so so maybe I should fight

00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:18,790
about yeah so hardware raid is really

00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:22,120
important because for us a person who

00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:24,700
works in a big environment because on a

00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,260
day we have like a normal day it's two

00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:29,830
hundred machines coming up and going

00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:31,720
down on a like a really active day you

00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:34,540
have like thousands of machines coming

00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:36,760
up and to engage in select new soft few

00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:39,430
you know product launch or something so

00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,890
you have thousand machines so every

00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:44,800
thousand machines has some person in the

00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:46,600
data center goes there manually rice it

00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,310
decayed and then somebody goes there and

00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:52,330
manually country is the slide with a

00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:55,030
special ram disk and its way I mean it's

00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:56,680
really time consuming like a week in a

00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:59,709
week in advance that particular person

00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:02,380
has to say ok I want right five on this

00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:04,270
you know this and then they go there and

00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:06,250
finally money modified this is like

00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:09,040
really really bad problem for us because

00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:11,110
it it makes like you need to prepare

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,760
ahead you know you cannot just go and

00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:18,280
deploy software with our continuing line

00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:20,380
so we needed some kind of you know they

00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:23,169
can the property themselves go and you

00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:25,450
know modify the kickstart file and do

00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:27,100
that if there is a if there is a way to

00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:29,229
do instead of script running strips if

00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,570
there's a way for in anaconda to do

00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:35,620
right configurations with like okay

00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:38,560
harder right put this on droid 5 and 10

00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,220
that'd be very useful for a company like

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,490
yeah

00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:44,890
we have seven thousand machines there is

00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:47,940
one another one is adding new features

00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:51,880
to on a camera so you might wanna so

00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:54,130
company like Yahoo sometimes we always

00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,440
some it play to point out bugs and some

00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:59,140
it to read that and focused on a country

00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:01,060
team but sometimes it takes a loop you

00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:03,100
know it takes a while before the bug fix

00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:05,740
to come in but we cannot wait around for

00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:11,380
that so we will time to time at practice

00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:15,070
to anaconda and you know push it out so

00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:18,460
this is where you add your own patches

00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:22,530
so that you'll be like ahead of what

00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:26,140
comes from my dad what comes from fedora

00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:28,270
another thing so one more thing this is

00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:31,540
going to do little buddy Yahoo we

00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:32,620
noticed is that when you have come come

00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,500
you know building thousand different

00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:38,140
machines most of the machines you know

00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:40,120
like the failure rate is like the

00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:42,790
failure team style is like let's say one

00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,370
person still it's like what one person a

00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:51,100
thousand eight hundred is 10 to 20

00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:56,200
machines um 18 machines yeah eighteen

00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:58,390
visions thanks so the person who's

00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,610
deploying the operator whose deployment

00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:02,350
plan has to actually go into console of

00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:04,720
this machine we do not use graphic user

00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:06,640
interface it's all text modes so the

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,310
person has to go into the graphical user

00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:11,260
interface look into the console into the

00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:12,910
tool server and figure out what the heck

00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:15,340
happened there whether it's a bad hard

00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:19,419
drive or something blown up it's really

00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:21,820
again a time-consuming shunt job so we

00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:24,250
are looking for something like okay the

00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:26,919
Anaconda when it starts installing so it

00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:29,530
starts the service but you curry from

00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:32,350
centralized dashboard well say okay wait

00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:35,110
fail what's the status of the current

00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:38,500
installation and some kind of a status

00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:39,870
API so there are other installers that

00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,310
do that right now

00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:46,080
are trying to add this feature anaconda

00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:47,430
but we might we might anything we might

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,170
implement it or we might use the other

00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:51,360
insular so there is an insulator like a

00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:53,250
witch does that so they have an API and

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,390
it keeps selling okay or what is

00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:57,000
happening in the machine whether it's

00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:59,790
you know formatting files file system

00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,710
our particular dry went down so that

00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:04,530
kind of status messages will be very

00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:05,910
useful for a datacenter use cases in

00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:09,990
this panna cotta I don't know what's

00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:11,790
keep thinking that's wrong what do you

00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:14,580
think is the right model the seniors of

00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:17,310
the nebula typically would honor of

00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:19,230
their prior flowers come this way

00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:22,260
version should pick up on like you got a

00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:25,800
requisition try this friend around you

00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:28,920
pulling one system manually a bigger

00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:33,110
away and it's a tasty server basically

00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:33,110
and you put your heart in here

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:41,950
every time your act something it sees it

00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:46,330
picks including immediately since an age

00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:48,520
about 40 mashina the agent runs I view

00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:50,800
my tool set schedule my password book it

00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:54,490
and now everything happens from the top

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,650
on I bi or whatever okay and so it can

00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:58,360
ask what never appreciate us was this

00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:01,630
status with that beta Centauri cult

00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:04,870
leader trust okay so basically big have

00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:06,580
a custom agent I mean yeah okay and then

00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:09,220
we can be reasonable or whatever and

00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:14,710
sort of consultant or whatever I mean

00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:18,720
after that okay which is a step above

00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:18,720
where a thon is involved right um

00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:25,280
yeah I mean something like installation

00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:30,260
locks yeah like how do you get

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:37,180
completely automated process Ram five

00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:39,440
mins later expunged one okay okay so

00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:41,060
these are some of the things that I mean

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,710
we can discuss about it like that but

00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:44,840
what how we can do something like a

00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:48,320
monitoring nothing of your installation

00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:51,400
status of all these things okay so what

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,930
are the tools people use normally to

00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,760
build anaconda so there are three tools

00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:59,600
we're going to use what you can use mark

00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:02,390
so Marcus you know is used for our team

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,210
building so if you want to build on a

00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:07,580
federal mission you know bill for l6 you

00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:10,880
will need a moxie route to build econo

00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:13,760
on that so we set up mark she wrote and

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,220
run our current there and then in case

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:19,820
of 6 used to use this tool gun building

00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:25,400
stuff you know a lot about it it's a

00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:27,080
shell script oh gosh so I you have to

00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:29,750
modify shell script if you on how to

00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,950
another package anything to this runtime

00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,900
you sell are you have to modify shell

00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:34,640
scripts so it's a totally building

00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:37,220
itself will will looking briefly about

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:43,160
it we want to focus on something a lower

00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:46,070
decks for sex so much yes I love exes

00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:48,560
nicer version of building style I it's I

00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:50,770
think six uses build insult when some

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,030
uses lower edge signal right ah and

00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:55,720
fedora if you're terrible horrible

00:09:53,030 --> 00:10:00,230
images for Federer you will be using

00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:02,840
lorex okay so this is important so um

00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:06,080
I'll be like switching between terminals

00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:08,240
it's not a demo I already built stage to

00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,740
squash AFER's outside because this

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,430
internet I cannot build anything right

00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:15,089
now so so this is like a mock

00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:18,240
configuration file so

00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:21,209
additional settings from attacked me I

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:24,949
wonder from an online I still wonder can

00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:24,949
I was not involved okay

00:10:26,329 --> 00:10:33,899
every time I happens yes sir basically

00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:36,660
we need enable binmen my moms too loose

00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:39,180
crashes images and and also some people

00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:40,889
what they do is they so mark every time

00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:43,559
claims the children survey what they do

00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:45,209
is they bind mom there are makanda are

00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:50,399
directories into the moxie road so that

00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:53,040
it doesn't clean anything so if you look

00:10:50,399 --> 00:11:00,449
at my I have a custom mark configuration

00:10:53,040 --> 00:11:04,399
file um I see mark flock yes I did you a

00:11:00,449 --> 00:11:08,699
mock configuration file flock 21 so

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:11,429
because the Apple composed some yellow

00:11:08,699 --> 00:11:16,829
stuff here and the important point one

00:11:11,429 --> 00:11:19,920
point is the line into a 10 to 13 so we

00:11:16,829 --> 00:11:23,550
have x amount enabled and we this mine

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:25,230
Bob BYE MOM Devon PP ascension so we we

00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:28,170
do not use the existing mark file so we

00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:29,670
created another one so that when when

00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:33,360
you are building rpms you don't really

00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:35,189
need all this now we also do some

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,290
Jenkins magic for you know Gator

00:11:35,189 --> 00:11:42,779
environment variable and pass it in this

00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:44,399
is something really yeah alright so so

00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:46,019
what are the installer comments so once

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,449
you build the building seller there are

00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:50,610
three components in installer like as

00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:53,069
usual the pixi kernel that you won't

00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:55,470
need and one other one is called ram

00:11:53,069 --> 00:11:57,439
disk so ran this anaconda is a big

00:11:55,470 --> 00:12:01,679
insular it's a two stages are as a

00:11:57,439 --> 00:12:05,639
ramdisk as your dracut stuff that

00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:07,350
actually prefers the stage to downloads

00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:09,779
the stage to downloads the kickstart

00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:12,049
file stage one and there is a stage to

00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:15,120
the stage to this is crash of this image

00:12:12,049 --> 00:12:15,840
that is in the in sultry so it's a

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,910
fleece

00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,500
each other so we'll be building on these

00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:21,780
three are will have been building but

00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:25,590
i'll be showing a hemlocks of the bills

00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:26,940
like what happens okay building style so

00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:30,450
what's the problem is a shell script

00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:36,750
let's look at building stuff what is

00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:44,520
that it will be a half shell yeah let's

00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:54,140
look at it like see how bad it is then i

00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:54,140
canna i had to work on this too yeah

00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:18,060
over here

00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:25,920
oh you did them last a lil Josie yeah

00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:31,790
get hold of you don't you now the more

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,790
or less number result

00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:51,620
or the other commands of Zagreb oh yeah

00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:55,420
ah demos I had to go into 13 so this is

00:13:51,620 --> 00:14:02,570
this the one comes with real Santa's

00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:05,450
scripts oh it's hard building stock okay

00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:07,910
so this is a building style I'm shell

00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:09,529
script actually that main building

00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:13,000
styles toughest everything is in

00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:15,410
something another sister just color up

00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:19,970
Institute so if you have to add a new

00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:27,339
package so you have to modify this

00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:27,339
transcript so construed

00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:40,820
it's hot yes okay I'm gonna sit here

00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:50,670
yeah so this is the that she'll sleep

00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:52,530
cause this one and it's almost the same

00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:57,450
as so if you look at this packages these

00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:59,340
are the stuff back it is after so if you

00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:01,470
want to have you back in whatever color

00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:04,950
and then you edit this thing and add

00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:06,810
this and make sure that you use the

00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:08,940
right build install to build this

00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:11,430
because I mean the building self there

00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:13,740
is a building sell outside and there is

00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:15,690
a built in distal part of anaconda so

00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:17,340
these are the set of packages that

00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:19,350
escapes insert in the trash offense

00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:25,170
images and then this is the place value

00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:27,510
added all right yeah that is the reason

00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:29,490
they created I mean I don't know what's

00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:31,860
the exactly is this the reason like is

00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:33,870
the every time you had two guys have to

00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:38,940
do a release you have to modify this is

00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:40,650
that or the reason bar lorex is that if

00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:43,210
you keep on bringing

00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:45,490
building start other than that there's a

00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:48,730
template on a terrifying terrifying

00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:50,680
Kodak you menya and in true it does

00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:52,960
things like try to figure out we tell ya

00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:55,750
says you need to have by guessing and

00:15:52,960 --> 00:16:01,020
entering through led with the finger

00:15:55,750 --> 00:16:03,580
make a group yeah doesn't that story not

00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:04,810
something thing and tried to sort them

00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:06,850
to fair make sure we got all right

00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:17,680
things in it but automatically break up

00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:19,990
the probe arms loose no no okay so so I

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:27,190
think it's certain when will good site

00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:29,080
looks human okay so you know so it's

00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:31,570
called that it's called the tree builder

00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:33,790
so basically it is used to generate the

00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:36,640
lack of your DVD tree in bed what do you

00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:42,010
see in federal DVD this is what the

00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:43,660
usage I hated so why Bill Gonzales hard

00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:47,680
to customize that's what I heard from

00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:50,200
Nayar see any places and lurex is Python

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,210
base and it was a system called template

00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:54,610
system so everything is set template so

00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:57,580
they have a template file I think it's

00:16:54,610 --> 00:17:00,300
the what what the temperature is a ninja

00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:00,300
it's something else

00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:07,280
yeah it's just in here okay it uses a

00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:09,350
template system where it's the templates

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,480
of customizable and if you want to add a

00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:15,380
bill stepp you can add your own custom

00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:18,640
template so it's so it's more modular as

00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:18,640
you want to customize it

00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:38,800
so let's look at the template you share

00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:42,180
lyrics hey makeup yeah so so if you look

00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:44,560
at these tmpl files these are the

00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:47,920
templates that are used to customize the

00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:49,870
whole image so by default is based on

00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:52,600
architecture I think it says its

00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:57,880
template let's look at what it is sports

00:17:52,600 --> 00:18:04,420
there so all the stuff I exist exciting

00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:06,670
stuff bootloader and the runtime image

00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:11,550
the scratch FS image is created by you

00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:13,870
can go through the core layer long time

00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:16,990
install post-install cleanup so

00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:18,910
everything is a template so if you look

00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:25,150
at clear this is the east of like having

00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:28,530
a bash variable you have like a yeah

00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:33,340
it's kind of easy to you know add 15

00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:35,170
things here so so if you want to add a

00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:37,360
new package to anaconda runtime this is

00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:41,640
the place you add are you adding one

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:43,870
template and pass it on here all right

00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:48,310
i'm gonna i think this talk is going to

00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:53,800
be like very will compete you know you

00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:56,170
know soon ok so the patches so what

00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:58,360
catches do we add so i have a small

00:18:56,170 --> 00:19:01,090
patch like you're welcome patch now you

00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:03,220
change i think most of the distributions

00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:07,780
if you want to do a remix they do this

00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:11,020
like they modify the modify the you know

00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:13,930
trademarks and all the names and stuff

00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:16,900
so let's look at this patch it's called

00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:20,250
the belkin patch I actually applied this

00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,250
patch on a machine um

00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:25,789
who

00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:39,100
so what what dispatch is that does is

00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:42,860
like it just says welcome to fluoxetine

00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:45,530
from welcome to fedora and I think this

00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:47,480
I don't know I didn't get it working i

00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:55,490
can explain he works on a libel live

00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:56,750
image yeah yeah yeah yeah but but you

00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:58,430
know when you're building with lurex you

00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,990
can say the product name so it changes

00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:05,390
the product in weeks at least see that

00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:07,520
in the demo and so so these are the two

00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:09,200
patches i order I have another patch

00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,420
this is like a bigger pass i can show

00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:15,850
you so this patch is actually running

00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:20,210
running in production at the apple so

00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:22,490
April 2015 arm okay so this is the patch

00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:24,830
that adds a top tailored support for a

00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:27,140
rel 6-inch seller so the concept is that

00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:29,960
we have a lot of we don't install into

00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:32,180
the lot usually have if you are in if

00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:36,770
you came to a talk like last year at

00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:38,300
Prague so we did a lot of tabas so tar

00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:39,800
balls are easy to like transfer an

00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:44,540
export that individual audience it just

00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:46,700
reduces time so we currently have

00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:48,950
support thanks to a kind of team they

00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:53,720
have added support for tar balls until

00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:57,860
7.1 armor side yeah some point 1 it

00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:59,750
landed on so even before they aren't we

00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:01,850
we've been running that patch now res

00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:04,640
six min ear we need a real we have had a

00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:07,820
custom installer and you wanted to move

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:10,700
away from it try different things so on

00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:12,220
Ahana is one of them so we added a patch

00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:15,010
to anaconda

00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:17,860
to add support for faith Tyler how it

00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:18,970
works is that you you specify in during

00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:21,580
the installation is specifying the

00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:24,429
konica command line Baylor equals the

00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:27,850
URL of the tarball it automatically

00:21:24,429 --> 00:21:29,650
passes this top tailored argument and

00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:32,020
downloads the star bar creates

00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:34,960
partitions and extracts them onto the

00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:37,030
disk so it's very simple like and but it

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,640
kind of we have to hack into the

00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:43,630
installer to divert to do this otherwise

00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:45,460
insular will do something else um so I

00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:49,440
think this is some for many teams I did

00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:49,440
I don't know why okay I shouldn't have

00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:55,510
yeah oh well course like the old

00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:59,559
onaconda code is really a little bit

00:21:55,510 --> 00:22:02,470
hard to read the new code is really good

00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:05,230
I mean from looking at the old guard in

00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:07,539
the new girl it's well organized then

00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:09,789
obviously a lot nice the new code is

00:22:07,539 --> 00:22:11,830
well organized I would I mean working on

00:22:09,789 --> 00:22:13,480
OpenStack you see like things like talks

00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:16,450
and unit tests but I don't see anything

00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:18,870
anything here so far because her plans

00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:18,870
to add it

00:22:19,149 --> 00:22:27,670
okay there's this company

00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:27,670
oh really okay i'll talk to you guys

00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:39,990
watching TV okay okay so i mean i guess

00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:48,040
but yeah so this is this after a plane

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,430
patch or what we already do is normally

00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:54,100
a creator iso image and then put the

00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:56,470
whole thing in a vm as like a test if

00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:58,000
the vm works we just push it to like a

00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:00,070
centralized repository and then it goes

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,250
to production automatically it's like

00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:05,260
ice-1 dump this but i think the current

00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:07,780
team plus noticed where they actually

00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:13,920
deployed the installer you stenciled on

00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:17,740
a vending machine and do the test so so

00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:21,670
this flag actually comes from sent by

00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:23,830
the code that process the kickstart

00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:26,980
files sorry the colonel command lines so

00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:29,620
if you find the top payload flag it goes

00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:32,800
to cross the talkback top i look back in

00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:37,120
this book for fedora and pearl and look

00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:40,060
at the top payload back in so it just

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:43,180
what it does is a finds out the size of

00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:44,980
the top ball see if it can write it to

00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:49,330
the temporary file system on the disk

00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:51,100
and it downloads it and uses a progress

00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:53,470
bar that's a private it's almost like

00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:57,070
you go into the one that you guys I mean

00:23:53,470 --> 00:24:00,190
live in a trailer except for l6 just

00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:03,880
like older installer and it takes tracks

00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:07,850
the whole thing onto the disk so this

00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:12,060
part is little important we use no AC

00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:15,990
dark if you use a CL success to be four

00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:19,230
they see else on all files so we got a

00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:22,080
dis really hard to disable it because

00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:25,470
it's kind of a security vulnerability to

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:30,120
set the default acs down on the files so

00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:32,790
we extract the actual twice the tarball

00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:34,970
onto the disk using this terminal and

00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:34,970
then

00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:43,720
um no should be I don't know so we don't

00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:46,240
use we do not have AC linux and you will

00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:48,730
done anyway yeah so but the assailants

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,070
like is just that you know in the future

00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:54,340
if you decide to do that we should

00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:58,620
probably trigger free labor yeah is the

00:24:54,340 --> 00:25:01,240
hard one so there was two bucks open on

00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:04,270
against her diet so it's fixed on fedora

00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:07,390
that patch is not the match was not

00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:09,700
never Burfoot backwater to tart so too I

00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:12,490
think it's tended to I think it will be

00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:20,409
released with 7.2 and 6.8 I don't know

00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:24,039
why 6.7 but let's see yep so we do

00:25:20,409 --> 00:25:26,770
something and then we you know this all

00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:28,480
done tons in the thread and just the

00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:33,720
patch so this patch is supplied against

00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:37,330
well six okay let's go here that's too

00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:41,950
ok this is the command actually to build

00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:43,960
the stage to scratch this image so what

00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:45,669
it does is this is the product which I

00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,590
have a may find that does this I mean I

00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:49,720
have published everything on in mind

00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:51,190
federal people it's easier I

00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:53,500
leave me the link later

00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:54,820
you can go to look at the branch and all

00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:58,660
they make fly if you want to do it

00:25:54,820 --> 00:26:02,350
yourself so lorex command is the product

00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:05,650
name so this is your new Bistro and this

00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:09,880
is your version of your digital and the

00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:12,010
release so this is this is our ego said

00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:15,940
normally points at the option vintage is

00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:17,860
fedora and this repo story the updates

00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:19,720
to go and the final one is not a car

00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:21,880
number so you have built an account as

00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:24,580
why what it is do this like I applied to

00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:26,740
pastor onaconda I built anaconda now

00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:28,330
Donna counter version has to be little

00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:30,220
bit like you bump the release so that

00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:32,200
it's little bit higher than the one

00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:35,830
that's available at you know the Red

00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:42,000
Admiral suffered Ramirez yes to get in

00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:45,010
the image and you in point you're a

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,630
pointless to the number and then finally

00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:48,400
say this final this is a little bit

00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:50,020
important otherwise anaconda will keep

00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:55,090
telling people that oh you're running a

00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:57,220
pre-release version yeah and other

00:26:55,090 --> 00:27:01,090
important thing another thing I noticed

00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:02,620
is if you're building and building this

00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:05,290
on a rail six but you are building

00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:08,290
further than seven are natural sometimes

00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:10,150
this I think it's a federal image I

00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:13,150
think if you're building federal or l6

00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:16,180
machine what happens is that the mac

00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:18,010
good stuff so basically the HFS they

00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:20,500
don't have HFS drivers so you probably

00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:21,910
need to say no mac boot in the lower

00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,860
edge come unless somebody add a patch

00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:26,920
recently very I think like a month two

00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:29,320
months ago at a patch to disable no Mac

00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:33,990
good it wasn't there so I used to do

00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:33,990
just sit down yeah we should never

00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:40,440
and so did it would be a poor teacher

00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:46,220
before or some happened different never

00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:46,220
ever all sides to this like yeah I

00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:51,389
totally understand America but if any

00:27:49,019 --> 00:27:53,639
are like walking in fact working in my

00:27:51,389 --> 00:27:55,710
enterprise company like you have like

00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:57,509
little six the popular thing right now I

00:27:55,710 --> 00:28:01,619
read somewhere just a la a tapping into

00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:03,989
their self so no no Mac boot option is

00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:05,730
there that's for people so it writes all

00:28:03,989 --> 00:28:08,039
the things in a tree so let's look at

00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:09,869
the makefile that's the like a important

00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:11,460
thing so how I built the whole thing I'm

00:28:09,869 --> 00:28:13,739
not going to run the mix well I just ran

00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:15,779
before this stock and I have the logs

00:28:13,739 --> 00:28:18,119
and the image i will show you that

00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:21,889
because if you run it will take another

00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:27,409
are with this inside connection so i

00:28:21,889 --> 00:28:31,470
have a make file name make file or X so

00:28:27,409 --> 00:28:37,320
as you can see the other five solid it's

00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:39,749
a flaw i'm 21 and x86 support and so i

00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:42,840
have a comment card and a small lake

00:28:39,749 --> 00:28:46,040
felony with grandma so it uses is going

00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:49,990
to use the flock 21 in six

00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:52,610
for compost month configuration file

00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:57,080
which has the bind moans enabled and

00:28:52,610 --> 00:29:00,970
everything and so i have 1 i'm not going

00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:02,990
to use the objects Miller so I have a

00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:05,630
rest of your maybe I think it may

00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:08,270
disclose in here so just little faster

00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:12,320
so i have a federal murder which is like

00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:14,060
a 11 we are here basement no thanks my

00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,630
life and i have a web server running and

00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:20,510
i copied all my kinda too and i don't

00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:24,640
know i try to use the file flag I just

00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:24,640
didn't work finally Colin Colin tell you

00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:42,590
I didn't that's yeah yeah i forgot sorry

00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:45,290
i don't know why yeah so so this

00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:48,320
anaconda mirror so right now so to walk

00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:53,800
around that I just started my httpd so

00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:59,470
you can see um I have longer www HTML

00:29:53,800 --> 00:30:02,540
Mike and outside so it just has all the

00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:06,200
Anaconda rpms with the bump for these

00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:11,780
pumps dash two I wish I a passionate in

00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:13,610
the record ah yeah so it will reply from

00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:15,950
that so I also i'm also going to test

00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:18,019
this image the ones i have the

00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:20,409
which i just got a vm and seafood worth

00:30:18,019 --> 00:30:26,299
you know it's like a smoke test see

00:30:20,409 --> 00:30:29,299
everything works you know that so the

00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:32,450
main main thing is the mantra so I

00:30:29,299 --> 00:30:34,789
should have run like a deft i scrub all

00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:36,919
I know is closed everything and you walk

00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:42,220
again but with this internet connection

00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:46,970
I cannot afford scrub anything yeah so

00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:50,389
what I do is I install lorex into the

00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:52,250
mock she wrote first and then i copy my

00:30:50,389 --> 00:30:56,059
current working directory which has that

00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:59,200
actually this main file and the actual

00:30:56,059 --> 00:31:03,260
code to build the whole thing into the

00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:04,820
into that mocks road and then here i can

00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:07,820
do in order to the ceiling it out

00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:13,090
correctly and then i called me find out

00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:13,090
lorex to run away play

00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:23,790
so I call them Lorax clean me and I

00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:29,640
don't know what's that I think it's

00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:33,570
probably low x3 it's probably teen entry

00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:37,010
so it's probably fusty cleans the whole

00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:40,230
thing and then again because the three

00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:41,940
infants the low rates reduce the lorex

00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:46,800
commander actually building into the

00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:48,870
children and then finally this is the

00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:53,730
clean so it just cleans this Denise all

00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:58,350
the unwanted stuff and this is where

00:31:53,730 --> 00:32:08,550
they're holding hands oh this is

00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:12,660
important in case of fedora so yeah so

00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:15,480
this is if you don't exclude this you

00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:17,190
know product this package is it will you

00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:19,550
tickle you you will run into depth sound

00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:22,380
when you are grading the runtime image

00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:25,190
so the product of this is right now

00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:25,190
stored here

00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:30,860
so we have high images excellent accent

00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:33,760
like where's the light was has the

00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:40,810
scratch of his image you just used to h2

00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:40,810
and I think ye upon

00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:47,029
goes in the door

00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:54,130
so that i think is a linux has the

00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:57,670
colonel and round disk so so this is

00:32:54,130 --> 00:33:06,150
basically and then adding images midges

00:32:57,670 --> 00:33:06,150
has the booty so yeah

00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:16,289
oh yes so this is basically like a DVD

00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:18,870
tree the whole thing is created less

00:33:16,289 --> 00:33:22,380
let's test this so this is created am I

00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:27,029
have the bill lock here I don't I don't

00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:34,080
think i have to show this but um so I'm

00:33:27,029 --> 00:33:36,259
gonna just do a make maybe I should go

00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,259
here

00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:46,270

you know don't need to really like do

00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:58,840
all this because anaconda just works

00:34:55,990 --> 00:35:02,050
most of the time but if you are working

00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:05,590

00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:12,340
know release model they take a little

00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:14,170
bit of extra time you want to fix it

00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:20,710
fast because internet companies are like

00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:24,610
fast things move fast um so we you have

00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:26,010
