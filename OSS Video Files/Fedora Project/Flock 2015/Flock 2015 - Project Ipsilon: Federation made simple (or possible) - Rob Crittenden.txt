Title: Flock 2015 - Project Ipsilon: Federation made simple (or possible) - Rob Crittenden
Publication date: 2015-08-26
Playlist: Flock 2015
Description: 
	Federated Identity is a means to do web authentication by trusting a third party to do the authentication rather than configuring the application to talk directly to the identity backend via LDAP, Kerberos, etc. Project Ipsilon, a new feature for Fedora 22, is a Federated Identity Provider, and much more. It simplifies the setup and configuration of the Identity Provider (IdP) and Service Providers (SP), your local web app, to authenticate using the SAML, OpenID or the Persona protocols. This talk will provide and overview of Federated Identity, the supported protocols (focusing on SAML), and cover the features of Ipsilon including simple installation scripts, configuring different Identity backends and controlling what Identity data is shared with different SPs.
