Title: Flock 2015 - Project Ipsilon: Federation made simple (or possible) - Rob Crittenden
Publication date: 2015-08-26
Playlist: Flock 2015
Description: 
	Federated Identity is a means to do web authentication by trusting a third party to do the authentication rather than configuring the application to talk directly to the identity backend via LDAP, Kerberos, etc. Project Ipsilon, a new feature for Fedora 22, is a Federated Identity Provider, and much more. It simplifies the setup and configuration of the Identity Provider (IdP) and Service Providers (SP), your local web app, to authenticate using the SAML, OpenID or the Persona protocols. This talk will provide and overview of Federated Identity, the supported protocols (focusing on SAML), and cover the features of Ipsilon including simple installation scripts, configuring different Identity backends and controlling what Identity data is shared with different SPs.

does anyone know we'll see all right

00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,880
well I'll get into it so my name is Rob

00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,769
Crittenden are going to talk about

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,950
practical tip salon and federated

00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:16,590
identity so meet Joe Joe is just your

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,359
average guy likes using the web he's got

00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,439
a bunch of different identities he's got

00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,480
to work out then and he's got a home

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,580
identity might be a gamer maybe a

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,470
blogger black people know a lot of

00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,619
different ways you really likes to use

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:30,750
the web this is typical you log into a

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:34,500
website they have a local user database

00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:36,719
he does this all over the place the

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:41,100
problem is he's got passwords for

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,690
everything different usernames and he's

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,370
not always good at getting a new

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:48,899
password or to think good passwords

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:50,399
because he's just never dude so there

00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,520
are fixes for this you can think

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,610
LastPass lots of the tools to help you

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,969
consolidate password which I've locked

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:02,640
all the others Federation is another

00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:05,820
solution so you basically have one

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,200
account the asterisk there because you

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,390
can actually multiply counts one for

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,330
each identity might have a work identity

00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:15,479
you know home identity gaming identity

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:17,970
etc is trying to over simplify things a

00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:20,670
little bit so this is good because then

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,200
you have one patch me for a count anyway

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,640
and you want to remember all the stuff

00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,220
and hopefully have a better password

00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,560
it's good for the web applications that

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,450
use federated identity because no longer

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,740
after new password resets and they don't

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,479
have to worry about giving their

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,750
database act and Evan all the passwords

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:40,549
stolen it notify everybody and it's also

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:43,110
some Federation can be good for

00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:44,909
administrator and with them people

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,039
leaving 2 so 4 exhibit a word

00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:50,490
environment if you have Federation you

00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:54,149
can log into oracle and salesforce and a

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,409
lot of other things when you leave they

00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:57,240
don't have to go to salesforce complete

00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:59,459
you and go into work on that you would

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,369
go into HR system they just lead you out

00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:05,909
of the federated identity system gone

00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:07,530
you can't load it anywhere this is a

00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:10,379
very simplified version of what

00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:13,200
Federation looks like so Joe goes to

00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:16,110
example at her work which wants the

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,299
dedication so his browser redirection to

00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,410
infinity provider of some sort he

00:02:18,299 --> 00:02:22,260
provides some sort of authentication

00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:24,269
it's outdated locally there and he's

00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,640
redirected back to example that work

00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:28,140
with some sort of token and this token

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,760
identifies who he is and I might say

00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,610
some things about my state names

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:36,269
addresses email address or other

00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:38,810
interesting facts this is not Federation

00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:41,579
this is stolen straight from see mail

00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:43,200
this is a example that I ordered is

00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:46,349
basically sending your password on to

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,840
another site you can't control your

00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:50,900
credentials this way this is totally not

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:56,160
safe it's literally a man-in-the-middle

00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:58,620
it's a terrible idea so some general

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,200
information about Federation you're

00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:03,359
basically outsourcing your identity now

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,970
outsourcing might not be very far by be

00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:08,700
elsewhere to do i.t but you could be

00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:10,019
giving turning through somebody else for

00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,049
example Google's in it when I can

00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:16,519
provide or so they're providing a venue

00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:19,799
for you so in their survey third party

00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:22,099
usually these are HD two days put HTTP

00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:25,109
based protocols it doesn't have to be

00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:27,690
and they're usually done in a browser so

00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:29,780
there are rich clients thumb you can do

00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:32,090
sample is one of the

00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:34,310
duration technologies and you can use

00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:36,620
that for my coming in line but typically

00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:40,430
they're browser-based some use cookies

00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:41,660
for steak some dem and there's I'll

00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:44,120
gated to this in a minute there's a

00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:46,340
centralized or decentralized Federation

00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,520
and then here's some common examples

00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:51,110
which you may have heard of so we'll

00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,180
start with Stan so this is centralized

00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:55,489
so by centralizing mean there's one

00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:58,100
identity provider it may have multiple

00:03:55,489 --> 00:04:02,959
instances but there's one place you go

00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:06,950
for identity it's it was created my 2001

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:09,980
so the last spectra sample two came out

00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:12,530
in 2006 it's pretty stable but because

00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:14,569
of the time he came from XML taught them

00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:18,109
that would say xml-based it's horrible

00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:19,609
to read and it has to be a race to BS

00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:23,210
because otherwise the contents

00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:24,800
meaningful and you have tokens going

00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:29,570
back and forth so you definitely want

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:31,700
SSO for Samuel requires an agreement

00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:35,479
between parties so if you want to be a

00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:37,940
web provider and deal with a see my BP

00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:41,090
you have to exchange some information so

00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:43,640
it's called metadata basically Shh keys

00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:46,400
so that when you get an identity from

00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:48,260
the example identity provider you can

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,660
confirm that is for them using a

00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:53,750
signature and you can even be encrypted

00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:56,450
if you were longer that far Samuel press

00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:58,250
crossed am a single sign-on and what

00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:03,169
that means is so cookies are

00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:08,600
domain-specific but with sample the

00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:10,760
cookie is for the IDP and so you go to

00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,289
the IDP you get your cookie and then you

00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,110
provide an additional data to the

00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:17,380
service provider which can be

00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:19,750
any number of domains and you can get

00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:22,150
across to being single sign-on Sam will

00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:24,070
also has single log app so if your log

00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:25,720
into a bunch of different websites you

00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:28,570
can click one button to log it all at

00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:31,030
the same time which is pretty

00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:33,580
significant I'll go over that this is a

00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:36,940
very similar picture we saw before Joe

00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:38,320
here in nonstick big reform starts by

00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:42,430
going to a service provider served

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:44,680
riders fancy way of saying website that

00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:47,380
it the surfs rider doesn't see a cookie

00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:50,410
for Joe so it redirects to get EP and

00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:52,960
his browser he's care of this the ID is

00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:54,970
going to present some sort of page it's

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,620
going to say authenticate now you can

00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:58,960
authenticate any way you want to be able

00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:01,420
to keep whatever way it supports and

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:05,470
this is another advantage of Federation

00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:08,440
is that Joe's web service isn't going to

00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:11,980
want to have you know one-time passwords

00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:13,270
in Kerberos and a lot of other summer

00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:15,360
were difficult for the negation

00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:20,320
recommend we're at IDP which all they do

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:22,660
so you can typical as Kerberos held that

00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:25,960
back and authentication simple form

00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:28,770
based one-time passwords it whatever you

00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:32,530
want once you're authenticated

00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:35,620
sandwiches token sends that back fruit

00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:39,850
jars browser to ESP recognizes the token

00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:41,680
and the way you go inside the token

00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:43,840
force animal are what are called

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,420
attributes and these attributes contain

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:49,770
information value they might contain

00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:53,650
what groups here in your email address

00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:54,750
things like that and it can also contain

00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:57,430
additional

00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:59,880
beyond this talk but this is basically

00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:02,260
this is what single log on looks like i

00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:05,770
had to grossly over simplify this

00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:08,140
because the lines got a little crazy but

00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:10,960
basically joe logs out a search brighter

00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:13,270
one and the first thing that sp1 does is

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,880
a reader back to Jewish browser and

00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:19,000
sends it to the IDP because the IDP is

00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:21,400
where all the real action happens so the

00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,160
IDP looks for all the log in sessions

00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:26,020
that it has for Joe and then it's good a

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,610
one bed one hit rate over those two log

00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,950
them all out so the only one left is the

00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:31,500
originating logout request and so in

00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:35,470
this case i'm showing la guitare soap

00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:37,240
which is basically HTTP POST you can

00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:39,760
also do redirect log apps and that's

00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:42,670
actually recommended by the same

00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:45,370
specification but it was impossible to

00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:47,920
draw so so basically logs out at

00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:49,240
Surfrider to once yet he sees that

00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,920
everything else except for the original

00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,390
ones logged out it locks him out of

00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:55,570
there and it redirects back to the

00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:58,480
circus rider and he's done and if joe

00:07:55,570 --> 00:08:02,050
went back to any other provider here we

00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:05,050
have to authenticate open ID is another

00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:08,770
pretty common that are it identity

00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:10,870
solution it's decentralized in that you

00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:13,450
can have additive identity providers

00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:14,890
anywhere your identities the role and

00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:18,280
the Earl basically contains information

00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:21,430
that says who you are and who's can i

00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:24,310
authenticate and basically with it when

00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:27,670
I didn't prove that you own this oral by

00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:28,930
providing a password and we're going to

00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:30,550
eat you can run around server if you

00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:33,880
want it to seems a little hard work but

00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:35,590
you could if you wanted so the infant ID

00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,370
itself is place that is just an earl but

00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:38,020
it could be

00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:41,080
whatever the only thing like for example

00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:43,870
my girl Miska for once like I'm our

00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,970
current idea federal project this is so

00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:48,190
you know something about me now my my

00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:50,650
fast login because of Mark written you

00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:53,470
now related or project so you have some

00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:54,880
idea about doing it but otherwise you

00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:58,060
know you can't clean any other

00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:02,560
information out so in similar to it to

00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:06,250
sample you can provide by a consent any

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,810
number of different attributes and open

00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:10,029
I'd these extensible said that then or

00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:14,500
what extensions available defines what

00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:16,900
data is visible so oh goodness sake so

00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,980
this is when you finish this Earl you're

00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:21,040
going to get something looks like this

00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:22,990
and partitas open I the server and so we

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,830
know to go to idea of your project at

00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:28,390
org so when you try to authenticate with

00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:32,730
this it's going to redirected they have

00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:36,400
to login there's actually pretty complex

00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:38,800
discovery process where the Earl's can

00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,959
be much more but the data contained with

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,980
a row can be much more complex but like

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,170
I said I'm just trying to give you a

00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:46,800
basic overview so then what happens is a

00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:49,630
shared secret is established between the

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,060
it so i've been using the term service

00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:54,670
provider and I BP and Samuel its

00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:57,490
identity provider and relying party and

00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:59,020
open I sew the relying party establishes

00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:02,650
a shared secret with the identity

00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:04,360
provider directly and then the user is

00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:07,600
redirected to the at any provider

00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:10,000
authenticate and similar to example they

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,100
provided the occasion somehow and again

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,950
this could be more complex than the

00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:19,779
relying party wants to do itself the

00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:21,850
open ID doesn't use cookies so it just

00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:26,220
it's took you guys back in the content

00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:26,220
of each response sure

00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:36,430
well I mean the vertical why's there

00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:40,930
conceptually for similar but open ID is

00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:42,990
it's just an earl and end this early it

00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:45,220
told a lot information that we're good p

00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:48,339
you don't need to register the search

00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:51,129
provider with the open I he provided for

00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:53,920
example like in Samuel you have to get

00:10:51,129 --> 00:10:58,300
exchanged keys overnighted does it on

00:10:53,920 --> 00:11:02,319
the fly so you couldn't have like a ruse

00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:04,329
or service provider in San it's it's

00:11:02,319 --> 00:11:06,939
centralized do you have to have a Jake

00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:08,889
open at knees not so much so I can

00:11:06,939 --> 00:11:13,779
actually use my fedora project open ID

00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:15,939
anywhere I want within reason you can

00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:18,970
accept if they accept up an ID and

00:11:15,939 --> 00:11:21,069
accept right you cannot trust other but

00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:22,749
I varieties if you want you can actually

00:11:21,069 --> 00:11:28,029
set up a team of who actually do i do

00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:30,610
but for the most part it's design part

00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:34,149
he's pretty friend right so we relax

00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:39,600
body weakens human service evil lady

00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:43,319
case defines what central servers

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:46,500
and anything that's forced away right in

00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:50,009
sam'l you have a more control it's like

00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:55,819
the IEP registered the registers the

00:11:50,009 --> 00:12:10,259
service one he is the opening email for

00:11:55,819 --> 00:12:14,040
collaboration consideration so what tip

00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:19,259
salon have a good talk if salon provides

00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:20,610
up an ID and same as a service so it

00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:21,990
consists of pretty straightforward

00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:26,449
installation scripts that set these

00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:29,279
things up for you you know just this

00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:31,829
salmon tips and open idea are pretty

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,720
easy to do but there is some metadata to

00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:35,720
exchange in January keys and things I

00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:39,389
guess and this greatly simplifies that

00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,560
and it lets you configure like I so I

00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:44,910
talked about what attributes you can

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:49,319
have may we address email etc you can

00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:51,149
control who sees what and sometimes even

00:12:49,319 --> 00:12:54,329
what is called because the different

00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:56,279
providers expected earnings there's a

00:12:54,329 --> 00:13:00,209
man a big gooey inter plugging framework

00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:01,709
and IPA it can be back in but enemy so

00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:04,740
this is what you see when you log into

00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:09,000
epsilon itself pretty firmly ministry

00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:11,939
gooey I'll go every to be Stewie each of

00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:16,949
these links basically is a major set of

00:13:11,939 --> 00:13:18,480
plugins so each provider in that case is

00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:21,990
a federation protocols that we support

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:24,209
cm2 so Sam wasn't quite large

00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:28,649
specification and they actually have a

00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:30,779
conformance document epsilon is the IDP

00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:31,920
light which doesn't it makes it sound

00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:34,829
like it doesn't

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,959
actually it's about half the spec the

00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:40,110
business part anyway what our

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:42,630
perspective anyway open ID and it

00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:45,450
supports fast so I assume there will

00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:48,199
years got a faster count so you can even

00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:51,889
give us a lot about the last two weeks

00:13:48,199 --> 00:13:55,889
so and then Mozilla persona is another

00:13:51,889 --> 00:13:59,399
provider that we support it's an email

00:13:55,889 --> 00:14:05,510
based well yeah it's an email based

00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:08,639
login system it's not super interesting

00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:10,350
so logging mechanisms that we score

00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,120
right now at jss API which we give

00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:15,660
Kerberos there's form based

00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:17,720
authentication which uses so actually

00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:19,829
he's got a whole bunch of modules mud

00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,050
intercept form submit is the one that we

00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:24,000
use to basically intercepts the form and

00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:25,560
then does your dedication before you

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,329
would then impact you rather than

00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,920
submitting to like it let me SGI having

00:14:27,329 --> 00:14:32,250
it through the authentication they could

00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:36,380
do that too for backends you can plug in

00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:39,269
if I ldap p.m. or the door consistent

00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:41,640
and information providers this is where

00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:45,269
we get the attributes to fill in the

00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:46,890
information about you so by default the

00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:49,490
things available are like the groups are

00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:52,440
in down list you have things like that

00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:55,500
we can get the data over sssd it's into

00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:57,899
a pipe which is at the bus interface so

00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:00,240
if you have open IVF free iba than

00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:04,440
anything for erp a is available as an

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:06,329
attribute it's an early you can also get

00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,399
data by to ldap which is almost the same

00:15:06,329 --> 00:15:09,600
thing as SSD just a little more complex

00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,810
to set up

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:16,130
enemies or you can just get rid of NSS

00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:18,630
but you gave your geckos that's about it

00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:21,509
so and I mentioned before you can

00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:22,829
configure data visibility so if you have

00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:25,829
a search provider you don't want to know

00:15:22,829 --> 00:15:29,370
people's addresses you can limit to the

00:15:25,829 --> 00:15:32,130
teeny moon or name and email or some

00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:34,589
providers so there's interoperability

00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:37,170
differences between San drivers and open

00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:38,940
antivirus leave some might want email is

00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:40,139
email address if someone like mail was

00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:46,889
thinking what your excellency you could

00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:48,509
do mapping of actually names so via it's

00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:51,630
one thing to talk about it let me see if

00:15:48,509 --> 00:15:53,810
I can actually show you what Islam looks

00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,810
like

00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:02,050
alright so

00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:05,019
I mean install an epsilon server with I

00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:07,809
paid the back end configuring the DSS

00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:09,730
the input pipe with all the form based

00:16:07,809 --> 00:16:12,069
authentication and I'm going to able to

00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:16,600
open a key to so Samuel by default is

00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:18,279
enabled so it's going to look and see I

00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,429
already have a key tab this machine is

00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:22,869
enrolled as an idea client which also

00:16:21,429 --> 00:16:29,470
simplifies their certificates that we

00:16:22,869 --> 00:16:33,239
need and that's it we now have an ID so

00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:33,239
if i go to my browser

00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:47,150
i'm showing here

00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:50,390
okay so i can authenticate as a show

00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:52,490
that's fine so i can login is my IP a

00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:54,440
administrator which is the same name at

00:16:52,490 --> 00:17:01,940
the epsilon administrator so it all just

00:16:54,440 --> 00:17:03,520
works and i have my my friendly page

00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:08,480
where i can flip through it i can show

00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:11,720
so we have open ID example configured we

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:15,800
have gssapi because oh I PA form based

00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:19,190
authentication cast-off is not something

00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:22,310
it's interesting for most people yes it

00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:24,680
basically it's let anybody in and then

00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:25,490
SSD is enabled and then it says disabled

00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:28,010
because you don't need them but if

00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:31,700
enabled at the same time it's the same

00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:33,290
information so now this really gets

00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:38,630
interesting we have a search provider so

00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:40,760
it's instead of a sam'l so you go with

00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:42,470
it so the same ol IDK metadata so this

00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,090
is basically saying i'm setting up a

00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:46,070
service provider and this is where you

00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:49,340
can get the identity providers metadata

00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:51,980
and then the San walk is wearing

00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:54,230
protective and then I'm going to

00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,460
automatically register this SP with hip

00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:57,950
salon without have to give a lot of

00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:59,660
metadata exchange myself so I basically

00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:03,220
just provide the password and it

00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:03,220
registers for me over the REST API

00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:13,200
I you don't now the client doesn't

00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:15,960
because all the L the identity stuff

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,300
happens on the IDP I do because it makes

00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:21,450
us so easier so i can use ID to get

00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:24,840
shirts for everybody and then I don't

00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:27,470
have trust issues you also don't even

00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,470
need to use it

00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:45,440
yeah well be the epsilon pi and soul is

00:18:40,909 --> 00:18:48,230
in innocence but the question is what

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:51,350
are the requirements right you have to

00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:58,250
have now the other kind of IPA is

00:18:51,350 --> 00:19:01,840
against these can work for justice so if

00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:04,840
you think of sam'l a common cases

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,840
somebody

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:14,820
so

00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:14,820
esky very likely

00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:24,940
so this case back

00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:32,389
liar absolutely why not you get certain

00:19:29,389 --> 00:19:32,389
rescue

00:19:37,549 --> 00:19:42,200
so here's SB test the providers you said

00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:44,480
it let me now let me explain why I have

00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,279
all my clients involved enrolled in IPA

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,809
so you can manually add a provider or

00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:52,070
tues you can just give it some friendly

00:19:47,809 --> 00:19:55,399
name like Jose now for the minute that

00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:57,769
Earl you know probably wanted if you

00:19:55,399 --> 00:19:59,659
wanted to ride the metadata or SSL in

00:19:57,769 --> 00:20:02,389
you know HTTPS blah blah blah blah blah

00:19:59,659 --> 00:20:04,820
well when you submit its going to open

00:20:02,389 --> 00:20:07,129
an ssl connection to that search

00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:10,190
provider and if it's CA trust isn't

00:20:07,129 --> 00:20:14,059
there then things don't work so great so

00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:16,129
that's why being in the same TK eyes is

00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:18,230
easy or you sorts that are issue from

00:20:16,129 --> 00:20:21,379
some well-known provider or is already

00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:25,730
in your cert bundle so it doesn't really

00:20:21,379 --> 00:20:28,249
connect to the estimable emotive

00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:31,009
malefactor you can write to in fabrics

00:20:28,249 --> 00:20:34,549
in there right but if it's protected by

00:20:31,009 --> 00:20:36,139
modest or sell or mod MSS then it the

00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:39,109
TLS connection needs to be trusted to

00:20:36,139 --> 00:20:42,139
and if you have so if you install this

00:20:39,109 --> 00:20:43,549
using locally issue self-signed serves

00:20:42,139 --> 00:20:46,519
everywhere then it's not going to work

00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:50,330
out too well it's okay to keep rubbing

00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:52,609
the bme cars2 using I da you have a

00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:54,950
central CA as well so it simplifies

00:20:52,609 --> 00:20:58,100
things is not mandatory and this you

00:20:54,950 --> 00:21:00,169
know all these things are not a problem

00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:03,230
that overcome is just for demo purposes

00:21:00,169 --> 00:21:06,409
that was easier to tease so how this is

00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:10,119
different so you know any manual in this

00:21:06,409 --> 00:21:13,509
is the alternative way off installing

00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:15,699
right yes the right so if you use Martha

00:21:13,509 --> 00:21:19,509
melon your pure just play model melon

00:21:15,699 --> 00:21:22,989
and you when it starts up it generates

00:21:19,509 --> 00:21:24,969
its own med data and so once you have

00:21:22,989 --> 00:21:27,069
your search were out of running all you

00:21:24,969 --> 00:21:29,499
have to do is go in here and provide the

00:21:27,069 --> 00:21:31,959
girl to wear that they did is and you'll

00:21:29,499 --> 00:21:40,869
just slip it over the interweb and how

00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:44,499
Trust is the first exchange partners so

00:21:40,869 --> 00:21:50,069
they did the stamp DSP metadata is based

00:21:44,499 --> 00:21:50,069
you already has a guided p metadata so

00:21:50,309 --> 00:22:00,599
it signed by the way auditing publishing

00:21:53,229 --> 00:22:00,599
ready three ways there to of that are

00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:08,360
add a file image uploaded so in this

00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:12,750
case you are blocking us at least today

00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:16,950
or you contemplated saying and the only

00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:19,590
one where you have issues and you really

00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:24,560
want to use HTTPS there is usually water

00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:24,560
heater correct sir and that's why I ca

00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:30,050
absolutely live on the certificate is

00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:30,050
made well

00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:43,900
oh just a certificate

00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:52,600
yeah really the way you're trusting

00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:03,210
so this is what

00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:10,010
this is what the metadata looks like so

00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:13,940
it's basically the public key of via

00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:15,560
this is a service provider and then it's

00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,970
got a bunch of entries for the things

00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:20,720
that supports it was the first single

00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:25,030
log out the assertion consumer service

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:27,020
which and then na might need supports so

00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:31,880
it's something that's a moment you can

00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:34,390
actually the name returned by the IDP

00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:36,650
doesn't ask me to name you log in with

00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:38,150
so it could be any number of things you

00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:40,400
could actually be the same thing it

00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:43,730
could be your ear icarus principal name

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,800
it could be a random uuid where it could

00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:48,290
be a random uuid that's always returned

00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:51,830
for you and that way you can you can

00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:54,650
link identities and it could be the

00:23:51,830 --> 00:24:01,030
number of things nte has one x509

00:23:54,650 --> 00:24:01,030
subject some other things so let's sum

00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:05,310
the servant action

00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:13,600
so I get at the secret site my my hurry

00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:17,899
up my laptop isn't that role than idea

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:20,260
so when I try to access the secret site

00:24:17,899 --> 00:24:27,770
I can be able to get redirected to the

00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:30,169
tape salon we log in this Joe if that

00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:33,640
kate's me and Here I am back on my

00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:35,929
exercise we can look at environment I

00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:38,720
will see these melon underscore name is

00:24:35,929 --> 00:24:40,880
easier basically the attributes are in

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,970
the seamless ershon so we have my full

00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:46,580
name is jer user that the group of man

00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:51,289
i'm in a groove IP users my phone number

00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:52,940
got money on a dress and anything any

00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:55,760
attributes that are allowed to be sent

00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:59,929
over will be listed here with the names

00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:02,570
now the enders 40 bit these are for

00:24:59,929 --> 00:25:05,240
multi value so if you are a bunch of

00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:12,880
groups you have group 0 group 1 group 2

00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:12,880
43 47 and same for any other attribute

00:25:14,169 --> 00:25:17,710
and i can log out

00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:24,640
i log back in of course it's going to

00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:28,900
think a key so i wanted to show single

00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:34,440
log out so i'm gonna install client on

00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:34,440
my fact that might epsilon serve as well

00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:40,220
just do I

00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:44,929
I don't want to serve another vm from

00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:50,809
the service providers there so I'm gonna

00:25:44,929 --> 00:25:53,020
log back in here it took from the right

00:25:50,809 --> 00:25:53,020
password

00:25:56,790 --> 00:26:00,020
ok so now if I go to

00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:07,780
this is the new SPS set up and I just

00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:11,590
get right in because i authenticated

00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:14,290
your review so approach you to make it

00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:15,640
look a little different so all right so

00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:19,350
I look at the environment that's exactly

00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,350
the same because it's the same assertion

00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:25,300
well yeah so host will be in here only

00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:28,240
because Apache provides the event yeah

00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:33,160
gift to show that people now you can see

00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:39,400
it up here I guess yes this is epsilon

00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:41,299
delta gamma calmness is that SP and this

00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:48,080
is SB test

00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:50,570
all right let me show you log out so i

00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:53,629
logged into ft into the SP on this tab

00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:57,830
we log out of this game is to click

00:26:53,629 --> 00:26:59,749
logout and i'm walking back down ok so

00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:03,159
now i still have this right but if I

00:26:59,749 --> 00:27:11,869
just refreshed the page not authorized

00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:17,570
so pretty cool all right now i also have

00:27:11,869 --> 00:27:19,519
an open ID provider and this worked last

00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:21,559
night let's see if it works so this is

00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:28,129
this is just some example code I grabbed

00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:32,840
from another there's one developer so

00:27:28,129 --> 00:27:35,359
this is my him that this is my girl

00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:38,600
which is rather long and awful it is

00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:41,059
configurable but so the same thing I

00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:43,480
sign in I'm going to be authenticated by

00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:43,480
epsilon

00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:51,620
this is something you're familiar with

00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:53,090
fast okay you get a little dialogue that

00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:56,780
says someone's trying to authenticate

00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:59,840
you how long do you want to be trusted

00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:02,030
and I don't have any data sense oh I'm

00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:05,559
so if I allow it I'm redirected back to

00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:05,559
this and failed

00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:22,830
yeah it's just all you do my demo all

00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:22,830
right

00:28:38,059 --> 00:28:41,929
so it's wrong

00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:50,620
slice

00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:53,740
it's it yes I'm still a finicky here we

00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:55,090
go all right so it's a run play sorry

00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:56,890
about that now notice that there's no

00:28:55,090 --> 00:29:00,840
name an email here right because I

00:28:56,890 --> 00:29:00,840
didn't set it up with in your salon so

00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:08,920
let's uh never open ID is is full of

00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:12,420
extensions and those extensions do

00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:12,420
things like the London wrong place

00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:36,670
so if I going to have an ID so

00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:40,570
these are the extensions available so we

00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:43,420
have little routines yeah it's really

00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:45,750
relevant for fast so if I simple

00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:50,050
registration is provides that username

00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:52,210
and email FB exchange allows a lot more

00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:55,590
this is what the map it looks like so we

00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:57,700
can actually map one name to another or

00:29:55,590 --> 00:30:00,540
modify with the list of attributes that

00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,540
one's a lot of send

00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:11,190
so

00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,190
now if I sign in again

00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:18,520
of course it's incision

00:30:22,429 --> 00:30:28,700
so it seems I'm still logged in as

00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:35,619
administrator so but now we have a name

00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:38,450
here so and Evan and I PA doesn't have a

00:30:35,619 --> 00:30:42,129
password or the email address let me log

00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:42,129
out the Sun is jerry game

00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:57,180
so so now we have full name and email

00:30:55,050 --> 00:31:00,390
addresses things they were consenting to

00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:02,070
send now if you've ever used like

00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:04,910
OpenStack there but I can provider

00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:07,080
actually asks you what you want to send

00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:09,270
that's something we could talk about

00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:11,130
adding but for now it's an

00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:16,880
all-or-nothing things now gentleman do

00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:16,880
either our sin so that's open ID

00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:24,730
the

00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:30,740
I'm single wrap things up so this is

00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:31,990
where we're going open i can t connect

00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:34,789
is under active development right now

00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:37,460
open ID itself is not deprecated not to

00:31:34,789 --> 00:31:39,380
me to do what you see many more open ID

00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:42,470
connect is based on it i ought to and

00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:46,039
like facebook giving a lot of other

00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:47,720
companies or pushing for it we're

00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:50,450
working on ID portal so you can go to

00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:53,059
the IDP and for example for samuel every

00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:56,120
SP is registered to it will show so if

00:31:53,059 --> 00:31:58,580
you have a company and you have all your

00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:00,950
internal sites particular samuel then

00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:03,529
you can list everything that you might

00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:05,570
want to go to and you can just click on

00:32:03,529 --> 00:32:06,830
it and BL dedicated going away or if

00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:09,130
you're already authenticated then you

00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:11,720
just go into a single sign-on and

00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:13,630
everything's great right now the rest

00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:16,850
database is only for registering

00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:19,669
survivors we're going to extend that to

00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:22,010
be able to the more stuff over rest and

00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:23,840
then we're still working on additional

00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:29,360
single protocol so we can claim for

00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:32,299
informants so there's our website if you

00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:35,809
want to hack on it patches accepted

00:32:32,299 --> 00:32:37,460
we're using pegar it's kind of like

00:32:35,809 --> 00:32:40,460
github light right now where it's geek

00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:44,509
I'll clone and it's working very well

00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:49,579
for us interpret batch of use and then

00:32:44,509 --> 00:32:54,019
kind of slung off renewed its it so many

00:32:49,579 --> 00:32:56,779
questions let me know we have a test of

00:32:54,019 --> 00:32:59,809
a ws-federation at the point now now

00:32:56,779 --> 00:33:03,699
we've on integration testing is another

00:32:59,809 --> 00:33:08,539
thing i didn't really put on there so

00:33:03,699 --> 00:33:10,820
always a simple PHP ASP we've tested

00:33:08,539 --> 00:33:14,959
with and there was the one other there

00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:19,119
was a getting job that's what's that she

00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:19,119
would she would AWS

00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:39,870
they're outside and show you know even

00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:39,870
in the case

00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:59,870
great yeah that'd be what I want

00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:24,250
log into that

00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:36,150
same seen walking experiencing piles

00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:46,169
as it stands right now how brandable is

00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:48,210
a logger portal not well I mean it's all

00:34:46,169 --> 00:34:52,559
CSS of stuff there's provided by the REM

00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:54,240
so if you branded it and then yes right

00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:57,300
but it's not it's all they wanted

00:34:54,240 --> 00:35:00,240
package except I'm sure that these are

00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:02,819
the package before my mind are beneath

00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,869
right it's old invited it's just like we

00:35:02,819 --> 00:35:07,230
would all over the place in the same

00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:10,170
it's just about the places have her back

00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:12,540
you so you get regular pleasure with you

00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:14,930
it's not like it's not nothing hard

00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,930
coded

00:35:27,619 --> 00:35:35,269
I mean I buy my own for passive reset

00:35:29,869 --> 00:35:38,749
for ipho Dora how does it change drawer

00:35:35,269 --> 00:35:41,900
because they're a change yeah computer

00:35:38,749 --> 00:35:44,150
will attempt by brethren so it is create

00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:47,630
your own templates directory don't eat

00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:48,330
by the hour tianjin education support

00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:52,160
theater

00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:52,160
director okay great

00:35:56,349 --> 00:36:00,999
I don't wanna turn my new sources of

00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:03,160
error log in society so they don't know

00:36:00,999 --> 00:36:08,739
yeah absolutely that's the whole point

00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:17,589
yeah that's why take an elevator I

00:36:08,739 --> 00:36:21,329
gather yeah okay so Cody peace they're

00:36:17,589 --> 00:36:21,329
really important factor out for me

00:36:40,329 --> 00:36:48,560
so what about SPS that require

00:36:44,109 --> 00:36:51,250
multi-factor like AWS I've got quality

00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,250
then of course

00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:56,690
so that thing would require

00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:06,170
yes

00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,210
this

00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:17,940
probably is that

00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:25,369
but you don't have anything

00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:31,940
yes if you have your own

00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:46,590
this is not

00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:55,440
so on

00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:06,430
they've got a whole team of a management

00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,680
system where you can say requiring a

00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:11,809
picked up right either using this know

00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:18,029
like you're using on the big men

00:38:11,809 --> 00:38:19,380
so they probably just so much that's how

00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:21,150
you work in San what we had a bunch of

00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:23,180
assertion and

00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:23,180
Oh

00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:27,780
and they also felt IEDs okay

00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,650
but

00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:41,099
and if somebody else

00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:53,510
well you couldn't force it out that the

00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:53,510
cycle theory if you want to

00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:11,660
and sometimes not just like

00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:17,790
No

00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,849
so

00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:30,310
they're going to any sort of

00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:33,130
self-service in its long to do things

00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:36,810
like my log in order like an update my

00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:36,810
email address so i can update service

00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:45,510
so about 88 right

00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:57,320
we're still on too

00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:57,320
yeah so pixel on itself

00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:16,230
you know

00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:34,810
by that that start with something

00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:34,810
specific that song that would be

00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:46,640
well we can we prefer that because this

00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:46,640
more natural

00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:58,630
I'm going to get there but for opening

00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,600
it

00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,210
well when they go to death

00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:49,859
this is

00:41:47,279 --> 00:41:59,969
so here's dear Lord and epsilon all you

00:41:49,859 --> 00:42:13,529
do is log back out Yeah right this is

00:41:59,969 --> 00:42:16,409
one right this is where you can see the

00:42:13,529 --> 00:42:18,539
portal right right so if he had taught

00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:20,459
wisdom you know all the things maybe

00:42:18,539 --> 00:42:26,359
description off the brake inside clip in

00:42:20,459 --> 00:42:26,359
any one day okay but it might be

00:42:32,609 --> 00:42:40,779
oil on that list oh he already have a

00:42:38,049 --> 00:42:43,930
ticket here yeah buddy but it's not

00:42:40,779 --> 00:42:47,589
formally open a deal no but for example

00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:50,380
we know that whoo if salon knows that IP

00:42:47,589 --> 00:42:52,210
is integrated so we could if we see that

00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:54,640
just pick one up anyway because we would

00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:55,900
have all the information and and get one

00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,430
can we said they were there your

00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:59,109
credentials your salon credential

00:42:57,430 --> 00:43:02,740
probably wouldn't let you do much today

00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:04,359
unless you've walked in with kerberos so

00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:09,480
you may afters wheel dedicated I VA

00:43:04,359 --> 00:43:09,480
which can be a little jarring probably

00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:17,770
IPA depends on the curb worst

00:43:14,859 --> 00:43:20,859
principally we return right here ain't

00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:22,869
no you need the ticket so only if you

00:43:20,859 --> 00:43:24,640
lot but then it gave you suggesting to

00:43:22,869 --> 00:43:26,920
see what's to get from one place to the

00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,990
other yeah so you would have to detect

00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:31,119
on here that you have characters in

00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:33,490
construction and then you log in and you

00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:35,609
have an IPA somewhere and we could at

00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:35,609
least

00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:48,470
it was not that we can't just otherwise

00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:48,470
you

00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:56,369
we should know whether

00:43:52,539 --> 00:43:56,369
install your salon

00:43:59,299 --> 00:44:04,400
configure justified

00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:13,070
yeah then ideas during already that my

00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:16,710
users

00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:19,380
most users can handle sir so what if

00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:26,910
there's like 10 years ago to a mic right

00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:29,100
said hey here's why is that what our

00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:36,110
level of confidence in technical terms

00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:36,110
is down to people can't remember concert

00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:40,410
they have one page they're used to going

00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:43,950
to and they have conquered parents and

00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:46,290
help desk level education bills and says

00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:49,440
here you go it's how you use this they

00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:52,070
might but actually having to go look up

00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,070
an article

00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:07,630
write what you want you'll say here's

00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:09,460
the portal you go to that and then you

00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:12,100
can follow what's on the page instead of

00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:14,260
looking up Vanessa idea at the ITP

00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:15,610
portal see you learn to get one place to

00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:19,270
do whatever's in the company and

00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:20,860
everything's linked there okay no I'm

00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:25,180
just curious and what kind of

00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:32,830
organization is it's a global media

00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:36,470
company globally a lot of technical

00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:39,430
challenges and

00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:39,430
companies

00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:49,040
Sarah I'm putting IPA out as a

00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:49,040
competitor to the global ad trust

00:45:53,849 --> 00:45:58,740
the right now is 80 and

00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:01,640
and the scene

00:46:03,859 --> 00:46:06,279
reverse

restarting back with one everything

00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:37,090
forward since then I'm not saying

00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:41,160
