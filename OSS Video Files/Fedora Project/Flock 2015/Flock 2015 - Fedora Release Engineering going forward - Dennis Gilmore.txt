Playlist: Flock 2015
Description: 
	This talk will cover the large number of changes for Fedora 23 in how we pull Fedora together. we will outline the further changes we want to make. All in the effort of making it easier, more transparent and flexible to get fedora out the door.

	00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:08,550
okay we're live I oh let's get moving

00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:33,360
we've got 45 minutes and apparently

00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:35,940
going to get kicked out at the end no

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,640
you don't all right i'm just going to

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:41,579
give a quick talk on future of Rollins

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,489
and things that we're doing and things

00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:46,550
that would like to see that not

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:52,559
necessarily going to ever happen but

00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:55,820
things I think would be nice optimism

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,820
great optimism active

00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:04,790
alright so one of the big things we've

00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:08,360
spent a lot of time in the last few

00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:11,810
months working on is punji with moods

00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:14,540
were we got a new branch of Bungie that

00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:17,720
came from the internal red hat combo

00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:20,780
stools it merged in the old bungee with

00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,790
some internals tooling so the big thing

00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,740
we get from that is that we're now

00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:27,770
instead of having just one or two people

00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:30,950
trying to keep on G working and making

00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:34,640
the isos we get a whole bunch of extra

00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:37,810
functionality and we get extra people to

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:41,840
work on the toy and less capital yeah

00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:43,220
and you know what works out and it's a

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,050
little more configurable in the output

00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:48,860
which for some of the things that we'd

00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:52,729
like to do is useful it means that you

00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:55,880
know this in ideally RL Santos and

00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:57,590
fedora will use the same to lean instead

00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,350
of three completely different sets of

00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:04,220
tooling and wasting resources and

00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:08,750
manpower on that we get a lot better

00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:13,260
logging it's going to give a quick if it

00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:15,769
will work quick show of

00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,769
that

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:26,360
from firefox here oh no how is it going

00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:31,550
to work since so this is the output of

00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:37,730
the punji logging it's going for the

00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:42,140
curb composed we get it you know login

00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:44,630
for the artist global login but the pun

00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:48,739
g login to date has been completely

00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:51,049
hidden from the view angle login esten

00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:54,500
matter too much but it's it's something

00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:57,049
that we do we get you know today the

00:02:54,500 --> 00:03:00,620
login happens on a composed box and like

00:02:57,049 --> 00:03:02,750
q ASI Cade what was this thing that they

00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:05,480
have to come to me and I have to go and

00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:08,299
find that you know with this we get

00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:09,950
logging where people can actually see it

00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:12,970
all the time it spits out some JSON

00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:15,739
files so that we can write to lean to

00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:18,620
trigger off automatic imposes or you can

00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:21,860
check what was in it you know there's a

00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:25,040
lot of extra functionality that we get

00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:28,250
it's also a lot more complex it does a

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,590
lot of its stuff in koji going forward

00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:33,019
we're wanting to look at ways where we

00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:36,650
can do more of the things in koji that

00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:39,019
the composed process does so you know it

00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:40,579
makes more transparent we can see you

00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:42,829
know you can go to cosi and say hey

00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:46,790
where was this thing rather than having

00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:49,760
to dig into other places to find it it's

00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:52,090
a very useful thing where we use the old

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,459
tune to do alpha and

00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:56,140
we're hoping we get things to the point

00:03:54,459 --> 00:04:00,370
where we can switch to using the new toy

00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:04,959
for the better release for fedora 23 and

00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:08,849
we also part of this is we end up making

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,849
rawhide look like it compose

00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:14,530
mouse cursor

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,519
so what long-term can plans want to make

00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:22,340
the compose process is completely

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:27,170
automated so that release engineering

00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:30,550
doesn't have to trigger you know start

00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:32,600
things off we you know when a build

00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:34,610
happens you know like a whoopsie build

00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,950
or a new anaconda build happens we

00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:39,020
automatically you know run a compose and

00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:42,610
then we can throw it for a test suite

00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:45,380
and make sure that you know that works

00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:47,990
want to reuse the processes as much as

00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:49,970
we can want to do composes all the time

00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:52,040
you know ideally we get rid of the

00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:55,220
nightly like we're hiding branch

00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:59,420
composed and we do them on an as-needed

00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:01,520
basis so that you know a gift anaconda

00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:03,620
changes every day we get a new build

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,550
every day but if you know the things in

00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:11,180
the output don't change we just don't do

00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:14,020
anything you know it's only when the

00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:16,790
stuff that goes into the you know the

00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:18,410
deliverables changes that we actually do

00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:20,890
it and ideally we do it much more

00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,890
frequently

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,550
ideally it would be every time that a

00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:32,200
package on the sub deliverable changes I

00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:35,830
mean most of that stuff doesn't really

00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:38,500
change that much and you know we would

00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:41,230
be gating so that if there's a composing

00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:43,690
process we're not going to do another

00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:45,760
one but once it's done if there's five

00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:48,460
things that need that say that needs you

00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,620
compose we do those five things and we

00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:52,810
only do you know I get the only thing

00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,970
that changes is a known package we only

00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:58,120
go and you know make the gnomon story

00:05:54,970 --> 00:06:01,270
and the known and the works dork station

00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,340
in sultry and the workstation live CD

00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:04,990
and that's it we don't make all the

00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:07,000
other things we only make the

00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:12,910
deliverables that have a changed content

00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:20,050
in it that you know in order to be able

00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:22,090
to do some of this yeah how you going to

00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:27,160
fix assigning the terrible terrible

00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:30,490
zombie noises to do I mean we've been

00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:34,080
working on the auto sinus stuff which is

00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:36,340
generally more broken than working but

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:42,490
ideally we need a way to be able to sign

00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:44,260
stuff and trust that it you know yeah I

00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:46,000
mean we need to define what what does it

00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:49,720
mean to be for the package to be signed

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,220
yeah at the moment it's the you know if

00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:55,530
the package is signed away like saying

00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:59,560
this is good this is from us longer term

00:06:55,530 --> 00:07:01,900
perhaps it's just a means to verify that

00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,830
this thing actually came from fedora but

00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,660
you two

00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:07,600
like we would sign the metadata or we

00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:09,880
would do some other kind of process

00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:14,410
where you can have a better verification

00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:15,730
of what you know the content is you know

00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:17,190
the real content from us and not

00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:19,720
something that someone's maliciously

00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:21,790
encouraging I mean it just means that we

00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:24,760
would trust the keys a little less that

00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:27,250
signs of packages rather than you know

00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,810
and maybe then we only have a key

00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:32,260
instead of changing the key every

00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:34,120
release and yeah I mean this is the Sun

00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:38,920
infrastructure is pretty horrible and it

00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:42,040
breaks frequently but I was asking that

00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:44,200
is the place to you know how we would I

00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:46,340
send stop counting like the Saudi youth

00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,590
destruction Android

00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:50,930
I mean no one's working on the Sun in

00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:55,190
infrastructure at all so if anyone wants

00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:57,889
something unsexy and difficult to work

00:07:55,190 --> 00:08:04,699
on I gotta sign in server we could do

00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:09,320
with some love yeah this is I mean

00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:11,180
single is when it was written it was net

00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:14,900
it was right after the incident and it

00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:16,610
was a necessary thing but it's kind of

00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,970
being written and put there and being

00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,970
left alone

00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:24,910
No

00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:42,000
yeah it's sigil is completely Python

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:44,670
code yeah I can't you do the work I can

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:50,360
point you did research isn't that why

00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:52,050
you're doing a lot of the way and I ok

00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,810
so you know I want to make sure

00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:57,540
everything is consistent we want to

00:08:54,810 --> 00:09:00,690
enable a framework for supporting

00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:02,790
different product lifecycles it kind of

00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:05,540
comes back to the whole ring stuff you

00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:07,430
know today we don't have a good way to

00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:09,810
say you know we want to support

00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:11,670
workstation for six months and we want

00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:14,850
to support server for 18 months we just

00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:16,770
we have no way to do we can say at the

00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:18,540
end of six months all these things that

00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:21,510
cut off and we need to have a good way

00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:23,250
to define the different range the

00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:25,230
different products the different pieces

00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:27,330
you know part of that comes down to if

00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:30,270
we want to automate you know and just we

00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:32,610
go well this package in the workstations

00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:34,170
changed make the workstation things we

00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:41,160
need to know what's in that so that the

00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:45,420
tooling and the processes can run but we

00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:47,580
need to have a way so that we can you

00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:50,580
know like once the workstation product

00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:52,680
is end of life in six months we cut off

00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:54,660
all the get branches so that you know I

00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,700
mean they exist but you can't you know

00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:59,160
commit to it you got two builds from it

00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:01,680
you can't try to push updates from that

00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,330
kind of stuff so that you can we can say

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,550
you know workstation is support of six

00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:06,780
months that's it fighting in fedora 23

00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:08,370
on and

00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:10,980
you know maybe longer done where you

00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:12,660
just want to get away from having you

00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,760
know like release numbers and do

00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:16,760
different levels of rolling releases

00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:20,250
where we have you know stable a

00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:22,860
ultra-stable and development and you

00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:25,560
know we just kind of promote things at

00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:28,200
different stages and make you know the

00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:30,810
more stable ones have a lot less churn

00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:33,270
and a lot you know let's change but you

00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:36,150
know like once every six months we

00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:38,010
promote a whole bunch of stuff and you

00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:40,230
know people do it they yum update or

00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:42,570
they get you know the wrong that packing

00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:45,090
a package kit says hey you've got you

00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:47,430
know there's a big update here in this

00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:49,800
you know 500 packages and that's it

00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:53,670
where you know we make things a little

00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:55,040
easier but you know to be able to

00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:57,650
support like the different rings

00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:01,260
concepts and you know like anaconda and

00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:04,170
the bass like OS you want that to never

00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:06,180
be broken you know like ideal get to a

00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:09,450
point where you know like row height is

00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:12,330
never broken because we make sure that

00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:14,730
anytime somebody pushes a package in

00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:18,660
update in the effort bumps or so name

00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:21,540
and say well if I see you or something

00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:22,920
that is part of intimate or that's part

00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:27,720
of install a bit if it's part of ends

00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:30,270
you know that core group and we detected

00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,790
the surnames bumped we then create a

00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:34,290
side tag and we go off and you know

00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:36,780
trigger builds for everything that

00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:38,970
builds against that in the site AG and

00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:40,780
we don't allow it to get merged until

00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:43,990
nothing's broken

00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:45,970
and that way we can be more sure I mean

00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:48,750
it's going to slow down something's

00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:51,280
getting in but it's not really because

00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:54,010
you when you push something in this

00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:56,950
broken that then means that nothing else

00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:58,330
is able to work and you know you've got

00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:00,160
to go and build these things you can't

00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:02,470
actually install it and do the updates

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,150
until everything's built against it

00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:06,850
anyway so if we just push it off the

00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:11,170
site and make it easier to have people

00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:13,210
do those things on the side or yeah well

00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:15,070
instead of having the other no se tags

00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:17,110
you know they built the first time pack

00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:18,700
gives a break stuff we put it on the

00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:20,980
side automatically incorrect and the

00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:24,970
automated systems do all that kind of

00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:28,170
stuff for us you know it's something

00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:31,630
that one needs to be sat down and you

00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:33,880
know going through a lot more and come

00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:36,550
up with a plan and get resources because

00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:40,270
it's way more than you know the railings

00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:43,030
team of which was one is now like four

00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:46,480
people it's way more than we can take on

00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:49,720
and it involves a lot more than just

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:52,600
your l engine needs what a Q and Q a

00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:56,140
buy-in because without automated qaa

00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:59,590
tests that we can trigger doing things

00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:02,440
on and you know pushing out things only

00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:03,680
when they've passed the QA test we can't

00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,170
do it so you know

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:09,920
need to work with QA and get a

00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:12,800
consistent cohesive plan as a project to

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,500
ensure that you know things can run

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,390
smoother and faster I mean ideally I'd

00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:19,670
like to push updates when they come out

00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:22,730
you know when when you go to boda and

00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:24,350
you say you know push this to stable it

00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:26,570
goes that automatically runs a bunch of

00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:27,980
tests and make sure that you know some

00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:30,440
sanity checking that nothing's broken

00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:33,260
but then pushes it out and it's pretty

00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,880
transparent ideally we push a lot less

00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:37,670
updates and we do today because I think

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:41,270
we push way way too many updates I mean

00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:45,740
by the time fedora when he got two wards

00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:48,350
end of life I think the fedora 20

00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:53,480
updates repo was somewhere in the

00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:55,399
vicinity of about 10 gig it was quite

00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,950
you know what honey was a little bit

00:13:55,399 --> 00:14:01,010
interesting because 21 had such a long

00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:04,550
cycle right I where'd it end our saying

00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:06,320
21 from 18 minus 20 in night in night 19

00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:10,000
and 20 ended up being supported for

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:14,089
about 19 months as opposed to 13

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,510
actively but even I mean 21 to that

00:14:14,089 --> 00:14:19,760
today is pretty large and the process

00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:22,400
for us to push updates takes about eight

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,830
to ten hours we just don't have a good

00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:28,560
way to get things out quickly we need to

00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:31,110
sit down and you know relook at that

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,330
I want to integrate secondary arches but

00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:34,800
as I said for a long time I want you

00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,420
know when we do a compose I want to do

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,000
the composer of the second I

00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:43,080
think the best way for us to do that is

00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,089
probably to bring the building of the

00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:47,910
secondary arches into the primary Koji

00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:50,550
and I mean my initial thought was to

00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:52,110
keep it at the Koji's as it is and you

00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:53,400
know right part to lean and stuff to

00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:55,620
just go off and do the things on the

00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,150
different arches but you know after

00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:59,760
talking with Peter and some other people

00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:02,370
I think the best option is bring the

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:06,480
building of everything in and use the

00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:09,480
toy as part of like defining that you

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:12,270
know this is and it kind of makes a lot

00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:15,960
more sense with the 686 talk of having

00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:18,870
you know some parts of 32-bit x86 no

00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:22,110
longer be in prime rate if we have the

00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:23,640
tooling that defines you know in a thing

00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:25,860
that defines what is you know fedora

00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:30,360
what's in the different pieces we can

00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:32,880
then say workstation x86 64 is primary

00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:39,260
and that's it server you know we're

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:43,170
going to have a out 64 maybe PPC exit

00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:45,840
you know the concept thing we're going

00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:48,450
to uncouple the concept

00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:51,210
of college ebay and where the ecology

00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:53,970
exists from whether it's a primary

00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:57,420
architect rebel now so and then demonic

00:15:53,970 --> 00:16:01,320
a edition so you could make promote

00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:05,850
peyote on turning to bed to Prime

00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:09,660
program simp you can divide 32-bit x86

00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:11,700
server to secondary right and because

00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:15,210
you're basically uncoupling the concept

00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:17,460
of Koji and the bills in deep vs. right

00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:19,440
a primary limit there we are then the

00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:22,470
tooling that you know creates fedora

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,880
it's the thing that you know what

00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:26,790
defines is what spraying on what

00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:29,580
secondary is where do we ship it do we

00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:32,190
you know do we push it to a stage do we

00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:34,050
push it to fedora secondary do we push

00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:37,580
it to the main fedora you know repoed

00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:40,350
what the thing then would define it is

00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:42,750
you know the toiling puts the things

00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:44,460
into the different places and how we

00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:47,580
ship it is what defines what's primary

00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:51,480
and secondary re-edited or even from the

00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:53,940
site it's more policy defines yeah I'm

00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:56,270
reading right and Eric and the tooling

00:16:53,940 --> 00:17:00,180
such as Koji and the release engineering

00:16:56,270 --> 00:17:04,440
is adjusted to do that and basically the

00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:06,300
difference thing is I know whether it

00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,280
goes to this area or whether it's

00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:11,580
promoted on the website and as opposed

00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:14,700
to you know at the moment things are

00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:16,980
being dictated by what these are they

00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:20,880
dictated by schools now that shouldn't

00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:23,370
be dictated by tools that we don't have

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,040
a lot of flexibility and a lot of the

00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:28,380
things that we've done because we wrote

00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:31,920
the tooling and we started doing the

00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:35,880
record processes when we did fedora core

00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:37,650
staff at our seven and we're using the

00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:40,980
same tool in same processes and when

00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:43,320
with older things on and it's time we

00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:45,990
kind of just sit back and go we need to

00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:49,370
reevaluate how we do this because longer

00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:49,370
term it's just not working

00:17:54,280 --> 00:18:04,760
yep because important what you see

00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:07,340
everywhere actually support building and

00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:11,240
the anything else distance the thing I

00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:14,740
found in the five or so years of I've

00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:17,390
dealt with like 9 x86 arches in flora

00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:20,320
there's been a number of times where

00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:23,000
we've discovered some showing issues on

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,970
million 36 arches that are in fact

00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,750
fairly major problems on x86 is level

00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:32,630
and we often go find out about until

00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:37,280
late wrong because the secondaries by

00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:42,490
definition like and so at the core but

00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:45,890
flora call central videos ultimately

00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:49,190
having a secondary arches in there or

00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:52,550
the 9 x86 arches email actually will

00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:56,380
provide or does provide value to counter

00:18:52,550 --> 00:19:01,269
86 arches as well

00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:01,269
things like a sec square

00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,799
subdivision

00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:10,470
the electrical is just a couple asked me

00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:13,049
for trying to bring the dependency

00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:15,299
center under it will install or base but

00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:18,690
remember it's all wobbly device but we

00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:21,620
always have to focus every tues a year I

00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,620
would ever like that

00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:27,180
and there's no formal in case another

00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:29,340
what we expect to be it's not a

00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:31,080
graduated four years in fedora it do

00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:34,110
something like your we're constantly

00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:38,690
yeah and but it is something on dealing

00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:40,590
with on I relates to release very ad hoc

00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:43,790
yeah whatever you sitting there

00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:43,790
basically playing whack-a-mole

00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:57,590
when we know there's no small module

00:19:49,009 --> 00:20:00,629
have small piece which I'm going to read

00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:03,000
you know I know there are other things

00:20:00,629 --> 00:20:05,250
that break when it explodes because like

00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,409
the fedora our men will build with

00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:09,600
shrunk it down to enough but basically

00:20:07,409 --> 00:20:12,059
if something explodes it starts to fail

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,799
because it doesn't fit in that the other

00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:16,529
payment place we have for it yet plus

00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:19,500
it's fairly a hothead yeah if you don't

00:20:16,529 --> 00:20:21,870
make you don't know that today when we

00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:24,659
do like the branched or the rawhide

00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:26,639
compose we get we run repo diff which

00:20:24,659 --> 00:20:28,860
says these are the packages that changed

00:20:26,639 --> 00:20:31,200
and this is their size but it doesn't

00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:35,250
consider you know on this package added

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:37,230
5 or 10 dependencies or whatever and we

00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,580
get the broken dependencies well ideally

00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:40,850
we don't ever have the broken

00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:45,480
dependencies get out to the real world

00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:47,309
and you know if if we have the tooling

00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:50,399
and the processes in place where we know

00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:54,120
what goes into everything we can then

00:20:50,399 --> 00:20:57,539
write a tooling all right reporting that

00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:59,070
you know we can go you know between this

00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:01,620
workstation composing this workstation

00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:04,440
compose these three packages were added

00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:07,440
and as part of how you know like nightly

00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,960
or automate our compose process we can

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,879
you know the output part of it can be

00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,799
you know these are the these are the

00:21:11,879 --> 00:21:16,019
packages yeah this is the repo diff

00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:18,000
between what change but in these

00:21:16,019 --> 00:21:20,820
deliverables these are the things that

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,220
changed in that yeah so you so you can

00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:26,970
see real easily that you know Oh

00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:29,730
somebody you know changed gee lip which

00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:30,680
added dependencies on a whole stack up

00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:34,610
oh and this

00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:37,730
and these situations i might add for 300

00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:40,250
packages other than when i did the

00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:42,500
biggest receiving of taking here's where

00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:45,020
i believe on in parallel with the CI

00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:47,620
talk yeah but one of the missing pieces

00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:51,320
here is how you find these things during

00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:58,100
so the little developers might be about

00:21:51,320 --> 00:22:00,920
precisa an exercise this year the coach

00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:03,140
i see i do at least as far as i know

00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:05,960
it's mostly trying to preemptively

00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:09,650
detect fast food from sauce so when you

00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:13,820
know GCC changes it rebuilds everything

00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:16,790
that they use GCC and it takes is a

00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:19,490
little bit bumpy it addresses some of

00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:23,440
the issues but it doesn't address all of

00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:23,440
the issues you still need the same

00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:34,669
yeah I know that it's discussion about

00:22:29,439 --> 00:22:37,669
like bringing those pages by I know in

00:22:34,669 --> 00:22:40,999
the enterprise product i discovered a

00:22:37,669 --> 00:22:44,749
bunch of values of course stuff just

00:22:40,999 --> 00:22:47,089
before the last or what fairly close to

00:22:44,749 --> 00:22:49,219
future of the last words going out and

00:22:47,089 --> 00:22:50,869
there are stuff like that but I we

00:22:49,219 --> 00:22:53,749
should have been getting applicant

00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:55,669
widget built so that you know the

00:22:53,749 --> 00:22:58,749
developers are aware but that's exactly

00:22:55,669 --> 00:22:58,749
the same in fedora

00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:13,010
people

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,080
hostilities

00:23:25,549 --> 00:23:34,009
and that this proper security tests that

00:23:28,789 --> 00:23:38,330
we do I pay you at a time gender to look

00:23:34,009 --> 00:23:41,809
at functionalities yeah but this is a

00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:44,600
big mouth the knowledge of the software

00:23:41,809 --> 00:23:46,610
is out there yeah and completely open

00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,409
but the knowledge of how to use it

00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:50,149
affected your little walk up inside

00:23:48,409 --> 00:23:51,889
that's why well yeah it's a recent

00:23:50,149 --> 00:23:54,080
redheaded step but how to use it from

00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:56,840
yeah but I mean a pyramid is a fireable

00:23:54,080 --> 00:24:00,559
who don't get had a lot of effective

00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:02,509
communication around had some channel or

00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:06,049
the XY like that because every time I

00:24:02,509 --> 00:24:09,230
just go to use we drive sort of had

00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:12,920
other issues aside prefer got dis

00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:15,130
implicitly things that we've just got

00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,130
but

00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:21,860
what for me

00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:21,860
getting salad with it Alex move that all

00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:29,240
very advanced capabilities of people at

00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:31,399
he was the front end of an advance of

00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,400
all debt and growing and reinvention at

00:24:31,399 --> 00:24:37,450
that

00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:39,040
I we're good at written deciding though

00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:41,290
this isn't work right and rather than

00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:45,070
figuring it out just reinventing

00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:47,560
something but there's this QA test that

00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:49,360
we could run as early as when you commit

00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:51,700
yeah as soon as you commits though

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:54,100
especially if you push a new towel to

00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:56,410
leukocyte cash we should unpack the tar

00:24:54,100 --> 00:25:00,940
ball and run a license check on it and

00:24:56,410 --> 00:25:02,770
see if any licenses have changed and you

00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:07,540
know there's a lot of QA stuff that we

00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:10,240
should be doing that we don't because we

00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:13,090
just have never done any kind of cycles

00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,710
yeah they're only so many of us working

00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:16,690
out test automation it but people want

00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:20,410
to help I'm more than happy to get some

00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:22,830
of that stuff working but we're busy

00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:25,630
just trying to get the structure of

00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:27,760
every even my some of the tosca Tron

00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:30,790
stuff that gets around once you create

00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:32,800
an update that's almost to wait for that

00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:34,450
time is not limited to just one yup they

00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:38,140
scream all right on top of that message

00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:41,410
the whole design that is hey you made it

00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:44,980
and leukocyte cash doesn't actually come

00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:47,230
to arrest me to have anything it is just

00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:49,060
running stuff on cookie building up its

00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:51,230
right now but it's not limited to that

00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:56,480
no reason totally doing that

00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:58,520
so much actual test shots yeah yeah but

00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:02,360
I mean general way to read that is

00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:05,630
always looking at they get commitments

00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:08,030
things like that that's happening in the

00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:09,230
open which means the door copies well

00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:14,320
you know a lot of cases were not even

00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:18,559
aware who's the third owner I'm here

00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:20,660
there's a lot of good ideas and as he

00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:24,740
said you have more people in reality we

00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:27,080
have you know how to make whatever this

00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:29,700
is way more stuff when we

00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:32,640
alright so what's that down figured out

00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:34,620
like concrete road network hierarchy is

00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,540
that easily think we're going to be with

00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:39,660
the next two months or do we just have

00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:46,500
this a good intention not at all to

00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:51,240
norwell and we have a very depart yeah

00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:56,010
yeah well what do you want yeah we're

00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:58,560
using tiger my English and we're using

00:26:56,010 --> 00:27:10,400
target to do product management and we

00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:15,300
have like daily scrums and it's also

00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:19,700
it's one place it's one place where you

00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:22,730
know with we're trying to be much more

00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:25,440
transparent and better about what would

00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:27,870
you know what we're doing and you know I

00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,040
mean it's a lot of change when pulling

00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:31,860
some of the people that have only ever

00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:34,040
worked inside of red hat into doing

00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:37,500
stuff because they use the toy

00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:40,530
internally you know the guys at work on

00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:42,690
the bungee code internally we're pulling

00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:45,420
them into doing stuff in fedora because

00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:47,820
you know fedora and ghrelin now going to

00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:52,760
be using the same tools to be creating

00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:52,760
the OS I was just

00:27:54,900 --> 00:28:05,800
says hang out in meetings right yeah the

00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:08,680
wiki hasn't been updated the older scrum

00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:11,800
stuff started in the last six weeks and

00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:15,750
the wiki page is probably like two years

00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,750
added since it's been edited

00:28:19,929 --> 00:28:32,090
cific or back to the good ideas and

00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:36,000
reality I think there needs to be some

00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:43,600
significant policy changes in

00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:45,309
it takes that is just 0 but most of it

00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:48,850
to stop running in the background but

00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:50,860
it's what he eats fire depth H my house

00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:53,320
is crazy yeah and it's never slowed down

00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:56,740
look ever since we merged coordinate

00:28:53,320 --> 00:29:02,140
it's been said oh has that ever been

00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:03,790
discussed it has been and you there's a

00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:05,440
little bit with a little bit opinions

00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:07,450
about a very strong work and usually

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,429
well i would say i would say you know

00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:12,100
obviously a lot of static chain teens

00:29:09,429 --> 00:29:13,420
use the updates models you push things

00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:16,390
on their room staff or where i find

00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:17,740
things like properties that they can do

00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:20,070
that on their own you can say what

00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:25,780
updates are going to be security

00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:34,410
interview I think that yesterday I did

00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:34,410
this I think that something that doesn't

00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:42,730
big big way to change that is to change

00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:45,820
rawhide if we can make royal hi to the

00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:47,559
point where you know I think we'll have

00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:49,570
to rebrand role hide it in the process

00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:52,120
because raw head has this conversation

00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:56,910
that it kills babies it kills kittens it

00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:59,980
does you know it still do that right but

00:29:56,910 --> 00:30:01,710
so i think that like by Reba I think

00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:04,090
it's part of it will need to rebrand

00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:09,450
rawhide to something else so that

00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:13,210
invited releases yeah but making sure

00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:15,610
make me isn't like you make making sure

00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:18,190
that at least the cool part is never

00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:20,110
broken and the outer rings you know we

00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:22,420
may go yo sup its and service stuff it's

00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:25,030
in workstation stuff that's in cloud and

00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:27,340
stuff that's in the core ring it can

00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:30,130
never be broken if it's work you know if

00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:31,929
you're up take breaks up then it's going

00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:34,179
to get pushed on to the side and we have

00:30:31,929 --> 00:30:36,880
to have a policy engine that deals with

00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:38,100
what we do based on that you know the

00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,090
leaf stuff if it breaks it breaks

00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:44,630
whatever

00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:47,360
but by making the core really solid and

00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:51,559
stable and ensuring that it never breaks

00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:53,000
i doing that then you know we'll give

00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:55,220
the incentive to the developers that

00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,950
that's where they want to be so then

00:30:55,220 --> 00:31:00,110
they push their stuff only so that you

00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:03,320
know only to the you know the

00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:04,549
development branch and that's where you

00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,020
know that's where they stay long as I'm

00:31:04,549 --> 00:31:10,190
is in the development branch and the

00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:11,870
stable stuff then by nature people you

00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:13,429
know the developers not being the one's

00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:16,340
using it but Dad years has been the ones

00:31:13,429 --> 00:31:20,299
that use it it's likely to only get bug

00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:23,179
fixes and security fixes so I agree with

00:31:20,299 --> 00:31:25,220
that I don't know that it's you know

00:31:23,179 --> 00:31:27,049
like a perfect answer but well no no i

00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:28,480
think i think that's that's definitely

00:31:27,049 --> 00:31:31,030
what we should be starting for it really

00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,679
over the past however many years I think

00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:36,490
that's what if you are up the assistant

00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:39,940
has organically grown into it was that

00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:43,530
it's basically brought the concept of

00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:43,530
the unstable unstable branch

00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:57,289
if we can get people to the other thing

00:31:52,029 --> 00:31:58,909
I think that we if we put enough you

00:31:57,289 --> 00:32:01,490
know automated stuff we're out of it

00:31:58,909 --> 00:32:04,070
we're your people who don't go oh it's a

00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:05,779
two block it you know every time I push

00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:08,090
something it gets pushed off the side I

00:32:05,779 --> 00:32:10,100
have to go do if you make things too

00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:13,549
hard people are just going to complain

00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:15,830
and push back and it has to work and it

00:32:13,549 --> 00:32:18,679
has to be quick and it has to not get in

00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:21,049
people's word but if we can do that then

00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:23,929
I think that you know that'll be the

00:32:21,049 --> 00:32:25,880
place where people should be and I think

00:32:23,929 --> 00:32:27,559
that is it there's so much inbuilt

00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:29,510
negative connotation with the name of

00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:31,610
rawhide that you know it's part of doing

00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:34,159
that I mean maybe we keep right where we

00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:37,669
just keep shoving stuff and we kind of

00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:40,760
ignore it you know I mean Susan kind of

00:32:37,669 --> 00:32:43,789
did the same thing they against

00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:46,549
tumbleweed the you know fairly stable

00:32:43,789 --> 00:32:48,110
they run a bunch of water here they do

00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:50,120
the complete they do like four or five

00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:52,610
composers a day when I was talking to

00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:55,370
them and they run it through what I QA

00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:56,929
and it's only once they've installed it

00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:59,870
you know went through their Testaments

00:32:56,929 --> 00:33:02,120
all sweet stuff that they then make that

00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:04,309
available and that's you know slight

00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:06,740
delay in that but it means it's a better

00:33:04,309 --> 00:33:08,390
you know but they still have the factory

00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:09,779
where they just shove all this stuff and

00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:12,479
you can use it if you want

00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:18,499
yeah well every left that model work

00:33:12,479 --> 00:33:18,499
smell similar concept

00:33:20,179 --> 00:33:24,930
No

00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:28,170
the problem was doing after the release

00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:31,260
level something great and we then have

00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:33,500
to fix it you have no release for two

00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,500
weeks

00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:38,590
telepathic level they

00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,630
the rest

00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:46,960
and so yeah I mean the thing would be

00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:49,180
that like once the builds done it needs

00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,800
to run some suite of tests you know like

00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:53,170
check so names you know if the surname

00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:55,330
bump it happens way down low in the

00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:57,010
chain you want to push that off to the

00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:59,860
side and get everything built against it

00:33:57,010 --> 00:34:01,630
and not push it in until it's done so in

00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:03,580
theory you're always going to have

00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:05,620
something out there and it's going to

00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:08,649
happen you know frequently because stuff

00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:10,810
is changing but you you know there may

00:34:08,649 --> 00:34:12,730
be things in the pipeline that are

00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:16,060
happening on the side that as they you

00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:20,169
know at least unbreak stuff and can then

00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:22,659
come in so the what would be raw hide or

00:34:20,169 --> 00:34:25,720
whatever you know replaces will hide

00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:27,130
would be this stable thing that's at

00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:30,490
least the core part of it is never

00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:32,080
broken and you know if someone pushes

00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:34,810
the change that breaks that core part of

00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:37,000
it it gets pushed off to the side where

00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:38,980
you know can be dealt with and once it's

00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,800
dealt with it can then come in but not

00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:43,990
until it's being dealt with properly so

00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:47,110
we don't just shove this up in and go oh

00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:49,540
crap this work boil and then we get into

00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:52,600
the situation where you know anaconda

00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:56,080
can be media we can create an installer

00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:58,120
for three weeks because the package set

00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:02,320
that gets installed in for the Anaconda

00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:06,970
runtime doesn't DEP solve which they

00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:09,310
happen easy I mean such as dnf but

00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:13,869
I mean it it happens that you know

00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:16,150
people tend to be overzealous with what

00:35:13,869 --> 00:35:18,220
they push and they don't necessarily

00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:21,340
realize that you know by pushing this

00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:31,990
thing it actually affects these you know

00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:33,880
50 other things that use it because I

00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:36,010
mean not there's anybody what to eat

00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:38,230
right little bit less there's a whole

00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:42,490
bunch of projects it should be you know

00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:45,340
doing a whole bunch of CI stuff on their

00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:47,970
source before they even cut at our water

00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:50,349
pushing us around here so that they know

00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:54,330
before they even do that but they're

00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:57,250
absolutely broken behavior and I mean if

00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:59,260
upstream projects whether a red hat or

00:35:57,250 --> 00:36:01,570
otherwise aren't doing that we have a

00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:02,350
number of our the product problems that

00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:06,760
I'm fortune

00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:08,920
range can't fix you know even with you

00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:12,700
know people send the emails to managers

00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:14,590
to on you know range it doesn't

00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:16,960
help because it's not something that we

00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:23,080
could not effectively we have the topic

00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:26,770
of all time energy on the they have

00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:30,190
cultures where he is our something most

00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:37,810
people if you get our aromatics would be

00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:41,520
very good yep typically yet to get and

00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:41,520
that's Tina's model yeah

00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:47,630
yeah i mean the tunes not going to fix

00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:50,930
it with the tooling and the process that

00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:53,480
detects it and and then you have the

00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:55,369
have it have a policy of engine of some

00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:59,000
description that goes well this is in

00:36:55,369 --> 00:37:00,770
ring 0 it can never be broken let's take

00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,530
it onto the site here let's either

00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:05,960
automatically rebuild things or send

00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:08,270
notifications to people that hey this

00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:10,369
thing has had its own a bump so if we

00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:13,550
did if we detect as soon as it's bill

00:37:10,369 --> 00:37:15,500
that it's broken stuff we can then you

00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:17,840
know deal with it before it ever become

00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:20,840
something that's visible to you know the

00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:22,670
users and we can you know highlight to

00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:26,119
the developers that this change you just

00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:29,359
pushed is caused you know these 50

00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:32,200
things to break and you know deal with

00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:32,200
it deal with it appropriately

00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:41,750
so got a bunch of ways to get there

00:37:38,829 --> 00:37:43,700
hopefully Koji to will enable us to do a

00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:46,250
lot more of the composed stuff inside of

00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:49,640
goji what I to which is going to be

00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:51,619
deployed next week means that oh yeah

00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:53,900
next we kind of kind of deploy gratitude

00:37:51,619 --> 00:38:07,670
it should mean that we have a bit more

00:37:53,900 --> 00:38:09,050
flexibility with our updates so I just

00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:10,970
wanted to give you a heart attack and

00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:15,170
you know all the work we're doing it and

00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:17,570
punji you know we need to be able to

00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:20,630
quickly iterate over everything we need

00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:22,609
to have like which I think we're going

00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:26,680
to go with the product definition center

00:38:22,609 --> 00:38:28,880
at least to look at it as a tool that

00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:31,099
defines what goes into each of the

00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,589
products so that we can keep track of

00:38:31,099 --> 00:38:36,890
you know what goes into composes what

00:38:33,589 --> 00:38:39,290
came out of it we can you know gets up

00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:41,869
implementing the things to give us the

00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:43,339
ability to implement rings and define

00:38:41,869 --> 00:38:45,440
what's in each of the different products

00:38:43,339 --> 00:38:48,800
and be able to support different life

00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:50,869
cycles and all that kind of stuff maybe

00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:53,180
dhaka i just throw it in that because

00:38:50,869 --> 00:38:55,239
it's the cool thing and we need to be

00:38:53,180 --> 00:39:03,049
willing to fail

00:38:55,239 --> 00:39:04,609
yeah we need we need to be willing to

00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:08,029
fail we need to try things and then go

00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:10,279
you know this didn't work let's take a

00:39:08,029 --> 00:39:12,019
step back and reevaluate it historically

00:39:10,279 --> 00:39:14,420
we have not done a good job of that it's

00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:16,279
like we've got to keep this sucker in a

00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:17,329
big huge big locomotive and we're going

00:39:16,279 --> 00:39:18,739
to keep it moving and we're just going

00:39:17,329 --> 00:39:21,619
to keep it moving we kind of a stop it

00:39:18,739 --> 00:39:26,739
we can't ever take it backwards and you

00:39:21,619 --> 00:39:26,739
know we need to become do that anymore

00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:36,140
range are positive signs

00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:47,030
yeah and so it the bungee who triggers

00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:48,910
off like wife CD built appliance well

00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:52,550
it's going to check out flying towards

00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:54,560
the doctor would we we need I mean yeah

00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:59,120
we need to have for appointment because

00:39:54,560 --> 00:40:07,880
actually good right I mean so what punji

00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:11,960
is pancho g no pun gia does burlap now

00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:14,570
Framing us hey I mean a lot of the

00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:16,790
engines call out to you check for you

00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:20,000
all rights why do you know right this is

00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:22,540
asking integration this time right the

00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:26,180
integration and go do stuff first um so

00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:27,410
if if we have the ability to do each of

00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:30,200
the things I mean we need to make atomic

00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:32,210
Reapers we need to sit back and I mean

00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:35,680
we had this plan when we implemented the

00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:37,970
atomic stuff and we make the repos and

00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,350
it's really not working very well we

00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:42,440
need to step back we need to re-evaluate

00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:45,260
how we make the atomic repos how the

00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:47,750
work isn't worth it right I mean I'm

00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:51,080
asking that echoes you can build the

00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:53,510
things that funky bills we don't

00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:56,120
necessarily need punji we need to have

00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:58,010
something that orchestrates I mean and

00:40:56,120 --> 00:41:00,560
maybe we don't need punji longer-term

00:40:58,010 --> 00:41:05,360
maybe if we put everything into Koji and

00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:06,890
we have you know like in PDC and we have

00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:09,470
something that's watching it goes oh

00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:11,540
yeah this thing is just being built and

00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:14,030
it in you know in the product definition

00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:16,160
that says you know it's in the

00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:18,370
workstation let's go off and make that

00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,370
thing

00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:24,260
well we were talking to John

00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:28,299
ridiculously will pick that out from

00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:28,299
that premise QA network intrusion

00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:37,200
it may be that we don't necessarily need

00:41:32,339 --> 00:41:38,730
a punji or what punji is you know going

00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,520
forward is not going to look anything

00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:43,200
like what Bungie is today I mean

00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:45,660
ultimately you need a bunch of color to

00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:48,089
do it whether it when you get you know

00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:49,950
you all for all of these ecology or or

00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:51,900
whether it's not as fun yet I don't

00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:53,460
think it makes any differences Justin

00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:55,230
still doesn't make we're going to be a

00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:58,049
bunch of color that's similar to what it

00:41:55,230 --> 00:42:01,529
is now yes the outputs are still needs

00:41:58,049 --> 00:42:08,010
better moments yeah I to me the light of

00:42:01,529 --> 00:42:11,250
environments yeah it does it's a little

00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:13,950
clunky yeah and oh yeah I mean they're

00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:15,720
very something like you sure you can

00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:21,240
make you can pick which pile of the blue

00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:24,029
I'm not going to Cody monstera you know

00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:27,359
yeah I mean longer term you know what

00:42:24,029 --> 00:42:29,750
punji is and may not look anything like

00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:35,270
what it does today and it just may be

00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:35,270
the name that's the same like

00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:43,750
no i mean so warhead changes I'd like to

00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:47,740
make the automatics ID tags when like so

00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:50,559
names and stuff bump so that we can deal

00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:53,740
with it have automated build QA so that

00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:55,980
whenever bill is completed yeah we I

00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:58,779
mean ideally I guess in the ideal world

00:42:55,980 --> 00:43:01,420
we tag it the build when it's completed

00:42:58,779 --> 00:43:03,250
in two like a pending tag we run a bunch

00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:05,980
of automated QA we check Sona and we

00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:09,460
check you know like licenses RPM diff

00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:11,500
you know all sorts of whatever whatever

00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:13,569
tricks we can think of to run on it we

00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:16,539
sign the RPM and it's only once you know

00:43:13,569 --> 00:43:19,210
only qh positive sign it's tagged in and

00:43:16,539 --> 00:43:21,400
ideally that takes no more than you know

00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:22,900
three to five minutes because if you

00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:25,089
start adding your each too late before

00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:27,880
that field gets into build routes and

00:43:25,089 --> 00:43:30,039
stuff people will you know fight against

00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:34,900
it and complain and try to work around

00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:37,359
it and not work with us you know want to

00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:39,730
sign the rpms and ride over the years

00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:42,549
from time to time people were likewise

00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:44,470
we're all had not signed and the way

00:43:42,549 --> 00:43:49,119
everything works today it's just not

00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:51,400
possible to really do it make I want you

00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:55,480
know something that we should be turning

00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:58,029
on hopefully before f1 free better is

00:43:55,480 --> 00:44:00,579
war hide will look like a release

00:43:58,029 --> 00:44:02,609
compose we got to make the workstation

00:44:00,579 --> 00:44:05,489
edition install you know

00:44:02,609 --> 00:44:07,829
networking sultry and the delight the

00:44:05,489 --> 00:44:10,140
server deliverables like all of the

00:44:07,829 --> 00:44:15,200
things that we make as part of a release

00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:17,970
composed and it's going to be right yeah

00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,920
that that should be you know we should

00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:21,539
be making the steps in making that

00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,819
happen you know the live CDs will be on

00:44:21,539 --> 00:44:26,460
the merits and you won't have to go to

00:44:23,819 --> 00:44:29,099
Cody and go where do I find the task for

00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:38,279
the last working you know workstation

00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:40,170
live CD and stuff and fully implement

00:44:38,279 --> 00:44:44,940
the ring stuff that's been going on

00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:48,839
about for a few years now is officially

00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:54,359
lazy well what does it mean that means

00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:57,630
that you know we can we still need to

00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:59,430
define completely what oh that is but at

00:44:57,630 --> 00:45:02,999
least from my understanding like the

00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:05,489
ring 0 would be the minimal installation

00:45:02,999 --> 00:45:07,410
that and the substance in the work in

00:45:05,489 --> 00:45:10,710
the base working group of a mineral

00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:15,029
insulation anaconda and its dependencies

00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:17,670
that the costs are Bill Murray that you

00:45:15,029 --> 00:45:20,720
need to be able to run an anaconda to do

00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:20,720
a minimal install

00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:37,260
yet to be defined but yeah but yeah but

00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:41,340
did you know we kind of still need to

00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:46,350
define that we're out of time so if

00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:52,680
anyone has more questions or use a mouse

00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:54,720
clicking it's very very going to mother

00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:56,880
is their issue which is great and I want

00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:59,610
you to do it but after that the next

00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:02,880
step would be alone layer product on

00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:04,800
tops on Terra because now I'm being

00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:07,350
working on the infrastructure side and

00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,360
the problem is that we have very dif can

00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:11,750
you match the current need to write

00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:13,850
packages them

00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:16,940
right some projects are meeting theorem

00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:18,860
which is concerning well and I magic to

00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:21,770
do with at some point we'll be able to

00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:24,050
say okay you must be federal back you

00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:26,870
will be able to get producer control

00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:30,550
you're reusing reigns in sharing or it's

00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:32,840
inside separate you two and maybe maybe

00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:35,660
it's something to be looked at I mean

00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:40,040
maybe we do it as in flooring in kochi

00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:48,790
or maybe it's done in copper doesn't

00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:52,070
don't quit yet I mean having a way to do

00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:56,420
support late image stuff like my product

00:46:52,070 --> 00:47:01,510
stuff in fedora and it's something that

00:46:56,420 --> 00:47:01,510
you know is you better work yeah

00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:06,700
