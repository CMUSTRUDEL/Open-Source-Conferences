	So, you want to help spread the word about Fedora? Excellent! Let's talk about how you - yes, you! - can help Fedora win friends, influence people, and march towards world domination. This talk will be focused on specific actions that you can take to help promote Fedora.

I want to talk about today and post

00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:16,120
we've been discussing this many of us

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,650
already but I've been participating in

00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,810
open-source marketing things for a

00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:23,750
number of years I've been doing stuff

00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:25,870

years a little bit more than two years

00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:31,700
and so today I want to talk about

00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:33,530
marketing is not a spectator sport and

00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:37,550
I'll explain what I mean by that as we

00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:39,380
go through the sock so in keeping with

00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:41,300
good marketing practices how many folks

00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:34,099
person my name is Joe brockmeier I'm a

00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:36,590
recovering tech journalist I work for

00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:39,200
red hat these days I'm in the open

00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:41,959
source and standards group these days I

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,849
manage the community team before that I

00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:45,739
was working on project atomic and before

00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:48,110
that i'm sort of a open-source floater

00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:52,040
working on many things including fedora

00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:54,049
marketing so why am i giving this top my

00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,610
experience the last couple of years I've

00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:56,840
been writing the Fedora release

00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,519
announcements and things like that

00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:03,110
trying to participate in fedora

00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:04,730
marketing and I often experienced people

00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:07,010
coming to fedora marketing and saying

00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:09,470
things like marking marketing should

00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:14,060
really do this or why has it marketing

00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:15,950
come to us and I'm sure that other

00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,569
people and other groups have experienced

00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:19,280
the same thing and I'm sure that you

00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:22,160
know that's we're not exclusive to that

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,560
but a lot of things that we do in

00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,329
marketing are things that everyone in

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,370
the project should participate in for

00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:31,400
example tweeting about the

00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:33,379
the conference this is a very low energy

00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,010
task that anybody in this room with an

00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:39,409
account can do and yet most people don't

00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:41,390
so I want to encourage people to when

00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:43,489
they think about why are we doing all

00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:46,220
this great work on fedora and it's not

00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:47,840
we haven't achieved world domination at

00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:50,239
least part of that is because we have

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,959
yet to communicate our message to all

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:56,329
the people who we could so what do we

00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:58,250
mean by marketing there are textbook

00:03:56,329 --> 00:04:00,019
definitions of marketing which bruises

00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:02,150
probably far more qualified to explain

00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:04,579
than I am but when I talk about

00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:06,739
marketing in the sense of this talk I'm

00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:09,230
talking about all the things that we do

00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:10,760
to promote fedora and hopefully the

00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:12,950
future the things that we also do to

00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,810
gather feedback from users and help

00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:16,940
improve the door and make the door more

00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:18,739
awesome so that we suck in more people

00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:23,360
and eventually achieve the aforesaid

00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:25,850
world domination so the topics I want to

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,650
go through today the goals for fedora

00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:30,289
marketing as I understand them today

00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:33,370
what marketing currently does actually

00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:37,520
the activities that we take on why you

00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:39,860
yes you must help ways you can help and

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:43,160
then open floor and discussion at the

00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:45,680
time we have left so goals for fedora

00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,630
marketing I'm saying anything here

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,300
anybody strongly disagrees with police

00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:53,260
say but we want to raise awareness of

00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:55,760
fedora we want to promote the

00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:58,039
Foundation's freedom friends features

00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,780
and first we want to go out and make

00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:02,449
sure that we spread not just the

00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,230
distribution itself but the philosophy

00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:05,590
behind it

00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:08,420
we want to encourage use of and

00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:11,330
contribution to fedora and we want to

00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:13,670
gather feedback and input to the future

00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:15,290
of crew future in fedoras any did I miss

00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:19,889
anything or is any of this controversy

00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:22,650
on anyway okay

00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:25,139
so now I want to talk about a deal vs

00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:27,629
reality what does marketing do and what

00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:29,669
what does it do ideally and then what do

00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:33,659
we actually accomplish right now as a

00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:35,490
body so ideally we collaborate with all

00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:36,749
of the teams or at least most of them I

00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:39,029
don't know how much for example

00:05:36,749 --> 00:05:42,090
marketing and relatives really need to

00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:44,219
work together although probably it's a

00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:46,800
good idea of marketing has some idea

00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:48,449
what the release engineering team is

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,430
doing and they know that they can come

00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:52,199
to us if there's something that we can

00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,789
help promote but maybe release

00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:56,580
engineering and marketing don't have to

00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:58,800
be that tight designed and marketing on

00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:03,750
the other hand yes ambassadors of

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:06,199
marketing yes the work groups yes we

00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:08,219
should be developing messaging and

00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:11,729
materials for the ambassadors and the

00:06:08,219 --> 00:06:14,310
rest of the project you know matt is

00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:16,319
awesome matthew Miller is awesome and he

00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:18,629
does a great job of talking to press and

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,960
he is very situationally aware fedora

00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:23,729
but it still helps it he has somebody

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:26,610
building the talking points and things

00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:28,560
and giving him information that it is

00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:30,480
insight into things maybe he doesn't

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,970
have in fedora

00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:35,190
we should be providing an editorial

00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:38,160
strategy especially for the magazine but

00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:39,990
also otherwise when I say that I mean it

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,430
would be great if we can get to the

00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:43,410
point where not only are we writing

00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:45,270
things for fedora magazine but we have

00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:48,090
people who are ambassadors not just

00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:50,190
ambassadors that go out and go to events

00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:53,430
and talk about fedora but people who

00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:55,170
will actually go to publications outside

00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:58,110
of the Fedora landscape and write about

00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:59,910
fedora for so Linux magazine in open

00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:02,250
source com for example will take

00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:04,560
contributed content lwn will take

00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:06,210
contributed content be great if we had

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,710
people who were participating in

00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:09,840
marketing who would take it upon

00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:12,750
themselves to work with us we go out and

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,990
write about flora in those videos so we

00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:17,760
can spread the word farther we need to

00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:20,720
manage social media for fedora which

00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:24,510
we've been doing for a while we should

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:26,880
be developing surveys and administrating

00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:28,500
to users and giving that feedback to the

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,810
different groups we should be able to go

00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,320
back to cloud and help them when they

00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:35,460
write

00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:38,370
our needs if I know what a PRD is I know

00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:40,110
YouTube all product requirement document

00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:41,880
it's what we go to the council with to

00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:45,630
say this is kind of where we see this

00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:50,970
condition going okay so we actually have

00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:53,280
some you know we relate the addition and

00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:56,100
the product to reality and what we

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,870
should be trying to achieve we also

00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:00,210
should be maintaining the marketing

00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:03,300
Ricky and new contributor materials and

00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:07,230
so forth so what does marketing really

00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:10,770
do ok we kind of poke teams last minute

00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:12,840
when we need something sort of we you

00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:14,700
know i've been i've been doing the

00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:22,830
release announcements for the Alpha the

00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:24,570
beta the finals for a while and I might

00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:26,550
you know I'm always thinking like next

00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:28,140
release I'm going to go to these groups

00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:29,910
earlier and I'm going to ask her input

00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:33,120
what really happens is the week before

00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:34,950
the readiness meeting like workstation I

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,200
know you guys do something this cycle

00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:40,020
what tell me because I need input them

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,640
in Paul comes and rescues you know the

00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:45,240
only group I've really tied into right

00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:47,010
now is cloud you know so we create the

00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,450
bare minimum for content for the

00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:50,880
ambassador's usually when the

00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:53,850
ambassador's roll up and say so I at the

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,000
top tomorrow what do we got and then we

00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:59,160
scramble and try to put things together

00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,770
we manage the door magazine we're doing

00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:03,390
that kind of well I would give us at

00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:06,150
least a be right

00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:08,070
we're doing with the door magazine we do

00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:11,400
some social media stuff right now we

00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:14,150
have the talented and beautiful Brian

00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:19,880
profit is doing some work for fedora

00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:24,060
social media as an element surveys no

00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:26,220
not in several years and wiki I just

00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:30,390
seriously need a shot of scotch when I

00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:35,930
think about the state of the week is bad

00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:39,150
is what I'm saying so how would I rate

00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:42,060
fedora marketing especially relative to

00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:43,980
the other groups in fedora I I would

00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:49,410
struggle to give us a c-minus right now

00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:51,500
I and I understand all of the caveats to

00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:55,470
go with this okay I understand that

00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:57,000
we're all volunteers I mean how many of

00:09:55,470 --> 00:10:00,300
the folks that Miss Marie work for red

00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,180
hat ok how many folks have contributed

00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:06,000
to fedora marketing in some way in the

00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:07,860
last cycle okay how many people were

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,660
actually paid to do that as part of

00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,060
their day job

00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:13,819
a lot fewer hands are going to go up on

00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:16,279
that one I kinda sorta since my job

00:10:13,819 --> 00:10:17,839
description has always been big I can I

00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:20,060
can kind of say that if it's my job

00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,829
description but honestly I'm usually

00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:27,800
right in the release notes at about ten

00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:31,759
o'clock at night so it's a volunteer

00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:33,410
organization and so yeah we have a lot

00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:35,120
of room to improve but we can't crack

00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:36,970
the look too hard because everybody's

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:46,060
doing this kind of in spare cycles

00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:46,060
alright so I've kind of yeah okay

00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,610
start blowing away

00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:14,589
but I would assume a very general

00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:16,939
screaming oh yeah organized

00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:20,309
that

00:11:16,939 --> 00:11:21,540
alright so now I just I just said a

00:11:20,309 --> 00:11:22,910
bunch of things that are a little bit

00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,500
negative and you

00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:26,240
maybe people aren't feeling good about

00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,770
themselves so this is what I do when I'm

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,900
not feeling good about myself little

00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:32,740
positivity for the room and everybody

00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:37,010
just soak it up for a second positivity

00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:38,600
all right we good all right remember

00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:40,160
we're doing things in the name of open

00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,750
source and we should all be excited and

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,460
positive even when we're getting a

00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,870
little bit of negative feedback we have

00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:47,060
to remember we're fighting a good fight

00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:50,210
we're doing the good things we have to

00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:51,440
be energized and excited so now now as

00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,960
you're energized and excited to have

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:58,070
kitten power I'm going to talk about why

00:11:53,960 --> 00:12:00,740
you yes you must help marketing really

00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:01,970
needs new blood okay we have a number of

00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,620
people who have been involved in

00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:05,710
marketing and on the marketing list and

00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:08,630
participating in discussions for a while

00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:09,650
they are not sufficient there's nothing

00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:11,180
wrong with the people who are

00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:13,760
participating except that they have

00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:17,330
lives I've advised against it we get

00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,260
people insist on doing it so they have

00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:20,030
lives and they have other

00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:23,180
responsibilities that's the main problem

00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:25,790
that most of folks have and they don't

00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:27,500
have situational awareness and to all of

00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:29,810
the things in fedora we need more

00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:32,090
participation from people even if

00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:35,240
marketing is not one of your core skills

00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:37,130
you still have information and you still

00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:40,670
have the ability to help us do things

00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:43,040
okay a core group can do most of the

00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:45,590
work but many hands are needed for some

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,890
of these tasks and members of the core

00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:50,660
group often you know participate heavily

00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:53,630
in one or two cycles and then something

00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:55,250
happens they move they get married or a

00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:58,280
life change happens they get a new job

00:12:55,250 --> 00:13:00,470
and when those things disrupt the flow

00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:02,960
of contributing it's hard to get them

00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:04,460
back nothing wrong with that people

00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,440
who've in and out of open source it's

00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:08,240
fine but we have to have new people

00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:11,510
waiting to step up and take

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:14,390
rolls when that happens so Fedora is

00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:17,500
awesome we all love the door and we and

00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:20,120
I honestly think this is true the last

00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,950
two or three years of the door had just

00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,500
been an increasingly better distribution

00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:27,230
even though it's always been great it is

00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:29,570
has increasingly gotten better over the

00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:31,940
last couple of years and the stats that

00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:34,040
Matt showed Monday shows that that's

00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:35,600
getting some traction I think there are

00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,850
some other things that are impacting

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,010
that as well but we can do better at

00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:42,050
getting our story out there and do

00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:44,420
better at getting people to try and use

00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:46,450
the door and contribute to it so unless

00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:49,010
people know it's awesome we can't win

00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:51,230
and finally you must help because if you

00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:56,000
don't Matthew will be sad we don't want

00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:57,410
to make the fpl sad right so now I want

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,950
to talk about some ways that you can

00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:04,250
help and these are mostly from easy to

00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:06,110
harder okay so the first couple of

00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:08,529
things anybody in this room should be

00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:10,850
able to do without any training

00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:13,310
subscribe to the marketing mailing list

00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:17,029
okay I'm assuming everybody in this room

00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:18,680
can do that you pretty much everybody in

00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:21,080
fedora should be subscribed to the

00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:23,760
marketing mailing list of my opinion

00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:25,589
this way when we are talking about the

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,330
things that we need to do we can get

00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:30,050
voices from other parts of the project

00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:36,300
and give us information that we need

00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:39,779
without too much friction use social

00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:41,190
media to promote fedora okay again as I

00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:43,290
said a couple people have entered the

00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:45,300
room since I said this but if you have a

00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:48,120
Twitter account or Facebook account or a

00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:50,100
Google+ account or maybe some form of

00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:53,070
social media that I'm unaware of that is

00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:55,560
popular in a different region or younger

00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:58,320
crowd than me because I'm old you know

00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:00,839
whatever I don't know that tender would

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,149
be the right mechanism to promote fedora

00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:06,750
but many many different ways you could

00:15:03,149 --> 00:15:09,060
use to promote fedora I would like to

00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:11,070
see this the next time there is a fedora

00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:13,950
release you know I would like to see us

00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:15,899
break twitter with the mighty waves of

00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:18,930
the Dorrans going to Twitter to promote

00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:21,209
it I don't know if we can do that not a

00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:22,350
lot is going to get to that is going to

00:15:21,209 --> 00:15:24,029
say I don't know if we can exert that

00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:25,800
much pressure but also since they've

00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:29,579
retired to fail well we might not get

00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:31,680
that but we could still you know we

00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:35,100
could still make a chat a shot at being

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:38,029
a trending topic and maybe attract some

00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,029
people to the door that

00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:43,380
how many folks are developing something

00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:45,180
in fedora land in some way shape or form

00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:47,960
how many people are working on technical

00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:51,030
features related to the door in any way

00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:54,090
all right if you're working on a feature

00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:55,950
again I've seen this phenomenon in a

00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:57,990
number of times someone will roll up

00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:59,670
after the release and go you know I did

00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:07,220
this great thing for the last release

00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:13,950
why didn't anybody throat it what's up

00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:16,080
you yes yes but I mean you know I'm not

00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:17,820
psychic thank goodness because there are

00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:21,750
rooms I have been in that I do not want

00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:23,370
to read those people's minds but if

00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:27,000
you're working on a feature you need to

00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:30,510
communicate it to us you need to surface

00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,580
that to us to help us out you can write

00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:34,980
for fedora magazine we just had a very

00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:39,900
very passion discussion about the door

00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:41,370
magazine and I keep coming back to one

00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,560
of the biggest problems we have with

00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:44,620
fedora magazine is not enough content

00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,290
not enough people

00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:49,510
for it I want to see more people even if

00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:51,460
it's just once a cycle if there is

00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:53,320
something going on in fedora more

00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:56,110
passionate about work with us to write

00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:58,480
articles about it surface those features

00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:00,760
that you are working on help us write

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:05,710
user-facing content on how to use things

00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:07,510
in fedora you know i'm going to pick on

00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:09,100
just some random people you with the

00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:11,610
gorillaz sticker what is your interest

00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,610
in fedora

00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:19,749
morning

00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:33,690
the better for Daniel isn't a scrobbler

00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:35,710
right

00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:38,620
have you written anything through the

00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:41,970
door magazine about gaming II explain

00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:48,120
okay you serve with the glasses I

00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:48,120
replaced my pens Bates products

00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:55,730
how long have you not I feel like I'm in

00:17:53,059 --> 00:17:58,220
a navy I used to be a Microsoft user

00:17:55,730 --> 00:18:00,920
it's been 12 months since I've booted

00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:10,059
windows so how long you been awful

00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:10,059
windows years what this machine drive

00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:19,060
I bet you have some great stories that

00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:20,320
we help other people take that back you

00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:22,090
thought about that you thought about

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:26,490
writing for a magazine and it's been

00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:26,490
sharing that yes have you done it

00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:34,060
daughters going to baby boy all right no

00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:35,770
you can't phone a friend here so circa

00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:38,230
I'll pick on you you have written for

00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:43,540
food or magazine and you know yeah how

00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:48,070
it hasn't been successful for him yeah i

00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:51,310
have written before and I gave always my

00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:52,940
things to dress and yes commissioner but

00:18:51,310 --> 00:19:03,740
this one right

00:18:52,940 --> 00:19:05,470
I and it's very successful I have

00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:10,220
already said yes

00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:11,860
submissions as I had lost time on one

00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:14,440
day

00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:16,160
but all of them alders some I have to

00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:20,429
reject

00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:23,220
but it's cool

00:19:20,429 --> 00:19:26,039
it was very successful

00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:28,530
well someone I won't thank you I won't

00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:30,030
torture everyone in the audience but you

00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:32,309
know you get the point that this is one

00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:34,409
a good way to reach people and two we

00:19:32,309 --> 00:19:36,750
all have stories that we can share that

00:19:34,409 --> 00:19:40,289
would it be useful for the project and

00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:42,690
probably useful for you to sew on the

00:19:40,289 --> 00:19:44,370
thing that Ruth raised if we're going to

00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:48,120
blow away the wick even this is sort of

00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:50,520
irrelevant but if we are going to keep

00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:52,409
the wiki as is we could really use some

00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:54,390
help cleaning up the marketing when

00:19:52,409 --> 00:19:56,850
you're going through getting rid of a

00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:58,110
relevant content adding you know looking

00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:00,539
and seeing like what are we missing

00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:02,880
because we don't necessarily communicate

00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:04,530
as well as we can the outside world what

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,960
they can do to help marketing what our

00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:08,520
procedures are we have a lot of standard

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,890
operating procedures on there that I

00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:14,960
don't think that updated since you know

00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:17,280
the sense pedorra was in the teens so

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,990
another thing would be very helpful is

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,090
have people participate in the release

00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:23,309
activities by release activities I mean

00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:25,760
writing or contributing to the release

00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:28,740
announcements the alpha beta and final

00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,720
also I will consider you I'm helping

00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:32,940
with the release is the final docs and

00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,679
things like that part of that as well we

00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:38,460
should be talking more with the docs

00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:40,830
folks so I would like to see people do

00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:42,510
that but also again when the release

00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:44,250
happens I want to see people out there

00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:46,740
blogging about it and shouting about it

00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:48,419
and working with ambassadors to schedule

00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:51,990
things you know I know the ambassador's

00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:53,820
take the bulk of planning release

00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:55,830
parties and things like that but we

00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,820
should also be using the door magazine

00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:59,039
the social media

00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:01,740
both those we're not doing that right

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:04,169
now we need to be creating Britain

00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:05,669
presentations and other materials for

00:21:04,169 --> 00:21:07,559
ambassadors we have a lot of people who

00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:10,620
are very knowledgeable about fedora and

00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:13,350
willing to go out and evangelize fedora

00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:16,980
but i can tell you creating slide where

00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:18,570
is no fun if we can if we can take the

00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:20,399
load off a little bit and help create

00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:22,710
some of those presentations that they

00:21:20,399 --> 00:21:25,139
can then modify to suit their own taste

00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:28,799
so it'd be very useful good comment you

00:21:25,139 --> 00:21:30,330
look like you know okay that was quite a

00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:33,509
user you look like you might have done

00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:35,460
okay another thing and again these are

00:21:33,509 --> 00:21:36,659
going from easiest to hardest this

00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:40,230
starts getting a little bit more

00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:43,200
advanced level take lead on a user or

00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:44,850
potential user survey I've looked at

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,740
some of the things we've done asked to

00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:49,320
serve a fedora users and I think one of

00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:52,080
the biggest fails was we tried to survey

00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:54,450
just eat the existing users which is

00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:57,179
sort of like you've already bought our

00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:58,649
product what are you going to do so that

00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:00,659
we can make you buy it again I want to

00:21:58,649 --> 00:22:05,309
reach the people we haven't gotten to

00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:06,990
yet I am NOT a master of creating survey

00:22:05,309 --> 00:22:08,669
type materials that would love someone

00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:10,140
who has a background and that sort of

00:22:08,669 --> 00:22:12,840
thing to take the lead on

00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:14,520
creating the survey the saying here's

00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:17,490
tuned ways I think you could reach

00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:20,310
people who are potential Fedora users or

00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:21,780
contributors but aren't already on

00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:24,170
mailing list where you can reach them

00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,170
directly

00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:30,130
I would love to see someone take the

00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:32,470
lead on for example I was talking in the

00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:35,860
break talking to Paul and Chris a little

00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:37,930
bit there are hundreds of universities

00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:39,580
just in North America where people study

00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:42,220
things like marketing and journalism

00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:45,130
although journalism is not as healthy as

00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:47,020
it used to be and these people could

00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:49,240
probably there are professors who might

00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:50,950
affect direct people towards fedora is

00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:54,460
an activity they could do for credit and

00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:57,220
work with us there may also be computer

00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:59,200
science folks who are this might be an

00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:04,090
easy way for students to get involved in

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:07,810
fedora most importantly do something

00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:09,640
okay what we have right now is not as

00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:12,550
much activity as we really really need

00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:15,430
and we need people to step up and

00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:17,860
realize that the door is not going to

00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:19,390
market itself and a group of people who

00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:21,850
are currently involved in fedora

00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:23,650
marketing are not sufficient to do all

00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:26,230
the things we need right now we need

00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:28,720
people to step up and take a little bit

00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:32,350
of responsibility and be willing to work

00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:34,830
with us on promoting fedora any

00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,830
questions

00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:44,690
I'm very quiet III guess now I'm kind of

00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:47,870
wondering what's going on over there it

00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:54,950
sounds very interesting no questions or

00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:58,190
comments the fair base yeah you know the

00:23:54,950 --> 00:24:00,880
floor is it something you can feel

00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:00,880
comfortable doing

00:24:01,049 --> 00:24:08,200
so me personally I have not with fedora

00:24:05,889 --> 00:24:11,019
I know Fedora has in the past dozens of

00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:13,659
surveys but that was before my time Ruth

00:24:11,019 --> 00:24:19,599
might be able to speak to them I think

00:24:13,659 --> 00:24:22,750
that all do you have any institutional

00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:25,510
memory to help you sorry

00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:27,550
what's certainly is asking about surveys

00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:29,080
does anybody in living memory remember

00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:33,250
doing any the surveys that I've

00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:39,420
experienced Lee I think this crafting

00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:39,420
the survey questions to get graphics

00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:51,160
taking the full results and see or at

00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:51,160
least

00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:00,309
too cool

00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:09,050
two

00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,130
the pieces of

00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:22,279
I do not put a volunteering to make an

00:25:19,429 --> 00:25:23,840
introduction thank you

00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:27,049
that would be awesome any other

00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:29,529
questions or thoughts about yeah who's

00:25:27,049 --> 00:25:29,529
the lead

00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:38,799
yes seems like something we ought to

00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:38,799
answer so

00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:47,450
we so how many folks went to the council

00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:51,020
meeting we had earlier today small

00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:53,630
number I'm toying with the idea so

00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:56,150
Fedora has objectives and the council is

00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:58,010
now taking on objectives a small number

00:25:56,150 --> 00:26:00,590
objectives at the time for example one

00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:02,960
of the objectives is the additions so if

00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:05,510
the door isn't it is has an objective to

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,490
have separate editions that are

00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:10,760
specialized for different use cases and

00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:12,470
different user personas we have a couple

00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,600
of other objectives but they mentioned

00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:17,690
an interest in having at least one or

00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:19,790
two more objectives to rotate in as that

00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:22,040
are rotating out because we're kind of

00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:24,170
far along on the additions so we no

00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,700
longer maybe need to have that as an

00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:28,040
objective and I'm going to stop doing it

00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:29,570
it's just that we may have gotten to a

00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:31,580
point where we've completed that work

00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:34,220
and it is now part of the more

00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:37,820
institutionally and I am considering

00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:40,010
proposing making reviving and improving

00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:44,510
Fedora marketing and objective for the

00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:46,880
next several releases I'm debating I

00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:49,160
don't want to propose that unless I am

00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,930
also willing to own a large part of that

00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:53,480
it could work because that's the way the

00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:55,530
Fedora works and it should so I'm

00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:57,780
debating whether i want to

00:26:55,530 --> 00:27:01,920
in that particular particular saw like

00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:03,930
that at this time but I would like to

00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:08,670
see that as an objective I would like to

00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:10,470
see I am very you know interested in or

00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:14,040
having very healthy marketing because I

00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:16,320
hate to see all the work that we do not

00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,790
reach the fullest audience and possibly

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,380
and I won't say the work goes to waste

00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:21,360
because everybody in this room is

00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:23,970
probably using fedora benefiting from it

00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:27,660
I think even if fedoras audience never

00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:30,030
grew we're still doing a good thing for

00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:32,040
the world and we're still you know

00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:33,780
reaching some of our potential but I

00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,970
don't think we by any stretch of the

00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:38,970
imagination reached our full potential

00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:40,730
or even tapped into more than thirty

00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:44,420
percent of our full potential yet I

00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:44,420
think somewhat

00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,700
Matthew

00:27:53,389 --> 00:28:00,860
by saying what we call it actually in

00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:02,530
actually the marketing lead you on that

00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:05,900
conglomerate peppers

00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:08,060
and half full

00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:10,850
that way one person doesn't have

00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:14,120
but more group ever

00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:16,040
well as personally I disagree with that

00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:18,290
approach just to move it because not

00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:19,970
about making me responsible for

00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:21,410
everything but in order to athletes

00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:23,600
accountable for making sure the

00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:26,420
appearance so one of the one of the hats

00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:28,490
that I wear occasionally is that of a

00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:30,920
member of the apache software foundation

00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:35,600
and participants some of those projects

00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:37,520
each top global project has a vice

00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:42,140
president that reports up to the board

00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:44,360
and that does not mean that that person

00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:46,250
that person is responsible for certain

00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:49,010
things like making sure there is report

00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:52,340
to the board a recorder and a couple of

00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:53,930
other housekeeping tasks and nominally

00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:55,480
they are the spokesperson for that

00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:57,170
project but they are by no means

00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:00,050
responsible for all the things that

00:28:57,170 --> 00:29:02,210
happen in that project or even like

00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:03,860
technically the VP doesn't have to write

00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:07,220
the report they merely have to deliver

00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:09,830
it to the board you know so I I'm with

00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:13,900
Paul on you probably need a fedora

00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:16,730
marketing lead who is responsible for

00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:19,420
for example like the last couple of

00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:21,070
releases I've taken on responsibility

00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:25,540
people with a stick to make sure that we

00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:27,310
have release announcements and you know

00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:29,680
going to the readiness meetings for

00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:32,860
example nobody went to the last reddit

00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:34,870
readiness meeting futhermore at all for

00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:37,979
the fervor for marketing that was

00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:43,269
probably find result after that problem

00:29:37,979 --> 00:29:45,820
very very long time for everything yeah

00:29:43,269 --> 00:29:47,139
and and I you know I think there's a big

00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:50,320
difference between I will take

00:29:47,139 --> 00:29:52,330
responsibility to find someone who will

00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:58,119
do this versus I will do all of this

00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:59,090
myself trying to convey actually we're

00:29:58,119 --> 00:30:03,210
setting up

00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:06,640
the who who's going to

00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:08,350
magazine me who's going to do who's a

00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,299
new kind of acrimony who's going to

00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:11,220
focus

00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:13,320
the flyer who's going to do release

00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:16,559
notes we're going to divide it up that

00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:17,820
way I'm not stuck with the magazine I've

00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:20,340
got to do the release notes and then

00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:22,739
like oh crap okay I'm do that now four

00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:24,960
doors coming out tomorrow so it was

00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:27,869
that's why the kind of sleep Matthew a

00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:30,149
while we can split it up and have tasks

00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:32,549
I think it doesn't any person to this

00:30:30,149 --> 00:30:37,879
job yep they think the police should he

00:30:32,549 --> 00:30:37,879

00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:47,519
do it yeah if everyone started taking

00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:53,520
given a certain dodging the question

00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:59,910
Oh

00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:05,270

00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:10,450
afraid because one of the interesting

00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,450
things about

00:31:12,909 --> 00:31:19,379
the key thing for this convex is just

00:31:15,009 --> 00:31:19,379
designed to be of the an activity

00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,680
and

00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:32,080
with a

00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:40,570
being able to see the stuff the glory

00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:40,570
done hey I can help

00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:44,130
and

00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:49,360
may actually help with that question

00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,900
making the

00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:13,880
the other questions or comments thoughts

00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:23,860
media

00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:28,950
all those things yeah

00:32:30,269 --> 00:32:38,119
we have a resource where for me

00:32:34,769 --> 00:32:39,800
yeah so

00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:43,360
last

00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,360
the first one hi how are you

00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,720
Raj they are

00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,980
as

00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,410
shred

00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:03,760
one and brian has already been stepping

00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:05,770
up and

00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,360
in fact we may have some feedback that

00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:10,660
it was maybe a little bit of a fire hose

00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:13,450
but but he stepped up and put all of

00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:17,590
Pete including some of the room 6 talks

00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:19,300
on Twitter for us so so he's already

00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:21,280
stepped up to do some of that stuff and

00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:23,110
he you know he may even have bandwidth

00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:26,670
to help this a little bit of editing or

00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:30,970
writing occasionally but and that's a

00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:32,920
great point but at the same time brian

00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:36,180
is also a tasked with all of the other

00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:38,920
projects so we can only rely on like

00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:40,390
O'Brien's amazing so like this much of

00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:44,380
his time is like this much of anybody

00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:47,430
else's time but still yeah so he can he

00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:47,430
can help us a little bit yes

00:33:57,490 --> 00:34:01,570
birds

00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:06,930
and so now what we got

00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:08,790
tasks and we wait tasks

00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:12,990
we're thinking them for each release now

00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:14,910
and that way we have accountability for

00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:17,220
that task and so forth it's actually

00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:19,260
made things a lot smoother like three

00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:20,889
job guarding who wants to do screenshot

00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:23,940
that's the

00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:23,940
this of course

00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:31,020
three

00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:34,399
dragonball able somebody wants out the

00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:34,399
market what do I hear

00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:39,700
there's always something

00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:50,790
very simple or something something a

00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,790
screenshot

00:34:54,610 --> 00:35:01,420
any other comments questions did not you

00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:03,970
can reach me if you have anything to add

00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:07,000
or volunteer for or comment on just

00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:09,310
jeezy me and red hat also on twitter you

00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,870
can find in there and jay-z me you want

00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:12,400
to subscribe to the marketing list or

00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:15,010
you have information to send to it it's

00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:22,630
just marketing at this to our project

00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:24,580
org so yeah it's not i'm a moderator

00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:26,320
though so if you send something like if

00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:28,450
you absolutely just don't want to

00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,310
subscribe if you haven't something

00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:34,530
important to send to it if you send and

00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:34,530
it's not spam about flag through

00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:40,470
and in fact whenever anything comes into

00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:44,100
the existing list so the admins can

00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:45,540
usually like okay Paul and appalled

00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,070
there's a lot of things in fedora and he

00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:49,200
sent a mail for list that he isn't

00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:50,640
subscribe but I'm going to go ahead and

00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,050
click the little box it says in the

00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,590
future you can send without being

00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:56,670
subscribed because I know Paul is

00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:59,190
moderately unlikely it something you

00:35:56,670 --> 00:36:04,880
need span to the list so we'll let him

00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:04,880
