Description: 
	"The next year will be the year of the Linux Desktop" - We have heard this so many times, yet the year didn't come. Why is that so? Are we doing something wrong? Even with the recent amazing news, that many gaming engines are turning to Linux and a few Linux-based gaming consoles are being released, there are still some problems which are frustrating for the end-user. The problems we will see are ranging from community problems to diversity problems, while including the fact that the enterprise overrides the needs of the desktop. The community must work together to solve these problems and make sure that the people who aren't tech-savvy can use a Linux distribution and we must ensure that they enjoy it.
