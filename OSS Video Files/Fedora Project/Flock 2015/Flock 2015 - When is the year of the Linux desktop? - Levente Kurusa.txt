Title: Flock 2015 - When is the year of the Linux desktop? - Levente Kurusa
Publication date: 2015-08-26
Playlist: Flock 2015
Description: 
	"The next year will be the year of the Linux Desktop" - We have heard this so many times, yet the year didn't come. Why is that so? Are we doing something wrong? Even with the recent amazing news, that many gaming engines are turning to Linux and a few Linux-based gaming consoles are being released, there are still some problems which are frustrating for the end-user. The problems we will see are ranging from community problems to diversity problems, while including the fact that the enterprise overrides the needs of the desktop. The community must work together to solve these problems and make sure that the people who aren't tech-savvy can use a Linux distribution and we must ensure that they enjoy it.

am also software engineer into another

00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,990
visualization team at red hats and we're

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:27,900

before we air so i wanted to ask a

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,540
question like who here has heard the

00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:41,340
phrase next year or this year will be

00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,070

familiar with this and even this I do

00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:56,399
not like this is we going on for years

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,109
and yeah that's how he goes every year

00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,309
has been doing it works that stuff and

00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:02,489
everybody was thinking that the next

00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:04,769
year we leave you'd better and that's it

00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:06,750
so I just wanted to give you myself a

00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,630
little bit of an introduction like Who

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:12,659
am I why do I'm 90 years I'm a computer

00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:14,970
hacker I working everything with regards

00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:17,700
to computers and software most of the

00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:19,409
time I have been an intern at gray hat

00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,310
last summer in this summer as well both

00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:25,320
through here the visualization team

00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:27,740
trying to make key we have another

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,110
things work

00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:32,450
I had tried to make them work properly

00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:34,549
most of her project ambassador my mentor

00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:37,040
was Sultan hope everybody's sitting here

00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:38,689
and he will be given up again to talk

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,220
just some advertisement he's going to be

00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:46,159
giving me to talk about food around

00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:48,590
faster mentoring player hush image spare

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:52,659
time and the gasometer chivalry and I'm

00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:55,039
also working out Donna's curl which is

00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:57,140
one of the main antagonists and why it

00:01:55,039 --> 00:02:00,429
looks killer will not be little excess

00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:02,720
stuff we will not be successful soon and

00:02:00,429 --> 00:02:04,280
I'm not just only working in linux

00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,200
kernel I must working somewhere else and

00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,720
low-level things like wrote letters and

00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,000
I haven't written my own little clone

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,790
thing that wasn't as successful because

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,970
you couldn't run do minutes but as a man

00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:18,739
i also apparently i consulted company

00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,420
and can add a direction into the

00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:24,049
officers project that i actually have

00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:29,510
some weird i actually like android

00:02:24,049 --> 00:02:31,340
that's so my goals are this talks to

00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:34,310
share my experiences as an ambassador

00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:36,350
and that's because I you visited

00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:39,680
conferences I talk to people and they

00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:41,180
talk with me and some people are just

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,470
you know the trial gnu/linux

00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,180
distributions they come to the news

00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,680
conference or even officers come first

00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:49,280
is because they actually want to try out

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,500
or legs distribution and sometimes get

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,780
to defend or both and they want to find

00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:56,930
out why fodor i suited for a desktop and

00:02:53,780 --> 00:03:00,650
why why why is it better than the other

00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:05,060
desktops that you vote to or our sucio

00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:06,290
something like that and i am i have some

00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,660
experiences that I wanted to share it

00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:10,790
what do we expect what are the problems

00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:13,370
and what they don't like it one should

00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:14,870
they like what would they like and I

00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:18,019
personally believe the Linux desktop

00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:19,910
right now is broken it's not the way it

00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:23,420
should be and windows as a desktop

00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:25,760
operation it's bad linux desktop and I

00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:29,370
gotta get killed for that but I opinion

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:33,090
and yeah

00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:37,500
so we're going to talk about why why I

00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:39,120
think it is broken and you'll see scores

00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,849
there's some questions like what do we

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,370
mean by linux desktop is it like first

00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:46,170
of all the pearl that defines an

00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:49,799
operating system their life runs linux

00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:52,049
kernel is it the is every operation

00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:54,540
running the linux kernel on the desktop

00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:57,450
machine or pc will be the linux desktop

00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:01,410
or will it be like more of the community

00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:02,940
like they call system the you know I'm

00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:04,650
and all that free software stuff that

00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,180
goes to the adder and for desktop

00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:09,239
environment thing that we you know I

00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:11,700
still accessed up or is it more we also

00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:13,859
mean that the desktop is only on like

00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:16,889
pcs and laptops like mobile friends are

00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:18,449
not linux desktop or are they these

00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:21,900
questions have to be answered and the

00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:23,550
thing is it's connect warned and I I'm

00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,070
also going with the ecosystem so it's

00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:29,639
like more it's not just a curl but more

00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:35,010
the ecosystem like gnome and KDE and

00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:36,510
acts of CEO of all that things so before

00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:38,280
we get deeper I wanted to give you some

00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:40,800
statistics regarding the desktop like

00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,240
how where do we stand right now and it's

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,280
not what are we standing right now I

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,470
know

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,320
it doesn't look good it doesn't look

00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:51,889
nice but we're progressing right to

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,540
school so 56 point twenty six percent of

00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:59,690
the whole their stock market share as of

00:04:53,540 --> 00:05:02,030
2014 this windows 7 which is quite big

00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:03,830
it's a nice chunk that's where we want

00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:05,510
to be at least by the next year if we

00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:07,550
were to claim it the layer will exist up

00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:09,020
and this interesting is that still we

00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:11,150
have 18 point twenty six percent for

00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:14,389
windows XP which actually expired

00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:16,520
support still twenty percent of the

00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:19,490
machines are at least available to you

00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:23,840
all night Anna exploits that windows XP

00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:25,610
didn't fix work on fixing a slight thing

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,490
that thirteen point fifty two percent as

00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:30,560
Windows 8 which is really interesting a

00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:33,950
nice jump it's like the newest operating

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:37,820
system and then really jumped up to

00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:39,350
thirty persons interesting my co is X or

00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:45,229
all the mac users I see at least one

00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:49,550
person you're using back federal cool so

00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:52,280
well sometimes the Luke is that for you

00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:55,160
days but 506 ourselves mac OS x which is

00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:57,440
a traditional operation of macbooks and

00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,470
we have slightly small number in one

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:04,610
point thirty four percent of Linux and

00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:09,670
you want to widen this blue line how to

00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:16,060
say into huge bulb legs desktop

00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:18,040
sorry yeah all of us right yeah of

00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:20,140
course in it like yeah what are you

00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,550
saying is the linux desktop the year of

00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:23,740
the new system has already came for

00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:25,180
people at come and you know and Alexa

00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:27,550
consistent that's true that's true even

00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:30,310
from yeah the urban exists up came in

00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:33,910
two thousand and now I return thing I

00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:36,130
don't even but years ago but we were

00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:37,570
talking about amasses right major any of

00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:40,510
the people we were actually using

00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:45,160
computers some distributions that are

00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:47,380
actually the main drivers of the you

00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,540
know lines of stuff melodic cement which

00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:51,430
is really interesting it's only like to

00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:54,490
be relatively young distribution and

00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:56,470
just you just gained the most Monica

00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:59,800
teacher I didn't find any unfortunately

00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:01,960
didn't find any uh percentages for usage

00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:05,050
but these are the 5 top distributions

00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:08,500
that are running in desktop my voluntary

00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:10,000
vivillon of this Suzanne fedora now

00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:15,040
we're at the fifth position that's right

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:17,050
okay a lot of distributions on the other

00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:19,180
hand it is the mobile market which is

00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:22,330
still running Android is based on linux

00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:25,060
kernel and on the local ecosystem and it

00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:27,670
has eighty-four percent share on the

00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:30,040
whole mumbai market share that means

00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:32,130
we're doing something great on the

00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:38,290
mobile favorite we're something kind of

00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:40,480
kind of not good the pace here stuff

00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:41,890
like that yeah like Windows Phone like

00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,270
this is like the exact opposite right

00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:44,980
you have windows which is like two

00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:47,230
percent and you have entered is linux or

00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:48,880
unix based i have an eighty-four percent

00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:52,780
right this is the exact opposite of what

00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:56,260
we have a pcs and laptops so the

00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:57,360
question naturally arises like can we

00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:59,370
learn from this right

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,530
like ways it that before my friends like

00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:04,650
lips when a member left I this is quite

00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:08,969
popular or linux on the PCs and laptops

00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:10,500
isn't at all popular right well the

00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:12,719
question the answer is that will create

00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,979
at the ground right there must be some

00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:16,560
difference that we're doing on the

00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:18,150
mobile phone and there must be something

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,439
different that we're what we're doing on

00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:22,469
your desktop and what we're doing that

00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:24,419
the mobile file right what are the

00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:26,819
problems that I think personally I think

00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:28,530
and then well i would say that some

00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:30,990
people at comp versus have told me that

00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:33,110
they look like about linux desktop in

00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:35,399
general is the following like this top

00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:37,829
environments and i underlined ass

00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:39,269
because there are multiple dish the pipe

00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:44,820
bottom is if you know if you're taken

00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:46,260
out like an android there is exactly

00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,810
what you i like most of the injuries

00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:51,630
look the same right and you can have a

00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:54,480
desktop like you can have this which is

00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:56,310
now free a notice how it looks and then

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,310
you have I think it is Alex though is

00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:03,390
que te you have KDE which looks quite

00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:05,370
different and see and we have alex de

00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:08,010
which is also different from the two

00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:09,930
maybe not so much different from ke have

00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:12,690
access see how this is now person mate

00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:15,570
and exercise xfce so these are all

00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:17,850
different and suppose you're a new user

00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:19,890
like the person who typically uses a

00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,329
scarf computer doesn't it's not a

00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:23,699
programmer is that somebody who is

00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:26,730
actually into programming Randy's now

00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:31,050
you don't really care about details of

00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:33,480
high work sir or the details of how it

00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:35,730
should be right what they care about is

00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,269
that they can use it it's intuitive it's

00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:45,240
easy to use and it's the same every time

00:09:38,269 --> 00:09:47,160
and the thing is android does the whole

00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,779
UI looks the same and most of the

00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,339
intrusions like there are some updates

00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:53,270
like every other year there's an update

00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:55,010
to android like don't want to enter it l

00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:57,530
and there are some minor differences

00:09:55,010 --> 00:10:00,260
between the UI but but if you take for

00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:02,450
the update from room 223 there was a

00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:04,880
huge update and I was not a single

00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:06,740
release of an operating system and when

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,780
the user updated suppose it's somebody

00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:10,730
who came up and he doesn't you know how

00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:12,170
to use it and then just the only reason

00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:14,780
he has a computer is just had emails

00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:15,800
right each other let's be honest those

00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,180
are the people who we want to be

00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,550
propeller bit right there's our new

00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:21,110
people who are interested in we're

00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:24,230
mostly interested desktop computers

00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:26,060
right and they don't really you know

00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:27,590
they don't have do not intuitive enough

00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,150
to actually find out where it work so

00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:32,360
they're going to call somebody to find

00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:35,450
out think I called me do you find them

00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:38,210
out how it works and that's it's really

00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:40,220
hard to do that when hundreds of people

00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:42,890
call you too hey my computer upgraded I

00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:45,620
can't find google chrome anymore or is

00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:47,630
it and yeah you have to move your mouse

00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,040
you talk right top left corner and

00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:50,510
you're going to have to that that's like

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,890
what we had what would happen from them

00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:58,580
to come frae yeah so the problem is that

00:10:54,890 --> 00:11:02,060
they are all okay very so they are all

00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:04,640
different and and for us like for

00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:06,350
programmers as good because we believe

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,330
in choice we believe in the freedom of

00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:11,660
choice and we believe that choice is

00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:13,640
good and that's because we can actually

00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:18,470
work out and we like work and I how

00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:21,700
things work right and that is pittsford

00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:25,460
Iggy we average user it's not so good

00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:28,340
right so the two screens are completely

00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:30,160
different right now yeah so I can't see

00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:34,120
anything right now on this screen

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:39,079
apparently I know so this one's frozen

00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:40,699
this looks less tactical so if Cruz I

00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:44,839
don't want like two slides away and this

00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:46,180
is a okay so yeah you can see this is

00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:48,560
what I'm going to talk about right now

00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:51,550
ok so the complete book and let me fix

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,550
it I don't know how to fix it but

00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:57,250
something happened ok so where was I

00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:12,100
option I which yeah so we just

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,100
experienced the yellow filling system

00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:20,240
okay so yeah so it's good for the people

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,940
like us who like the Guru stuff who like

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,920
understand how much and we like change

00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:28,700
or the people who are you know into

00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:30,590
things like you know they embrace change

00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:32,480
they want to test dial you have that

00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:34,730
urge to you know think over there and

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,130
that's it for you but for an average

00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:40,730
user somebody like a great martyr I get

00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:43,910
grandmother she doesn't know Holly Holly

00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:45,860
you know when she knows this this tactic

00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:48,410
of find a google chrome icon on his

00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:51,170
desktop same uses roofs is my new

00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:52,580
survives up duty after the screen and

00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:55,190
there's the google chrome icon let's

00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:57,770
just take for granted then it upgraded

00:12:55,190 --> 00:13:01,190
to grant three now she has to move her

00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:03,710
mouth injured top left corner find out

00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:07,580
that the activities thing and then

00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:09,860
typing to Crimean and then she's lost

00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:11,900
again so she ends up calling me it takes

00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:14,440
a couple hours to figure out where it

00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:17,240
went where how was new name and stuff

00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:20,120
obviously a solution to that is job to

00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,440
never update the computer but of course

00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,640
you went off they do computer everybody

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,650
wants to update their computers because

00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:29,890
new and fresh you fresh free stuff right

00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:33,620
but sometimes it just doesn't work right

00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:36,440
so another problem with different ok so

00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:41,840
the animation was lost

00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:43,760
okay whatever as we're so yeah so we can

00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,590
have configuration problems right every

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,390
different desktop environment has their

00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:50,930
own configuration applications their own

00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:52,970
selling applications even for me it's

00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:54,710
quite difficult to set the time on two

00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,790
machines because if they have two

00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:57,470
different this stuff environments

00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:59,090
because one of them calls time settings

00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:03,050
you know what calls in date and time and

00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:04,580
the other one goes it by a clock or

00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:06,620
something and you know it's going too

00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:10,040
hard it takes time and it's you know you

00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:11,270
have this urge to set the time when you

00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,220
have making dollar I mean in excess

00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:14,960
obviously and then you just try to

00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:19,250
figure out where it did it go where you

00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:21,230
went yeah so they even it's quite hard

00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:23,480
to figure out where you set where the

00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:26,380
great your settings went and another

00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:28,460
problem is the second point here is that

00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:31,550
sometimes they have different settings

00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:33,320
so take for example on KDE you can set

00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:35,120
something that's you know more advanced

00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,580
and then a good for you you cannot set

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,790
that and you get the figure out how do

00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:43,220
you actually said that setting to

00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:46,010
justify value well lead up you want

00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:48,020
right and I think as a problem and even

00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:49,940
even birch is that to desktop

00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:51,980
environments do not necessarily say that

00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:54,350
it share their settings so if you have

00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:56,420
your printers who hears someone had

00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:59,540
problems with it printers I never had

00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:01,740
them working so a thing

00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:05,730
great so that's like half of the road

00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:08,130
right so sometimes the you know I've set

00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:10,710
my printers I don't know and I buning to

00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:13,590
KDE and then I have to redo it and then

00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:15,360
it's like oh come on I have to figure it

00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:18,060
I have to log back in to grub to figure

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,820
out the IP address of my printer type of

00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:23,310
my printer and then at this time instead

00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:27,210
they could you share them I don't know

00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:29,750
why they don't share it I am its use the

00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:34,170
same demon for it perfect print but

00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:35,279
that's the problem i'm kinda good so i

00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:37,650
think this is one of the reasons why

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:40,890
people use Macintosh is that it just

00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:42,870
works you don't have to said anything it

00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:44,550
just works and then it's going to root

00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:49,170
for a lifetime I just don't like

00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:50,220
Macintosh but that's my opinion yeah so

00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,720
this was like one of the problems with

00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:53,550
Alex esta but is that you can't

00:15:51,720 --> 00:16:00,270
configure it you can configure it but

00:15:53,550 --> 00:16:03,260
it's just a little bit impractical yeah

00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:05,520
ok so the split-screen happens again so

00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:09,330
distributions are a problem that I

00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:11,280
believe now get me wrong I believe in

00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:13,050
the freedom of choice and I like being

00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:15,930
able to choose with linux distributions

00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:17,820
I like running a boat to fedora and

00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:19,650
other stuffs in ultimately in my machine

00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:23,010
even though I love for the right that's

00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:25,350
what i'm going to end up with steel for

00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:27,060
the end user it's not so good like take

00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:29,190
for example somebody actually wants to

00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:32,490
install firefox in their machine like

00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:35,610
they're going to tighten install firefox

00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:38,460
into there are two their browser of

00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:40,170
choice in stuff the thing is they only

00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:41,760
know it they running linux because they

00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:44,040
that's what they that's different that's

00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:46,290
what differentiates them from windows

00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,700
users of the internet works and they're

00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:48,089
not do not necessarily know that they

00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:53,550
run

00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:54,839
after Dora or take abanto so this is

00:16:53,550 --> 00:17:00,749
going to tap into the browser of choice

00:16:54,839 --> 00:17:02,339
that how to install firefox on linux and

00:17:00,749 --> 00:17:03,809
it shine on how to install it so they

00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:06,209
get a happy and package and they you

00:17:03,809 --> 00:17:09,270
suppose they running ubuntu so they try

00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:11,189
to run the RPM package on a boat too

00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:14,520
because that's the other thing they find

00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:16,049
or and then they are they're stuck they

00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,659
have an art be other they can't run and

00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:20,819
they just going to take okay linux sucks

00:17:18,659 --> 00:17:22,559
i'm going back to windows and they do

00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:24,809
this happened many many times to my

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:27,679
friends and to people who told me that

00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:29,669
they found an RPM package for firefox

00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,559
yeah because they do not know that

00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:33,330
there's a comment line that don't want

00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:38,130
to use the comment line because they

00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:40,289
think it's magic which it is and so it's

00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:42,149
really but really the problem is they do

00:17:40,289 --> 00:17:44,940
they're not aware of this system they

00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:47,190
are running and the choice is sometimes

00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:50,789
not good choice is not good when you are

00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:52,200
newbie it's you more like you do not

00:17:50,789 --> 00:17:54,029
want to think of it you do not actually

00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,039
care about is the primary problem i

00:17:54,029 --> 00:17:58,140
think that you do not care about the

00:17:56,039 --> 00:18:00,720
distribution you just want it to work

00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:04,320
and when you find tutorial for

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:06,029
installing an array of safer game United

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,250
so it came and then you find an

00:18:06,029 --> 00:18:09,779
instruction for fedora but you're

00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:12,149
running ubuntu so you mess up your

00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:13,799
computer and you say for the brantford

00:18:12,149 --> 00:18:15,779
by the first half of the tutorial the

00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:17,159
comment lines work and you're all girl

00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:19,020
you believe it's good it's working

00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:21,059
you're already met fed up because you

00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,529
have to type all these comments even

00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:26,669
though you can use copy and paste but

00:18:22,529 --> 00:18:28,710
liver and then magically in the middle

00:18:26,669 --> 00:18:30,899
of the tutorial just stops working and

00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:33,240
your machine cannot find that comment

00:18:30,899 --> 00:18:34,740
that's where you blocked it's what you

00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,010
don't want to happen when you are just a

00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,140
new

00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:39,240
user you didn't want to debug you don't

00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:41,040
want to figure it out why it doesn't

00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:47,490
work or white what would even happen

00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:49,110
frame super are ya next thing problems

00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:50,340
are distributions right well then one of

00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:52,080
the other problems that you find it

00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:54,780
through shoulders when I'm stop that one

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,880
of the other thing is I you find comment

00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:59,990
and installs Firefox a real missile fire

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,850
trucks you're using running a bunt 0

00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:05,820
comment young Matt found what are we

00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:08,070
going to do clinics us are switching

00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:11,250
back to windows right that's what

00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:12,510
happens it truly happens another thing

00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,750
that this is suppose for some weird

00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:16,650
reason Dave the train is stalled

00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:19,740
proprietary driver is that they need

00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:22,650
development packages say so we find our

00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:24,330
bad for the safe or live cheap active

00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:27,420
package name for it really cheap bag

00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:29,850
bash dev and luring fedora and it's

00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:32,960
called death l right that's how it hurts

00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:36,080
how you call it dev Allen fedora and

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:39,630
what happens is it you type in DF

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:42,240
install legit Baghdad something liver

00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:45,600
but that one for the rock and thank is

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,460
not far are you stuck again frame this

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,140
also happened just visit from my

00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:50,580
experience like this happens to people

00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:55,170
and they are really fed up with it and

00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:56,160
don't really like that and the police

00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:58,590
questions how they set up my practice

00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:02,550
like I have one of those divisions it

00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:05,760
works where this solution doesn't rig it

00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:10,090
works but that's something that bridges

00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:12,789
are useful

00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:16,120
they don't feel that you are in hurry

00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:18,580
right so this was this is a quote by

00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:21,340
miguel de Caza I hope buddy and I was

00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:22,690
his name correctly he's the you I think

00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:26,169
he's ignoring the villa operator like

00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:28,240
the main one he is the one you sent this

00:20:26,169 --> 00:20:29,980
and before she sanitizer the colonel and

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,330
a set of core libraries around the mind

00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:33,669
by the gesture of the day that held a

00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:36,880
position of power and that's because

00:20:33,669 --> 00:20:39,490
like the wreath of how I green mud that

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,620
every distribution isn't a race against

00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:44,080
the others right we want to be the best

00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:46,690
people they they they suck one of

00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,610
advanced right and we do everything for

00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:51,850
that now one of the reasons is how you

00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:53,919
gain market share is by adopting things

00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:56,169
that are not compatible with the others

00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,600
because if you have the most market

00:20:56,169 --> 00:21:01,059
share and you'd up the new technology

00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,830
and that doesn't there is no longer

00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:04,539
compatible with other distributions and

00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:06,700
what other distributions that house

00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:10,149
model will do is that they adopt to you

00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:12,610
and that's why the linux kernel was

00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:15,190
selected i think that you have to make

00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:16,809
sure that warm up your market share like

00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:20,409
they want like the prisoners market of

00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:22,809
distributions and you have a market

00:21:20,409 --> 00:21:24,340
share of sixty percent and I knew you're

00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:25,809
running the same kernel with the forty

00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:27,880
percent now what you do is you switch to

00:21:25,809 --> 00:21:29,799
a new kernel so that your software is

00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,720
not compatible with the others now what

00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:33,370
happens is that 60 person of the users

00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:36,279
of the whole distribution market I

00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:38,020
switch to the new curl and then and then

00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:40,929
the rest of the 40 person will be forced

00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:43,990
to either fork away or switch to the new

00:21:40,929 --> 00:21:47,049
kernel and most of the time if you are

00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:49,090
in market you're racing you want to be

00:21:47,049 --> 00:21:50,919
the best and how you become the best is

00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:52,990
that you have to copy sometimes what do

00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:55,179
you think the the principal and the

00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:56,860
market share has been doing and this is

00:21:55,179 --> 00:22:02,110
what happens this happens every day in

00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:05,890
market and also yeah there are some

00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:09,640
other problems like actually right I

00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:12,070
think that nobody really cares about the

00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,809
Alex that stop anymore and that's a

00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:16,149
serious problem there's some really

00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:18,500
interesting thing that is this Erick

00:22:16,149 --> 00:22:20,600
Rowan felissa bridge 4096

00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,340
that's looking super computer yet my

00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,990
laptop but this one but the other laptop

00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:26,240
is fine difficult when returning from

00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:29,240
sleep it should be simpler thing right

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:32,660
this is quite a nice laptop that hasn't

00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:38,030
even had linux installed by default yet

00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:40,040
when I when I pull it away and I try to

00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:41,420
bring it back it crushes would grow big

00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:44,810
and I can't really do anything about it

00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:47,150
arabelle trying to buy but only if I had

00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:49,490
time right and the first time is super

00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:51,740
newbie user I don't know how do you view

00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:54,770
the colonel messages by tapping d net

00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:56,570
but I can't do anything with the

00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:58,820
information and it's just kind of weird

00:22:56,570 --> 00:23:01,070
to some interesting thing that I found

00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:03,620
this little ship coming you know this

00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:06,440
propensity between what the colonel can

00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:10,280
do and what the colonel would do and

00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:14,230
what to do but yeah that's linux towards

00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:18,800
by the way the creative nice girl and

00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:21,550
burner come on problem with a little

00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:25,550
zest up is the video graphics very odd

00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:28,010
vga for sure Pan Am those are the small

00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:30,050
cars all cars that you have in your

00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:33,830
laptops or pcs that generate graphics

00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:36,170
for you and one of the biggest problems

00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:39,080
i think is we just missed the it just

00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:43,250
works moment when you have your your new

00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:47,300
aunt Amelia 999 super super awesome vga

00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:51,380
card you plug it in and that it just has

00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:54,950
the same or even verse frame by frame

00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:56,120
rates why is that because we just

00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:58,040
actually missed it because it just

00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,660
doesn't work because first of all the

00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,490
colonel doesn't care the colonel

00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:04,550
actually dismissed binary compatibility

00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:08,060
for device drivers for the sake of

00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:10,670
evolution but actually the problem is

00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:13,400
that the colonel guys actually have

00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:17,120
valid reasons for dismissing battery

00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:18,370
compatibility but the desktop guys the

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,250
ones who were you know

00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:26,440
xorg drivers or whatever for there for

00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:28,210
there for interfacing BTW vga card they

00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,230
just don't have the power the desktop

00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:31,390
market share loonocks is like

00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:33,640
one-point-three percent does anyone care

00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:36,309
about like if you have if you have a

00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:39,280
huge market like Nvidia and I ET de TI

00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:40,809
has would you care about 1% would you

00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:43,930
care about that one percent I don't

00:24:40,809 --> 00:24:45,640
think you will and then what happens is

00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:48,010
that you just you know they just don't

00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:49,900
really care about now and but they have

00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:51,400
to care about the curl which is like two

00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,750
different things right now they care

00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,880
about the colonel because the colonel

00:24:52,750 --> 00:25:00,130
has a huge sharing service based and

00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:01,990
other spaces and but desktop you don't

00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:03,610
really care even if the curl supports

00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:07,150
vga card it doesn't mean that the

00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:08,530
desktop also supports it and then this

00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:11,170
is the fact yeah the girl doesn't happen

00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:13,090
a fighter so because of the buyer in

00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:15,760
this mission which is this face to

00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:18,370
Colonel dismiss the binary compatible

00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,170
device drivers and that's good because

00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:22,960
of the evolution it allows for faster

00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:24,370
evolution of software you don't have to

00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,620
be backwards compatible with all the

00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:31,210
modules from the 2.6 series of the

00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:32,980
colonel find it doesn't work that way

00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:35,830
for the desktop

00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:39,730
and another thing that I would love to

00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:42,190
have is this software you raise that we

00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:44,590
have from windows right everybody can

00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:47,770
set your GPU speed and you know all that

00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:50,710
stuff did we have a Linux I didn't see

00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:52,240
and actually you know that's quite a

00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:54,610
useful thing that would haven't fixed

00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:58,350
some problems if it had but we that is

00:25:54,610 --> 00:26:00,130
has to eat faster debugging as well

00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:03,309
unfortunately we don't have that because

00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:07,000
we only sadly we're one percent of the

00:26:03,309 --> 00:26:08,620
market which is kind of bad but that's

00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,950
what we have that's what we have to be

00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:15,669
happy with it right another thing yes

00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:20,440
backwards compatibility of my bat

00:26:15,669 --> 00:26:23,530
sleeves i love it win32 k which is the

00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:27,640
ABI of the of the windows operating

00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:30,120
system is quite stable the win 98

00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:33,040
applications could can run in windows 8

00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:35,890
which is very interesting right that's

00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:39,220
actually 19 years a little compatibility

00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:40,720
which is the same age as I am so for how

00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:43,919
long I have life I could just run the

00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:48,299
same application of mine members machine

00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:52,540
and which only left side is the gtk

00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:54,730
dunno kit and QT for ke iron backwards

00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:56,919
compatible so you if you have like an

00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:59,919
application brilliant gtk 10 years ago

00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:05,860
chances are if you recompile it it won't

00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:08,350
work which sucks for making up for

00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:10,390
keeping old applications thank you know

00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:12,580
you have that super useful project that

00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:15,220
was abandoned ten years ago and that you

00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:16,330
need for your printers to work you don't

00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:18,040
really want to rewrite the whole thing

00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:20,940
just to make it work even though I have

00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:24,000
to once but whatever

00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:26,420
another thing is the rate of change like

00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:31,140
how often operating systems change now

00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:33,180
linux distributions up do change windows

00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:36,270
updates its major version every two to

00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:39,480
three years an average sometimes even

00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:41,190
more that's not a point and the thing of

00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:44,130
that is there are no big changes in that

00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:47,850
time so if you have Windows XP you have

00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:50,190
the same exact windows XP feeling when

00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:52,830
you are great to service back to write

00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:56,060
the same exact you are sick software

00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:59,010
nobody nothing breaks muscles out right

00:27:56,060 --> 00:28:01,380
but in Abraham we have three loops test

00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:03,150
results linux distro sandford you know

00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:05,790
they release quite frequently and there

00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:07,560
are big changes in there like you know

00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:09,960
changing from ground to to roam free I

00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:11,820
don't get me wrong I laugh at this this

00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:15,360
is you know this is great for developers

00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:17,640
all right the one on have changed fast

00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:21,960
and they won't change every time they

00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:24,120
want to use the newest technologies came

00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:26,250
off like 10 years ago it was like yeah

00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:28,710
let's say small switch no I know it's

00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:30,780
like but still you know if you're not

00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:37,080
following development just upgrade and

00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:39,000
they just witches whatever so I think

00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:41,100
it's like you know yeah maybe go three

00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:48,380
is not the best example but these

00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:48,380
happens I have had that and yeah ours

00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:54,159
why do you say something but I actually

00:28:51,789 --> 00:29:00,249
forget so I'm just going to skip to the

00:28:54,159 --> 00:29:02,289
next slide oh you said so now this is so

00:29:00,249 --> 00:29:04,269
far it sounded like a rent of the nicest

00:29:02,289 --> 00:29:07,149
up I don't want to make it rant because

00:29:04,269 --> 00:29:10,899
I actually believe that the ghetto there

00:29:07,149 --> 00:29:13,169
exists on for coming yeah so there's

00:29:10,899 --> 00:29:18,190
going to be great talk about gaming

00:29:13,169 --> 00:29:20,379
today and we've tomorrow are somewhere

00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:23,980
in this press conference and it's going

00:29:20,379 --> 00:29:25,239
to be a better gaming and because on the

00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:27,100
gimmicks I he has some great stuff

00:29:25,239 --> 00:29:28,720
happened to us that fascinates the

00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:31,210
faster development of lunatics estar

00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:34,239
like siloam is XD voice like you have

00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:36,249
that machine on your data runs this is a

00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:37,989
based on TBN and and you can just run

00:29:36,249 --> 00:29:41,580
games an end that this operation is

00:29:37,989 --> 00:29:44,049
amiss especially created for gaming

00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:47,529
there are some gaming engines that are

00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:49,119
turning to linux that ulcers our started

00:29:47,529 --> 00:29:50,889
supporting linux like critic which is

00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:54,549
may I don't know how to pronounce but

00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:58,929
pretty tech nothing which is the engine

00:29:54,549 --> 00:30:00,700
behind of some great games and unreal

00:29:58,929 --> 00:30:02,230
engine we should really nice engine you

00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,609
can just quickly throw the game scarier

00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:04,960
if you have a game that was written a

00:30:03,609 --> 00:30:07,450
real and gene and make bricks and

00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:10,179
windows never know sort of Tamil linux

00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:13,629
and better but a specially its

00:30:10,179 --> 00:30:16,539
development of bikes because you know

00:30:13,629 --> 00:30:19,090
gaming actually is grateful for giving

00:30:16,539 --> 00:30:20,859
the whole foods that stuff to people who

00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:25,019
aren't you know family or with

00:30:20,859 --> 00:30:27,309
programming and stuff even other side

00:30:25,019 --> 00:30:29,739
they're really there are some

00:30:27,309 --> 00:30:31,960
interesting improvements i think that is

00:30:29,739 --> 00:30:34,119
that nvidia is compatible with bumblebee

00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:36,070
so which is cool but you know you can

00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:38,470
actually switch these the optimist

00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:41,109
technology just like you have two GPUs

00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:42,169
and your laptop and you can switch

00:30:41,109 --> 00:30:45,169
between the two GP

00:30:42,169 --> 00:30:47,090
hang on the load of the office old GPA

00:30:45,169 --> 00:30:50,809
and it's compatible with the appropriate

00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:52,639
driver school and there's some also

00:30:50,809 --> 00:30:54,499
other improvements to the GPU drivers in

00:30:52,639 --> 00:30:57,200
terms of performance instabilities

00:30:54,499 --> 00:30:59,809
boiler kernels open-source drivers

00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:03,499
involved in the proprietary drivers as

00:30:59,809 --> 00:31:05,409
well and it's good because this is

00:31:03,499 --> 00:31:07,489
actually passively develop the

00:31:05,409 --> 00:31:08,899
development of the works desktop and how

00:31:07,489 --> 00:31:11,389
it will eventually become even better

00:31:08,899 --> 00:31:15,859
better better which we all have our

00:31:11,389 --> 00:31:17,960
sticking of this what we want right so

00:31:15,859 --> 00:31:21,970
that we're approaching the end so

00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:26,029
there's like when it's ah yeah so okay

00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:28,159
work stories are here right so who else

00:31:26,029 --> 00:31:30,970
Texas will be the year of excess top of

00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:33,499
you though it's always fast like 2015 I

00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:35,480
I'm trying to be optimistic I still have

00:31:33,499 --> 00:31:38,389
my hopes high i still really linux will

00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:42,350
be great so but i think realistically

00:31:38,389 --> 00:31:44,239
answer is this work is not soon right

00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:47,029
it's there are some problems it all

00:31:44,239 --> 00:31:49,639
looks to stopping we all hope that it

00:31:47,029 --> 00:31:51,019
will be fixed as soon as possible but

00:31:49,639 --> 00:31:54,799
there will be some other people trying

00:31:51,019 --> 00:31:56,210
it figure out what happens next I'm

00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:58,429
unfortunately not so much into the

00:31:56,210 --> 00:32:00,590
desktop so i don't really work the best

00:31:58,429 --> 00:32:03,109
that thing didn't work even though I I

00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:05,480
do love to work or did I stop it and

00:32:03,109 --> 00:32:08,779
make it better for people and I do have

00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:10,549
some I do help my friends and my family

00:32:08,779 --> 00:32:14,179
finds out that stuff but that's all I

00:32:10,549 --> 00:32:17,440
can do right now so that's the end of

00:32:14,179 --> 00:32:21,609
the talk if you have any questions for

00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,609
what if you want this again sure

00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:41,059
but yeah it's always this you know

00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:44,270
question and he kind of put something to

00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:47,419
me is like theory and it is hear me out

00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:50,750
on this right most people accessing

00:32:47,419 --> 00:32:53,779
means that and will access in computing

00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:55,070
from their mobile device yeah and for a

00:32:53,779 --> 00:32:57,020
lot of people they're going to have back

00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:59,330
especially in various classical don't

00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:01,880
even have access access to this they've

00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:04,340
got access to this now what is the

00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:06,590
number one dominant market on the front

00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:08,659
example right we check the hardness when

00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:10,789
his curve doctor he raised an

00:33:08,659 --> 00:33:16,640
interesting point that was the year the

00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:25,700
Linux desktop has come and gone yeah

00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:27,289
it's not yeah it's what I asked that's

00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,970
one of the reasons why i had a sly like

00:33:27,289 --> 00:33:30,850
we have to define what his looks that's

00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:34,250
all right it's just not going to come

00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:39,140
like next year's it's like wrong person

00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:40,630
right plus you but why would you say

00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:44,320
that

00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:46,540
okay yeah sure so yeah if you were

00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:49,060
actually feeling he'll buy avodart extra

00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:51,580
slide for you if you are interesting in

00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:55,030
water problems about little excess stuff

00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:57,220
there is a huge place like 500 items or

00:33:55,030 --> 00:34:01,540
so that actually lists problems with

00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:04,290
Alexis that why it doesn't work why why

00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:07,390
you know wise current situation s is and

00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:10,649
there are some improvements the list has

00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:15,159
been decreasing and increasing in agents

00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:29,110
over the years but we'll see what

00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:31,480
happens right so yeah thank you sure we

00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:33,070
have like 10 minutes okay so yeah I'm

00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:39,070
giving a talk later made up we go

00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:47,080
desktop yep and pro protein see you next

00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:48,909
to go to the net working it's like you

00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:50,669
avoided the entire Harbor compatibility

00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:58,020
problems

00:34:50,669 --> 00:34:59,130
servers platter is dis things I think

00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:00,240
I'm running my company it's like it's

00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,859
pointless to try to get people are

00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:04,500
trying stole my desktop there's some of

00:35:01,859 --> 00:35:08,270
that company politics and requirements

00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:08,270
from the book corporate

00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:23,060
I don't know actually like you know it

00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:25,250
like still running looks on your

00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:30,440
computer having another examples would

00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:35,990
be like fire install work desktop I

00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:38,119
would not want get mighty damn proud

00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:40,280
this is a like me TIFF desktop

00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:42,050
absolutely quietly there's even some web

00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:45,380
apps about our company like two months

00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:47,599
ago they'd only spare food IE for sure

00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:50,150
is that it becomes even like developing

00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:51,980
what apps brand new ones my samara

00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:54,950
growth forests and they only support IE

00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:57,680
howdy yeah the other nor to minimize

00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:59,720
cost of internet export their web moment

00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,910
that they're making their the only

00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:05,660
testing their applications with school

00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:10,339
so it's there's so many like trying to

00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:17,690
replace let other words you know land

00:36:10,339 --> 00:36:19,340
minor problems yeah why fair yes

00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:25,820
successfully if you wanted people to do

00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:28,220
their glad to see things and all that

00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:29,570
stuff I never actually did that but I

00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:31,820
might actually try it going to try to

00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:33,650
yeah i mean i can start like a

00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:35,060
topological written or smaller tech

00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:38,210
companies from allegra and they oversee

00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:40,010
notes you want replaced from the OS on

00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:43,280
your laptop and desktop no problem but

00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:58,650
just at large enterprises there's so

00:36:43,280 --> 00:37:29,630
many desktops of the whole

00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:29,630
I reach this point before yep

00:37:29,819 --> 00:37:44,430
it's a recent time I think I'm sorry

00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:46,650
who's this yeah you can go chrome OS but

00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:50,130
basically my problem is that I'm

00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:54,660
developer so I really use it because I'm

00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:56,190
trying to do work right so mournfully I

00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:57,719
think one of the problems it looks dead

00:37:56,190 --> 00:38:01,170
stuff is it tries to be better for

00:37:57,719 --> 00:38:03,390
everybody so why what I really adore

00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:05,640
about Fedora is that we actually have

00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:08,190
targeted audience now for federal work

00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:10,229
station and others developers and the

00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:14,130
verdict station protect now is really

00:38:10,229 --> 00:38:15,989
suited for developers I love it and you

00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:17,910
know like you I think I think one of the

00:38:15,989 --> 00:38:19,229
problems it's a staffing in general is

00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:20,759
that you can't be good for everybody and

00:38:19,229 --> 00:38:22,829
there's no such thing as the door

00:38:20,759 --> 00:38:24,900
accessories it's linux desktop for

00:38:22,829 --> 00:38:27,509
programmers phone accepts our for gamers

00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:29,849
and stuff like that right yes this

00:38:27,509 --> 00:38:31,190
message that I think about crumb curve

00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:35,190
is good if you want to read emails

00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:37,109
Facebook and other stuff but it's good

00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:40,019
for the newbie internet use it right so

00:38:37,109 --> 00:38:43,709
I think that somebody out here you have

00:38:40,019 --> 00:38:46,410
yeah sometimes I think the problem is

00:38:43,709 --> 00:38:48,329
that proposition arid very sweet nobody

00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:51,349
who's just arrived and I think it's some

00:38:48,329 --> 00:38:51,349
sort of thing while you're walking at

00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:57,650
they realize that there is really no

00:38:55,070 --> 00:39:00,530
limits because of UK learning units you

00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:02,840
get all the problem yeah yes just a

00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:05,060
little bit really it's like you know

00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:07,730
that's a good organization or or even

00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:10,880
two or steam OS and they are very

00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:12,170
independent in some detective it keeps

00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,420
talking about them that they are all

00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:15,890
basically the same group creates a lot

00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:18,080
of these issues because people inspect

00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:19,880
at hey I can you know there which within

00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:22,880
10 desktops and expected to over at the

00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:26,960
same yeah the problem is the common

00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:29,360
label yeah so I mean sometimes men lots

00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,340
of problems you need surviving this what

00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:33,080
where you stopped calling the news does

00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:36,610
it say that actually normal to focusing

00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:36,610
on Terry so I can or a recession

00:39:41,880 --> 00:40:28,590
I think that's one of the reasons why

00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:29,850
the main figures go about i think i was

00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:31,620
gonna say is you know you mentioned all

00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:34,310
those like the packet so you wanna

00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:37,230
change the setting my gateway yep oddly

00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:41,310
close though the system oh yeah

00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:42,900
subscribe dad so you know all the costs

00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:46,390
desktop environment compatibility

00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:52,370
operability stuff is defined or invite

00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:54,730
desktop that organ there a place in like

00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:57,470
they have a bunch of settings for older

00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:59,900
students to find like the proxy setting

00:40:57,470 --> 00:41:02,210
is defined by the next ed setting heavy

00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:04,880
death environment nobody comes out right

00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:06,500
now it needs that proxy settings so they

00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,870
do have some sentence but I think they

00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:10,850
need a lot more to be defined does that

00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:16,820
disappoint another example is you know

00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:18,470
like a screen saver time that's like

00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:20,960
this is what I was talking about

00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:23,150
everybody is in a race with each other

00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:25,580
right now they did another loser like to

00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:28,760
my desktop clients not distros you know

00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:31,840
and I mean no like Norman Katy we have

00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,840
work to know very well and

00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:38,800
yeah that's like you know I think I

00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:41,170
think it's part of the race like it's

00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,220
we're not working together all right I

00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:47,740
feel like there's a race between

00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:49,869
districts but not but not as not as

00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:54,310
they're not let the FD but if he doesn't

00:41:49,869 --> 00:41:56,200
down that's specific data sea oh you

00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:59,650
have to you should work together more

00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:02,040
closely at South but the market is not

00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:02,040
the way is

00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:21,880
there isn't a peril I think you can

00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:27,569
easily apparently be really I don't

00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:30,400
think I've ever virtually the program

00:42:27,569 --> 00:42:32,829
that once again it sold by the

00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,809
industry's before it because you know

00:42:32,829 --> 00:42:36,609
what we talked to some his number is an

00:42:34,809 --> 00:42:38,589
API that some other things you can

00:42:36,609 --> 00:42:41,140
in a bit campy and it doesn't course

00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:43,269
help you have you know k if you just

00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:47,230
always do your duty version changed or

00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:50,109
coercion change forever and so it's so

00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:53,789
fun time in form is looking backward

00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:56,890
compatibility we go take all this way

00:42:53,789 --> 00:43:00,369
you know it is moving platform with 10

00:42:56,890 --> 00:43:02,230
million pieces through and I mean I

00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:06,309
guess the pics are trying to work on

00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:08,279
their new mobile of doing application

00:43:06,309 --> 00:43:11,140
but during a library but meant for and

00:43:08,279 --> 00:43:18,329
applications which I think in the era

00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:21,519
was the fix I believe me that i'm very

00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:23,380
nice applications will check i'm going

00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:24,819
to happen to know this base with two

00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:28,180
approaches that he will take to getting

00:43:24,819 --> 00:43:30,190
software the Windows desktop approaches

00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:33,630
go to the software programs websites

00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:36,609
yeah mozilla.org yeah Dobie adobe.com

00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:39,910
parameter the mobile approaches you get

00:43:36,609 --> 00:43:41,680
from the app store so it's harder for

00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:43,020
linux conform to that the former

00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:45,540
standard for understand

00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:47,970
softest and which uses you know damn a

00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:49,470
dnf so I feel like that you wouldn't

00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:52,650
have to work on two people downloading

00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:59,250
mana more pm's our guests thanks to this

00:43:52,650 --> 00:44:01,020
office yeah by the pepper I do you think

00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:03,270
we do there's only dinner featured

00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:05,700
playing four notes office and the reason

00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:07,980
I came up with this firefox example is

00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:09,780
that people coming over from windows are

00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:13,910
used to having people to download it

00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:13,910
grabs and rpms from the website we are

00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:27,390
teaching classroom you know so I had a

00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:30,270
lot of phones tablet and I bought it

00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:32,040
myself before 2020 hearing cleaning at

00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:33,990
work at seven him you've got this wacom

00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:36,060
tablet it actually even said it was into

00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:37,680
a spoon and it just works so I was like

00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:39,720
Grandma taken into classroom that we've

00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,850
got me there 70 in a classroom so I

00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:44,400
 to machine one of the kids to

00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:47,580
define it okay thank you for us ben poco

00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:49,680
than its story doesn't know what it is

00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:51,060
so then we have to go on a man to Google

00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,770
we have to actually get the dryer and

00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:55,830
have downloaded to go to make my driving

00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:58,230
file and everything else and i find that

00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:59,880
like so i've got i always say to you

00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:01,470
cross these they're for my mother but it

00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:04,290
is my mother that I was three years I've

00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:05,400
got my mother using fedora and the

00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:07,170
reason I

00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:09,030
that was because she was having so much

00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:10,530
trouble everything wanted to download

00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:12,900
drivers and everything else so it's

00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:15,810
actually easier for me to save money by

00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:17,370
just do dinner install this or go to the

00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:18,930
software center and how that she likes

00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:21,060
playing little games those very often

00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:22,920
look at that and I think that we need to

00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:24,600
do a lot of Education and I've no

00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:26,090
tutorials and things around meant the

00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:28,980
average user to show you them actually

00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:30,780
this is a really it's a lot easier this

00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:32,520
is how you this is how you should use it

00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:34,470
right attendant follows the model oh

00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:37,740
maybe that's a good point is if we can

00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:39,030
tie it into the app model for people is

00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:40,830
what like just how you go can you

00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:42,720
download your place to rap or whatever

00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:46,080
you're not you can download a Southwest

00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:48,510
and out perhaps you should have version

00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:50,730
so quite a problem stuff like it don't

00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:53,670
desktop vocalist who is killing no

00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:55,530
here's how do you know yeah we should do

00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:56,730
we should have like bitter extensions

00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:59,090
like here's how the installed software

00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:59,090
on

00:46:05,289 --> 00:46:08,469
switch it up

00:46:30,099 --> 00:46:36,489
I mean visual geyser yes what's visual

00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:42,670
sweet chocolate really cruel jest that

00:46:36,489 --> 00:46:45,960
in the old time was that be was just

00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:45,960
gonna say yeah

00:46:57,550 --> 00:47:01,360
