Description: 
	There's a lot of new technologies and standards out there that are driving the IoT (Internet of Things) revolution including 802.15.4 WPAN, 6LOWPAN, Thread group, MQTT, CoAP. A lot of those standards have open source reference implementations. There's a lot of existing IoT devices that run Linux on ARM. What is the state of these in Fedora? How well do they work? What extra work needs to be done to enable Fedora to excel as a development platform for the Internet of Things revolution. I'll cover kernel and hardware support, network stack support, gateway requirements as well as a number of messaging and middleware components that are designed for enabling of IoT devices, gateways as well as IoT server components that might be useful in a complete IoT platform.
