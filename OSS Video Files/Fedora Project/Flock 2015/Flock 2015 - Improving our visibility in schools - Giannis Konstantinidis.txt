Title: Flock 2015 - Improving our visibility in schools - Giannis Konstantinidis
Publication date: 2015-08-26
Playlist: Flock 2015
Description: 
	High schools and universities are important places where we should conduct outreach. Students are the ones that would later grow up using fedora and free & open source software in general. They are also the ones that could become part of our community and contribute their time, talent and skills to our project. We need to provide more resources and tips to ambassadors that wish to spread out the word. The Campus Ambassadors program aimed to do that, but is dead and sadly never truly worked out. In this talk we will be discussing about possible ways of doing that, in an attempt to bring the Campus Ambassadors program back to life. We will also have a look into what didn't work quite well in the recent past and recognise potential challenges. It's important we increase our efforts to have a greater impact on target groups like these.
