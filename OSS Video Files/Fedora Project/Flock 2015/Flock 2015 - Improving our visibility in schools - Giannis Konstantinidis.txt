Title: Flock 2015 - Improving our visibility in schools - Giannis Konstantinidis
Publication date: 2015-08-26
Playlist: Flock 2015
Description: 
	High schools and universities are important places where we should conduct outreach. Students are the ones that would later grow up using fedora and free & open source software in general. They are also the ones that could become part of our community and contribute their time, talent and skills to our project. We need to provide more resources and tips to ambassadors that wish to spread out the word. The Campus Ambassadors program aimed to do that, but is dead and sadly never truly worked out. In this talk we will be discussing about possible ways of doing that, in an attempt to bring the Campus Ambassadors program back to life. We will also have a look into what didn't work quite well in the recent past and recognise potential challenges. It's important we increase our efforts to have a greater impact on target groups like these.

foot to press the recording button that

00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:10,219
was quite an achievement so now I did

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,530
though so I mean those students have

00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:15,150
assignments in universities or tasks or

00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,470
projects to complete and they need to

00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,270
your specific software that they need to

00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,279
buy so what do they do if they cannot

00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,529
afford it sometimes they use pirated

00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:24,000
software so they become pirates but

00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:26,099
that's illegal that's an illegal thing

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,650
we don't want that we don't want to

00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:30,210
convert students to pirates we want to

00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,399
present them with friend open source

00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,620
software alternatives not just freezing

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,270
freedom but also as in free beer so we

00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:41,850
keep both of these perspectives in mind

00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:43,890
so another thing is that students are

00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,840
tied to close source software once they

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,370
start using it the type drug they keep

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,410
using it for years they buy the next

00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:53,670
version of the software and they just

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:55,949
keep buying it over the time so there

00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:58,949
are some cases where software companies

00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:02,120
they offer software to students for free

00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:04,379
as let's say University valuations or

00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,880
education valuations upcoming they

00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:07,170
offered for free but they don't do that

00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,820
because they are philanthropists they

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,460
don't want to help people they want to

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,979
gain I mean they won't get to gain new

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,770
user new users because these people they

00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:19,350
will get the software for free on their

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:21,330
students but once they grow up they will

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:25,920
have to buy it to be used in their work

00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:29,159
or in home so what are you doing this I

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,710
mean they try to gain new users by

00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:35,610
providing free evaluations to students

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:39,299
and I don't think students related to

00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:41,189
ice studies such as computer science or

00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,320
software engineering or whatever

00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:45,720
anything related to ICD they don't give

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,950
the chance to see how close source

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,229
software operate because they kill

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,460
attacks in the source code but but with

00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:51,840
free and open source software they can

00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,369
do that because they have access to the

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,020
source code they can view the code they

00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:56,930
can become better developers they can do

00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,670
take a look they can do that stuff and

00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:02,159
last but not least another point is an

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:05,189
education is about saying of knowledge

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,079
for free for free to everyone but closer

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:10,739
software is supposed to that it's qaeda

00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:11,770
posed and for that i would like to hold

00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:15,340
rates of some

00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:17,350
in one of his interviews he said that he

00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,970
said a small story he said imagine a

00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:22,780
classroom where there are lots of

00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:26,470
students inside it in a open source in

00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:28,360
the fridge open source ecosystem there

00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:30,880
will be the student who will check those

00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,460
candies and she would sell those cards

00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:36,130
with his friends but on the other hand

00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:37,900
on a close source ecosystem that

00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:40,630
wouldn't be possible there will be the

00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:42,340
teacher who would say hey Mike you vote

00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:44,560
to block those candies for yourself you

00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,510
bought them but you're the only person

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,850
that needs to own those gabby's you can

00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:50,770
observe them with your friends say in

00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:53,800
this piracy you're being a pirate you're

00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:56,200
being illegal you cannot do that so that

00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:59,380
was quite an interesting story but he

00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:01,480
said so definitely free and open source

00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:05,070
software deserves a shoots place in

00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:10,120
education now more specifically

00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:12,010
regarding fedora so I would like to talk

00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:15,690
a bit about the induced pin or they do

00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:18,640
remix whatever we end up producing or

00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:21,220
whatever we end up discussing so what

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,230
about the tea mix or best pin imagine

00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:25,870
that we could build a custom fedora

00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:28,360
environment to be used in education and

00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:30,280
that environment would include

00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,230
definitely apps for any use for example

00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,350
a web browser and office productivity

00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:38,980
suit a media players or basic software

00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:41,950
that students need to use but it will

00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:44,590
additionally include other apps relate

00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:49,440
to education for example KDA do I mean

00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:52,930
most of you should care of it right no

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:55,150
okay yeah good I mean the KDE do project

00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:57,100
includes lots of educational relating

00:03:55,150 --> 00:04:01,480
applications to be used by students in

00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:03,730
different stages of education so this

00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,350
software should be available to be

00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:07,630
adopted and used in no state of

00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:09,400
education so that's at least primary

00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:11,110
education secondary education and

00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:15,280
tertiary education that Sheree's

00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:17,260
post-secondary every teacher and student

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,359
should be able to customize it their own

00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:22,720
needs so we definitely need to provide

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:25,200
instructions on how to do that what are

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,200
the benefits of that what the students

00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:30,630
game and what also we could gain by

00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:33,600
providing a custom floor an environment

00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:35,580
like that so first of all zero cost okay

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,800
they don't need to buy it that's a good

00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,330
thing for the students because they end

00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,430
up with good quality software that they

00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:43,700
can use for free to be productive in

00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:48,180
their school environments or at home

00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:51,930
it's safe for them I mean it's an

00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:54,420
out-of-the-box this dro that requires

00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:58,340
minimal customization and continuosly

00:04:54,420 --> 00:05:00,660
instantly and they don't need to install

00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:02,670
additional software for protection for

00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,530
example most of the students currently I

00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:06,420
mean they have to buy other kinds of

00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:08,850
software such as security software mean

00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:11,370
antivirus software I will stuff like

00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:14,280
that in magnitude windows so they don't

00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:16,350
need to buy additional software by using

00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,710
fedora or any Linux system in general

00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:21,660
and another thing is that they get rid

00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:23,430
the green so we could get rid of all

00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:26,130
those crappy software that are bonded

00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:28,950
with OEM Mike's windows installs so

00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:31,250
that's a good thing it's stable because

00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:35,400
as I said okay it's kind of stable

00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:37,380
because as I said it's it just works out

00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:40,080
of the box they have to do minimal

00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:44,640
customizations and it can be portable I

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:46,380
mean imagine having a portable feather

00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,720
educational environment that any student

00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,910
can use in application for example they

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,320
can come a federal live USB stick with

00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:55,110
their custom federal environment with

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,640
all their ups and their data and for

00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:58,140
example when they visit the computer

00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:01,050
laboratory in their schools they can

00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:03,060
just plug it in they can use it and when

00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:04,740
they go home they can share the same

00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,510
federal environment with them everywhere

00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:10,040
they go how cool is that I mean for

00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:13,110
students that would be very very handy

00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:15,720
its innovative because as you may know

00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:18,680
in fedora we are we're always six months

00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:22,500
ahead of other distros it's one of our

00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:24,360
four foundations its features we always

00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,700
make sure to include all the latest

00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,190
advancements in the linux world wherever

00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,840
always ahead of others so we probe that

00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:34,110
will provide them with innovative

00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:36,150
software that they can use okay fully

00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:38,680
customizable as I mentioned earlier they

00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:40,539
should be able to customize to tailor it

00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:44,259
to their own needs so it does exactly

00:06:40,539 --> 00:06:46,389
the kind of computing they want and it's

00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:47,860
backed by the community so if there are

00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:50,020
going to any problems and different in

00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:55,270
support we would be there to shove them

00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:57,400
okay but where are we now are we

00:06:55,270 --> 00:07:00,009
covering education what are we doing to

00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:02,080
provide a specific federal environment

00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:05,320
for education so basically what we ship

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,660
now is soas which is sugar on a stick I

00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:13,210
guess ok I see them XO laptop over there

00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:15,160
perfect perfect but SOA is it's mostly

00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:19,660
for preschool education it's for young

00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:22,449
children ok maybe until I don't know 11

00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:25,900
years old let's say maximum I mean not

00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:27,300
not more than that and on the other side

00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:30,009
we also have further scientific

00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:32,500
providing my federal labs it to use this

00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:35,320
it could be a spin but now it's called

00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:37,960
it's a spin but it's part of federal

00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:39,550
labs so which is the significant spin

00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,349
but this is mostly for tertiary

00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:43,240
education it's for university students

00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:45,639
and more specifically it's for

00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:49,870
scientists it's for people not to want

00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:52,510
to use science or related tools ok what

00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:54,430
we use to share is fel a federal

00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:56,680
economic lab also haven't fed us feel

00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:58,659
but again this was mostly for tertiary

00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,580
education it was for university students

00:07:58,659 --> 00:08:02,770
and it was for people that wanted to use

00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:05,020
open doors to design further so even a

00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:07,150
more specific target group so as you can

00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:08,889
see there is a huge gap I mean currently

00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:11,949
we just have a preschool education and

00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:13,479
tertiary education so we need to make

00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:16,659
sure that we cover other scientists of

00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:19,389
education as well so what can we do

00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:22,720
about that as I said make sure that we

00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:25,599
should try to cover as many states of

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,030
education as possible we need to sell

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,039
all kinds of students we should not

00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:32,079
focus on specific target groups we need

00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:33,490
to shop at one when we need every we

00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:35,200
want everyone to benefit from our

00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:41,680
actions and from our products from

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:44,860
Marvin pellets so an idea would be as i

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:47,140
mentioned to produce a spin or remix

00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:49,300
that can be used in all senses in

00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:52,550
education inside and outside the

00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:54,380
classroom ok and even if we

00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:57,860
rainstorm and we agreed not to do that

00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:59,779
at least we should provide some simple

00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:01,279
and straightforward instructions for

00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:03,800
people that want to build their custom

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:07,760
federal government's okay kindly I mean

00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:09,649
there are few booty pages describing how

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:13,640
someone can create this all over here on

00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:15,860
fedora remix but this is a big technical

00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,720
it's not very straightforward I mean

00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:19,850
someone who's a big technical person to

00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:22,040
do that not everyone can do that so it

00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:24,620
will be a very good idea if you can at

00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:27,579
least provide some good distractions so

00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,579
that everyone can do that

00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:40,129
okay and now the hot topic for today

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,079
that's not working so now for the folk

00:09:40,129 --> 00:09:45,949
topic of today about the campus

00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:47,569
ambassadors program so what about it

00:09:45,949 --> 00:09:50,620
what was the campus of masters program

00:09:47,569 --> 00:09:53,720
because it was kindly doesn't exist in

00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:57,470
practice so the federal campus

00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,999
ambassadors program focused on spreading

00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:01,220
the word of fedora in schools and

00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:04,189
universities in all places of the world

00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:06,170
okay and it was connected to the larger

00:10:04,189 --> 00:10:07,999
fedora bastards program and if someone

00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:09,920
want to become a federal campus

00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:13,550
ambassador she or she had to previously

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:17,420
become a fully vetted fedora master so

00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:20,209
there was up condition but the thing is

00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:24,170
that it never worked out it's kind of

00:10:20,209 --> 00:10:25,730
dead and the whole initiative it got

00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:27,379
stuck in its formative stages I mean

00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:30,800
there wasn't any final structure for it

00:10:27,379 --> 00:10:34,249
there's just a few wiki pages about the

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:37,120
program but nothing was finalized so it

00:10:34,249 --> 00:10:40,279
got stuck there and it never progressed

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,410
so I believe Vince important to see more

00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:44,389
fedora and schools and I also believe

00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:47,569
that we need a specific set of

00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:49,819
ambassadors to do that so what I would

00:10:47,569 --> 00:10:52,399
like to propose to you today is that we

00:10:49,819 --> 00:10:54,529
should consider bringing the campus of

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,699
masters program back to life and for

00:10:54,529 --> 00:11:00,220
that I would like to propose a few

00:10:55,699 --> 00:11:03,259
changes the structure so first of all

00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:07,450
think of the word campus what does it

00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:11,530
make you think of campus

00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:14,270
so the school or university or college

00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:16,040
so the world can boost it makes you

00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:20,120
think of colleges and universities

00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:23,390
mostly okay so the first thing I'd like

00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:25,130
to propose we should change is changing

00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:28,070
the name from campus ambassador soon the

00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:31,190
password okay so this is a much broader

00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:35,320
term students it's applicable in no

00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:39,290
sense of Education and we want to share

00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:41,060
ambassadors from different states of

00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:42,770
education we should along refocusing

00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:47,090
universities we also have to include

00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:48,680
high schools for example so another

00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:50,900
thing would be that the new program

00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:53,440
would be no longer connected the larger

00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:55,910
Buster through a project it should be a

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:59,000
different thing a completely different

00:11:55,910 --> 00:12:00,620
thing so there won't be that shouldn't

00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,540
be a requirement that someone should be

00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:05,660
an existing federal buzzer in order to

00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:06,980
become a student ambassador ok students

00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:09,140
are young people we need to give them a

00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:11,150
break I mean they don't need to know

00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:12,410
everyone they should process some

00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:14,210
specific knowledge about the

00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:15,950
distribution and the community as a

00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:18,350
whole in the project but they do not

00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:20,780
need to be experts we just want to

00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:22,310
empower people that want to be the

00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:26,180
representatives of federer in their

00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:27,710
schools so we shouldn't chip we

00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,360
shouldn't proposed very tough

00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:30,620
requirements for all students they

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,230
definitely need to process some

00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:35,330
knowledge about us all the distribution

00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:38,180
course they won't be very busy lives but

00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:41,510
they don't need to be experts so how

00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:43,100
we're going to do that students of

00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:45,680
course will go through a manual process

00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:47,089
which have matters to make sure that

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,010
they meet specific criteria before

00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:52,970
become extremely a pastor definitely

00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:55,250
okay so the students could be accepted

00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:58,360
once the mentor feels that the student

00:12:55,250 --> 00:13:02,180
is ready to become a student buster ok

00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:04,700
men this will be connected to their

00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:06,589
mentors at all times this is not

00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:09,800
happening in the current capacitors

00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:10,590
program I mean athlete so many gears to

00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,810
speak to mind

00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:15,750
and I feel bad about that for I mean for

00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:17,940
something we relate to fedora so what

00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:19,710
happens in the current federal masters

00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:23,250
program is that there isn't any direct

00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:25,560
mentir and mentor relationship so we

00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,910
need those young student ambassadors to

00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,680
feel like they're connected to the

00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:33,330
project and that they always give a

00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:36,810
person to support them if needed okay so

00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:39,410
there were there will be amended tied to

00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:43,020
a mentor that's how it's going to work

00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:44,970
in a good way of course the main doors

00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:46,770
would be able to provide their mentees

00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:49,530
with new contribution opportunities as

00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:51,210
they see fit and those students can

00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:52,980
explore more contribution opportunity

00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:54,930
inside the plant project and they can

00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:57,600
even become fully vetted ambassadors at

00:13:54,930 --> 00:14:00,630
some point once they are in for it sure

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,850
we want to end up with we won't soon the

00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:06,120
Masters to become fully impacted abastos

00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:08,730
that's perfectly fine we definitely want

00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,870
that another thing would be to bring it

00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:13,070
back at the federal classroom do you

00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:16,890
guys remember the federal classroom a

00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:20,370
few people only so the federal

00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:21,900
classrooms were IRC sessions shelter by

00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:23,940
experience community members most

00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:26,010
experienced community members about

00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:32,130
different topics about the distribution

00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:34,800
or the whole project okay so new

00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:36,360
contributors could explore new

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,700
opportunities inside the project and

00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,500
they could learn new things the last

00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:45,600
time we shall fedora classroom i think

00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:48,660
was back in 2011 so no one else has been

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,120
holding IRC federal classrooms since

00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:52,890
then that's quite bad thing I mean

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,580
federal classrooms I think they will

00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:58,680
work very well in that's to the master's

00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:02,370
program if we decided to provide that

00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:04,890
and another thing would be that maybe

00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:07,800
maybe we should consider building back

00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:11,310
netted a scholarship and your nose the

00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:14,400
feather scholarship the program okay so

00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:17,900
after scholarship program or worded one

00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:21,330
high school senior it's here for his or

00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:23,460
contributions towards the project okay

00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:25,860
and that was a good way to motivate

00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:28,710
students to do more stuff for fedora and

00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:31,230
also to report one person it's here so

00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:34,020
there was one recipe for received two

00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:38,700
thousand dollars every year for his

00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:43,710
university enrollment and it's not up to

00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:45,690
me if we should bring it back to life

00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:48,180
bring this federal scores back to do

00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:50,160
part two left the sponsor was red hot so

00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:53,310
it's up to read cut to do that but

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:58,560
contest I'm just getting an idea but we

00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:59,970
should reconsider that okay lust by the

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,520
way the last time there was a federal

00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:07,440
scholarship it was back in 2012 since

00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:09,150
then no longer exists so moving on so

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,870
let's say that we shave a new purpose

00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:14,640
fracture let's see what those using the

00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:17,010
muscles to do a few a few possible

00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:20,760
activities that they could do at their

00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:22,020
schools so first of all maybe that first

00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:24,510
thing that comes to mind is to give a

00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:26,790
talk or conduct a workshop about fedora

00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:28,760
either technical or non-technical it

00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:31,650
will be depend on the student on the

00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:34,350
skills the fescue michelle's and will

00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:36,810
also depend on the audience okay so

00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:38,760
that's the first thing that comes to

00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:40,320
mind another thing would be to invite

00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,820
someone else to speak maybe a more

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,290
experienced a master or a more

00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:47,880
experienced federal contributor in

00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:50,010
general okay host a federal in southwest

00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:53,370
they cannot organize install fists in

00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:54,990
their schools in their campuses and they

00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:57,290
can help other students to install

00:16:54,990 --> 00:17:00,000
fedora and machines and they can answer

00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:01,920
questions they can troubleshoot if they

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,500
have any problem second to this kinds of

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:07,770
stuff another cool thing would be to

00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:10,530
maintain a fedora powered computer

00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:14,700
laboratory so these students the skills

00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:17,040
know pastors could consult the professor

00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:19,290
sorta teachers of the computer

00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:23,250
laboratory supervisors depends on their

00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:25,770
school and they can see if it would be

00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,490
possible to share figure powered

00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:28,860
computer lab

00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:31,350
I mean that's very good I would love to

00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:35,220
see schools using federally on their

00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:37,290
machines another thing if there is some

00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,809
good feather presents inside the campus

00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:43,350
or inside the school they should they

00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:47,700
could consider organizing amita for the

00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:49,380
local community okay whenever a new

00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,059
version of federal cancer I did the

00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:54,929
kudos except release parties in their

00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:56,820
schools and last but not least there is

00:17:54,929 --> 00:17:59,700
always the possibility to share a file a

00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:01,740
federal activity day but even if for

00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,420
some reason they cannot hold the part

00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,980
because telling a fund implies there

00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:07,650
needs to be some actual contribution

00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,510
towards the project there need to be

00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:11,760
some metrics for the project even if

00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:14,550
they could do it after activity that can

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:17,220
just chip a day dedicated to fedora with

00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:18,720
presentations and workshops and they can

00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,960
call it a fedora day let's say or

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:24,710
federal weekend it's if it's due days

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:27,510
okay so these are FG boss black tivities

00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:29,520
there's always room for more just

00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:32,040
putting a few ideas there some of these

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:36,870
ideas were also proposed for the campus

00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:38,940
ambassador program ok but ok so far we

00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:40,770
have a new proposed structure and we

00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:43,050
also have a few possible ideas that they

00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:45,600
ask you now Buster's can do but how do

00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:49,350
we begin ok first of all we should let

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:51,030
the federal community know ok with to

00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:54,000
post mailing lists and ask for feedback

00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:56,280
and for new ideas and we definitely need

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
to discuss a lot between us and

00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:01,350
brainstorm put ideas from the tamer and

00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,150
finalize how to come with the new

00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:06,240
structure for the program and finalize

00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:08,850
it ok and subsequently we should update

00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:13,710
existing problems of the wiki and create

00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:15,360
new one with native then the next step

00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:17,520
would be to invite existing federal

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:21,360
passwords who are also students for

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:23,640
example me ok or experience the

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:27,090
passwords in general to join the program

00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:30,150
either student ambassadors or as mentors

00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:32,960
we definitely need mentors to get going

00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:35,399
with this we need people who can leave

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:40,469
the project that technician

00:19:35,399 --> 00:19:41,999
okay and very it's obvious that we need

00:19:40,469 --> 00:19:44,820
to start planning activities in schools

00:19:41,999 --> 00:19:50,609
and try to try to recruit students as

00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:54,019
student ambassadors okay now a few words

00:19:50,609 --> 00:19:58,559
about the university initiative okay

00:19:54,019 --> 00:20:00,809
although I'm not the expert for this so

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:03,330
what about it it's called the University

00:20:00,809 --> 00:20:06,119
involvement initiative and if you chef

00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:08,580
if you read the federal magazine

00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:11,299
frequently you would notice that it's

00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:13,889
one of the current 12 to 18 months

00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:17,719
community objectives and this proposal

00:20:13,889 --> 00:20:20,580
was approved by the Federal Council and

00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:22,919
the description says that it aims to

00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:24,839
increase fedoras expulsion in university

00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:27,629
environment particularly in engineering

00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:29,729
universities okay but unfortunately I

00:20:27,629 --> 00:20:32,070
mean I don't have nuts in from this I

00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:35,969
think when you are working with that

00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:38,099
right so there is a ticket in the

00:20:35,969 --> 00:20:40,169
Federal Council track and there's also a

00:20:38,099 --> 00:20:41,909
wiki page but I mean it's not very

00:20:40,169 --> 00:20:44,099
efficient very clear do we have any

00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:45,839
progress on dots how is it going could

00:20:44,099 --> 00:20:48,629
you please serve some more info maybe

00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:50,129
sure so during the council session

00:20:48,629 --> 00:20:52,200
there's really a two-part session

00:20:50,129 --> 00:20:52,470
tomorrow morning then issue the council

00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,360
member

00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:56,429
reporting back on the objectives that

00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:58,530
are being delivered I'll be giving a

00:20:56,429 --> 00:21:01,020
quick presentation on what's happening

00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:03,960
in fedora education and university

00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:06,270
tissue there hmm but TL DR there are a

00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,100
few specific universities that Fedora is

00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:10,500
working closely with right now including

00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:12,720
RIT here in Rochester which is a big

00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:14,970
reason why the flock bid came through as

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,760
well as a minute and we also have

00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:19,650
programs and co-op programs that we've

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,860
done along with some code or other

00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:24,570
initiatives so really I mean this is

00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:26,220
something that is going to ramp up as we

00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:28,110
get into the school year the first

00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,730
install fest that we have plan are going

00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:31,380
to be around software for free today and

00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:32,760
you've already got at least two schools

00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,620
that are signed on and hopefully we'll

00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,270
get a few more before some time but

00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:39,390
there's a lot more to comment I don't

00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:40,890
wanna take a little time you go

00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:46,500
okay I mean I'm almost ending we're

00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:48,120
almost at 30 minutes so far so that is

00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:51,059
basically my presentation thanks a lot

00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:53,539
for participating and now would be the

00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:56,400
time for discussion let's brainstorm

00:21:53,539 --> 00:21:58,980
let's share a few ideas yeah i have seen

00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,840
comments to make and proportions also if

00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:03,960
you can go back you of this life which

00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:07,620
one does students and pursue whatever

00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:11,539
that campus ambassador taste yeah son

00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:17,250
yeah okay just go back to one more baby

00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:20,039
woman come here come forward yep boss

00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:21,830
changes okay so i just wanted to ask you

00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:24,110
like you remember anything

00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:25,760
two things which were way ahead when we

00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:28,159
talked about him some residents of

00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,320
Normandy happened at that time through

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,690
the background history so one other

00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,269
thing happened was then by the time in

00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:36,860
be sorry later I residency program after

00:22:35,269 --> 00:22:38,539
come here it's late we started

00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:42,019
discussing this campus and perseverance

00:22:38,539 --> 00:22:44,360
and the decision was up and we want to

00:22:42,019 --> 00:22:46,309
do that and we show that a few other

00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:48,710
projects and companies also starting

00:22:46,309 --> 00:22:55,970
their residency program and what a bonus

00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:58,429
our son so we get two thousand six in

00:22:55,970 --> 00:23:00,559
here talking about their Indian pony so

00:22:58,429 --> 00:23:03,710
we shall bury people coming most issues

00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:06,049
like a person come back asks racking

00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:08,600
federer in nearly a scene ago he will

00:23:06,049 --> 00:23:10,639
become episodes and I saw this campus

00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:13,549
ambassador page and it's very nice he

00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:17,510
continued to FINRA by the way which 571

00:23:13,549 --> 00:23:20,220
English me so that was the life in a way

00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:22,450
so that there is no like how this ice

00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:24,820
few companies that went out the back of

00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:27,160
money and that's calling people like

00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:28,630
people that move our project and just

00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,570
like you can still become another sucker

00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:34,000
and go everywhere and this brady any

00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:35,980
extra interested in it because of that

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,190
other goodies rather than the project

00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:42,220
itself and so that's where it started a

00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:44,230
dragon and away we see the number of

00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:46,570
ambassadors you see leg back in two

00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:49,870
thousand nine we have like this huge

00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:52,060
cars going off and then there's huge

00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:53,680
drop because then we have a round

00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:56,050
assistance or whatever a little thing

00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:58,120
and then we came up with ideas like ok

00:23:56,050 --> 00:24:01,060
these people should evil this my lip

00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:04,870
thing unless this much of the project

00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:06,970
and so and so and then there are a few

00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:08,500
countries like in here if you go to the

00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:10,510
miscibility program there is a

00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:13,000
particular message freedom that we

00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:15,280
expect students to actually work of art

00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,490
of the project was absent anything I

00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:22,840
never said yeah but later on but we

00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:25,540
managed to get a little bit of bar 21 to

00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:28,300
enter you represent a program but this

00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:29,860
happened was after that was like the one

00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:33,070
of the project which actually does

00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:34,690
exactly all these things this new Xena

00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:37,090
by baggage today's episode us together

00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:38,770
but I don't know how much you shorten

00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:42,280
the output of it because you are already

00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:44,050
in the abseiling but their youth paste

00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:46,360
number of capacitors with you the

00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:48,220
firebox to relax a basic program and the

00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:52,360
only thing they can talk about is that

00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:54,070
France is great because in a bunch of hm

00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,750
I mean they difference under a perfect

00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:58,660
on it your experience with maybe I mean

00:24:55,750 --> 00:25:00,850
in your experience yeah it's because all

00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:03,190
say we have a clear with the most of the

00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:05,560
readings there are really good students

00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:08,380
were doing stuff but whenever they

00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:10,690
becomes that go to the 11th in sent to

00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:14,410
the next level and start contributing to

00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:16,360
the whole project itself but the one of

00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:18,640
the major problem give up that between

00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:20,410
all the focus only those two or three or

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,720
four students may be one single region

00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:25,810
and but you know everyone wants to

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:28,030
become an epicenter so that whole thing

00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:31,900
is at least for easier that's what we

00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:33,940
said particularly from that region it's

00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:36,130
a horrible ways we can for Mozilla in

00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:39,280
that side everyone wants everyone is

00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:41,560
almost another set of ordered X but they

00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:44,620
don't understand the project at all so

00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:46,630
that's a big question from my point of

00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:49,000
view is like to do with how to handle go

00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:52,390
sleep sleep because you say let's say

00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,280
the Food Network windy the real sec so

00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:56,650
like we make sure that the main heran

00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:59,380
the rain is should reply back let's send

00:25:56,650 --> 00:26:01,480
an email with Olga bracely key once in a

00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:03,820
week and then we have a at least once a

00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:05,560
week at a cat with it makes you just a

00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:07,540
couple of all I assume it is pixel they

00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:09,580
feel part of the community rather than

00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:12,700
someone who wants to be get into the

00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:14,230
community okay so I mean what do you

00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,850
what is your father going who's things

00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:18,790
how we want to handle those kind of

00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:20,980
changes so as I said there needs to be a

00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:23,500
manual process okay so we can just let

00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:25,780
everyone in we propose a few criteria

00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:28,480
for students that want to become soon

00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:31,360
the pastor's okay then we may be there

00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:35,610
would be interview is with a high collar

00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:39,160
and visitors go away again

00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:41,200
we don't necessarily need them it's a

00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,760
bit tough for some young people to

00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,580
become full with the Masters it's not an

00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:47,679
easy process but okay when we see

00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:49,210
ambassador of the world we are talking

00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,490
to the people who are representing your

00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:53,530
brand right kind they should be any

00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:56,380
sound level that they can represent the

00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:58,960
man anywhere in the college or out

00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:01,299
changing it please so I mean how do you

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,220
want to make sure that that bar is there

00:27:01,299 --> 00:27:05,080
babe the people who are interested in

00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:08,340
the project should know more about the

00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:10,900
project at work okay so that's like

00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:13,960
everyone makes it even for you and in

00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:15,610
general if you are snapped yeah yep this

00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:17,470
country if you are you make sure that

00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:19,540
the students are the people who are all

00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:22,390
engines and conservators are we want to

00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:25,030
propose you know you want to be CEO that

00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:26,860
these people are no at the corner of the

00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:30,280
word ambassador means something

00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:32,350
different or and most other places I'm a

00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,280
happy that right it's got a lot of time

00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:36,490
we had

00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:38,440
students and when other programs like

00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:40,480
ability for instance has campus

00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,530
ambassadors and what that means is that

00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,470
Adobe

00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:47,500
risa to give away to other students for

00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:49,570
free and to just chilly the product is a

00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:52,180
product evangelist in the position where

00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:54,520
as ambassadors in fedora is not a

00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:57,340
product case then it's a community-based

00:27:54,520 --> 00:28:00,250
so when we talk to students about

00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:02,200
ambassador programs that that term isn't

00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:04,600
just for ability that's what Microsoft

00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:07,600
that's for any other software ambassador

00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:10,660
is a understood and established it means

00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,640
product evangelist possibly paid and

00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:13,600
possibly within another position waiting

00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,850
for

00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,919
they're highly coveted because their

00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:19,809
on-campus jobs that are very fluffy and

00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:22,390
they're easy for students to get extra

00:28:19,809 --> 00:28:23,799
money and extra perks and that is part

00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:25,809
is that we use the word ambassador

00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:28,000
that's what that means on many campuses

00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:30,940
in the US I'm not sure about other

00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,160
places but it is it's officially Shmi

00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:38,110
say exactly that they may be talking

00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:40,780
about changes provocations grab

00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:42,880
something that can be eventually nor

00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:46,890
something I think something that's

00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:49,270
something that implies more what it is

00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:51,190
when ambassador program we should

00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:53,890
remember when it started it was one of

00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:55,600
the people who are already be the same

00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:58,000
work what we expect from under center

00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,850
and we distracted like oh you can teach

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,710
colours and power numbers and you know

00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:05,770
which would represent its loading up our

00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:09,070
way how much ever since then has very

00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:18,759
much the same way when okay whereas

00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:20,169
first students at a university yep so

00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:22,840
most of the students we should come down

00:29:20,169 --> 00:29:24,549
and we still get because of the 50 pages

00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:27,730
like oh I want to become a cactus

00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:29,259
understand that is in India I know that

00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:31,600
comes up only because they want variety

00:29:29,259 --> 00:29:33,549
tell me they have is you and the persons

00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,700
that this end there you do come along

00:29:33,549 --> 00:29:38,889
with evil and already the days that they

00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:41,769
are like this ever said earlier packet

00:29:38,889 --> 00:29:43,629
or est Simza turn this distinct on so

00:29:41,769 --> 00:29:48,100
and I want to want to become by the way

00:29:43,629 --> 00:29:52,240
for federal sector so I mean we found it

00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:55,090
is it's a big containers community and

00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,070
that's why we pulled apart and thanks to

00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:58,539
the MS word that and then they also

00:29:57,070 --> 00:30:01,899
understood that we need people of the

00:29:58,539 --> 00:30:04,450
bar at mystery regions where we have any

00:30:01,899 --> 00:30:07,149
variance in federal and it's very easy

00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:08,980
become an MS in it but it's not that

00:30:07,149 --> 00:30:10,620
easy in India so when we give them a

00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:13,929
before that I always played six months

00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:15,340
become part of the community people then

00:30:13,929 --> 00:30:17,160
when you are a part of community will

00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:19,950
always

00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:23,320
anyway in 10 days does that creep

00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:25,090
doesn't matter so becoming part of that

00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:27,730
I was a terrific was are much more

00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:29,590
important so we don't we don't

00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:31,330
necessarily want students to think like

00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:32,470
you can't put a sign resume right that's

00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:35,020
the number one reason why i watch

00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:36,850
students get involved and we do have a

00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:39,160
lot of free software you would right so

00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:40,900
we are we do have a lot of the best

00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:44,580
parts of why you want to be a student

00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:49,470
bathroom whether the

00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:52,470
I think that the real issue a lot of it

00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:54,570
is that the unified messaging and there

00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:57,169
are different different people use

00:30:54,570 --> 00:31:00,059
software for different reasons and I

00:30:57,169 --> 00:31:02,789
even on the council initiative focusing

00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:04,890
on engineering universities is a is a

00:31:02,789 --> 00:31:07,350
narrow focus but we're a Linux is

00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:10,019
growing at a lot of debts but broadening

00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:11,360
now that bass alluded to is an important

00:31:10,019 --> 00:31:15,000
way to reach our universities because

00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:19,769
the a lot of the it's harder to do on

00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:22,889
campus but we've seen a lot of a lot of

00:31:19,769 --> 00:31:25,010
new ground to be made with disciplines

00:31:22,889 --> 00:31:25,010
like

00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:30,750
that aren't the hard CS MIT that when we

00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:33,120
get folks from those disciplines

00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:36,240
particularly game design is another good

00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,760
one and the places where students are

00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,950
most excited to do this

00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,450
Media Development happens on the web and

00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:43,400
happens in games which are highly

00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:46,130
written in a closed source issue right

00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:48,290
so there's a lot of culture that is not

00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:49,730
the best fit with where academia is

00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:51,740
going more students are applying to

00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:54,170
these technical programs and figuring

00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:55,790
out where we can tell that story so that

00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:57,950
you can say well if there's a place for

00:31:55,790 --> 00:32:01,040
gamers in fedora and there's a whisper

00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:03,980
designers and there's a place for other

00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:06,770
new media and new types of disciplines

00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:08,900
that are related to compute that is a

00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:11,750
message that as a district that we

00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:13,490
haven't spun up yet that is a new story

00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:15,350
than even the universities are still

00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:18,040
trying to figure out too because it's

00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,040
changed so fast

00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:28,440
we would chance

00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:32,590
if we target the church itself we can

00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:35,680
make a really good noise and in sba we

00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:39,760
did it in hungary actually we have an

00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:42,820
open source lab at second and we have

00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:46,900
planning to Professor banner merchant

00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:52,370
processor and we inspire them to create

00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:56,880
lists in suburban and there is

00:32:52,370 --> 00:33:02,270
still under polish mathematician

00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:02,270
people to spin that actually containing

00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:10,430
quite the humans love so that's actually

00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:16,360
a general question I wanted to ask

00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:19,700
because why stay why a spirit squirts

00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:21,980
battistini that says we're missing an

00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:26,450
opportunity we had a workstation is that

00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:28,870
that really is part of its goal is to be

00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:31,640
is to be a mechanism for getting

00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:36,110
actually worked out it's not just about

00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:38,270
to be a developer rotation but but all

00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:40,160
about making sure that whatever it is

00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:42,680
you'd want to do as long as I get some

00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:46,580
actual something an actual substance

00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:49,040
done four stations where you do it we're

00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:52,370
defaulting to well for education needed

00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:55,640
to be agreements or reset then something

00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:57,610
is missing would be really important to

00:33:55,640 --> 00:34:00,520
talk about what it is

00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:03,580
first is jumping to a risk is probably a

00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:06,160
very heavy weight effort for what might

00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:10,149
just be a witch one with some things

00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:12,159
might be solvable works just a clear

00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:17,290
point so yeah actually maintaining this

00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:18,609
thing is really difficult like creating

00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:22,379
the screen and make sure everything is

00:34:18,609 --> 00:34:25,810
updated when you associate Alyssa so

00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:27,490
it's much easier if we can make a right

00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:29,950
now we have oxygen because we had their

00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:31,629
a row you be the solution you have the

00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:35,230
standard installation and maybe work on

00:34:31,629 --> 00:34:39,609
top of it like there was a talking this

00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:42,100
years at University before not be shy

00:34:39,609 --> 00:34:45,550
about it so that's actually a very poor

00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:47,770
village school where we bought five four

00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:49,990
computers related and computer on fedora

00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:52,840
the only thing the change was actually

00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:54,560
installed the local language and so was

00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:57,420
running

00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:59,130
that's cool double our school students

00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:01,350
and he takes everything got to be

00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:03,870
changed they got apple megawatt for only

00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:05,730
one single project it was huge success

00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:08,430
because before that nobody in India at

00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:11,700
the school level use linux like that and

00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:14,760
adjust it at a point for any thank you

00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:17,070
should go to any injury colleges so 19

00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:21,660
I'm almost nine passengers will find a

00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:23,640
favor or any mechanisms so it's can we

00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:25,410
maybe want to look into that sorry also

00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,450
because we know that we can really call

00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:30,000
this our uniqueness that will be either

00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:32,100
rail or Federer and this case is mostly

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,740
federal it's like maybe should we go and

00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:36,810
talk to you so that might be a entry

00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:38,370
point you could be but our own is not

00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:41,130
just an entry point we should probably

00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:43,740
be talking about forex trading

00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:48,480
strategies use cases

00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:53,810
materials for things actually I think

00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:57,390
the labs for would be the best way to

00:35:53,810 --> 00:36:02,760
say that this

00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:02,760
sweet hours us that we can

00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:20,450
if it's easy to make sense of packages

00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:26,230
tools that provide some tables in or

00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:29,210
near psychosis AR Arkansas stir yeah I

00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:34,580
think that you are a custom the group

00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:37,190
set so I need if I need assets from the

00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:41,570
tools from this group or this group I

00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:46,420
why not cannot make by deena crew that

00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:53,870
actually can hold my stuff so from this

00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:56,180
Christopher Walken I left out the

00:36:53,870 --> 00:37:00,410
workstation to me that we hit that

00:36:56,180 --> 00:37:01,750
veterans Bureau software things as

00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:04,650
handlers

00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:07,120
to say okay mathematics category

00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:10,750
patients mathematics click its installed

00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:12,310
oh wait we already have so again I ask

00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:14,770
why are we talking about we fixin to

00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:17,140
overpay if there are individual things

00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:19,480
that are causing us to have an author is

00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:20,740
why we fix those things and make sure

00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:24,400
that our all of our marketing materials

00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:27,670
show how easy it is to install the

00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:29,980
mathematics lab or or the certain design

00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:32,530
that to directly from your home so

00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:36,010
that's perfectly fine I mean I don't

00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:38,560
quite look like they're two options for

00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:40,630
that I mean either we did a remix or at

00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,340
least we provide some instructions for

00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:44,710
people to customize their environments

00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:45,910
so yeah and yeah that definitely work

00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:48,790
out it means also we don't have to

00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:51,310
maintain separate spheres if we have one

00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:53,020
place where the skins were in one case

00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:56,350
the places where you don't have good

00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:58,840
parent that's only they split but does

00:37:56,350 --> 00:38:01,150
it one place but Jesus when we actually

00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:03,940
fix it up the mostest we have been

00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:07,150
someone so that was only this well

00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:08,580
sneeze actually but all of this is they

00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:11,160
understand

00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:18,450
the fact is you need what what he's

00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:20,400
already committed but there many just

00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:22,800
meeting right after documentation of

00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,140
what this is i don't own anything so

00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,430
good other than that everything else we

00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:29,960
can just blew the circuit breaker

00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:35,430
washington I'm not see green campus

00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:37,620
about sorry oh so on I know that one of

00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:40,740
the other council objectives is modular

00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:43,050
zation rings and/or next type stuff so

00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:48,150
does this fit into like the EMPs and

00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:51,090
stacks paradigm or is this is that nice

00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:54,109
quote figure in the actual packaging

00:38:51,090 --> 00:39:00,170
work to get things into

00:38:54,109 --> 00:39:04,130
a lot of us actually over there

00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:10,270
they're polish yeah I think it would be

00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:10,270
a bad idea to integrate all the thanks

00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:24,269
the extended ones and there is also

00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:30,859
so the JavaScript bar why not so having

00:39:24,269 --> 00:39:37,519
up that yeah very different topics like

00:39:30,859 --> 00:39:37,519
that LOL we're past us all the things

00:39:38,749 --> 00:39:44,940
they love so actually a high school lock

00:39:42,539 --> 00:39:47,460
so that's you comments of a chemical

00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:52,700
keyboard and so much we have a whole

00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:56,039
bunch of excess here you really are a

00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:57,400
general overall be ceramic travel one

00:39:56,039 --> 00:39:59,779
right eventually

00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:01,489
considered entire environment can just

00:39:59,779 --> 00:40:06,319
build something with their look at it

00:40:01,489 --> 00:40:08,809
come to it because SL that didn't into

00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:11,150
work and big girl bc also running a lot

00:40:08,809 --> 00:40:14,119
of trouble is a lot of groups have

00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:16,219
mandated programs come a lot of

00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:19,039
especially us-style schools or other

00:40:16,219 --> 00:40:21,469
schools to community programs videos

00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:24,349
online applications they're trying to

00:40:21,469 --> 00:40:26,719
access the dub organ playing fedora all

00:40:24,349 --> 00:40:28,759
the new job i require windows and recent

00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:30,949
things like adobe shockwave things like

00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:34,369
that shown and outright willing to go in

00:40:30,949 --> 00:40:36,529
at all you can't necessarily rough it

00:40:34,369 --> 00:40:39,140
running your own business at schools

00:40:36,529 --> 00:40:42,349
especially more enterprising networks

00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:44,280
about what we have centralized control

00:40:42,349 --> 00:40:47,770
over the network and you want to have

00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:50,530
on it and schools of later I actually

00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:54,430
the opposite experience OBC currently is

00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:56,860
all going to the 12 lbs this is you can

00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:58,330
tell publicly because that is what these

00:40:56,860 --> 00:41:01,660
school districts in don't know what they

00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:04,900
retired or upgrade cycle it did makes

00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:06,160
their software very hard to maintain so

00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:08,050
they're just there's how you're kind of

00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,020
a jump everything up I just want to be

00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:15,020
else

00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:17,120
that just briefly colleges united way

00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:19,280
out of college at this point Mike Spears

00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:21,710
yes ambassadors from like something's

00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,710
tend to be very old age I would think

00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:26,650
you would want missus Airways very

00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:28,510
open source reports going to work on

00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:31,720
that is both work with as opposed to

00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:39,130
trying to raise your own your ambassador

00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:41,020
separate from it Microsoft specific

00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:42,670
software that's the point of having the

00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:47,349
u.s. geologic sweet we can still use

00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:48,849
Windows not going to another saying nice

00:41:47,349 --> 00:41:51,880
what you want writing again not

00:41:48,849 --> 00:41:54,040
necessarily related to anything and USB

00:41:51,880 --> 00:42:00,040
be made food supply this is going it

00:41:54,040 --> 00:42:02,410
over the food is not elastic music by

00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:04,630
lack ops get or if you're doing that

00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:06,790
arrow you see maybe it right you can get

00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:09,250
out of network with it it's to be

00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:13,990
general here but it is like school

00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:17,320
operated you can only run this in there

00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:19,900
actually I left I will change and then

00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:23,170
you know Fred videos with the school

00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:24,640
photographers what we need is me to find

00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:28,829
that

00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:31,750
to use that to prove out that this is

00:42:28,829 --> 00:42:34,950
their students that the students that

00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:38,170
come out from a school this experience

00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:44,589
succeed combining compared to their

00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:46,690
peers and we make sure that hat and once

00:42:44,589 --> 00:42:49,390
we can watch me demonstrate that is the

00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:52,990
case then we said happy those releases

00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:57,069
energy so there are so microsoft centric

00:42:52,990 --> 00:43:00,010
that basically Rapunzel green fields

00:42:57,069 --> 00:43:01,269
which are our game french thing is a lot

00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:03,720
of dolls it was that we're trying to

00:43:01,269 --> 00:43:06,670
find that we're kind of squeeze that are

00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:08,559
amenable to that two alternatives not as

00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:12,059
a means the schools that are just

00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:14,950
outright hostile are not the records

00:43:12,059 --> 00:43:19,720
disposable near we can be convinced by

00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:22,900
other my other successes but it is for

00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:25,269
your bicycles of learners to alter a lot

00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:27,099
of schools and down they see first world

00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:29,589
myself never that's what they want

00:43:27,099 --> 00:43:32,380
because they don't they don't want you

00:43:29,589 --> 00:43:34,000
to read something like sugar piston ski

00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:36,009
into them they want an actor what

00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,930
everyone else asks well see and five

00:43:36,009 --> 00:43:39,570
years ago absolutely agree to that but

00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:42,940
you know

00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:45,220
very heavily towards a very strong

00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:47,140
linux-based cloud environments a lot of

00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:48,670
the Upton jobs out of college hammer

00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:51,100
thought if I go in that direction and

00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:53,380
then Microsoft started with their

00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:56,200
terrifying they keep rebounding it's

00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:57,790
your strategy I have no basis I think

00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:00,700
there's not anything that this is kind

00:43:57,790 --> 00:44:01,960
of an opportunity point where we haven't

00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:03,880
we have to be really a saying hey

00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:07,180
develop on the deployments they did up

00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:09,280
on your home turf again we haven't we

00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:10,870
haven't a moment in Indian history where

00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:15,130
we actually might need to strike that

00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:17,170
bats and get in while while that major

00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:20,920
paradigm shifts have I think you need to

00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:24,640
do now the important thing I think that

00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:27,160
like we hear you suit and fedora we're

00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:29,890
moving into a the additions right we're

00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:31,340
trying to differentiate different ways

00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:33,830
people can use

00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:37,400
reasons and then having release cycles

00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:38,600
that reflect that that is sort of the

00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:41,120
way that we need to think about schools

00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:44,180
too because though the lot of schools in

00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:46,550
the US are similar all of them have very

00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:50,140
different political realities and some

00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:53,859
schools are very much older too

00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:55,510
and some of them just will not have I've

00:44:53,859 --> 00:44:59,290
even seen schools that are amenable to

00:44:55,510 --> 00:45:02,590
it have one c-level executive change

00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:06,370
the entire policy changes my students

00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:07,460
used to have and that's not a lot in

00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:09,920
total that's a universe

00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:12,480
over policy I haven't told the students

00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:15,690
are allowed to run their own web servers

00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:18,840
more on campus network which was not the

00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:20,130
case even three years ago so things can

00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:22,650
change it effects and they are very

00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:25,230
different in school so even if we come

00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:27,210
up with unified tool sets and your

00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:29,730
thought strategies those are going to

00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:33,019
work different

00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:37,099
and you will always need local person on

00:45:33,019 --> 00:45:40,369
at least one faculty member open tenure

00:45:37,099 --> 00:45:43,149
who has the ability to be able to

00:45:40,369 --> 00:45:46,309
withstand the political pressure and

00:45:43,149 --> 00:45:47,959
there are different ways externally that

00:45:46,309 --> 00:45:50,509
you can go in turn i mean i could do a

00:45:47,959 --> 00:45:54,880
whole adventures and happy give me a

00:45:50,509 --> 00:45:58,209
session low doing outreach on campuses

00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:01,249
that is not no time for that way i

00:45:58,209 --> 00:46:02,839
really need all of your help this is one

00:46:01,249 --> 00:46:05,599
of most well-attended sessions that I've

00:46:02,839 --> 00:46:07,279
seen and if I'm supposed to be meeting

00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:09,469
the council on this education

00:46:07,279 --> 00:46:11,089
objectively all the ideas that we're

00:46:09,469 --> 00:46:13,009
talking on in here are really important

00:46:11,089 --> 00:46:14,630
all your experiences that you've had are

00:46:13,009 --> 00:46:16,999
really important particularly with sugar

00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:18,799
lab we'll see I think of that strategy

00:46:16,999 --> 00:46:21,489
excuse that represents three million

00:46:18,799 --> 00:46:22,900
Fedora users across the world roughly

00:46:21,489 --> 00:46:25,420
depending on

00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:27,039
math these are really important things

00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:29,559
than the stuff they were doing here that

00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:32,920
we need to find a common place to meet

00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:35,770
on this I don't know if adoro as in educ

00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:38,049
or the council has a meeting where

00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:40,210
people do student ambassadors campus

00:46:38,049 --> 00:46:42,430
representative whatever we're going to

00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:44,799
call it things look establishing some

00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:47,529
kind of regular edu powwow it is

00:46:44,799 --> 00:46:48,849
probably a good idea because 12 to 18

00:46:47,529 --> 00:46:51,640
months isn't going to be enough time to

00:46:48,849 --> 00:46:53,270
transform all of the universities maybe

00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:55,340
we can have one or two

00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:57,560
they're this year but if we want this to

00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:59,570
be an ongoing initiative and foolish it

00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:00,380
looks like a lot of you do then we're

00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:04,279
going to need all

00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:06,910
so please check into the castle wiki and

00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:06,910
century

00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:11,930
yes

00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:21,250
normal program

00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:28,710
that's all soon after billion so very

00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:31,560
high barrier entry and I'm not really

00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:35,010
much of a programmer ongoing business

00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:38,940
administration but I didn't have like

00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:41,310
the integral knowledge computer but I

00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:44,220
was really began the whole bottle door

00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:47,610
community the free open-source software

00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:48,990
house how pulled me in and I really want

00:47:47,610 --> 00:47:53,930
to get involved in some kind of

00:47:48,990 --> 00:48:00,410
kind of stuff and I want to be something

00:47:53,930 --> 00:48:00,410
how about I don't know

00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:08,760
yeah sure what was the point what you

00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:16,350
got stuck I mean what makes you confused

00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:17,850
I mean I was Everett everything

00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:27,630
prohibition African tradition is

00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:30,320
meaningful I mean and I mean I talk

00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:30,320
about all

00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:38,820
I explain it try to get an accurate

00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:42,240
understanding that ian is in software

00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:43,860
and I mean I'm not much of a developer

00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:47,760
going building that community side of

00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:51,160
stuff and I always wanted to involve the

00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:53,450
program I see the best way from

00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:55,369
visual standpoint

00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:59,720
or how to have some kind of guidance

00:48:55,369 --> 00:49:03,740
ability making an impact when I began to

00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:06,170
see the master academy I'm 98 before the

00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:07,279
poland master that I am sorry i was

00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:12,519
looking for

00:49:07,279 --> 00:49:12,519
yep good good point

00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:24,790
I mean the student a master's program

00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:27,280
would would would would work for you

00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:30,280
that way so basically you just need an

00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:32,109
entry point to keep progressing inside

00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:35,500
the community and to explore new

00:49:32,109 --> 00:49:38,230
opportunities so yet from what you're

00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:43,890
saying I mean it would work this kind of

00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:47,440
structure it would work out for you so

00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:49,599
do you if we as in the girl or we have

00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:52,420
here in u.s. do you have any kind of

00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:55,030
work towards the concealer novel

00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:59,200
technology for the school boards or eat

00:49:55,030 --> 00:50:00,180
or the 06 before open source Wendy no I

00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,430
don't think

00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:04,290
strategy for school board elections that

00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:06,450
would be a really interesting way of

00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:08,700
going about it school board election

00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:12,390
year important elections I'm talking

00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:15,569
about the why is that because in here

00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:17,460
the largest school board is for CBS c so

00:50:15,569 --> 00:50:19,260
i know that there are many people from

00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:21,809
Granada was also very much been bought

00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:24,300
with the event the people who take the

00:50:21,809 --> 00:50:26,970
seasons in evergreen and so in another

00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:29,430
90 or in event they decided and number

00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:31,050
13 that one city was populated so

00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:33,300
instead of having only Michael some

00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:36,780
specific tools now in India we have the

00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:40,589
syllabus is neutral it says either can

00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:43,770
you bewitched crushed Oreo Oreo ECC and

00:50:40,589 --> 00:50:47,339
use my superior you learn database are

00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:51,500
instead of un c c++ programming language

00:50:47,339 --> 00:50:57,619
and operation is also a choice such a

00:50:51,500 --> 00:51:00,619
baby as I say it's in the US almost all

00:50:57,619 --> 00:51:00,619
schools

00:51:01,789 --> 00:51:06,200
sure

00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:10,780
there are certain that's a national make

00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:10,780
involved here and you know actually ever

00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:26,670
every teacher I've ever met all those

00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:31,290
national laws that movie so far so much

00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:31,290
entirely defects in them so

00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:38,070
at least in the u.s. tempo che I will

00:51:35,910 --> 00:51:40,100
modify my creamy cleanser to say not

00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:42,510
that item oh I'm still pretty good here

00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:44,790
there is a new organization called

00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:46,980
co.org you know who is working really

00:51:44,790 --> 00:51:49,680
hard in the u.s. to get siesta counties

00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:52,800
of mathematics requirement so there are

00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:55,700
there is a national organization that is

00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:59,310
getting some traction that I know that

00:51:55,700 --> 00:52:02,670
companies like Red Hat also support so

00:51:59,310 --> 00:52:04,890
though we're not necessarily taking it

00:52:02,670 --> 00:52:06,330
were the global public policy team as

00:52:04,890 --> 00:52:08,430
far as I can tell is always paying

00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:12,090
attention to all the subject they can

00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:15,690
find but the real it isn't necessarily

00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:17,790
as much policy on curriculum side red

00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:21,570
have just established education outreach

00:52:17,790 --> 00:52:24,480
team with it SS so spot and Jenna and

00:52:21,570 --> 00:52:26,670
Nikki eights are amenable esteem

00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:28,609
they are compiling lists of fedora

00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:31,430
friendly and foster and the university's

00:52:28,609 --> 00:52:34,700
car gets there to be trained

00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:37,220
professors posse so there's a lot of

00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:38,809
curriculum development and module

00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:42,319
development that is coming out of this

00:52:38,809 --> 00:52:46,190
new Red Hat education outreach team and

00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:48,550
they are very accessible so I would say

00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:52,670
they would probably know best for sure

00:52:48,550 --> 00:52:56,000
spot and Jenna Lyons and those are the

00:52:52,670 --> 00:53:00,770
three folks at that that's a pretty good

00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:04,300
shot good circle of ours are under

00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:04,300
staying out here about how now

00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:12,030
other ways

00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:12,030
runner figure out how to involve

00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:20,030
just

00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:20,030
and it hasn't

00:53:24,839 --> 00:53:31,619
like other expands with a different kind

00:53:28,599 --> 00:53:31,619
of made to get before

00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:38,700
we are like way over time so if you got

00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:40,950
a closing message well we should

00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:45,300
definitely look into that that's all I

00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:47,220
want to say so I mean we should stay

00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:49,320
connected because I guess most of you

00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:52,740
are definitely interested in that topic

00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:56,340
on how we can improve our visibility in

00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:58,380
schools so with the guinea breast

00:53:56,340 --> 00:54:00,780
involvement initiative I think we can

00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:02,400
definitely join and plan something

00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:06,240
together plan something better and

00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:08,400
bigger so we just need someone to step

00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:11,040
in and say hey let's do that so we need

00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:24,180
leaders for that need people are going

00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:31,070
to step in I leave that's a very

00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:31,070
inherent part that if you're able to 0

00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:39,320
which takes me so I ha yeah

00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:47,920
yeah it's easier to do that in secondary

00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:51,549
school I mean for from secondary

00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:55,839
dominant on board so yeah that Alistair

00:54:51,549 --> 00:54:59,740
by my well I always known about winning

00:54:55,839 --> 00:55:01,509
stuff right but it was only like all

00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:03,069
secondary that moving the doors and then

00:55:01,509 --> 00:55:08,880
later first

00:55:03,069 --> 00:55:08,880
in high school there linux with this

00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:15,069
kind of coveted thing that you want to

00:55:12,459 --> 00:55:20,499
get into with a little bit hard that was

00:55:15,069 --> 00:55:27,430
Oh properly kingdom okay guys that's all

00:55:20,499 --> 00:55:29,349
thanks very much nothing here I look

00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:31,059
forward into shaving more discussions

00:55:29,349 --> 00:55:37,869
and to plan more stuff thank you very

00:55:31,059 --> 00:55:45,150
much yeah yeah yeah definitely

00:55:37,869 --> 00:55:45,150
