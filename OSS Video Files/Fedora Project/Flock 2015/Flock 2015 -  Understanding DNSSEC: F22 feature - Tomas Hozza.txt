Publication date: 2015-08-26
Playlist: Flock 2015
Description: 
	Domain Name System SeCurity Extensions(DNSSEC) is a set of standards defined to extend the Domain Name System(DNS) protocol, to securely exchange information between DNS clients & servers. This session aims to introduce the audience to the nitty-gritty of the domain name system(DNS), its pitfalls, its security, its utility and importance to the users. And how Fedora contributors could help to develop this feature. This session is suitable for all kinds of audiences.

all right let's start hello everyone my

00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:11,219
name is tomorrow's ax I've been a

00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:14,309
contributor for over then for more than

00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:18,000
three years and I've been mostly working

00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:22,109
on DNS related stuff and networking days

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,220
so today I'd like to explain you dns

00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:30,119
like a pro high level and the changes we

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:35,130
are trying to make in fedora so let's

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:37,829
start giving this presentation I'll

00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:40,530
cover y quien SE important is important

00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:43,829
and why we should care what is the

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:46,739
change in fedora all about how it works

00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:49,800
and what are the disintegration in

00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:52,469
fedora products volt detection server

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:58,050
cloud and not everything is finished yet

00:00:52,469 --> 00:01:02,579
but what are our plans so why is the

00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:05,549
intersect important hopefully all of you

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:08,189
know what dns is it's a distributed

00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:11,729
database that is able to store various

00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:13,530
type of types of data most usually IP

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:16,080
addresses please use for translating

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,570
name domain names to IP addresses but

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,780
that's not the only thing you can store

00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:25,380
in DNS you can store also different

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:28,439
types of data for example so it's a

00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:31,799
golden trusted data data you can use for

00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:34,170
verification of for example certificates

00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:37,020
or remove those fingerprints and stuff

00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:41,970
like that so for example pls a resource

00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:46,799
record can use for a very fine remote

00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:50,180
host yes certificate SS a fingerprint

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:53,060
you can use for verifying remote host

00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:55,920
SSH fingerprint so we don't have to be a

00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,670
task to answer if the fingerprint

00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,409
presenting body

00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:01,409
remote host is really the one it should

00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:05,130
be so it can be verified by the ssh

00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:09,539
client automatically ipsec keys for

00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:11,730
example I know always trying to do some

00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:15,420
advertising VPN tunnels and stuff like

00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:18,750
that so in ideal world if you are trying

00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:22,230
to connect to some remote server first

00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:26,310
you look up i piss a case of the of that

00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:29,130
server create a tunnel that server would

00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:35,870
look up your IP SEC keys and you can

00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:39,450
start communicate a liquor / palace oh

00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:42,690
then there is a certain result record

00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:45,750
you can use for example for story of PGP

00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:47,700
hub certificates and there's the

00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,730
certification Authority authorization

00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:53,069
research record you can use for like a

00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:58,080
research in which our certification

00:02:53,069 --> 00:03:02,010
authorities are can issue certificates

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,420
for your domain so this opens up

00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,790
possibilities for new kinds of

00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:11,690
applications well I guess ethnic or poor

00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:14,040
tasting VPNs repent and also then ssh

00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:18,930
clients can automatically verify the

00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:21,209
remote host fingerprint and so on but

00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:24,390
with plain dns doesn't make sense to

00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:28,109
those data from from dns database

00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:30,959
because the plan dns there is no that

00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:34,590
data integrity mechanism and no the data

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,810
authenticity mechanism so when dns is

00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:38,700
vulnerable and suffers from various

00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:41,400
types of attacks when the middle attacks

00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:45,780
cache poisoning annex spoofing that

00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:51,660
makes em so on and also in usual

00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:52,660
situation dns works over UDP so these

00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:56,590
are only easy

00:03:52,660 --> 00:04:01,260
you spooked or clients IP address or or

00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:05,020
servers integers so this is why I mtns

00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:07,180
DNS SEC was introduced it stands for DNS

00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:11,140
security extensions it's just an

00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:13,150
extension of DNS protocol so all the

00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:15,460
amendment implementations that don't

00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:18,670
have dns a key moment it should just

00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:22,330
ignore all those extra data in responses

00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:25,770
and all those texts extra flex DNS SEC

00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:30,490
provides data authenticity and integrity

00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:34,260
in DNS row and it uses a symmetric

00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:36,820
cryptography basically how all the data

00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:40,300
whether you are using tienes like our

00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:44,200
site using a symmetric cryptography and

00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:47,530
keys and then you can verify the server

00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:50,050
responses using by building a chain of

00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:53,260
trust from the root zone and by using

00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:56,410
the well-known root key used by the root

00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:59,080
servers so you can build a chain of

00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:01,750
trust from root zone to the hostname you

00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,730
are trying to resolve and verify that

00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,740
the response is really the one it should

00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:09,550
be and that's no one messed with the

00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:13,330
response or you can find out that there

00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:15,669
is no such a domain name and you can be

00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:20,590
sure that this is the response from the

00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:24,340
alternative server so now we know why is

00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:27,370
this important to have the DNS SEC so

00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:30,280
what's a change all about we are trying

00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:32,910
to focus on the client side oh and by

00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:35,650
that i mean the applications go inside

00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:38,560
everything works pretty nicely on the

00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:42,700
server side but when it comes to to for

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:46,810
example mobile mobile machines and

00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:51,610
client there is really not that much

00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:55,330
support building into applications so we

00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:59,080
are trying to basically a integrate

00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:01,030
multiple components on the system so

00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,250
they can be installed by default

00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:08,500
in fedora and provide some some extra

00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:11,350
security this components must respond to

00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:16,780
different network configuration changes

00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:19,000
and do some other side oh so we are

00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:22,090
trying to have a lock of our categories

00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,790
over on the system installed by default

00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:28,900
and running by default this will allow

00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:31,690
us to provide some extra security from

00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:35,380
DNS point of view to the application

00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:38,290
then then that don't even care for

00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:41,590
example your web browser it doesn't have

00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:45,330
to match any like drastic data from from

00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:50,340
DNS that even though it can be sure that

00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:52,630
your internet banking domain name was

00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:56,440
translated to the right IP address and

00:06:52,630 --> 00:07:00,850
it was very fun Oh applications that do

00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:04,500
care like SSH client or if the browser

00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:08,290
wants to do the TLS certificate

00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:11,290
verification using the TLS a record they

00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:15,280
should use preferably some validating

00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:19,300
DNS API for example get dns or click on

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:21,090
bound or something else because you can

00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:25,060
you could rely on the local running

00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:27,460
while getting the resolver but you can

00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:29,290
never be sure or can make sure that

00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:32,650
there is such a resolver running and

00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:35,760
that it was configured properly and all

00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:40,000
the libraries you are using for example

00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:43,660
gypsies kind of broken ended in from the

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
nest point of view so if you do care

00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:52,120
about security preferably you should use

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:56,310
some some better api for dns so how it

00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:59,730
works in fedora in fedora we are using

00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:02,139
three main components net for measure

00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:05,379
since its use by default

00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:07,210
as a network configuration manager we

00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:09,759
use it as for notifications about

00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:11,949
network configuration changes and for

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,499
all the data about current network

00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:16,840
configuration then there is a unbalanced

00:08:14,499 --> 00:08:19,960
server which is validating DNS resolver

00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:22,539
its use for basically for the name

00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:26,590
resolution and it does the combination

00:08:22,539 --> 00:08:29,529
unbound is kind of special because it

00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:32,099
was developed with DNS SEC in mind from

00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:36,159
the beginning and its purpose is to be

00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:39,510
like not a swiss knife as a DNS mask but

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:41,529
rather just resolver solving its purpose

00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:44,560
then there is of the essence reader

00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:46,600
danczuk trigger is kind of integration

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:51,519
component between unbound and never

00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:54,459
measure it does it dynamically

00:08:51,519 --> 00:09:01,630
reconfigures unbound based on the

00:08:54,459 --> 00:09:04,410
current network configuration so you can

00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:07,630
imagine like leather measure on the top

00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:10,029
reach out on every network configuration

00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:13,209
change notifies DNS SEC trader that

00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:16,120
there is some change dns a trigger uses

00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:18,040
standard network commercial providing

00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:21,220
cell library to fetch all the time

00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:24,279
network configuration from it and tries

00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:27,579
to figure out if it should reconfigure

00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:29,709
involved in any way it's generous for

00:09:27,579 --> 00:09:32,440
example default configuration before

00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:34,560
default connections what are the dns

00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:37,779
service provided by the people

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,730
connection if there are any VPNs what

00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:43,480
are the domain story two victims VPNs

00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:46,750
name servers and so on dns it trigger

00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:50,470
them when it gets all the delta does

00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:53,829
some performs various tests for example

00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:55,390
to be four unbound to be able to do the

00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:56,550
validation needs to be configured

00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:59,940
properly with

00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:03,029
or set of DNS servers those DNS servers

00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:05,670
have to be able to provide all the data

00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:09,720
necessary for validation so this would

00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:13,529
be NS sec trigger tests for those

00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:16,200
network provided DNS servers are capable

00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:19,680
providing all the data than necessary if

00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:23,040
this is not the case it can try if it's

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:25,320
possible to arrange alternative servers

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:29,870
on the Internet it does not possible it

00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:33,000
can try if it's if it can contact our

00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:34,560
federal infrastructure because in

00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,550
further impede our infrastructure we

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:45,060
have dns resolvers running on a tcp port

00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:48,600
80 and also on port 443 and they are

00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:50,370
using ssl so it tries to tunnel all the

00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,880
dns communication to the federal

00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:56,690
construction it does not possible it

00:10:53,880 --> 00:11:01,320
should basically inform the user that

00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:04,050
something surreal broken then when all

00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,720
those tests are performed Undong is

00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:11,660
reconfigured zone it reflects the

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:15,089
current network configuration so

00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:18,839
currently support just flick dns view

00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:20,970
VPNs so if you connect to your VPN VPN

00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:25,680
provides you different set of name

00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:28,680
servers and some domains and VPN is not

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,480
configured to be used for all resources

00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,450
but just for the resources from the

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:37,020
video network it configures special

00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:39,980
forward zones in unbound so that began

00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:44,010
providing observers are used only for vm

00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:50,240
from the domain from IBM then we are

00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:53,610
configuring come forward zones also 44 I

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:59,059
probably I've been networking geez so we

00:11:53,610 --> 00:12:03,769
are able to do the reverse reason

00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:05,689
no IP addresses then we have a couple of

00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:09,759
public mechanisms like I said for

00:12:05,689 --> 00:12:12,379
regarding and then DNS over TCP or SSL

00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:14,719
basically you are you can set up your

00:12:12,379 --> 00:12:17,329
own pro structure if you don't trust the

00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:19,279
right cross structure that by default

00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:21,519
there is we are using better

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:24,919
infrastructure for that there is also

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:30,219
upstream infrastructure with ups from

00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:33,889
the upstream of the NSA trigger okay so

00:12:30,219 --> 00:12:36,529
what's the integration fedora fedora we

00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:39,219
have different products for some time

00:12:36,529 --> 00:12:45,639
and those programs have different

00:12:39,219 --> 00:12:49,309
audience therefore after some pretty

00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:51,889
pretty long discussions of Pedroia list

00:12:49,309 --> 00:12:54,049
you figure out that we need to provide

00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:58,429
specific product specific configurations

00:12:54,049 --> 00:13:01,339
because long folks were not really happy

00:12:58,429 --> 00:13:05,089
about the changes in the user interface

00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:06,289
the NSA trader provided also if you

00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:08,179
figure out there are a couple of

00:13:06,289 --> 00:13:10,699
integration points we need to solve and

00:13:08,179 --> 00:13:12,919
that maybe some differently in different

00:13:10,699 --> 00:13:14,899
products for example depth portal

00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:17,329
detection get to point out handling

00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:21,859
logon handling and then the user

00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:26,419
interaction so what are the common

00:13:21,859 --> 00:13:31,099
things in the beginning there was a DNS

00:13:26,419 --> 00:13:33,949
SEC trigger panel that was not really

00:13:31,099 --> 00:13:37,159
user friendly but it worked and it was

00:13:33,949 --> 00:13:39,390
installed by default I do a work session

00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:42,060
product didn't like it so we

00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:46,380
split into separate suffocation so is

00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:49,050
not installed by people and we made some

00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:52,410
changes so that we don't need to deuce

00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:56,790
any extra user interaction but we left

00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:59,220
everything up to the production then

00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:02,820
that the portal detection is now turned

00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:06,800
off currently only in federal rotation

00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:12,450
but it will be most probably turned off

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:14,400
on every product and everybody will rely

00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:17,400
on network manager because never measure

00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:19,590
is doing basically exactly the thing

00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:22,980
maybe something more that the interior

00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:26,250
was doing when detecting the captive

00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:28,230
portal and for that we will need some

00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:30,180
notifications on connectivity state

00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:32,670
changes from metal measure that's not

00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:35,820
yet available but natural metric

00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:38,940
developers promise to provide this

00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:42,500
functionality so like Network measure

00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:44,880
this picture notifies you or network

00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,620
population changes if you want if I

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,600
possible connection state changes for

00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:54,330
example if the Internet is reachable or

00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:57,870
if there's a captive portal and so on so

00:14:54,330 --> 00:15:00,840
pretty a mortician we completely turned

00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:03,710
on the Catholic water detection login

00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:10,590
functionality it was no notion already

00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:12,300
or implements this and basically it

00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:15,900
didn't work real well because there are

00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:22,650
some race conditions we are doing no

00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:24,930
user interaction but we want to provide

00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:28,290
some way to easily configure some

00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:30,930
notifications if you really want to do

00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:34,050
know the mockers don't want to bother

00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:36,089
users with some fortifications that make

00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:38,220
use them or the user may not even

00:15:36,089 --> 00:15:42,480
understand because it mean for example

00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:45,570
when all the fallback options failed and

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:48,120
we are switching to some kind of

00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:50,370
insecure mode from the NSA point of view

00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:52,440
the user may not understand like what

00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:54,870
are the implications and may get scared

00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:58,890
something like that so therefore we also

00:15:54,870 --> 00:16:01,290
to know to get rid of the need to for

00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:06,899
user interaction when the old open

00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:09,329
options fail we got rid of the basically

00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:12,209
UI for that and we are doing the

00:16:09,329 --> 00:16:17,300
automatic switch to insecure mode or

00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:19,860
public options there this is basically

00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:21,600
the switch to in secure mode means that

00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:24,269
you're basically in the state that is

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:28,350
currently in fedora so we are not doing

00:16:24,269 --> 00:16:34,170
anything NSA partition so just the user

00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:36,499
where they all that is it so so is there

00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:40,039
is like if I'm climate user

00:16:36,499 --> 00:16:43,039
the rower station and i think i'm on i'm

00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:45,079
using DNS SEC and then you know I walked

00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:45,910
through a cafe or whatever something

00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:50,960
failed

00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:53,540
caramel yeah I just actually using

00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:55,730
actually us a question actually we has

00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:59,900
the change developers we think that

00:16:55,730 --> 00:17:01,640
users should be important but we don't

00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:05,780
developers have a different opinion

00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:07,610
about this but by introducing the

00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:09,589
possibility to automatically switched in

00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:14,510
subhuman because DNS extra car didn't

00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:17,780
have that before I i also added a option

00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:21,110
to run some comment on sweet secure mode

00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:23,030
so it is easily possible and it would

00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:26,990
will be like commented out in the

00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:29,300
configuration to send a notification

00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:32,510
window too long she'll so you can be

00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:34,600
notified like yeah now I switch to too

00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:37,190
insecure mode and the insecure mode

00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:41,660
automatic switch can be like disabled so

00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:44,620
it will not happen at all and the

00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,620
application to like

00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:59,770
if they care here so maybe we'll figure

00:17:55,930 --> 00:18:02,620
out some some good notification that is

00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:06,670
digestible for the user and also for

00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:10,060
developers but right now we agreed not

00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:11,530
to do any multiplication which is not

00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:13,900
really good from our point of view but

00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:17,350
you know everything silently trails and

00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:18,880
you you're losing the security yeah but

00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:24,550
doesn't seem like a priority for

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:27,760
rotation so for cloud so we basically

00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:30,490
just started the discussions we think

00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,460
that the transom resolver makes sense at

00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:37,450
least until post where you are running

00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:40,750
containers because containers running on

00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:43,690
that host can reuse the walking around

00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:47,080
increase over and get extra security

00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:51,190
even though they don't care a lot aware

00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:52,990
of it so for sure for sure it doesn't

00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:56,950
make sense to have a like local resolver

00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:59,640
although images themselves because you

00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:03,520
don't want each container to run

00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:07,590
separate resolve the problem is that

00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:11,500
docker currently is not able to use the

00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:14,530
local grand increase over it works in a

00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:17,860
way that if you're is if the host resort

00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:23,410
com contains some IP address different

00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:25,870
from localhost the doctor will copy the

00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:28,060
IP addresses to the containers result

00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:30,450
for but if there is local host address

00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:32,940
it will put the Google

00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:36,720
dns servers IP addresses with the

00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:39,720
containers result of which is basically

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:42,840
the easiest way to solve this and it

00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:45,840
works but it's not the most clever thing

00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:49,200
to do does it do all the clothes or like

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:53,190
if you were to change 1.7 001 01 27 00

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:56,100
yeah i think it's like 1 27 / r8 so

00:19:53,190 --> 00:20:00,830
anything from the sublet is basically

00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:04,890
not we proposed like some easy heck

00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:11,040
using IP temple rules to forward or

00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:12,420
older like DNS queries the local for

00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:18,390
from containers of the local irani

00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:20,370
resolver but the upstream wants to solve

00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:23,730
it in the more proper way by

00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:25,410
implementing some dns proxy and they are

00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:30,390
not really sure when this will be

00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:33,090
available or how this will work if the

00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:36,870
communication is kind of slow and we are

00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:41,970
not sure like how to solve it in fedora

00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:45,810
without the upstream really improving

00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:49,830
the pics for now so the coming coming

00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:51,480
discussion is still ongoing for the

00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:54,030
server there is the question of

00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:56,370
configuration in the server environment

00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:58,680
you don't have that many like our

00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:01,190
network configuration changes and most

00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:05,490
probably everything is statically

00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:11,160
configuring so the DNS exterior part may

00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:14,070
not make sense in server but if you use

00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:16,170
it you can't like the value of not

00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:18,450
having to manually configure anything

00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:21,210
because it will automatically configure

00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:25,080
unbound even though it will be just once

00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:27,930
when you boot up server and also there

00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:31,470
is the density reader control to the

00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:32,590
subject use the user interface in on the

00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:37,510
command line interface

00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:40,210
from a line on that's usable for for

00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:42,610
getting data like was the state how is

00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:45,659
what are the outcomes of the best

00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:48,640
performer but the IC trigger and

00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:53,200
basically for switching to two different

00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:57,330
wrote this tool is included by default

00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:59,830
on on any product but makes more sense

00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:05,409
in environments where the command line

00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:10,720
tool is like the most big most usual way

00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:15,429
of interacting with the system so for

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:17,529
other variants for example as I said

00:22:15,429 --> 00:22:21,340
long shall provide some user interaction

00:22:17,529 --> 00:22:23,860
and hotspot logging functionality for

00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:27,460
other variants some spins that don't

00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:29,919
provide this it necessary to install the

00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:32,710
DNS sector your panel sub package for

00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:35,590
the user interaction and as for the rest

00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:42,279
it should be all the same as for other

00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:44,830
products so to summarize the Instagram

00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:48,549
high side opens new possibilities like I

00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:52,059
said you can store some special data in

00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:54,520
TN s and write or enhance your client

00:22:52,059 --> 00:22:56,530
applications to use those data to for

00:22:54,520 --> 00:23:01,030
example validate

00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:07,410
host a certificate or some fingerprint

00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:10,870
or to build some VPN tunnel to the host

00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:14,170
the changes we are doing are mostly

00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:17,980
consisting of tightly integrated set of

00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:20,850
components level manager unbound and DNS

00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:25,420
a trigger we are providing different

00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:28,600
configuration for work station but we

00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:29,920
are open to like suggestions if there

00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:33,250
are other things that should be

00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:35,560
different we can provide different or

00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:40,240
configuration also for other products or

00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:42,730
variants yeah I also from I'm basically

00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:46,240
i forgot to mention that by using dns

00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:48,430
exim some dirty hex that were commonly

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,760
used with plain dns with a stop working

00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:53,500
for example if you used in the past if

00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,930
you use just never measure and you

00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:59,110
connected to VPN never matter put the

00:23:55,930 --> 00:24:02,770
VPN DNS servers and on the first place

00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:05,290
in erie softball so even though the EPM

00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:10,120
was configured to be used only for the

00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:11,890
resources from the VPN network those BTW

00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:16,600
and providing dns servers are used for

00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:19,390
all dns queries so this was privacy

00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:24,310
leaking basically but it worked so if

00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:29,560
you didn't list all your domains when

00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:31,480
you connect it to the VPN it worked on

00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:33,970
in that way but now it will stop working

00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:38,910
because if you don't list specifically

00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:43,120
of all domains from the VPN those are

00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:45,490
very not from the listed from domains

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:52,039
are not listed and will not be provided

00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:54,889
to the VPN also also some like

00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:59,389
if you connect to some Wi-Fi on on

00:24:54,889 --> 00:25:01,460
airport and they are using their like

00:24:59,389 --> 00:25:04,190
own top-level domain that doesn't exist

00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:08,899
it will usually it will not work because

00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:11,419
they are basically making up their own

00:25:08,899 --> 00:25:14,899
records that don't exist so you can get

00:25:11,419 --> 00:25:17,059
like cryptographic proof of

00:25:14,899 --> 00:25:19,669
non-existence of that top-level domain

00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:22,039
of their sting still claiming that there

00:25:19,669 --> 00:25:24,950
is such a domain so if you're using DNS

00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:31,570
SEC this is basically an attack so you

00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:34,759
will not trust their answer that yes

00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:38,960
that's a good thing but you know a lot

00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:43,099
of users are used to things working and

00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:46,070
by introducing new countermeasures for

00:25:43,099 --> 00:25:47,749
security you're breaking those things

00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:50,769
that was where basically

00:25:47,749 --> 00:25:53,830
misconfigurations or missing present

00:25:50,769 --> 00:25:55,729
misinterpretations oh yeah yes RFC sir

00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:57,440
but not for a hundred and eighty

00:25:55,729 --> 00:25:57,710
thousand dollars you too can have your

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,480
own

00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:06,409
right so what at the Bible so I would

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:10,970
like to ask you to test the neck trigger

00:26:06,409 --> 00:26:14,299
if you didn't yet in fedora and provide

00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:16,429
us some some use cases for which it

00:26:14,299 --> 00:26:20,390
doesn't work for you not all use cases

00:26:16,429 --> 00:26:22,490
your head may be valid so we will tell

00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:25,669
you that you should change your

00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:27,470
configurations so hopefully there will

00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:29,480
be some place where i can share those

00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:31,460
slides with you so we can go through

00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,919
some links on further away kit if you

00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:37,880
are interested in some design documents

00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:39,890
we put together after having to explain

00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:43,190
over and over and over and over again

00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:45,169
like what is the nsx all about and what

00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:50,809
is the change all about and why we think

00:26:45,169 --> 00:26:56,570
is important some of them so that's

00:26:50,809 --> 00:27:05,029
basically everything from my size so on

00:26:56,570 --> 00:27:07,909
your mother chose reason English I I

00:27:05,029 --> 00:27:10,250
think we doesn't make sense to be put in

00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:12,860
the meat Mitch yeah I everyone

00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:16,430
that's not because the way it's been

00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:19,420
presented on the helpless seems like you

00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:19,420
guys trying to put

00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:22,470
Wow

00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:30,399
actually I don't think there was any

00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:33,729
previous discussion butter on just this

00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:36,639
week ejp send some emails you there are

00:27:33,729 --> 00:27:40,570
claw of mailing list and to be honest I

00:27:36,639 --> 00:27:42,070
didn't go through the email but if he

00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:45,970
claimed that we should include it

00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:48,399
everywhere that's not true that's not

00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:50,859
true no years but I understood was that

00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:53,200
they're on all containers it would not

00:27:50,859 --> 00:27:57,179
include because then you run a fashion

00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,179
events and models about a thousand times

00:27:57,269 --> 00:28:02,200
yeah that's why I thought about the

00:28:00,549 --> 00:28:05,540
calling

00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:08,060
yeah that's the idea there is a person

00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:10,010
trigger trigger between you have to done

00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:14,450
start to trust a host or running them

00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:15,680
for dns localhost higher because because

00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:17,450
you're outsourcing the trust of your

00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,980
penis from within the container some

00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:23,650
theory you're vulnerable to the host

00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:25,430
government service for our container

00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:28,910
you're already on searching the

00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:33,290
foundation storage network so like they

00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:35,840
just do anything they want but to have

00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:38,630
it heading Doak Walker auditing resolver

00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:42,680
on the host I think it makes sense to

00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:44,450
have it there so we don't can you do

00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:47,660
gallan exactly can you define cloud

00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:50,330
image to yeah because I'm thinking of

00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:52,550
cloud-based image which is just like a

00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:53,900
disk image that you boo and then like

00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:55,700
you mentioned a thousand different

00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,870
versions of it running which makes me

00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:59,480
think you're talking about a docker

00:28:56,870 --> 00:29:07,580
image right so we what are we talking

00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:09,110
about ok ok but there would be a

00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:11,950
thousand different versions running if

00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:11,950
you include it in that

00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:32,610
provide isolation okay you control over

00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:33,930
th so with each VM instance you're

00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:35,940
talking about that would run not

00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:38,220
necessarily if containers were running

00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:43,010
on top of the video i think i've got a

00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:45,810
cloud image if you're already in like

00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:47,790
days we doesn't make sense to include

00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:50,280
the dress because over there if you want

00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:54,300
trusted is over there's a more efficient

00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:56,710
way to do that excellent to the image by

00:29:54,300 --> 00:30:03,779
dealing with Lightman network

00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:13,419
okay repellent stack is a providing

00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:19,380
service oh yeah make a lot of sense

00:30:13,419 --> 00:30:24,399
because then you've got yes inside

00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:27,220
already control wasteful of rejection

00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:29,080
yeah and ok thank you go you don't want

00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:36,909
to run a thousand on themes among people

00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:38,770
harder yeah but you mentioned atomic

00:30:36,909 --> 00:30:41,230
hose yeah you say it does make sense

00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:43,899
there or it doesn't well cuz like we

00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:46,090
currently do atomic host for bare metal

00:30:43,899 --> 00:30:50,020
and atomic host for cloud and right now

00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:52,870
they're kind of same bits almost so but

00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:55,270
like for it to be the host like it kind

00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:57,669
of if you're going to be spinning up

00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:59,260
containers you're probably not to be

00:30:57,669 --> 00:31:01,840
sitting like if you're just doing a

00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:03,820
European environment then you might be

00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:06,360
spinning up you know a thousand be

00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:09,009
honest if each line of your

00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:11,830
or some like that but if there's getting

00:31:09,009 --> 00:31:13,750
up containers on top of the PM you're

00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:17,380
probably each of your fianc is going to

00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:20,679
be a bigger p.m. like you know we're

00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:23,299
you're you're almost using the container

00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:27,230
host is becoming

00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:31,730
but I think I'm your infrastructure bond

00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:36,429
fewer really beefy ghosts even feel

00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:36,429
running Cloud ridden and so I feel like

00:31:38,019 --> 00:31:43,220
look at because for the number of

00:31:41,419 --> 00:31:45,950
tenants or serving like the point of

00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:51,470
containers you deserve way more tenants

00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:53,830
on and so I feel like why didn't you

00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:53,830
just you

00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:02,630
okay right in the tacos you're sure

00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:13,680
that's so it seems like it makes sense

00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:16,440
for academic hosts on Burma home Buffy

00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:18,030
doesn't never sense for he's saying

00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:19,680
saying it depends on where you divide

00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:20,850
the service right right because if

00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,650
you're doing it would just with

00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:24,000
traditional cloud image then you're

00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:25,800
probably going to spin up a ton of those

00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,470
cloud images to do their own thing yeah

00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:31,010
but if you do it on atomic host even if

00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:33,720
atomic host is hosted in the same cloud

00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:35,460
situation you're probably breaking up a

00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,350
bunch of different containers on top of

00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:41,550
that atomic host so you would only have

00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:44,070
one dns a resolver on the atomic owes

00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:45,720
for a lot of different services versus

00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:47,850
in the traditional cloud base where you

00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,920
probably have a bunch of different VM

00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:52,560
instances and each of them have their

00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:55,050
own resolver you might have time you

00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:57,260
know ten time host of honor containers

00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:57,260
each

00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:11,559
like it has some implications on its own

00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:13,750
to have to unload their you can save

00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:16,960
some by cashing it can save some time

00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:20,169
and bandwidth but it is still running

00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:24,090
there so it's consuming memory and CPU

00:33:20,169 --> 00:33:24,090
time so yeah

00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,250
and then one

00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:40,840
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:43,470
there's options yep because the process

00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,470
can do

00:33:50,050 --> 00:34:02,710
a subside being the like you to email

00:33:53,440 --> 00:34:04,810
was like okay yeah I mean not having it

00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:08,830
known anything really about me in a sec

00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:12,910
much before this is what we have now

00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:15,250
kind of an in-between step before larger

00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:18,190
infrastructure gets in place for dns

00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:20,670
Sakura and at what point in the future

00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:26,890
does the current implementation go away

00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:30,000
right so I forever forever yeah that's

00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:33,550
catching for the whole machine okay

00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:37,050
happens not firefox s cashing it is a

00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:40,360
network may work spotless I know I

00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:43,780
system assault Leonard talk recently

00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:45,340
about something similar to this where he

00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:46,929
didn't want each application to do its

00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:49,750
own caching the dns so there was some

00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:56,260
system the service do their diesel to be

00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:59,560
doing some tumbling of dns overdose yeah

00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:02,620
and yeah it is fun it's hard to sort

00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:05,230
everything out like and understand right

00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:08,380
the homogeneous produções it works on

00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:11,050
453 because yeah marching via load of us

00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:14,920
the marshalling via nesting to any other

00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:21,010
format seems to be it's a well of us to

00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:24,040
format just runnin off work and result d

00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:26,950
doesn't support indila sec yet and from

00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:30,160
the nurse balls and from what I

00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:32,650
discussed with them or ask them they're

00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:35,770
trying to do what they are planning some

00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:38,740
kind of esta for DNS SEC so we are

00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:41,220
trying to do all those fallback options

00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:44,970
like trying to do the for garden or

00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:47,820
the US over tcp but they their plan is

00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:50,580
not to do any those fall back so it

00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:55,560
never provided dns servers don't support

00:35:50,580 --> 00:36:00,930
DNS SEC they were just started open that

00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:05,270
works so so we have another movie with

00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:05,270
me Anita yes

00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:15,690
yeah actually it's a horse pretty nice

00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:18,839
and also with with a weird manager and

00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:42,680
I'm like running three instances of DNS

00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:42,680
mass for four then yeah

00:36:48,510 --> 00:37:04,030
exactly for example bite in legal

00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:10,320
configuration Federer it's also recycled

00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:14,100
also it would top it with innovation

00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,100
generally with Norman

00:37:29,420 --> 00:38:11,400
you know yeah right we don't want to

00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:13,980
have like more open resolvers on the

00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,270
internet and you know to help with video

00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:19,380
of service attacks and stuff i don't

00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:21,910
know he has asked fedora house and be

00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:23,890
like this is what's going on

00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:28,480
they'll just be uploaded to the top just

00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:30,190
be stuck there forever so so backless

00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,960
wpns so you're saying that that's going

00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:34,690
to work out of the box if you had

00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:37,089
another manager configured correctly for

00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:39,130
your BBM goes in all cases right now I'm

00:38:37,089 --> 00:38:40,450
just studying Venus mask myself manual

00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:42,099
and sitting back to your result

00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:44,920
comfortable Apollo stand in setting the

00:38:42,099 --> 00:38:47,440
domains for the remote and right if you

00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:50,109
delete the VPN provides all the domains

00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:52,780
like for example if I going to resume

00:38:50,109 --> 00:38:56,170
clearly provided a song and some set of

00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:57,970
DNS servers DNS mask automatically

00:38:56,170 --> 00:39:01,059
configures unbowed to forward like

00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:03,970
varies from the redheaded come to those

00:39:01,059 --> 00:39:08,760
that set of DNS servers and for

00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:08,760
everything else it uses different social

00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:23,170
also the depends on the type of it we

00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:25,400
are using because if the VPN

00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:27,350
implementation is not communicating

00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:29,210
media tour manager we are fetching

00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:32,120
holding information from metro measure

00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:35,810
so if that measure is not aware of your

00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:38,480
EPN then we will not configure it so he

00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:41,480
knows that the current is some VPN

00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:44,000
solutions to redirect like I don't worry

00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:45,980
I give Salam but also I think of the VPN

00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,650
don't forget the cisco VPN you will find

00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:52,490
that if it can remodel that was a result

00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:54,770
of cloud and then now are your things

00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:56,840
sorry I mean this is cookie and yes

00:39:54,770 --> 00:40:00,650
overseer the force you to have all the

00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:03,260
resolution through the VPNs it does bad

00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:06,020
pitch giving the proprietors forever

00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:09,830
yeah the continued running table to an

00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:12,050
image in a fit of them so economists are

00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:13,880
actually are you using a dog anysex

00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:17,270
software which works fine if you use

00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:18,740
another collector or forever local

00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:22,220
networks have been authorized

00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:24,110
the editing an apple you don't need

00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:26,360
those of those a whole are so you can

00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:28,460
find at least a client you can just go

00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,840
in a penis only if you don't use in a

00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:31,400
special feature but they have all their

00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:35,210
own special feature works out if you

00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:37,610
have the car run a lot of epi yeah but

00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:40,430
I'm seeing situation where the fear not

00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:42,940
a lot of Patrick there that are going to

00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:42,940
have to use

00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:58,560
fedora and a vibrant of the other VPN

00:40:54,150 --> 00:41:01,320
suffer I'm so it's on limitation

00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:05,040
parenting to the dns you can only act to

00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:07,800
get one domain currently dusty oh 440

00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:09,960
92nd because i can you support one space

00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:12,630
done today we're working on a graph

00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:15,570
together with apple actually extend this

00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:18,119
to be a little one that's the limitation

00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:20,340
of the VPN software yeah i mean in worst

00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:22,650
case where the Frenchman's agree with

00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:24,119
the customer and get their domain I'm

00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:25,710
lovely that's attached to it you know

00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:27,270
you can add whatever and but I actually

00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:29,280
want to do all of my resolution on a

00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:31,650
road man and only do the resolution

00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:35,369
force one demand on the VPN servers

00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:37,230
working 'banahna meeting say one of the

00:41:35,369 --> 00:41:41,630
local resort owners are underway and

00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:46,320
everything else goes to the TPM yeah so

00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:50,070
if you configure your DPM to be used for

00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:52,560
all for everything done for something

00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:55,590
good no I mean like in network matter

00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:58,140
you know when I configuring PP and I can

00:41:55,590 --> 00:42:01,440
like chicken pox to use the VPN only for

00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:04,230
resources from the network so if I don't

00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,240
check the box of net for measure will

00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:08,910
prefer that VPN over any other

00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:10,859
connection so you'll be the default

00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:13,800
connection from our promo video and we

00:42:10,859 --> 00:42:16,260
are not distinguishing like between the

00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:19,170
kids DPN or just wired network so that

00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:21,270
any level figure others of the local day

00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:24,290
right yeah you need to treat the local

00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:24,290
connection as it

00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:57,560
yeah that's problem so currently we are

00:42:54,119 --> 00:43:00,869
configuring power it's always boring any

00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:03,390
like domains provided by the required

00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:05,849
connection so so it would be configured

00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:07,680
but if there's like golden linking

00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:09,480
domains so the VPN provided the same

00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:12,599
domain of our connection is providing

00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:15,930
the VPN should be returned okay they

00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:17,700
don't need for power there someone tell

00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:21,720
you they create for other local

00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:25,140
resources actually we have some like own

00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:27,839
own solution for this situation where

00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:30,720
you connect to to bar network but the

00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:33,900
network provided dns servers are not

00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:36,450
able to provide all DNS SEC theta so you

00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:40,349
in the end you you would not use them

00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:44,609
but there may be like Adam a different

00:43:40,349 --> 00:43:46,690
the interview or some zone but so for

00:43:44,609 --> 00:43:51,819
the internal domains you

00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:54,520
use them anyway so we have like a module

00:43:51,819 --> 00:43:58,720
for unbound this can be configured with

00:43:54,520 --> 00:44:00,430
different set of nameservers so if the

00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:03,849
response from the internet most insecure

00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:05,950
basically meaning that the domain is not

00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:09,720
sighs because we don't want to downgrade

00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:14,050
the security the module would ask the

00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:16,000
different set like local DNS servers for

00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:18,910
court answer so what could you do for an

00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,800
extra monitor the local underground yeah

00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:23,170
you try to interact if like you get

00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:26,920
science answer you trust a side answer

00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:29,230
you get outside answer you will try also

00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:32,589
to ask also those like local servers

00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:35,319
because they cannot tell you or provide

00:44:32,589 --> 00:44:37,270
you any side concert for sure so if you

00:44:35,319 --> 00:44:40,720
would ask them like for every answer you

00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:44,109
would downgrade a security basically ok

00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:45,849
question can you in a community your own

00:44:44,109 --> 00:44:48,849
environment can you have a subdomain

00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:50,530
that it is basically not signed even

00:44:48,849 --> 00:44:52,920
though your route to the main sign and

00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:55,470
then in such a way to the client

00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:57,930
that it is not signed by within yourself

00:44:55,470 --> 00:45:00,090
so you can actually ask when Dennis X

00:44:57,930 --> 00:45:02,610
will not be there but yeah but you like

00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:08,610
me situated there is no proof that it

00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:09,960
doesn't exist so you think a lot of

00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:12,480
people that might want to live with

00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:15,120
yourself think about red Commodore a

00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,880
party whatever they may want to have an

00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:20,820
insider they may have it cork them

00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:23,340
whatever some domain well you know it's

00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:25,650
kind of in my wet and they don't want to

00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:28,860
sign that because write anything don't

00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:30,600
want to unlike publish the riddles about

00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:32,850
that specific subdomain I don't read

00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:34,620
request but I don't want to have any

00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:36,990
other recommenders of the way to

00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:41,850
actually write but you don't want to

00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:44,040
have like a delegation or anything for

00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:46,470
that settling well maybe I don't know

00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:50,130
how ya like it you can delegate that

00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:53,820
subdomain to write also to this thing

00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:56,370
like a set of servers but and not having

00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:58,740
the so called TS record i delegate

00:45:56,370 --> 00:46:00,990
designer and by not including the

00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:02,700
computer record for that delegating

00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:05,640
domain you're saying that the domain is

00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:07,680
not south basically but you say we know

00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:09,510
the domain actually exists you know but

00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,730
it exists but it's not something because

00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:13,680
you can also use and secretary brought

00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:17,640
out and everything of how is actually

00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:20,410
not covered so anything could exist

00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:26,920
so you can actually have your your

00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:29,320
hidden domain name that is hidden yeah

00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:33,010
like I want to be able to say oh this is

00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:35,500
and not signs after me again and this is

00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:37,570
a non-existent yes I take action Jackson

00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:39,370
say two of the main site so if you don't

00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:42,250
take any action for definition he writes

00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:45,610
on the side as long as a delegate yeah

00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:48,340
nothing yes because if if it's part of

00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:51,430
the same zone it has to be site or

00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:55,330
website and also because you cannot like

00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:57,370
a hip-hop signs of zone and then he will

00:46:55,330 --> 00:47:00,990
become my things like that because like

00:46:57,370 --> 00:47:03,550
how about i XYZ that think

00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:06,520
hotel zone doesn't is not technically

00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:08,920
possible because you are including also

00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:11,410
the proof of non-existence of some names

00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:15,970
so it would be then like this have

00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:18,250
explicitly yes and then you can make an

00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:20,770
you will get like prove non-existence of

00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:23,050
DS records or that sub domain and by

00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:24,760
that you mean no that is not some

00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:26,500
basically because there is no such

00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:29,130
record so you are not able to build

00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:29,130
chain of trust

00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:44,490
like to be honest we are the only ones

00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:45,810
based on the like a DNS secretary our

00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:49,500
mailing place we are the only ones

00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:51,450
contributing to today project but there

00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:53,220
is previously will not predict you'll

00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:56,100
install Santa but they've sort of

00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:58,490
ignored or problems I guess they don't

00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:58,490
have much

00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:27,710
yeah everybody installs

00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:34,580
and also in fedora and all the old

00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:37,760
communist technical but but then it

00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:40,550
happened yeah yeah but then can you have

00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:42,500
problems like ideally you want to use

00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:46,580
them and provide it nameservers

00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:51,020
impossible right so you're not right

00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:53,480
yeah yeah its 42 as far as for the like

00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:58,160
server-side like x server side I mean

00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:59,990
bind when they stop bind unbound just to

00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:04,580
do the resolution the NSX enable

00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:06,890
everywhere every time soon but if you

00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:09,320
want you to use it on a mobile laptop

00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:11,619
you have problems because you can

00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:14,450
connect you to network where all

00:49:11,619 --> 00:49:16,640
outgoing dns communication to the

00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:19,010
internet box and the New York route if

00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:22,609
you don't go pick you unbound correctly

00:49:19,010 --> 00:49:30,440
like to tell the communication or to use

00:49:22,609 --> 00:49:32,770
the local nature's right thank you for

00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,770
