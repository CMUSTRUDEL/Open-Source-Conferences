Title: Flock 2015 - Security threats at conferences - Till Maas
Publication date: 2015-08-26
Playlist: Flock 2015
Description: 
	In this talk I will raise awareness for security threats against developers and contributors during conferences and show mitigation techniques and best practices to avoid them. A lot of attacks that happen less likely if someone uses the Internet from a secure station at home become dangerous, if for example WiFi networks at conferences are used. But there are a lot of possibilities that allow to reduce the risk. Using the Fedora Project as an example I will show what can be done in the infrastructure and by the contributors to minimize the risk.
