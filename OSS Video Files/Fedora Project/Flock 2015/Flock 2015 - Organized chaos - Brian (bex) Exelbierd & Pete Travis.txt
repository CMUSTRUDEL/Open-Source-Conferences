Description: 
	There's a huge amount of potential in the Fedora repositories, but figuring out what's available and how to use it isn't always easy. Enter the Fedora Docs team, with a plan for reference materials large and small. You'll learn about the Docs workflow, and how it is changing to enable SIGs and special use cases to showcase the best they have to offer.

turn somebody off yeah they're like paws

00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:14,280
they were giant all right I'm Pete

00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:22,140
Travis the door documentation lead I've

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:25,260
been doing that for years forever they

00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:29,119
won't let me quit it's great team people

00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:32,189
to work with seven though and enjoy good

00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,840
so I'm Brian Exel beard I'm associated

00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:36,930
with the documentation project as well I

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,030
also happen to work for red hat and i

00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,739
put here that i'm an engineer nay writer

00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,079
because i was actually hired by red hat

00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:44,940
as a technical writer and have moved

00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,320
into a software engineering roles so i'm

00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,890
kind of coming at this from a lot of

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,469
different angles including a long time

00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,539
ago i'm old having used for Dora and

00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,690
production so there's a lot of

00:00:54,539 --> 00:01:00,980
opportunity here that we were

00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:03,610
yeah so we've had a lot of conversations

00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:06,380
especially over the last year in half

00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:08,630
about enabling people to contribute to

00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:11,440
dogs so we've talked to folks in the

00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:14,210
community and sort of thought about what

00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:17,750
you would want to be able to contribute

00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:21,710
and kind of taken the feedback from that

00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:24,380
and our own experiences and we put

00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:26,600
together this talk about problems that

00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:34,550
we know about and things we'd like to do

00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:37,340
about it so we'll talk about the new

00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:40,330
life cycle for documentation look like

00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:42,350
the ideal experience for you thank you

00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:44,840
it's sort of would it be like to

00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:47,869
contribute and get a new model up and

00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:50,060
running for everybody and would touch a

00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:55,159
little bit on tools that we're working

00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:56,659
on to enable that so one of the first

00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:59,990
things we want to talk about is the new

00:01:56,659 --> 00:02:01,879
contributor experience and this is the

00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:03,649
experience whether you or someone who

00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:05,300
literally just rolled up on fedora and

00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:06,800
you're like hey i was working through

00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,360
this and I want to help make these dogs

00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,940
better for the person who comes after me

00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:13,010
or if you've been an active project to

00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:15,349
contribute or elsewhere and you want to

00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:17,090
as the term go to shed some light on the

00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:18,860
things that you've been working

00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:21,200
in the quality of documentation around

00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:23,150
it and when you first approached the

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,129
documentation project and you're going

00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:28,700
hey I want to help we have a fantastic

00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:30,830
to-do list that you can use and this is

00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,959
not a bad slide this is actually the

00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:34,549
problem that we identified first is that

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,549
when you walk up to the fedora docs

00:02:34,549 --> 00:02:41,510
project there is no easy how do I get

00:02:37,549 --> 00:02:44,049
started there's just a blank list and so

00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:46,489
that kind of turns a few people off

00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:48,440
because there's no kind of engagement

00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:51,140
there from the beginning some people

00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:53,930
stick around though and they get on IRC

00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:57,560
channel and they start with okay so what

00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:59,239
do I do really and it opens up a series

00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,560
of questions if they want to ask and we

00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:02,450
want to explore these questions because

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,269
some of what we're doing is working

00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:07,310
really really well and some of what

00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:09,230
we're doing is that to do list that was

00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:11,000
on the previous slide so we need to

00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:14,319
figure this out together to help make

00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,319
this a better experience for everybody

00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:22,870
so people come in and say I want to

00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:26,269
write I want to be a fedora docs writer

00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:30,590
go right about where do I start with

00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:32,180
what work do you have going and it's

00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:35,209
kind of overwhelming because you can

00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:36,470
write about everything there's 20,000

00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:38,930
packages and there's

00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:40,250
hundreds and millions of interactions

00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:42,620
between those packages to either

00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:44,120
document people put touching they use on

00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:49,750
their own machines we could cover all of

00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:53,930
that and if I just say pick one if it's

00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:57,200
it's not a great show for you and what

00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:59,810
happens is that person loses their

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,240
enthusiasm because now they've got to

00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:05,660
figure it out all these things to choose

00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:07,520
from anyone pick the wrong thing they

00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:10,310
want to pick something good so it's

00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:12,140
going to be engaging for its kind of

00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:16,760
stopped

00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:20,209
some people never made it past and when

00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:21,859
they do come up with ideas honestly

00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:23,810
they're just not all these great ideas

00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:28,490
it's something that maybe is too

00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:30,800
ambitious for them and that's great but

00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:32,750
don't necessarily want to pick something

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,330
that's overly ambitious when you're just

00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:38,030
getting started with writing or maybe

00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:41,790
it's just way too simple to even be

00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:44,880
worth your time right

00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:46,590
to teach someone how to open Firefox you

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,340
could write a document about it and it

00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:51,780
might be good practice but you're going

00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:55,710
to have to open firefox to find the

00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:58,110
documentation or a lot of people that

00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:00,690
there are tons of problems that fedora

00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:03,810
users have it we just can't do you can't

00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:06,420
tell you how to install and video drums

00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:09,960
we can't tell you how to do covers all

00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:12,810
of the rules for software that is not

00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:16,050
permissible in fedora also apply fedora

00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:17,790
docs so we not only do not provide you

00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,320
with things that are not be

00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:21,720
distributable we can't tell you how to

00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:26,340
do it for yourself so all of that stuff

00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:28,500
is out and there's a lot of people you

00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,930
write a blog you write an article you

00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:33,210
take notes while you're hacking on

00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:36,540
something you've got this content it's

00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:39,510
kind of halfway there and you say this

00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:42,720
would be good for dogs other people like

00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:44,640
this where you put it

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:49,730
we've got guides but there's no where

00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:49,730
they just dump it in so that's

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,600
that's right in topics yeah

00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:57,790
and so along those lines the where do

00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,550
you fit problem is really a problem I

00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:03,040
mean as we said the established gods

00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:05,170
have well defined scope and it's hard to

00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,510
take something that has had any kind of

00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:10,020
feature bringing or just total change

00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:12,430
and figure out how you fit it back in a

00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:14,050
good example that came up recently with

00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:16,500
somebody wanted to talk a little bit

00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:19,450
about the use of docker containers and

00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:23,140
there's not a great place to put that

00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:25,570
today there's not a short-form place it

00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:27,610
doesn't fit the virtualization guides it

00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:29,770
doesn't go in the insulation god it's

00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:32,260
not a system administration topic but

00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:34,750
it's really hard for a new writer

00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:37,720
especially to even understand these are

00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:39,570
all the boxes that i have to play in now

00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,160
how do i get all of us working in and

00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:44,040
this writer in particular said okay well

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,840
i'll just start a brand new guy well

00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:48,700
there's some issues around that and one

00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,280
of them is that frankly it's just not

00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,960
easy some that's too long which we'll

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,310
talk about and some of that is just

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,810
you're going to start a new guide

00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:58,000
there's some expectations that it

00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:00,100
becomes feature complete which

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,380
mean that you're writing for a really

00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,900
long time before anybody gets to see in

00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:06,910
this that you've got enough material

00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:08,440
that it makes sense you can't just start

00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:11,590
somebody in the middle of a process for

00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:13,510
example and we're going to hit on to

00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:15,190
learn quite a bit because all

00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:17,710
discussions ultimately become further

00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:19,600
discussions it seems but at the end of

00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:21,640
the day publishing is a very delayed

00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:24,670
action right now it's something that is

00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:26,290
kind of onerous to accomplish and so we

00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:28,690
see some people become discouraged

00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:29,890
because it takes a while before their

00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:32,050
writing has ever seen in the world

00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:33,340
whereas if you've got your own blog you

00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:36,280
just toss it up there in the next day

00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:42,540
you've got comments so that's a

00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:46,090
challenge of course whether you are a

00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:48,490
seasoned packager or you're totally new

00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:50,620
to open source projects when you get

00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:52,570
started you're probably going to need

00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:54,250
some help it's just a different domain

00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:56,610
language it's a different set of tools

00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,610
and

00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:03,370
we're actually really really good at

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:05,500
this and we've done a lot of stuff to be

00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:10,780
better at it just to make sure that

00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:12,930
we're we've got a great team of

00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:14,950
technical writers a lot of them are

00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:16,930
professionals they do it all day but

00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:19,240
really really good at communicating

00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:22,480
ideas there's people like me you didn't

00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:26,860
play it long and at least answer

00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:28,420
questions I've seen all kinds of

00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:30,550
questions thrown out of our mailing list

00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:32,380
and you get a variety of really good

00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:34,990
answers back from people that you just

00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:39,430
don't see unless that question piques

00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:42,729
their interest so it's a good venue and

00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:44,650
the the IRC Channel it's pretty active

00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:46,720
it's a laid-back sort of environment

00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:49,170
it's easy to drop into and just ask

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:52,510
Steven quest

00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:55,779
but it's not unlikely at all to just

00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:57,370
come in there and later on right away to

00:08:55,779 --> 00:08:59,769
get an answer is need your Brian and

00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:01,000
janitor from anybody and the will talk

00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:04,120
you through whatever it is you're

00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,250
working on and we've set up workshops

00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,230
IRC because is a little bit a

00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:11,399
synchronous and if you're not used to

00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:13,839
IRC etiquette and workflow and all that

00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:16,709
you might expect an answer within five

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,709
minutes and you might

00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:21,820
when it's the appropriate time zone for

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,360
us be sitting in front of our computer

00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:30,080
so we we laid out some slots I think

00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:35,170
what I usually do is wednesdays

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:37,760
thursdays thursdays at two p.m. eastern

00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:43,040
that's right there's another one for the

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:45,920
media folks time slot some guy said the

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,839
person who does it change times up next

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,220
couple of weeks ocean of you but but but

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,810
we're really good at helping whether

00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:52,940
it's with the tools are with the writing

00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:56,089
or just if you want me to complain to

00:09:52,940 --> 00:10:01,040
you whatever it is relatively active

00:09:56,089 --> 00:10:02,810
core team so we're really helpful and we

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:06,620
have to be because the tools are really

00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:08,360
complex frankly there's a lot of things

00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:10,130
that are involved there's publican which

00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,290
is actually used to take what you're

00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:14,779
writing and convert it into HTML so

00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:17,060
there can be published there's doc book

00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:18,079
which is the actual xml language that

00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:21,760
you have to write all of the

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:23,520
documentation in its HTML plus plus plus

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:27,540
kind of

00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:29,460
nightmare at times and it's theirs you

00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:31,350
know editors of choice and we all know

00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:33,000
the editor wars that can be had so as a

00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:34,710
consequence we don't really have any

00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,780
direct guidance on that but sometimes

00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:38,400
you have you know new contributors who

00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:40,140
don't have an editor of choice they just

00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,600
need some help in getting over these

00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:45,240
herbals there's XML length there's get

00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,190
there's lots of stuff so even for

00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,900
experienced project contributors there's

00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:51,750
one or two of these tools they've never

00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:53,910
had to use and these tools present very

00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:55,770
interesting challenges so like get is

00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:57,570
get you know if you've contributed on

00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:59,490
the development side of your project you

00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:01,440
know yet if you've never done

00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:03,870
development work you have to overcome

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,690
this hurdle docbook as I said it's a

00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:09,120
fairly complex XML markup and the nice

00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:10,830
thing about doc up is there's a tag for

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,930
just about every situation you could

00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:15,630
ever dream of running into in

00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:17,940
documentation the problem is there's a

00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:19,410
tag for just about every situation that

00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:22,440
you could ever dream of running into a

00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:24,720
documentation we have some standards

00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,610
which you know we'll talk about that say

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,830
are we don't use this tag but we do use

00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:30,900
these tags when we have this situation

00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:34,170
we mark it up this way that's a

00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:36,570
challenge publican it's a great program

00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:39,930
it does exactly what it's supposed to do

00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:42,300
it's just not updated very frequently it

00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:44,190
is highly likely than if you've just

00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:46,380
installed fedora and it was just

00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:48,450
released public and will not run for you

00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:50,040
like the Fedora release announcement

00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:53,070
should just about say by the Republican

00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:55,230
will work for a long because it's very

00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:57,630
fragile it has so many dependencies and

00:11:55,230 --> 00:12:00,240
so these are all challenges that we have

00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:02,310
to figure out how to get around and to

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,070
help somebody over and so we need to

00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:08,280
work on this as one of our issues this

00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:11,490
area really is the biggest space that

00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:15,710
when I talk to others or contributors

00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:15,710
that they do they don't

00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:24,420
and how do i right well what is good

00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:27,420
technical writing that's as a

00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:30,600
conversation that seemed to be really

00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:33,750
good at having everyone get there but

00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:36,150
most new contributors and they join the

00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:37,620
project we talked about to leave me talk

00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:39,210
about where they're going to go what

00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:41,220
they're going to write about they

00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:43,380
finally get something in there they find

00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:45,270
a slot they write a new guide they start

00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,830
working on a patch and we'll have a

00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:49,980
conversation that goes back and forth

00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:52,230
and it we talk about their markup we

00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:54,630
validate their docbook over and over we

00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:58,440
fix their essence their docbook syntax

00:12:54,630 --> 00:13:00,870
and their xml tag matching and the

00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:03,570
conversation really quickly turns into a

00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:05,460
negative feedback save one here's what

00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:08,010
you did wrong here here's what you did

00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:10,950
wrong here and here's what you did wrong

00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:13,080
over here and in

00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:16,020
it's burdensome for everyone involved

00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:19,180
it's not that we don't like helping it's

00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:22,880
just that you don't want to be home

00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:25,790
over so part of a lot of folks once it

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:28,940
gets to that point where you have

00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:31,370
something that pretty much covers all of

00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:34,720
the topics do you need to and it kind of

00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:37,160
tells you how to do it and it builds I

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,810
don't want to tell you that it's needs

00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,210
improvement anymore

00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:45,500
I want you to see the results of your

00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:48,650
work and this is where the conversation

00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:50,810
of new tribution start it should start

00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:52,670
with good right technique

00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:56,290
but it's conversation you don't have

00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:58,820
enough so we've talked a lot about

00:13:56,290 --> 00:14:01,420
challenges that we have today that over

00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:04,940
the years the the processes have become

00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:07,400
more onerous or negative feedback to use

00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:10,010
that language cycle so we kind of

00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:13,880
defined an ideal solution where we want

00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:17,029
to move to and there's a lot of

00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:19,850
opportunities for help you so in an

00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:21,920
ideal world we want to create something

00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:23,540
that more resembles things that have

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,210
been proven to work in other parts of

00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:28,640
the project for example we want docks to

00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:31,730
move through a defined predictable stage

00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:33,589
life cycle we want this to be something

00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:36,230
that is obvious something that is very

00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:38,510
accessible something that can be clearly

00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:41,060
defined and something that you can join

00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:42,740
the various consist of we want this to

00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:44,510
be something that we can write code

00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:46,670
around and expect to have happen

00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:47,730
regardless of the document garbles of

00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:50,589
work

00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:53,290
we recognize docbook as a challenge

00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:55,060
there are fantastic reasons to use

00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:57,519
doctor it's never going to go away

00:14:55,060 --> 00:15:00,820
completely because it's really really

00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:02,769
good at what it does but we need to

00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:06,010
allow other rooms of markup to be used

00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:07,630
because a that may be all we get if

00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:09,519
somebody has written their blog and

00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:11,829
their blog happens to be a markdown

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,649
based blog somewhere we need to be able

00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:17,019
to take that valuable content generalize

00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:18,910
it out accept it in and maybe over time

00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:20,800
he gets migrated through different

00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:22,480
formats but we need to be able to work

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:26,019
with these popular formats that are

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:28,060
useful all we want to make sure we have

00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:30,699
more opportunities for this peer review

00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:32,320
we really want the contribution story to

00:15:30,699 --> 00:15:35,199
start with all right you've got this

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:38,230
let's make it better not you've got this

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:41,110
let's make it build all very different

00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:42,699
conversations and the molesting is we

00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:44,079
want to get the people in the project

00:15:42,699 --> 00:15:46,720
who are doing this work out of the

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:49,000
publication business as we mentioned

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:52,660
under Toulon the tooling has some issues

00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,760
it tends to lag behind inversions at one

00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:56,649
point there was one person in that as I

00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,209
understand it was a little

00:15:56,649 --> 00:15:59,709
at one point there was one person who

00:15:58,209 --> 00:16:01,480
could published because they happen to

00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:04,839
have this really old version of fedora

00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:07,269
hanging around I'm there's 0 and this

00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:10,360
line person here in one person in Europe

00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:12,999
and we better get right off because they

00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:15,279
happen to keep the door really old you

00:16:12,999 --> 00:16:17,769
know running and it works and that's

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,839
really not acceptable and we shouldn't

00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:24,610
have to do anything when the text is

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:26,410
good it should just go out and that the

00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:29,110
tooling to make that happen kind of goes

00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:31,209
hand in hand and and really the manual

00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:34,449
part of the process I'd like to see go

00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:37,559
away translations our translation team

00:16:34,449 --> 00:16:41,559
is excellent they do a really good job

00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:44,079
we don't do such a good job with giving

00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:48,369
mr strings don't be such a good job of

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:51,119
publishing the ideal situation right now

00:16:48,369 --> 00:16:53,230
is that we push the strings out and

00:16:51,119 --> 00:16:56,829
whoever is to team lead for that

00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:58,389
language handles the publishing we don't

00:16:56,829 --> 00:17:00,210
want them to have to be publishing in

00:16:58,389 --> 00:17:02,980
work with one our writers

00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:05,290
so what I really like is for the

00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:08,410
publishing thing just like other trans

00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:10,120
the hope publishing in the original

00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:12,550
source language should happen

00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:15,520
automatically zanottis got an API

00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:17,760
transfax have an API you should just use

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,760
them

00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:27,640
but when you start looking at the

00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:31,550
content if you're straying away from the

00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:34,820
large book comprehensive documentation

00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:37,130
model then you can really start to get

00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:40,520
the community involved and what I'm

00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:42,290
thinking about six the example that

00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:44,059
really comes to mind for me is coming

00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:48,020
releases ago i'm working on the release

00:17:44,059 --> 00:17:51,530
notes and it started going down the list

00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:53,480
of all the different states but people

00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:58,100
really don't even think about unless

00:17:53,480 --> 00:18:01,910
they're involved those and i talked into

00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:06,980
the fedora GIS parsi chain which is

00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:11,570
geographic information systems client

00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:13,730
and server applications

00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:16,190
anything you some really really cool

00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:17,690
stuff if it's sliced Hopkinson where the

00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,620
guy's been working on and ended up

00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:23,180
having a really interesting

00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:24,620
conversations with diabetic and I can

00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:26,750
remember its name so I give him credit

00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:28,220
seems super helpful and they've been

00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,380
putting in a lot of work with the new

00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:32,450
software their words it stuff that

00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:34,970
people wouldn't necessarily know about

00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:38,960
unless they were already doing looking

00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:41,600
for that stuff or I put in there and I'd

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,900
like to see them supported so that end

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:47,360
users can deploy that stuff with

00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:49,160
predictable instructions like be able to

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,170
support those each other through by

00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:54,650
robotic stuff for the whole lot that

00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:57,680
people do 3d printers and whatever and

00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:59,600
it doesn't have to be one big guy it can

00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:02,650
be a whole bunch of atomic articles that

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,940
we can put all these pieces together and

00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:08,630
individual contributors in that space

00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:11,030
because pick something up and they don't

00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:13,070
have to be technical they can be subject

00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:15,170
matter experts in that area they can

00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:17,420
really go to GIS and not good writers

00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:18,500
and they can just help us and say here

00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:20,480
are the things that you need to write

00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,030
about to make a good G is so we're

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,000
deployment

00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:26,640
here's things you write about to help

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,190
people they might make microcontrollers

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,920
word and if you tell us get it in the

00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:36,510
pipeline we have people that are asking

00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:38,610
what do I do we're like start so we can

00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:44,180
we want to be able to support that kind

00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:44,180
of stuff and on the same same page

00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:49,980
pulsing the wiki for our wiki could you

00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:56,850
find the page on floor awaking if i gave

00:19:49,980 --> 00:20:00,150
you a topic to go into it but if you

00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:04,230
have process documentation for your

00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:07,620
internal team or getting started

00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:11,070
documentation or just things that that

00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:13,770
fedora group does we can give you a

00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:16,190
place to publish it that doesn't be like

00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:16,190
the wiki

00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:24,799
and the last fit I think it's just a

00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:28,850
really cool nice to have kind of thing

00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:32,000
if we can generate documentation on the

00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:36,500
fly not write it but build it from

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,960
packages so API documentation python

00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:41,660
module comments there were better

00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,250
examples Brian heavy atom one of them

00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:45,020
was something as simple as would you

00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:47,390
like to know what packages are included

00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:49,640
in the various variants what do I get

00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:51,590
when I install workstation where I get

00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,690
when I walk the dog urgent care what's

00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:56,390
in the lungs that's the kind of stuff

00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:59,240
you can just put before out and nobody

00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:00,770
has to maintain so we can write

00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,840
something that will format that and

00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:05,870
publish it and it just happens because

00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:06,790
the release happened and not because we

00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:11,230
went through

00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:12,940
either script about so if it sounds

00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:15,370
interesting you've got a note at the

00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:17,350
bottom here we're working on tooling to

00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:20,190
make all of this happen please number

00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:20,190
hackfest and help

00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:37,040
not happy here we go the new model do

00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:42,870
you want to briefly touch on this yeah

00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:46,130
so for workflow what we'd like to see

00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:49,530
your experience be as a contributor is

00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:52,140
this predictable stage document life

00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:54,990
cycle and the idea is you can tap in

00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:59,070
here anywhere you want or as much as you

00:21:54,990 --> 00:22:04,430
want I like these are turn pipeline or

00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:04,430
concept of a funnel so that we have this

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:12,899
said maybe you just have an idea you say

00:22:10,019 --> 00:22:15,239
I would really like to see some document

00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:17,249
doc or documentation can you help me out

00:22:15,239 --> 00:22:20,129
I really like to have an inscape

00:22:17,249 --> 00:22:22,399
tutorial do you have someone that can do

00:22:20,129 --> 00:22:24,509
that I'll just queue them up and

00:22:22,399 --> 00:22:26,279
somebody will pick that up they'll be

00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:28,919
looking for something to do and they'll

00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:31,139
say i can write about daughter and

00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:32,729
they'll start writing it and we'll have

00:22:31,139 --> 00:22:35,659
somebody else look it over and we'll

00:22:32,729 --> 00:22:37,950
have that peer review conversation

00:22:35,659 --> 00:22:40,289
that's where this is a continuous

00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:42,239
process because we do like really

00:22:40,289 --> 00:22:44,519
appreciate part reports and feedbacks

00:22:42,239 --> 00:22:48,239
and losers that's totally valid way to

00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:50,279
participate in the project and then it

00:22:48,239 --> 00:22:54,899
gets published along the way it is

00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:58,080
transit so you can do as much or one

00:22:54,899 --> 00:23:00,309
piece however you want to plug in

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,320
so the two user stories that we're

00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:04,659
trying to enable with all of these

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,850
changes are this drive-by contribution

00:23:04,659 --> 00:23:09,309
content and that kind of takes on two

00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:10,690
two meanings the first meeting is the

00:23:09,309 --> 00:23:12,789
one we just talked about the idea that

00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:15,159
you have an idea maybe somebody else

00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:17,830
writes it helped serve as a reviewer or

00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:19,929
you just want to review documents or you

00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:22,679
just want to write drafts or whatever

00:23:19,929 --> 00:23:25,750
the idea that you have a low commitment

00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:27,639
opportunity to participate however you

00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:30,250
choose to engage with the problem or a

00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:33,039
project the other one that we're trying

00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:34,990
to enable is one where you want to own a

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:37,419
particular piece of content for the

00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:39,639
entire life cycle but maybe it's a small

00:23:37,419 --> 00:23:41,590
piece of content you figured out how to

00:23:39,639 --> 00:23:44,529
do something totally awesome lesson that

00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:46,620
needs to be documented and therefore you

00:23:44,529 --> 00:23:48,809
own that little thing

00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:51,180
the boxes you don't have to think about

00:23:48,809 --> 00:23:55,050
the larger scale of what's going on

00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:57,120
outside of that drive icon contribution

00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:59,520
we think is going to be critical to the

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,230
growth of the project because street

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,600
credibility is measured in blood posters

00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:05,670
and these blog posts need to ultimately

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,280
get formalized and made into a document

00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:10,710
that's going to survive longer than the

00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:12,240
validity of that blog post and yes we

00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:14,700
want to give you credit for sharing your

00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,800
blog posts jamail I'm not just in

00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:20,730
committed long to put it up on this site

00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:23,100
as you say I was published the other

00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:25,080
model is somebody that really wants to

00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:28,910
get engaged really wants to get to dip

00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:34,559
we've got a guy that introduced himself

00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:38,400
two months ago maybe and said I am

00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:43,320
really interested in hi lip verts Python

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:46,820
eclipse and I want to write a book about

00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,820
them for Python

00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:52,750
how can we help you do it we said about

00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:55,540
the repository already knew docbook and

00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:59,020
everything and he's owning that topic

00:24:55,540 --> 00:25:00,730
one hundred percent and so he's going to

00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:02,200
what go through the whole process and

00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:04,660
we're going to have lots of peer review

00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:07,120
conversations with him and he's going to

00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:09,880
do in doing really comprehensive stuff

00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:14,440
and it's well beyond something where you

00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:17,710
just pick up the individual pieces we

00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:23,420
definitely want to help back up not at

00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:25,850
the expense of anyone else but it's

00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:29,540
you can really get into detail and cover

00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:32,780
a range of topics or you can cover

00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:35,290
different aspects of the same topic you

00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:35,290
really need

00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:41,450
so we all have a couple more slides but

00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:43,429
we would like to engage in some

00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:46,669
discussion so we have summary what was

00:25:43,429 --> 00:25:48,500
said basically contributor experience is

00:25:46,669 --> 00:25:52,130
not working for us it's not working for

00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:53,929
anybody the tooling is insufficient it's

00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:55,789
insufficient to publish today as we were

00:25:53,929 --> 00:25:58,130
talking about and it's not going to

00:25:55,789 --> 00:26:01,760
allow us to create a new contributor

00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:03,890
experiences and these contributors

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,809
especially these drive by low commitment

00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:09,890
contributors are going to be critical to

00:26:05,809 --> 00:26:12,409
the growth and continued success of the

00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:15,110
documentation set and so we kind of have

00:26:12,409 --> 00:26:17,240
a couple of asks from you all and one of

00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:20,299
those asks is how many of you

00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:22,130
contributed I'm just curious all of you

00:26:20,299 --> 00:26:23,899
I know for those of you watching at home

00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:27,590
that was a code a lot there was like two

00:26:23,899 --> 00:26:30,440
hands but the idea is we want you to

00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:32,090
contribute we want you to think about

00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:34,700
what it is that you want to do to make

00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:36,590
dogs better so that's both the drive by

00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:38,779
Madeline the protege model and by

00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:41,659
encouraging a new round of contribution

00:26:38,779 --> 00:26:44,690
we can really road test these ideas we

00:26:41,659 --> 00:26:46,970
want you to contribute in a way that is

00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:48,780
not burdensome for you we want you to

00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:50,280
contribute and be able to

00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:52,170
managed of things that you're already

00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:55,080
doing things you're already working on

00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:57,390
you take notes you're right blog posts

00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,950
you work on something kind of figure out

00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:01,230
you can just have a conversation about

00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:03,060
things you already know and derive

00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:05,130
something from that without you having

00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:08,310
to own a big part of the process well I

00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:12,540
think that's one thing I'm certainly

00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:14,160
seen there's people who start out as the

00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:16,200
breadline contributor and then they

00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:20,610
become the protege and then they become

00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:22,080
the driver I provision so there is that

00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:24,030
flexibility you don't have to feel like

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:27,300
a min this I'm going to be tied to this

00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:31,860
for the next 15 years contributing hours

00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:35,960
now is weak that's only our second big

00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:39,060
ass is to come help us build the future

00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:40,920
we really do want to build a tool chain

00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:42,780
it's friday at five is when we're

00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:45,450
getting started and I'll go ahead just

00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:48,710
flip ahead to this slide we have

00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:50,780
specific things we want to accomplish

00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:53,550
we've been looking at some specific

00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:55,110
technology around to get repository

00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:57,360
structures that we want to use we need

00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:58,850
people to help test it make sure it's

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,430
going to work for what we want

00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:03,020
build the ACLS etc if it's missing

00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:05,180
features the development team behind

00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:07,940
it's been very responsive we want to get

00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:09,800
them requests oh well while we're on the

00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:11,650
gift up is there a Frenchman in the room

00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:16,400
that can help us pronounce this word

00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:18,650
yeah good you okay you guys really

00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,350
really diesel thank you we've been

00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:23,090
struggling with that yes my

00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:24,320
pronunciation problem so I was quietly

00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:29,150
not telling you the name of the

00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:31,220
technology we also need to work with

00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:32,840
we've been using buildbot because that's

00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:36,700
what's preferred we need to work with

00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:38,660
some trigger based testing and building

00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:41,270
initially that's going to probably

00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:44,180
literally just be get get commits to

00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:47,000
trigger a build that's happening using

00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:48,890
what we got code we need to take the

00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,240
code to the next level or at least get

00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:51,680
it implemented and make sure it's going

00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:55,160
to work correctly at the time that's

00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:57,710
right cetera we also need to work on the

00:28:55,160 --> 00:29:00,170
visual design we need to work on

00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:02,060
creating I'll say the meta site that

00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:03,470
rolls over the top of all of this so

00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:06,140
we've got all these repos in all these

00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:07,850
documents if you can't find them that's

00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:09,200
a problem so there's data and it needs

00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:10,880
to come out of this that needs to be

00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,860
rolled up into a menu system or

00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,230
something logical so that the whole site

00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:17,480
can be republished and with these pieces

00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:20,660
and a piece that similar to this which I

00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:22,700
did not list related to translation so

00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:25,340
that we push into zanotta automatically

00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:27,520
when documentation is accepted this is

00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:30,100
going to get us to the book that we

00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:32,890
those user cases so that's our second

00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:36,820
ask for me and the third ask is what did

00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:38,650
we miss you know what have we said that

00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:40,000
you didn't agree with or what have we

00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:42,550
said that you were like wait a minute

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,290
what about this because we're soaking in

00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:48,880
it so occasionally we can't see the

00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:51,130
edges so I think that's questions there

00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,810
are kind of questions I mean we put our

00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:54,610
email addresses up here in Jared's email

00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:57,549
address because he's running the extra

00:29:54,610 --> 00:30:01,639
pepper heck Presley

00:29:57,549 --> 00:30:06,400
front and then arm a leg was

00:30:01,639 --> 00:30:08,320
for super food so I have to

00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:11,170
the first one is where are the

00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:14,230
competitor than sitting there and the

00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:16,480
second one is you said that you want to

00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:19,270
run over by a contribution but at the

00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,310
same time is where in the brain if you

00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:25,090
want rather guidelines it can be

00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:27,070
completely well done son how do you

00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:29,410
decide if suddenly a guideline is no

00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:32,170
longer needed or if you do the job

00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:34,930
yourself or to say yeah it will pass is

00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:37,600
nice but we have to we are virtually

00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:40,720
package in this world and this myself

00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:45,330
would that be seen as burdensome and

00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,330
thank you let's a lift

00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:50,529
community or technical environment I'll

00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:54,669
take number two you offered him the

00:30:50,529 --> 00:30:57,250
candy Oh for those of you on video I

00:30:54,669 --> 00:31:01,809
have just given microphone oh thank you

00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:03,669
okay um so the second mobile question I

00:31:01,809 --> 00:31:05,169
apologize I i was listening more to the

00:31:03,669 --> 00:31:08,860
same question the first question I was

00:31:05,169 --> 00:31:11,020
hoping you can dude you're I'll

00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:13,840
take a shot at it the answer that we're

00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:16,299
looking at is that you as a contributor

00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:19,149
if you're say a driver I concluded or

00:31:16,299 --> 00:31:21,880
even a person through your text will

00:31:19,149 --> 00:31:23,710
undergo some form of editing that may be

00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,690
an editing that you want to be involved

00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:28,120
in it may be an editing you don't want

00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:30,220
to be involved but we're also hoping to

00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:32,770
find other contributors may be what they

00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:34,000
want to do is edit there are actually

00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:37,210
people in the world with that is their

00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,640
thing and so we're going to enable both

00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:42,159
of you to be part of a process to allow

00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:45,190
that to happen the end result is that

00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:49,120
not anyone can contribute to the

00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:51,270
publishing document bright so we will

00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,490
have a gatekeeping we

00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:55,320
people at the end go right this really

00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:58,080
isn't ready it really needs a lot of

00:31:55,320 --> 00:32:01,110
help one of the things we may also learn

00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:03,360
over time is that we are willing to

00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:05,310
relax some of the style guidelines that

00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,170
we've had today we think they're all

00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:09,360
good we think they're not 20 verse we

00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:11,250
don't think it's a problem but if we

00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:14,070
discover that we have a hundred new

00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:16,680
contributors and they're all writing in

00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:18,630
a very clear understandable easy to

00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:20,250
translate way that happens to be in

00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:22,680
violation of one of our style guides

00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:25,590
well let's fix the style guide instead

00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:29,730
of trying to fix the people most mostly

00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:33,750
overreaching style things are very

00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:37,950
general it's it's not you must construct

00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:41,060
a sentence using these words or you must

00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:44,490
refer to packages in a specific way is

00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:47,370
don't use a whole bunch of extra

00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:49,260
transitionary phrases you do not need to

00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:50,850
say now that you have completed the

00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:53,640
first step you are ready to proceed to

00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:55,740
the second step that adds 20 information

00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,280
kind of that don't be offended if we

00:32:55,740 --> 00:33:01,890
tell you

00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:04,410
it and it will be use a positive active

00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:07,110
voice and that's more of a linguistic

00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:09,500
term that I'm Jared would probably do a

00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:16,940
much better job of describing that

00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:16,940
something was written about thank you

00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:26,020
you might want to install the package

00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:30,400
next door instead you would say install

00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:36,970
the package there's an implied view

00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:40,510
there but otherwise it it shouldn't be

00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:43,260
too difficult to get past that part of

00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:46,570
it we're not going to go back and forth

00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:49,210
about your writing stock it's your

00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:51,040
writing right the way you speak as long

00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:56,130
as it's clear and we can understand it

00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:56,130
and you're not editorializing

00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:01,220
and we're not scared i get to change the

00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:03,290
answer but we're not scared to look at

00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:05,690
these things you know there are

00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:08,090
occasionally things that people go you

00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:10,490
have to change this it makes translation

00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:12,649
to heart if you don't use this quazy

00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:14,179
stilted form of the language and then

00:34:12,649 --> 00:34:15,380
suddenly you find back two years later

00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:17,090
from a translator that they're like

00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:18,740
would you please stop using this quazy

00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:20,540
stilted form of a language or making

00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:22,790
translation part because it turns out

00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:26,540
translation was never made difficult by

00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:28,429
the original phrasing so some of its

00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:31,280
going to feel it the other thing that I

00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:34,310
would say is that i think this sets up

00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:36,230
an opportunity for people who especially

00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:38,330
these drive by people who have blogs and

00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:41,360
reposting already this is a chance for

00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:43,760
you to get feedback on your writing not

00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:45,740
necessarily when they're content so you

00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,630
this may turn into something that it's

00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:49,280
actually like I really want to

00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:50,750
participate in this because I become a

00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,990
better writer as a result of this

00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,990
process

00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:58,250
other words

00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:07,250
late there were some awkward about

00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:11,330
denotes I look quite actions at

00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:13,400
minus the visa another guy so that

00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:18,120
cousin will be

00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:22,080
rescue I've really been trying to get me

00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:26,340
to stop using that word the owner put

00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:28,980
odor I would say a guide maintainer and

00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:34,440
I coordinator you don't know if we're

00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:35,790
team as as far as workflow book goes we

00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,920
have a couple different fast groups

00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:39,900
there's a doc's group as a docs writers

00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,540
group is a docs publisher improvement

00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:45,330
it'll probably end up that the branches

00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:48,030
of these git repos that we publish will

00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:49,980
only be able to will have commit rights

00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:52,680
for the docs writers in the docs

00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:58,130
publishers group which at the end of the

00:35:52,680 --> 00:36:02,600
day will be a pull request workflow and

00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:06,960
if you do two or three of them and

00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:10,630
everything's fine we'll probably just

00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:14,410
the barrier to entry getting into that

00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:16,360
was not difficult yeah it's you didn't

00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:18,280
break anything you're right reasonably

00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:20,410
well we're going to put you in that

00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:22,090
group and hope that you become the guy

00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:25,990
that's working on this poll requests on

00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:28,150
the other side a secondary thing is that

00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:29,830
you mentioned maintenance specifically

00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:33,580
you know something changed between

00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:36,210
fedora 11 and 13 the guides about 21

00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:40,589
style methodology

00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:42,630
if we can bring new this new user

00:36:40,589 --> 00:36:44,760
contributor methodology online we can

00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:47,339
lighten this process we can hopefully

00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:49,800
engage with the working groups within

00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:53,400
the project in a way that causes them to

00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:56,339
be more able to report changes that have

00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:59,040
documentation of that today it's a very

00:36:56,339 --> 00:37:00,810
heavy process but if we can get to a

00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:03,300
point where they can go yeah we we

00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:05,280
change this you know it's more than just

00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:07,560
replacing the word young with DMF

00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,270
there's like an entire thing that you

00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:11,849
need to think about this is no longer

00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:13,890
valid and this is the new way and if we

00:37:11,849 --> 00:37:15,510
can get that conversation rolling again

00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:17,160
because things are now easier to do

00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:19,410
that's going to ultimately make

00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:21,450
maintenance better for everyone it will

00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:23,940
also open up a lot of opportunity for

00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:27,630
brand new participants in the plural

00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:29,910
project to go I followed your god step 5

00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:32,220
doesn't exist anymore step 6 all the

00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:33,869
arguments changed and I figured this out

00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:35,910
and since it's so lightweight easy to

00:37:33,869 --> 00:37:38,160
engage with you I am as my first

00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:40,140
activity ever in contributing community

00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:43,470
going to fix the installation guide for

00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:46,560
the next person we love that even if you

00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:49,140
just say it's wrong here's what I did to

00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,970
fix it if you send me an email that it

00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:52,369
makes life

00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:53,630
you because I know what's wrong I know

00:37:52,369 --> 00:37:57,140
where to fix it I know where that

00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:59,810
maintenance activity needs to happen is

00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:02,000
it it's really hard to read through all

00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:03,859
of the documentation all the time make

00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,030
sure everything's up to date so that's

00:38:03,859 --> 00:38:07,030
sort of what we expect from

00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:10,160
how to sign

00:38:14,789 --> 00:38:23,380
wisdom screen the kids are dressed

00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:26,549
and with a specific format try to render

00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:26,549
that's a good position

00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:32,720
weather

00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:35,640
but yeah we've done some good out there

00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:38,460
I don't think there's anything that runs

00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:40,260
commands I think they're working on of

00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:43,260
the mineralogical there's there's

00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:45,690
there's a testing framework work for

00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:48,660
documentation called a vendor I believe

00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:52,260
only does a little bit stone is on Alice

00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:56,390
because nobody can be extended but you

00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:59,040
did there this potential to do that with

00:38:56,390 --> 00:39:02,609
probably most markup languages I mean

00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:04,500
I've been nose-down restructured text

00:39:02,609 --> 00:39:07,020
for a while for example it wouldn't be

00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:09,930
too hard to write it directed that could

00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:11,430
be interpreted and you write or start

00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:14,250
your text directive and take that

00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:15,750
command and maybe it would dump the

00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:17,340
output of the command into your document

00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:20,930
or maybe we'll just make sure they

00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:24,030
return 0 there's potential for that and

00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:26,280
joy the build system I revision sort of

00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:30,570
segment two hours and grew a bunch

00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:32,250
job so there's a validation step this I

00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:33,960
don't dive down the markup rabbit hole

00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:35,790
but this is also one of those cases just

00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:38,100
so everybody knows where dr. Wolfe is

00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:39,660
like really also because one of the

00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:43,170
meander tests that they do have working

00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:45,030
right now is it markup package names it

00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:48,420
will tell you if the package is still

00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:49,530
available so you don't refer to packages

00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:53,460
that no longer exists in the

00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:55,770
distribution and that's something that

00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:57,930
other markup languages like say mark

00:39:55,770 --> 00:40:00,240
down they don't provide you anything

00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:03,840
around the content to tell you hey this

00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:06,660
is a packaging but docbook can if we

00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:09,030
choose use it that way so that's where

00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:11,250
we get to think about all right for this

00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:13,650
documentation set that's in this markup

00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:15,570
that has a much smaller test suite but

00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:18,950
over time as it grows an important we

00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:18,950
migrated from one more

00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:33,510
no more other questions or comments you

00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:36,780
open a pretty quiet crowd Kyle what do

00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:38,040
you think we do we covered everything

00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:45,900
you possibly want to know about your

00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:49,109
dogs so I have a level yes I got I guess

00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:51,180
my phone in this is if this sounds good

00:40:49,109 --> 00:40:54,030
to you this sounds releasing you from

00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:56,010
work or our half that's on Friday and

00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:59,550
help us make this a reality so it's not

00:40:56,010 --> 00:41:02,130
just talking actually yeah and even if

00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:04,230
you don't want to work on tools to show

00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:05,410
up and say hey I'd like to write an

00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:07,820
article

00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:10,220
consider all your matching I need help

00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:12,740
with fabric or evening I mean I'm saying

00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:14,180
that I anywhere out there happen what

00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:18,770
living is even if you're not a

00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:20,960
programmer come because we can use your

00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:26,090
input to help the developers understand

00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:27,650
the kind of a solution we need because

00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:29,420
you know those of us with development

00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:32,390
experience approach the world in a very

00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:33,980
particular way and obviously everyone

00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:36,230
can do all of these command-line

00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:38,150
functions and in reality that's not the

00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:40,280
user based on fedora and a hundred

00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:43,030
percent and therefore if you're one of

00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:45,740
those people which they're very people

00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:49,920
show up and help us by giving us your

00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:51,430
eyes that's that's really perfect

00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,599
what

00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:54,599
I will tell

00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:02,760
in Ecuador good position team haha about

00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:05,970
writing something and then I was kind of

00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:08,960
pissed much and you do really get me to

00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:12,210
eat and then

00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:18,289
which I have been hearing Garrett

00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:18,289
explain okay he's not that bad

00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:32,090
well it's not you see that all the steps

00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:35,420
one it's not just doesn't just take a

00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:38,720
while to learn if you're writing things

00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:40,940
out in docbook and you know doc book and

00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,890
you know the subject it still takes you

00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:47,810
a while to write it just to write it out

00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:50,180
and if you just write it out without any

00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:51,950
markup and then you go back over it it

00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:56,240
still takes you a long time to get all

00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:58,010
of that done that's it doesn't have to

00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:00,380
be the same person one person can write

00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:02,720
it test another yeah come back come back

00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:04,520
and we don't let that be here you know

00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,080
if you say a lot of red box but I don't

00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:07,730
want have to do on this mark don't let

00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:10,240
that year hanging attic keep you from

00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:10,240
contribute

00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:19,780
needed to be said we are basically out

00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:22,849
of time but I did want to say thank you

00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:26,109
i'd be interested after the presentation

00:43:22,849 --> 00:43:28,280
for those of you can chose not to speak

00:43:26,109 --> 00:43:30,290
i'd be interested know why you came to

00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,400
the presentation i'll turn off the

00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:33,080
videos which you don't have to be

00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,910
recorded all that so all of you people

00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:37,070
thousands of you watching from home you

00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:39,310
can notice the assess our as he's been

00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:43,040
totally out of frame is our last 15 oh

00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:45,170
but there's a reason for that is why

00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,940
they did not install the effect that

00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:49,460
allows me to look 10 years younger in 30

00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:50,780
pounds lighter but um that being said

00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,400
that ulcer since I'd actually like to

00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:55,700
know why you came because that's a

00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:57,470
driver for thinking about what it is

00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:59,630
that makes people want to engage and

00:43:57,470 --> 00:44:01,160
I've been put on the video so I'm going

00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:02,510
to click the magic button so everybody

00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:08,710
watching who's my face really really

00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:08,710
