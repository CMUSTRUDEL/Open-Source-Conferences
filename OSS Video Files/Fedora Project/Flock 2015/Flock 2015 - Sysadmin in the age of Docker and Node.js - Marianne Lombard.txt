Title: Flock 2015 - Sysadmin in the age of Docker and Node.js - Marianne Lombard
Publication date: 2015-08-26
Playlist: Flock 2015
Description: 
	When you work in a research center, one day, a user will come and ask you if you know $new_fancy_tool. How do you install all this soft when documentation just say "docker run" or "grunt install" ? How do you follow update ? security fixes ? How do they fit in your ansible managed infra ?

i sorry for the French accent I hope

00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:14,790
everyone will understand so what is

00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,949
being assistant me when you have to deal

00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:21,150
with docker was not yes we're with

00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:26,160
autistic first I'm system administrator

00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:28,800
I work in a French public services and

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:34,829
it's a research institute so I have user

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:37,290
very very very most very new stuff that

00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:41,250
is good being years who actually people

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:43,260
so security people it's mainly telling

00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:48,059
them know you can download with

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:50,190
bittorrent at work I'm not today I'm not

00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:54,000
the repair I never learn how to develop

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:57,600
properly that was not my formation or

00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,000
DevOps and I package for food we're on

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,000
it bears in soon almost a year now

00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:09,860
I will speak mainly about open source

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:13,380
because if you ever touch something

00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:20,900
proprietary for linux you will have

00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:20,900
nightmare so

00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,799
what is great

00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:36,160
okeechobee sweet say it's easy you can

00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,800
fold you can do a very severe software

00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:42,540
you can access the documentation because

00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:46,390
it's all in one can we put a bird yeah

00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:51,430
doc is easy is great it's in very easy

00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:53,110
to install you installed ok what service

00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:57,600
will little bit of configuration of

00:01:53,110 --> 00:02:02,050
target you are a ton of software times

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:05,470
every several sing now you can't find it

00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:08,320
ok almost you don't have to bother to

00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:12,340
find out the dependency compile if it's

00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:16,990
not so available version is not good you

00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:20,530
can include a run the same instance on

00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:23,560
your letter on your server somewhere and

00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:27,010
open you can create your own image if

00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:31,660
you want some customization offer a

00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:33,850
software your project and you don't mess

00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:37,060
up with your space system you use it

00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:42,330
with there too with your mailer respond

00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:45,670
to your bus and you have to explicitly

00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:48,030
declare support you want to use in the

00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:48,030
docker

00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:55,799
and other security people I think it's a

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:58,599
good thing because it should it make a

00:02:55,799 --> 00:03:05,409
user realize we cannot open everything

00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:08,640
on the internet every time so there is

00:03:05,409 --> 00:03:13,390
so also something with its language

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:20,010
liberal reward story seems like Japan pi

00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:23,650
PI probably it's ruby gem when you can

00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:26,650
rhian you have one pair language you

00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:31,120
have tons of memory and it works

00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:35,909
everywhere if it's done prefer even for

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:39,359
song in with OS is like windows omegas

00:03:35,909 --> 00:03:39,359
not focus

00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:46,520
so when is a trouble begin

00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:53,819
you are all all of your sins it tastes

00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,819
somewhere

00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:05,400
okay you really want to launch this on

00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:09,630
your laptop and your personal laptop

00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:12,260
with all the data yeah you your parents

00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,260
have taught you well

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:25,450
always be careful well I will volley

00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:30,070
comfort yes there's the documentation

00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:35,230
there is good that im sue samina i work

00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:38,650
with them adware openmanage is a its to

00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:43,090
develop and manage its true to managers

00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:47,460
who are where supervisors and it's

00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:47,460
official documentation and certified

00:04:50,920 --> 00:05:02,110
yes we all we all I see artists in

00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:05,110
stellar installation I I workloads all

00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:07,720
right with private network so not of my

00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:10,330
a lot of the seven minutes don't have

00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,100
access to internet it's a choice we

00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:15,600
don't want them to access presenter has

00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:19,840
only website or some services are facing

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:24,580
well what do i do when i see an entry in

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:27,760
style and I launch it on the box we

00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:33,610
don't that don't have internet what I

00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:35,790
faith very good so what can I do I can

00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:43,210
have an internal memo for every language

00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:45,550
existing any time and place install the

00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:49,690
network who has access to the internet

00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:52,390
and move its ultimate and final yeah for

00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:56,800
every update and we need to shut down

00:05:52,390 --> 00:06:00,790
the services move the server change

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:04,870
changing the IP in a date and we move

00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:06,970
okay I can play with the proxies and to

00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:10,650
firewall to allow the dough nothing but

00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:13,169
not suit according that's what

00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:17,600
but all of this is very time consuming

00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:22,160
and they're in this was consumed and

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,160
that's always a problem for season

00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:32,330
wild okay

00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:36,349
dhakuria as a lot of advantage but

00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:39,919
a lot of images for software including

00:06:36,349 --> 00:06:44,719
not only the software but also all

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:46,819
services of the dev of the laptop yeah

00:06:44,719 --> 00:06:49,370
of the dev laptop generally the

00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:52,039
developer is making the images from

00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:55,699
Israel is on laptop and pushing it on

00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:57,770
the doctor well why it is an issue first

00:06:55,699 --> 00:07:02,629
it's not optimized will use it more

00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:05,060
space and it's generally not the one you

00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:07,159
are using a lot of them is a lot of

00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,949
developers are using Ubuntu we are

00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:15,280
running fedora who is not running fedora

00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:15,280
handsome okay

00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:22,360
and there is a recent study study where

00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:25,870
shows and more than such a person of the

00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:28,960
official image i am not a dating they

00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:34,120
have measure of security issue Shh I say

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:38,500
what ugly it's one year it was last year

00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:45,220
a bit and yet now we can still find

00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:48,810
images and there is another issue with

00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:51,550
specific children to itself into license

00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:55,830
and more specifically is the stuff about

00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:59,080
the trademark who is pushing it because

00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:01,900
when you really care free you can

00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:04,560
understand that you need to have a

00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:07,720
neutralization of canonical to use

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,410
ubuntu for your product you're saying

00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:13,419
all you need to recompile everything

00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:18,940
also this place also distribution not

00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:22,570
just a packaging so i don't know that i

00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:26,229
don't find it very clear on the other

00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:29,650
side fedora i read up on some twists a

00:08:26,229 --> 00:08:32,430
very clear way to do it so it's only a

00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:32,430
few package

00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:39,039
where the tram mark with a trainer and

00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:42,280
you can easily remove them or change

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:49,150
them to your own it's what's not wes is

00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:52,090
doing well you have your stuff you have

00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:56,200
to eat you up find it good you want to

00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:58,780
deploy it on your company network or for

00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:03,480
your friend well why not make your

00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:06,690
attorney for these are what can go wrong

00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,690
any ID

00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:14,720
chondroitin copper you can do it sir in

00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:21,189
the main fear a tree when but it's a bit

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:21,189
longer classified material well

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:29,709
where the sikh from your wife chromium

00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:34,080
is not infidel know from young yeah

00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:34,080
there is also some licensing new species

00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:43,470
I want to package this memory from my

00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:47,040
users it's a baton spuyten see

00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:50,260
scientific books and calculation and

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:53,730
alpha method myself I have to package

00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:58,660
five or six other library in order to

00:09:53,730 --> 00:10:04,770
package 21 miles above it can be a

00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:07,210
little expensive and the fancy fancy

00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:12,700
especially with I don't know why but

00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:15,370
it's often with a rather stuff we need

00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:19,290
an older versions and the version in the

00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:25,980
distribution and Noah's I want updated

00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:25,980
updated reasons

00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:37,490
recent ruby is notoriously bad at making

00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:41,089
AV eyes when they update yes Ruby is a

00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:47,449
very bad for that is breaking up in a

00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:50,540
barrel I repeat presently camera and you

00:10:47,449 --> 00:10:53,600
are the licensing issue where there is a

00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:58,459
library with hotel care license or even

00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:00,679
a license at home or something for

00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:04,809
Guidry distribution that for you we will

00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:04,809
just just put sitting inside

00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:15,420
well you the old world example I know

00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:17,400
that a dupe would probably be retired

00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:21,200
from Phaedra because it became

00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:24,060
impossible to a package that's sad I

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:30,290
don't know if anyone has ever played

00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:37,620
wizard it's a written many in Java yeah

00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:44,540
and it's to do population on whether you

00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:44,540
can it's wrong place just off

00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:54,050
and another issue is the reason a lot of

00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:56,570
project oftens a small project seems to

00:11:54,050 --> 00:12:00,310
forget to do raise regular on a regular

00:11:56,570 --> 00:12:04,820
basis they do a release for it oh it's a

00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:06,890
0.1 and after you like it you want to

00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:09,020
pack at it you see Zurich bergens the

00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:11,990
sea opposites elementary no no we don't

00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:16,100
make a reason it's on the menu hey I

00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:19,310
want a clear version and and there is

00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:22,160
some time and also stuff with missing

00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:25,160
it's the documentation especially the

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:32,260
upgrade documentation for software when

00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:38,690
you have a change of database keep

00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:42,560
schema come up configuration change and

00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:48,040
you don't have anyone is just oh yeah a

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:50,540
break I ever change ur acct system

00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:55,120
configuration has changed we don't just

00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:55,120
move away we switch to another Savior

00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:07,149
yeah a lot of documentation now it's the

00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:10,019
camera and configure yeah where is the

00:13:07,149 --> 00:13:13,019
config file in which one Reggie

00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:13,019
resolution

00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:22,509
untrue you need to find a config file

00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:25,540
and you read it extensively on your

00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:30,149
small terminal because everything is it

00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:30,149
is in the comments when it's up to date

00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:41,540
well it's sometimes a blog article more

00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:43,340
less useful mall is complete you need to

00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:47,120
find out his ear piece another piece

00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:49,460
here and guess what attention you have

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:52,310
to make because we're documentation is

00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:59,590
about is to the two on your arms Delta

00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:59,590
for ya can always

00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:10,140
and people are following his

00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:10,140
instructions I see there is a minute

00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:17,140
under stay online oh yeah

00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:24,060
as I said not bad

00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:31,620
because a really sort of good stuff so X

00:14:29,009 --> 00:14:36,209
square don't care to make always on

00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:38,850
virtualization these green wigs and our

00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:44,190
 are in studying on move yeah for

00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:46,649
everything I Cesar can do snapshot makes

00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:49,680
a snapshot your upgrade if you're seeing

00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:53,509
is fun okay every single wrong I can

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:59,420
stay late and go back on my section I'm

00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:59,420
work on it later not to fight it

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,980
families are some good

00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:18,819
you can when you are lucky a lot of

00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:25,239
software providing a fee I was a

00:15:18,819 --> 00:15:29,329
but not always packaging with very very

00:15:25,239 --> 00:15:34,639
very good packaging sometimes it's no

00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:37,339
cheats / opt it's not always respecting

00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:39,829
the federal guidelines them but it's not

00:15:37,339 --> 00:15:43,939
working for federal or whether all right

00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:47,079
up when you are not too lucky you get

00:15:43,939 --> 00:15:50,869
knock out that with clear installation

00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:57,559
instruction or as when or get to go on

00:15:50,869 --> 00:16:00,259
it's working and now with system day

00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:04,929
it's very easy to create a system were

00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:10,489
satisfied we're aware easier than with

00:16:04,929 --> 00:16:13,100
any design it for our system pipe while

00:16:10,489 --> 00:16:15,759
at some project even begin to provide

00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:19,160
one because into a billion will switch

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:23,619
persistently soon or else always always

00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:23,619
switch so it's beginning to

00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:31,040
Alabama's with system decent you can

00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:35,860
resurrect very easily your login joelle

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,860
you have everything

00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,570
awesome

00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:48,720
and while everyone has out of uncivil

00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:52,320
prepared for observer and that was our

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:57,330
old manager very to Tokyo container they

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:59,990
will manage system to services so don't

00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,990
do they know

00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:03,009
teddy plane

00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,870
I'm first affair visions it wasn't

00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:14,270
adventure you just have to these

00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:18,650
measures shrinking or what you are using

00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:23,180
here but sometimes it's a user user

00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:27,770
supervision two men at four at six

00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:35,090
o'clock friday it's not working already

00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:39,350
know okay i was very faster than i think

00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:42,110
i will be so i would like to send thanks

00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:46,420
so people on the federal welfare channel

00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:49,010
was profiting and if there is a some

00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:52,220
autographic here error as there are mine

00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:55,250
of mine only I want to size difference

00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:58,010
i'm going for almost making me missing

00:17:55,250 --> 00:18:04,120
my talk I arrived I was supposed to

00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:07,540
arrive yesterday I driver at turn okay

00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:13,300
and everyone here but listen to me I

00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:13,300
hope her rough questions

00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:31,980
repeat for social question is how to

00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:35,280
solve when a developer is using MCM or

00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:38,820
under the stuff i don't have the magic

00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:42,240
warm i explained in why it's not a good

00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:45,830
idea for a selling point of view but i

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:48,780
cannot forbid it item types of his power

00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:51,390
they understand general when there are

00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:57,870
reasonable people you can talk to

00:18:51,390 --> 00:19:03,390
developers when they don't region airy

00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:06,710
finish with a server in what we call a

00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:09,390
experimental team there where the

00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:12,150
developer in studies on OS and manage it

00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:14,550
and we cut it when there is a if the

00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:17,580
machine is a service compromise we can

00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:20,900
to network and experimental but he has

00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:20,900
to be is on so sorry

00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:31,860
we are that we are with more yeah i work

00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:35,670
with researchers so they need to have

00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:37,080
stuff very experimental so we don't have

00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:39,570
the same mood for production on

00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:43,050
experimental experimental is very very

00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:46,400
year they can use action we don't love

00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:49,640
it because as I'm gonna meet here

00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,640
business stuff

00:19:53,130 --> 00:20:01,620
one of the big challenges with offer

00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:05,300
I much

00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:05,300
aighty administration

00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:11,809
because

00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:15,500
many things that are in languages and

00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:19,149
daughter takes us to extreme end of

00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:21,280
deploying a black box as far as

00:20:19,149 --> 00:20:23,950
from the developers going to do not

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:26,560
they get to package everything together

00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:28,980
and just employ other known quantity

00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:31,590
attested unit but from the sysadmin

00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:37,770
operations going to do you have

00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:37,770
something that's running a new context

00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:45,110
if you do an image that has parking in

00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:51,290
there

00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:51,290
like Raptors to reverse engineer of

00:20:53,960 --> 00:21:00,350
so what boots do you take you do you

00:20:57,559 --> 00:21:01,210
simply give the development doctors

00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:05,980
fault

00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:10,120
then be in charge of outside

00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:14,110
trying to add some level of

00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:14,110
guarantees about dr.

00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:19,690
the fish a question was about to

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,670
prosecute was about the pairing of

00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:24,220
production on the unknowns and how we

00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:28,450
deal with it to not end with black boxes

00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:31,810
our network well the answer is it's a

00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:34,000
research center we loved secure

00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:36,010
researcher who are using docker it was

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,540
not a lot some of them are still using

00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:47,140
photon the researcher using docker our

00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:49,890
generation before we can talk with their

00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:55,480
they're following the news there and

00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:57,900
Sons done the way they have a forge way

00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:02,130
it's not get ur because we comes fitted

00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:05,410
for various reason but we have a fortune

00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:09,850
there are proteins I've gotten on target

00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:12,700
instance so when the development is

00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:19,020
working is done properly with some

00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:23,070
standard and a forge get you already you

00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:27,630
deploy some new software on github URL

00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:30,820
we have also also continuous integration

00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:31,850
so it's not very black gloss we know

00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:35,210
what honey

00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:37,160
and its many well as its original center

00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:39,169
is many from calculation so it's not

00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:41,960
facing some tonight she will have long

00:22:39,169 --> 00:22:45,719
running instances then happy cleaned up

00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:48,729
itself stole 12 months ago

00:22:45,719 --> 00:22:50,499
no it's more a researcher is setting

00:22:48,729 --> 00:22:54,849
represent there are not and sharing it

00:22:50,499 --> 00:22:57,489
with the students to do calculation

00:22:54,849 --> 00:23:01,269
another specific with a specific

00:22:57,489 --> 00:23:06,059
environment its research is a very

00:23:01,269 --> 00:23:06,059
specific and enemy it's not an industry

00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:25,830
no we don't have the specific service

00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:27,929
for internal development of specific

00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:33,330
data it's not my part I work with a

00:23:27,929 --> 00:23:35,999
researcher I don't managers what I

00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:40,649
didn't manage financial applications

00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:42,210
appz focusing no sir et cetera as very

00:23:40,649 --> 00:23:45,629
free because they are doing research in

00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:50,359
IT are in computer science so then need

00:23:45,629 --> 00:23:56,070
to be free we offer them for the new

00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:58,379
newcomers the students formation we try

00:23:56,070 --> 00:24:02,460
to offer information about the best

00:23:58,379 --> 00:24:09,020
practice in development I'm out tributo

00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:10,910
power outages gate always be svn

00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:13,070
but for the language it's really

00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:16,580
different of the somatic presence the

00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:19,450
team so we count importance we can for

00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,450
them to you something

00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:29,760
so teens are forcing themselves we have

00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:33,990
a team we don't want to use a scene so I

00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:39,150
use item zip to do Susan C so issues as

00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:42,570
much as sales is a few students know how

00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:45,720
to develop easy program a lot of student

00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:49,560
not a title so it's easier to have a

00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:52,620
large occurred well maintained too

00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:55,050
despite some plans yeah that's probably

00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:57,390
the only leverage we have to explain the

00:24:55,050 --> 00:25:01,260
unrest easier sometimes to do a language

00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:05,700
because everyone played well fine

00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:11,810
example is using canaria know what come

00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:16,980
it is ok what does it it's the

00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:19,980
imperative language it's functional

00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:23,930
language give up in France so very

00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:28,850
popular in France but only I don't mind

00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:28,850
edinburgh original NL

00:25:29,539 --> 00:25:32,539
reason

00:25:35,049 --> 00:25:38,340
any more question

00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:45,809
we have a few application will you mean

00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:45,809
inside well switch

00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:53,460
only two people or one or two people can

00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,460
can work on

00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,630
so

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,450
thank you I hope it was interesting for

00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:09,450
you

00:26:13,789 --> 00:26:16,899
for someone
