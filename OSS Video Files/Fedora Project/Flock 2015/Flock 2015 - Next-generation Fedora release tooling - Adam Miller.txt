Title: Flock 2015 - Next-generation Fedora release tooling - Adam Miller
Publication date: 2015-08-26
Playlist: Flock 2015
Description: 
	In this talk we will discuss the challenges faced by RelEng with the current Release Tooling. From there we will talk about the current plans, proposals, work that has been done, and work still needing to be done in order to implement next-generation Fedora Release Tooling. We will cover build systems, compose automation, how the new tooling is aiming to solve the challenges being faced with current tools, and how we hope this new design will prevent us from facing similar challenges moving forward.
