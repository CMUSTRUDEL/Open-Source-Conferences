Description: 
	Ansible allows sysadmins to do more work in less time by giving them a means to capture the desired state of machines in special configuration files and then apply those configurations to multiple remote machines. But for every labor saving tool there is some startup cost. In this case the price is recording the desired state into ansible playbooks. Several Fedora Infrastructure admins were faced with just this problem and solved it by building github.com/ralphbean/lightsaber , a common repository of playbooks and roles to configure their systems. Come to this session to learn how you can use their work to jumpstart your own ansible deployments on Fedora.
