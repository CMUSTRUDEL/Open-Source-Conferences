father I welcome we are speaking about

00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:13,349
SS management's why drink as its

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,800
managing looks to know what you want to

00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:20,430
knowing what isn't the wrong once you're

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:23,220
not especially for expensive our service

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:26,189
and search to planning the replacement

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:30,090
sons of budget when project I'm homes

00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:33,200
and not asking for small project when

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:35,760
you have tons of hardware to replace and

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:40,250
also because there is legal obligation

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:43,230
for the company to know what your own

00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:44,910
had returned in English buying

00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:48,090
friendship we are speaking of

00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:51,140
immobilization it's what can be deducted

00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,140
from Texas and

00:00:51,800 --> 00:01:01,269
and well first solution is adding a

00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:04,309
folder paper on computer with awesome

00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:05,990
holls paper about it it's not very

00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:11,869
efficient it work well if you have one

00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:15,860
laptop well second solution is that

00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:18,860
inspection spreadsheet share the twill

00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:23,509
work or to a point we have that before

00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:28,970
before at work 20 people can edit once

00:01:23,509 --> 00:01:32,030
you church it is a nightmare okay there

00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:38,630
is very two or three I think it can work

00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:40,399
but well what we use now is called she

00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:49,250
strongly with the back informatik free

00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:53,700
management its's it's open source web

00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:57,759
based and it's written in PHP and

00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:01,750
and thanks to her me collect it's a

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:08,500
variable infinity money is one of the

00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:11,260
people who are creating software what

00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:14,530
you can do in it you have two main parts

00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:18,700
inventory button to address part I will

00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:22,090
begin with your L desk or first a bit of

00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:27,220
publicity it's not limited to small

00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:29,349
company with hundreds of users the

00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:34,540
freshness of security using it with more

00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:38,019
than a hundred thousand people so it's

00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:42,910
very working while you need to very

00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:45,910
carefully chose a size 7 1 but yeah it

00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:51,720
worked with very big it can work with

00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:51,720
very big network of smooth

00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,390
yeah so desk is I to compliance if you

00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:03,210
are using I tell you are the web

00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:05,460
interface with moons or requests or you

00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:07,500
can do it by nine seconds your actual

00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:11,670
work flows can be flown as for the

00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:14,430
losers and a request can be like Inca to

00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:16,330
when in an item in anatomy is very

00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:22,780
useful when you are

00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:28,460
and this form a user's not sound bad but

00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:31,040
and you can really customize it on tell

00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:34,100
that this user once each other or

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:37,490
Connecticut it going to that i like you

00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:42,020
so because it's a VIP Alex groans VIP

00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:45,800
year fewer with us lois la it's kinda

00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:47,690
same but this one our printer sings all

00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:51,709
the printers related teen are going to

00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:55,849
test page 15 because a man

00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:59,599
and you can vary it takes sometimes to

00:03:55,849 --> 00:04:05,310
master it fully but it's strongly desert

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:07,620
can really customize its placement well

00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:12,540
you need to our users in it so you can

00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:16,109
create your user manual ok but when you

00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:18,720
are lot of users it's easier to use a

00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:21,900
ldap transportation or a teacher to

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:25,229
notification the transistor company to

00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:28,110
be honest assistant administrator as a

00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:31,410
GOP opening that integration is one of

00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:33,930
the best you can really choose what is

00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:37,500
your primary key for user which

00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:41,180
parameters views we don't have that

00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:44,729
Jason all software

00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:46,680
but and you have to drop off right there

00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:49,229
is the rights on the inventory but its

00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:52,919
rights and to address back and read to

00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:57,150
contribute and there is also system

00:04:52,919 --> 00:05:00,180
called entities entities is well if you

00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:01,889
are multi structure company can add a

00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:06,449
division with identities and other

00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:09,510
entities and rights are given parent it

00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:14,820
is all on the wall so you can get the

00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:16,440
right one people from an unknown cities

00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:20,699
will not access it themselves also

00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:24,000
entities but technician Zion entities

00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:27,840
person can access your food because they

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,970
need to answer our canteens services can

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,129
access to the inventory records only in

00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:35,249
reading second qualifier

00:05:32,129 --> 00:05:38,459
that kind of can really be there is some

00:05:35,249 --> 00:05:40,949
profile recreated but you can really

00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:46,080
create one profile and customize a plan

00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:48,389
as you need we have doesn't earn that so

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:53,909
just the right management is astonishing

00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:57,929
they start yeah and that you're not

00:05:53,909 --> 00:06:00,770
really are fulfilled what you can do it

00:05:57,929 --> 00:06:03,449
manually and web interface where

00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:09,449
it's a bit painful when you have a lot

00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:12,810
of we can import CSV file export in the

00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:16,050
true you are using now and just

00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:20,310
and you can even do it with a bit of

00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:24,380
stretching and witty when you extract

00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:27,600
the data from your ad venting software

00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:31,940
its new common continue our work can be

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,940
possible 20 30 you can

00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:41,130
that would be soon to save time is there

00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:45,330
is a way to create I don't know if you

00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:49,950
buy a lenovo laptop 2440 you can create

00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:54,900
a template with laptop t440 with some

00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:58,250
fields already for manufacture our

00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:02,850
fields are types come on 20 of the same

00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:05,580
sometimes oh and there is a plugin

00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:08,850
system you can extend the software and

00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:12,540
the data you can plug in a lot we bought

00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:15,360
a csv file yeah you just have to

00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:18,840
associate the creative contributions you

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,889
column and what the chromosphere to try

00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,189
you say disco

00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:25,469
this is the same number disqualified so

00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:29,550
this graph this is a name of the user

00:07:25,469 --> 00:07:33,539
and you just run temple and you can even

00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:36,539
issue your data coming from services you

00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:39,360
don't need to mess up with your fat you

00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:41,909
said before you can import one source

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,789
and that then sÃ©ances with an engine

00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:48,050
there is linking back you just have to

00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:48,050
find a common key

00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:56,520
and another cell plugins extremely

00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,580
useful it's called web services it

00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:02,460
turned the web interface in it went well

00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:05,479
it Bettis interface so you can interact

00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,479
with spitting

00:08:07,969 --> 00:08:17,539
yeah so what is that what we are set up

00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:20,599
at work we are exporting the new album

00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:23,479
from the earlier EMP database every

00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:26,289
night a bit of tweaking because it's

00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:29,989
it's a nice ambience ESP with its own

00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:34,069
it's easy to change and then we import

00:08:29,989 --> 00:08:37,459
them and with that injection could be

00:08:34,069 --> 00:08:40,879
pregnant to both sexes and it's done

00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:43,269
every night wizard for just a bit of

00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:43,269
sprinting

00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:51,340
and the main part of the screeching was

00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:54,070
in the export part to categorize well to

00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:57,510
command that is a service that is

00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:57,510
another because that is a cell phone

00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:07,210
also where is to use another software

00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:12,010
what you see Jonathan tory isn't as a

00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:14,200
software it's written in tell the agent

00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:20,710
is packaging through our only that

00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:25,230
Oh in almost all other UNIX I know to be

00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:28,960
honest step aside is she a penetrating

00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:33,220
but can also be linked it to other as

00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:36,820
its management it's a fog form another

00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:39,730
project called osseous inventory both

00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:42,190
most projects are mainly French I all

00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:45,090
says inventory was is every suit

00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:48,520
sponsored by the french surgeon damaged

00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:54,010
because they are using it manager

00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:57,850
exerted vision can be run as a service

00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:59,910
and waiting for course or you can run

00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:03,240
through chrome late night

00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:06,060
that's a reason decide yeah it has our

00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:09,660
own a lot of information also add when

00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:14,540
information what else details about the

00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:14,540
motherboard processor at risk memory

00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:23,160
software it goes through its can bring

00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:27,390
every team packaging stuff you need to

00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:29,199
test and a filter GOP are you can filter

00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:33,370
it because where you don't

00:10:29,199 --> 00:10:39,589
gotta leave SSH for cotton cultivation

00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:41,660
install on the 75 well after the

00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:47,180
software part is you stood for software

00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:49,850
well sense and whisper netted who has an

00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:56,079
effort on the computer with connecting

00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:59,149
now more useful carrasco for windows but

00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:05,170
you can run on all your needs now

00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:08,449
concedes genoise is it a window as

00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:12,380
communication between these agents is

00:11:08,449 --> 00:11:14,320
send the information in with the values

00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:17,590
initiative

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:23,470
so a secure part is not mandatory but

00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:26,530
recommended articles and there is a slow

00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:28,930
in the flying mode you can start the

00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:32,950
information you are gathered in the file

00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:37,030
and to can inject emulator environment

00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:40,120
we can be the school it's someone with

00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:42,010
them more so when the people who are

00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:49,000
researching the computers are not very

00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:51,550
techincal and you can linger it it's

00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,490
only bring back from this fisherman grp

00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:59,620
I you just have to specify what is

00:11:54,490 --> 00:12:01,810
primarily what is what elements is is it

00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:03,120
the same numbers it's also always say

00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:07,710
you know

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:11,839
I can choose several under out to

00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:11,839
determine if there is a

00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:14,810
item we spoke twice

00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:24,490
Travie clean database and future also

00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:27,369
can discover our user net discovering

00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:30,059
features unmet inventory feature it

00:12:27,369 --> 00:12:30,059
should be simple

00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:37,270
to discover on iphone network what is

00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:39,910
connected broken I

00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:44,770
the computer I always known it is a

00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:48,040
printer it is a switch there's a network

00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:50,820
access and you can gather the

00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:54,580
information and for printers you can its

00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:57,280
dependence of the manufacturer but you

00:12:54,580 --> 00:13:00,660
can also gather information about the

00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:05,220
consummation of failure can be useful

00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:05,220
many opening

00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:14,310
and forth or network the other or

00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:18,330
anything with available western energy

00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:23,820
for Cisco it's a lot of information you

00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:27,089
can really enjoy the glp fly but can't

00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:31,800
out for a switch which computer is

00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:34,050
connected to which I'm already busy and

00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:38,330
you are deployed future personally I

00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:41,279
never ended it's motivated for me

00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:46,500
and I know that it is using peer-to-peer

00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:49,100
to allow to faster downloading of the

00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,100
software

00:13:53,340 --> 00:14:03,240
and the Essex inventory is made through

00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:06,870
a TI o vmware api api and it's not

00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:11,040
a server within the inventory it's an

00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:12,810
agent with more honest services and the

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:17,700
server is sending message telling

00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:19,390
launching contributor the es6 cloud data

00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:23,720
types

00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:29,329
can and it gets of information about

00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:34,399
yeah it so much I don't know if you are

00:14:29,329 --> 00:14:40,310
using the other one me neither we're

00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:43,670
winning them and all this task of

00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:46,370
discovery and inventory are configured

00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:49,699
choose web interface and it can be

00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:50,510
launched you can resume one time because

00:14:49,699 --> 00:14:53,540
you know

00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:57,520
my way or you can scale them to be lunch

00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:57,520
every week every once every day

00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:08,710
thanks to as a team of us

00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:08,710
of posting i knows and fairies

00:15:08,859 --> 00:15:19,129
signs to Remy for his work thanks to

00:15:13,249 --> 00:15:21,069
ikea because i still first I can make

00:15:19,129 --> 00:15:24,129
you an email if you want because you're

00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:29,559
explaining it it's interesting that's

00:15:24,129 --> 00:15:33,759
showing its better and then scream so

00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:33,759
there is a demo on the website

00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:40,510
demonstration

00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:47,230
it's instance we are winning at work it

00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:47,230
is on an older version soon

00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:06,270
I am in French but the software can be

00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:10,230
translated almost every night is well

00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:12,720
worth translating in lot family because

00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:17,250
its most of the developer are French

00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:21,780
those men trees they can be some glitch

00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:25,050
in English version some transition so

00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:27,890
you are you arrive on the inventory part

00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,890
nice

00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:35,710
so here you have

00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:37,890
request waiting for to be closed or to

00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,890
be

00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,770
to be taken

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,410
and edgy for your group

00:16:48,269 --> 00:16:52,319
that's you of the same data

00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:04,399
the most interesting for me is inventory

00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:04,399
but what you have

00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:19,410
you can have a computer screen software

00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:22,190
network of the printers

00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:25,150
you can manage your

00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:28,220
constantly woeful printers as possible

00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:30,640
so computers is the most interesting

00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,640
about

00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:41,029
so yeah you have the base data they set

00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:46,090
of that house where is a computer who is

00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:49,960
using it was moderate is to manufacturer

00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:49,960
to say on the burner

00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:59,670
it's only those

00:17:53,500 --> 00:18:02,740
and you can go even to it's a

00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:04,870
motherboard processor you can be very

00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:08,020
seen oh you can tell its electron

00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:10,150
machine or physical one because your

00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:16,680
machine you don't really bother about

00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:16,680
other configuration you can ask

00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:24,899
you can also the only news you can see

00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:27,899
the bastion it's praised in Bastion

00:18:24,899 --> 00:18:27,899
software

00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:33,650
sighs moaning still under

00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:41,010
don't you can no

00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:44,370
f clinic when you have a computer you

00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:50,090
can connect it to a monitor onto our

00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:55,830
print out some other aware and IP phone

00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:59,520
so its oriented link added as its and

00:18:55,830 --> 00:19:02,000
you can when you declare but when

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:06,540
someone will declare of incidence which

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,700
you can choose well wedgwood so computer

00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:11,270
to a user so the other elements are

00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,270
limited

00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:24,540
yeah you're managing bath

00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:24,540
financial information

00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:33,230
come on number of me to pay when you get

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:36,820
one to expire that comes I don't know

00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:36,820
myself pretty nice start

00:19:46,669 --> 00:19:50,019
unless wishes for you

00:19:55,670 --> 00:20:01,950
yeah i forgot to speak about it there

00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:05,700
you can generate a report for your

00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:08,340
management a number of hardware bites

00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,980
your honor guards for the address bar

00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:12,000
true number of

00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:13,929
x

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,850
m

00:20:13,929 --> 00:20:20,169
integration thing before closing time

00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:23,860
for closings at dancing while I think I

00:20:20,169 --> 00:20:31,950
have makeup since nobody means drugs so

00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:31,950
I secure it for you taken your questions

00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:58,440
it's not set up yeah the future

00:20:54,700 --> 00:21:03,910
inventory is stored easily cinephile and

00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:10,660
gather yeah software information is a

00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:13,930
passionate users it's an extreme hotel

00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:18,160
you have to feel it a little machine to

00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:23,080
test or is it detect with what exists on

00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:26,050
your name further computers no you are

00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:27,850
not forced to feed it before we are at

00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:30,790
work we have done it because we already

00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:33,140
have them in hand to invest and we don't

00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:36,179
want to risk well

00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:40,020
remember everything manually so we are

00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:42,150
seated before but so if you install the

00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:45,150
agency agents through your uncivil

00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:48,600
policy it will gather this information

00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:55,020
with a comma you just have to be careful

00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:58,500
to not have items over choose the

00:21:55,020 --> 00:22:02,600
parameters for import what is the key

00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,600
for actual declare an item is unique

00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:09,420
Salem your father

00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:14,580
just for virtual machine can get tricky

00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:21,780
because there is no sale no address on

00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:25,040
your number as regent their vision agent

00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:25,040
can be run on memory

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:44,659
this beautiful I think we don't use it

00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:47,270
to resume we just inventories Alexander

00:22:44,659 --> 00:22:51,080
its virtualization that were under there

00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:54,220
too virtual machine this agent on it we

00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,220
don't use specific

00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:00,039
well as it is also written it don't fall

00:22:58,039 --> 00:23:04,789
for every manufacturer at work for dell

00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:07,519
and we can gather bring that information

00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:11,090
about going to france will construct our

00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:12,350
website that very convenient yeah it's

00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:17,870
very convenient but you don't work for

00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:21,190
every manufacturer perhaps just but it

00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:24,230
can be just adding one factor on the

00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:26,990
address to where the information is

00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:29,659
available it can be easy that sometimes

00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:32,450
i was spending tricky died which

00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:37,850
required an authentication or sensor

00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:40,010
games for it-- for HP it's a

00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:43,370
not very easy because you have to give a

00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:47,240
modern number and the serial number to

00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:51,770
have 12 information under more than one

00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:54,410
Burton how are you it's Chandra Valley

00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:58,309
when you buy a laptop in January wobbler

00:23:54,410 --> 00:24:00,799
as a number a model number under in

00:23:58,309 --> 00:24:05,110
August with your mother because they

00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:09,880
have changed it's not the same memory

00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:09,880
that kind of sleep okay

00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:23,780
yes I waiting for everything to no

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:28,760
hospital making to nowhere well as ever

00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:32,960
are in the work in 27 in the right we

00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:37,550
did this one it's like one base rear and

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:41,950
its history you in three new server it

00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:41,950
can be useful when you think

00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:48,620
yeah we can sell via my technician come

00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:53,990
we can just tell you it's a rock three

00:24:48,620 --> 00:25:04,160
silver a generic cut labelled on the

00:24:53,990 --> 00:25:09,890
servers I can tell em uzum em the season

00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:13,160
device is an interpreter interface for

00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:16,520
people with less right it's the same

00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:18,200
interface just less choices so don't see

00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:21,740
the choices they come back see then

00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:27,470
comes with the only different interface

00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:29,540
is for user can only submit they just

00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:31,679
have performed to submit requests and

00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:36,210
Caesar

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:36,210
get on to hold also in country bad

00:25:48,669 --> 00:25:51,419
