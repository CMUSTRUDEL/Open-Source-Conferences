that's good someone gets to see my big

00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:19,329
head staring at the screen okay so how

00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:23,810
many people attended my previous talk on

00:00:19,329 --> 00:00:26,929
contain a security excellent so this is

00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:30,500
the exact opposite this is totally

00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:32,480
turning the security on how many people

00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:37,850
here have played with project teutonic

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:39,019
we're talking post okay any so if you're

00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:41,089
following the development to the

00:00:39,019 --> 00:00:43,190
operating system or the quote what we're

00:00:41,089 --> 00:00:45,080
trying to do in the product ID project

00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:47,510
it's sort of build a new way of using

00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:49,400
operating systems and the goal here is

00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:51,110
to make an operating system that the

00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:54,409
only software you ever installed on it

00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:58,839
it's going to be containers in order to

00:00:54,409 --> 00:01:02,059
do that we need to allow containers to

00:00:58,839 --> 00:01:04,460
content to have applications in them

00:01:02,059 --> 00:01:06,470
that might manage the host of my

00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:08,270
advantage of the containers so we need

00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:10,729
in that case what we need to do build a

00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:13,610
container platform way to run containers

00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:16,660
in such a way that the container can

00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:19,100
break out of this containment so what

00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,990
I've been working contain a technology

00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:23,320
for many many

00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:24,970
yes lemmings guy from any 400 years of

00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:28,470
read that but I've also been using

00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:30,970
namespaces all the way back to l5 but or

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:34,049
Arthur or five-year statute of

00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:36,580
namespaces but may not so namespaces and

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:38,740
selinux and other types of confinement

00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:42,659
capabilities things like that are all

00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:45,720
things that we using to confine to

00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:48,220
define this thing is called a container

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:51,429
so for many many years with the use in

00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:53,770
this technology but most people weren't

00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:56,229
really didn't understand it until dr.

00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:58,240
camera and with the really interesting

00:01:56,229 --> 00:02:00,280
thing about darker is not so much the

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,740
containment that all the doctors really

00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,659
doing is taking advantage of stuff that

00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,490
linux kind of provides but the really

00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:09,880
cool thing they did is new packaging for

00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:11,620
so what we're looking for is so as we

00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:14,940
move forward I believe that people

00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:17,200
should start packaging software in

00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:19,930
high-level applications in the form of

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,239
contains all right so you your low level

00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,830
tool should still be built in rpms some

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,870
of that but you get to high level

00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:27,790
application sweets the attacker jealous

00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:29,280
up in Japan and we want to base and make

00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:33,360
containers new wave ship

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,860
system but in order to do that we say

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,870
we're going to do that we want to build

00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,450
platforms that are really optimized for

00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:41,970
running that but again we need more

00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:43,560
advanced applications so if I'm the only

00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,750
way I'm going to offer is inside of a

00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,000
container and now I have a host system

00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,489
that all i can do is run containers then

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,370
i have to get tantalise advanced system

00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:58,020
management type tools so actually this

00:02:53,370 --> 00:03:01,440
is a UNIX where containers i guess the i

00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:07,290
guess in china they decided that their

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:10,470
day to comea i guess not the jump jump

00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:12,870
the gun on a container technology is you

00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:16,019
so obviously no one in this room should

00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:18,720
tell DC Comics that I'm stealing their

00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:20,700
logos ok so talking so they just

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,630
standard containers are talking super

00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:27,900
contains so on time I coached I we don't

00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:29,880
have um install we want to make the

00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,620
atomic Coast minimal so we don't want it

00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,940
everybody the place with the time of

00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,010
coats the first time they get on there

00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,200
and they say this is awesome Drago's

00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:39,239
it's minimal install but what I really

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:43,890
need is I need this package install I

00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:46,049
need estrace I need ping I need n pages

00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:48,090
I need everybody gets on there in that

00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:50,280
and I get instantaneously frustrated cuz

00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:51,600
you know it's a minimal and stop so

00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,269
everybody wants a minimal install with

00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:58,890
just the air additional packages so

00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:00,209
what we really our goal is just to keep

00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:01,530
it as minimal as possible and if you

00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:05,040
need extra stuff you're going to skul

00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:08,219
containers so how do I administrate how

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:11,489
do I admin a machine without estrace gdb

00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:14,609
traceroute so really were as an admin

00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:15,569
now you can stand to look at you gotta

00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:18,120
stop thinking about the world

00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:20,370
differently so its container platform so

00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,009
this this machine a project atomic is

00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:26,509
not your desktop machine okay this is a

00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:28,380
pure server play up your cloud image

00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:31,020
environment it's not something that you

00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,940
want to run desktop one although I think

00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:36,900
someone's building a photonic based

00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:38,520
desktop platform customers want to

00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:43,050
install the favorite tools on a time of

00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:45,870
coast Tomic so the rule on the atomic

00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:47,880
team the atomic host team right now the

00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:51,060
rule is you have to if you want to get a

00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:53,130
piece of software into atomic post you

00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,979
have to prove that you can't do it

00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:57,599
inside of the table so you have to

00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:59,909
basically proved that you can't do it

00:04:57,599 --> 00:05:02,009
aside can can we put some stuff in the

00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:03,720
time of course we want to get out if we

00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:05,280
made mistakes for instance kuba nedick's

00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,980
we want to get kuba knows the hell out

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,840
of a comic post and make that run

00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:12,370
the only thing my end goal with rotana

00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:17,880
coast is the only thing you're going to

00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:22,570
get is the colonel systemd journal d and

00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:25,090
dr. okay getting rid of ssh demons a

00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:27,100
little bit difficult some other pack

00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,510
right now for instance Isis like if you

00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,610
want to run on syslog that comes in the

00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:32,140
form of the pan so really what we want

00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:36,280
to do is just get that thing down as

00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:37,810
minimal as possible so another problem

00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,420
state I want to ship an application that

00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:41,560
will manage the host so what happens if

00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:45,370
I want to manage the host operating

00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:50,920
system when a ship in application manage

00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:54,610
containers but we introduced about I

00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:56,680
think back in before Christmas this year

00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:58,270
we introduced the concept of superfoods

00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,010
containers so there is no such thing as

00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:02,620
a super privileged container I'm going

00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:05,170
to explain the concept anybody everybody

00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:07,120
India's played with dr. at some point do

00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:09,070
you know about dash dash privileged so

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,770
dashed as privileged just basically says

00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:13,900
turn off all security basically

00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:16,060
literally says route is root on the

00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:18,160
system but what it doesn't do is doesn't

00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,270
get rid of namespaces the super

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,090
privileged contain we're going to get

00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:23,380
rid of namespaces concept of it so it's

00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,540
really just a constant way to run

00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:28,180
certain types of containers svcs will

00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:29,620
manipulate the content on the host as we

00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:32,980
seize we use to manipulate other

00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:34,720
containers turn off the security first

00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:37,410
step to running super pillage containers

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,410
turn off the security

00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:54,840
go through that stuff though okay first

00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:58,800
time I did this talk it actually Twitter

00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:00,330
some people did go on to eat it so

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,979
promos contain you need to turn off the

00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:04,530
security so the way you do that in doc

00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:05,849
review Ron so I'm going to go through a

00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,770
whole bunch of command say it but

00:07:05,849 --> 00:07:09,599
basically in jockey you run dash dash

00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:12,060
privilege that turns off selinux turns

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,820
out the capability and it is said if you

00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:16,139
want to my previous talk we talked about

00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:17,430
read-only file system renown with

00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:19,770
Colonel file system talking about

00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:21,360
selinux we talked about capabilities we

00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:23,430
talked to the future of all set got all

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,080
that stuff user name space all gets

00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:30,930
turned off as something to do Josh

00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:35,789
Brookes but we still have we still have

00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:37,979
a problem that you have namespace

00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:40,830
separation so even though i turn off

00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:42,330
even around dr. dark darker privileges

00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:44,069
if i do a PS command i only see my

00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:45,810
processes I don't see all the other

00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:47,310
processing system i'm still in my

00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:51,060
network namespace oh I still don't have

00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:52,919
access to the network the real network

00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,560
on the host I don't have access to

00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:59,090
shared memory from post processes I

00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:01,580
don't have other accesses to the host

00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:04,940
so what we've been what red has been

00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:06,740
working with docker is contributing all

00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:09,560
sorts of things to turn off namespaces

00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:11,990
so you can do a doctor run now that's a

00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,280
genetical suppose and that says to share

00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:15,139
the network names basically with the

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,590
host operating system really assist

00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:21,110
don't really network names best dr. Ron

00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:24,410
I can c equals host says share the hosts

00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:28,910
IPC namespace for instance def jam em

00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:31,160
dep cumin of dollars toughest dr.

00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:34,640
Ron deaf deaf kid he goes host means

00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:36,050
don't give me a pic namespace so as soon

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:41,060
as I do this one I get to see all the

00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:43,219
processes on the system this next part

00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:44,690
so so that gets me too so I can do with

00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:46,520
these commands I can get to the point

00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,529
that the only thing i'm using inside of

00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:50,510
my containers the mountain namespace so

00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:52,880
I have my own version / user which I

00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:54,500
want because if I'm going to ship my own

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,510
software into the system I want to have

00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:59,450
my own operating since my own host

00:08:56,510 --> 00:09:01,730
operating system but I need to get

00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:04,010
access to the host operating systems the

00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:05,480
hosts file systems so we want to mount

00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:09,830
the hosts file systems into the

00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:11,510
container one of the things we I mean in

00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:14,060
all you don't have to do all these to do

00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,649
super close contains you do partial one

00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,689
so we're going to

00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:19,449
to the final community but if I just do

00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:22,180
a doctor run that be select run colon

00:09:19,449 --> 00:09:24,850
run that means mount the by mount the

00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:26,680
host / run into container as soon as I

00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:28,240
do that I'm able to interact if I do

00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:30,369
that with dashed as cruel as I'd be able

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,649
to interact with systemd I'd be able to

00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:35,259
interact with d-bus I'd be able to

00:09:32,649 --> 00:09:37,329
interact with darker so I could actually

00:09:35,259 --> 00:09:39,129
if i run a container like this i can

00:09:37,329 --> 00:09:42,610
actually start and stop dr. contains

00:09:39,129 --> 00:09:46,329
because anybody can talk to / run dr.

00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:49,089
Salk I can get access to it if i run dr

00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:52,300
run that feed them dev that means less

00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:53,559
share / dev into my container so we have

00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,480
one of the first super privileged

00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:57,579
containers we built was libera so in

00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:00,490
libvirt world we wanted to basically

00:09:57,579 --> 00:10:02,949
allow libvirt too much BMS but we didn't

00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:05,050
want to ship lib thread everybody knows

00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:07,420
what Libertas it's a tool we used to

00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:09,910
watch virtual machines we wanted to run

00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:11,740
libvirt on atomic host but we didn't

00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:13,329
want to have to add all the liberty and

00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:15,670
so we want to write liver in a container

00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:17,199
but we needed / death so that it could

00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:19,839
go out and create device notes and

00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:21,759
things like that I actually live very

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,399
also required the dash dash pit equals

00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:26,079
host and a few other additional features

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:29,019
but now you can run libera in that back

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:31,449
if you've looked at the cola project kol

00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:34,029
la that's an effort to contain arise all

00:10:31,449 --> 00:10:35,800
of OpenStack inside of docker containers

00:10:34,029 --> 00:10:38,510
I know it's require a few of those

00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,830
requests if approvals

00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:42,560
allows of container process communicate

00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:45,840
with you bus system there to cover that

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,820
so that the the sort of the granddaddy

00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:52,710
of them all is actually down kid like a

00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:55,920
run that's the / to / host we're doing

00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:57,690
so that basically says mouth entire root

00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,790
filesystem into the container that's

00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:02,220
also any any mount points under /

00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:04,740
basically is buying mounting / into the

00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:07,620
paint and we've basically said we're

00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:09,330
going to standardize us being project

00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:11,790
atomic that's the way you do this is /

00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:13,800
shows not only that will we're also

00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:16,440
setting environment we say you should

00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:18,090
set an environmental variable for doll

00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,010
sign post and a container to point to

00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:22,530
slide shows and then you could build

00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:24,510
your scripts to be able to run if the

00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:26,100
dollar host is in set on the native

00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:28,770
machine if it all goes to set the mood

00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:32,250
change basically go into a subdirectory

00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:33,930
when I show you that in a minute I'm

00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:36,030
cutting off the bottom of the screen and

00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:39,210
I can even standing up here i have a

00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:42,540
down see what this sure it's i'm sure

00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:44,190
its real interested in ok so its best

00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:47,370
right now if i do a demo and you have to

00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:50,480
walk around and i'll show you all what

00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:50,480
happens when you do all this stuff

00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:07,710
ok so here is a standing contain a

00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:12,230
fedora container okay I don't even have

00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:14,370
a PS command but basically you know ID

00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:16,890
one of the interesting things inside of

00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:18,960
containers is we actually like to se

00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:22,050
linux inside of the container telling it

00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:23,460
that selinux is disabled un oso emphasis

00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:25,830
is enable the reason we do that is to

00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:27,630
stop applications from trying to ask

00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:30,870
selinux activity it's not physically

00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:33,030
ready it's basically the stock tools

00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:34,080
from oh I'm not on selinux enable system

00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:36,510
that you should try to do something

00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:38,450
because it's going to block so this is

00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:40,830
actually I would never run this

00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:46,050
escalating system disabled if I go over

00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:47,640
here you see the same hoes it's

00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:52,190
enforcing its just laying inside the

00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:52,190
container but if i did a cat proc

00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:06,730
that's your cue the selinux label

00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:08,800
so that I want PS command we basically

00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:10,270
the show unity as you when it's late so

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,800
this is a fully can trying to contain

00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:14,130
them but now I'm going to do the same

00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,130
thing

00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:27,370
yep so I'm the personnel do you have yes

00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:35,790
lse well let's use a little history of

00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:39,000
Alexei so Alex C means different things

00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:43,050
to different people okay so galaxies and

00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,899
your definition means Alexei toolset as

00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:48,180
well by IBM be able to exceed containers

00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:52,010
lxc is also shorthand for release

00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:54,180
contains yeah so we're using it as

00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:57,389
interpretation diesel is perfect silence

00:13:54,180 --> 00:14:00,269
means that I also the lippert L exceeds

00:13:57,389 --> 00:14:04,170
the implementation of Lippert those

00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:05,880
little things so yeah if if I had a go

00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:07,560
back machine and I might eventually go

00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,180
back I'm going to call that container t

00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:12,269
he entered that all our crap all

00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:14,760
together after something that name was

00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:18,269
developed this policy was developed for

00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:21,930
liberabit running the old-fashioned bird

00:14:18,269 --> 00:14:23,370
sandbox okay so now we're going to go

00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:28,320
into a container and I'm going to do the

00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:32,639
same thing proc self at our current and

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:34,860
you see it's now running as SB CT ok so

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:38,220
you SBC t is basically on defined

00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:39,540
process but i'm still in a container

00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:42,000
environment so even though i'm

00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:44,310
privileged because they can't show it

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,670
then I PS running of it believe me

00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:46,670
there's a

00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:53,530
ok so there's only two processes into 10

00:14:49,540 --> 00:15:01,960
1 so i basically still have no access to

00:14:53,530 --> 00:15:06,900
the whole system so now if i do so if we

00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:06,900
start to do some of the good equals host

00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:15,300
and he proposed

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,300
i can c equals 0

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:21,240
and if I did that saying how Barack all

00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:23,550
of a sudden I start to see lots and lots

00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:26,550
of processes on my system I also don't

00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:27,740
think i have this config yeah but what's

00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,360
the IP

00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:31,160
his command side of the container but

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,860
basically i'm now using the host network

00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:37,160
so basically it turned off all of the

00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:39,650
namespaces networking space it turned

00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:41,630
off IPC namespace and i've turned up hid

00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:43,430
namespace so now have full access to the

00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:46,160
namespaces but i still don't have access

00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:50,200
to other pots the operating system but i

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:56,210
can start going further and dash b / run

00:15:50,200 --> 00:16:04,700
colon slash run that's be of dev the one

00:15:56,210 --> 00:16:08,150
/ dev inside the / black host and so

00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:10,660
here I am inside the container that's

00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:13,660
still no command but I can do to route /

00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,660
host

00:16:16,529 --> 00:16:21,879
instead of laying of the PSP why because

00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:24,069
I'm on the hook so they were reading

00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:25,809
project atomic blog I actually blogged

00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:29,739
about the security problem with allowing

00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:32,409
dr. to listen to to allow global use

00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:34,059
this to use docker sockets but basically

00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:38,049
this just shows I totally broke out of

00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:40,419
containment and now fully I'm confined T

00:16:38,049 --> 00:16:41,739
on post and I can do anything I want so

00:16:40,419 --> 00:16:44,470
it's kind of interesting you know so

00:16:41,739 --> 00:16:46,899
this is all the stuff is is the idea of

00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:48,369
a super Povich container if I went and

00:16:46,899 --> 00:16:52,599
looked back into the container and I

00:16:48,369 --> 00:16:58,689
look dead / dev and I'd see those files

00:16:52,599 --> 00:17:00,099
and if i look at sit / host / dub see

00:16:58,689 --> 00:17:02,409
the same long does a different command

00:17:00,099 --> 00:17:05,339
but basically see that but also notice

00:17:02,409 --> 00:17:05,339
that suddenly

00:17:06,169 --> 00:17:10,789
that's the ilanic started to work okay

00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:12,769
because it basically I turned because

00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:15,039
i'm a super privileged container i'm now

00:17:12,769 --> 00:17:18,769
started to tell selinux you are enabled

00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:20,659
to start to see as you like stuff so you

00:17:18,769 --> 00:17:23,809
can start to do relabeling fixed labels

00:17:20,659 --> 00:17:30,909
or anything you want to so let's go back

00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:30,909
to presentation okay

00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:35,440
so who wants to type all that stuff

00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:41,710
every single time you write it right

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:43,270
entertain all right I certainly don't so

00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:44,920
there's a fundamental one of the

00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:47,110
fundamental problems with Dockers we get

00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:49,210
to these more advanced environments as

00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:52,420
you start to get more and more complex

00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:54,700
command lines so one of the things we've

00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:56,410
looked at with dog I guess I'll continue

00:17:54,700 --> 00:18:03,460
the presentation rather than jumping

00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:05,020
ahead so when we looked at and we wanted

00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:06,790
to build some new tooling to make this

00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:10,810
easier but one of the things we talked

00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:12,760
about when you go into a container and I

00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:15,430
don't know if it's a fedora tools image

00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:19,480
editor probably should be especially

00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:22,000
after what I about to say when you get

00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,620
onto atomic host right I talked to

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,540
earlier about doing estrace and things

00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:27,970
like that you really need access to

00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:29,920
these tools that's praise GD be sought

00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:31,810
and relevant relevant versions we needed

00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:34,060
sauce report we don't even have main

00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:35,350
pages so you can't even say man dhaka to

00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,550
figure out how to run the doctor to me

00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:39,160
as well here

00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:40,870
japan but we've added is a tools image

00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,940
or the tools image is actually a great

00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:45,220
big container image that brings all this

00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:48,580
stuff really is sort of the admin shell

00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:50,710
that's the way I would think about it so

00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:52,900
we bring the package of a whole big ton

00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:54,280
of of what you would expect and we bring

00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:56,110
it down to the host and then you could

00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,790
go into the container or in a super

00:18:56,110 --> 00:19:01,860
privileged mode and also in your video

00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:04,300
man pages you've got your other contests

00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:07,270
in order to do this we want to introduce

00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:08,980
a new command so we didn't want to just

00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:10,300
continue working with just the docket

00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:12,820
command we want to introduce the brand

00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:14,620
new command called the tonic and I'm

00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:16,030
going to explain some of the goals at

00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,740
the time but basically what you can do

00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:19,750
with atomic we should we do atomic level

00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,070
tools shell and all sudden it's going to

00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:24,160
pull down the relative basically do a

00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:25,810
doctor dr. pol pull down the rel tools

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:29,470
containers you're going to be in super

00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:31,750
privileged mode will show you live in

00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:35,020
second the lodging running containers in

00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:37,930
super privileged mode and to run rel

00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:41,790
tools image if you do at romak run at

00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:47,830
hsbc well tools bin shell it will run

00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:48,970
last ok nothing more you know when we

00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:50,860
first started out with this it was

00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:52,840
nothing more than basically a huge alias

00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:55,630
to say hey if I execute this commandment

00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:57,790
then put all the super privileged stuff

00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:59,500
into the container they were doing some

00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:01,490
other weird stuff like making sure the

00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:07,220
local times either contain

00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:09,620
typos we also add some name stuff we

00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:11,660
also do something by default in atomic

00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:13,880
shell is basically we're going to build

00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:16,610
a container here pull it down to the

00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:18,410
system and then we leave that container

00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:19,610
around so you can do a young updating

00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:21,950
side of this container yum install

00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:23,300
inside this container add content and

00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:24,530
every time you run the atomic command

00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:27,020
you're going to enter me into that

00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:29,090
container so that container becomes sort

00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:33,590
of a permanent way that you can continue

00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:36,470
to do your updates in the system so we

00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:38,330
also wanted atomic we want an atomic to

00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:41,110
be the only command that you would need

00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:44,240
to execute new management of the tongue

00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:46,940
sonic coast obviously you can do docker

00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:50,210
as well but we wanted to also wrap our

00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:51,679
copy MOS street dance so when if you

00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:54,679
play with the project a time if you have

00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,880
to do things like you know move to the

00:20:54,679 --> 00:21:00,350
next version and reboot the machine

00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:02,000
atomic post reboot time and close to get

00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:05,929
there so it's like how many how often I

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,630
use the tacos but basically the tools to

00:21:05,929 --> 00:21:11,720
to manage poetry book manage your host

00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:14,450
operating system up move it up and back

00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:16,070
to version so huh just gone with this

00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:18,860
Hut so you can do a tonic coast upgrade

00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:20,300
time post hole back and Tomiko status to

00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,730
basically switch back and forth between

00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:26,110
different versions

00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:28,720
Tata coast so promise a my application

00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:30,700
is nicely rolled into a container how do

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,950
I tell a user to run it this is one of

00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:35,380
the fundamental things we found wrong

00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:37,690
with docker images we want docker

00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:40,270
container immature and now it's called

00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:41,950
open container an image format to be the

00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:44,860
default way that everybody ships

00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:47,710
applications the problem right now is

00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:49,990
everybody has to ship an image in a

00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:51,760
description or page somewhere that

00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:53,260
describes how to install the image how

00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,510
to run the image what is the command

00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:57,010
line what what benefits so you have to

00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:58,720
go to two different sites to get

00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:00,850
information about how to run an

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,730
application so if I build a big

00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:05,980
application like IPA or a big

00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:07,510
application like OpenStack we have to go

00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:09,490
out to these random sites and say oh you

00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:11,830
want to download this this and this the

00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:13,420
developer of the tool cannot build

00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:16,510
something into the container image that

00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:18,790
tells basically instructs how to run his

00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:21,010
application another way to look at is we

00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:23,380
play with our p.m. right now darker does

00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:25,930
not have post install scripts for our

00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:28,300
p.m. all right so we wanted to build the

00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:31,840
concept either way to do a post install

00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:34,720
or install an application my application

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:38,980
runs mostly confined but needs one

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:42,220
additional privileged free IPA was

00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:44,050
building an ntp demon container and only

00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:45,370
thing then totally locked down but the

00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:48,100
only thing he needed to assist tagged

00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:49,299
with ntpd has changed system time it

00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,489
could run

00:22:49,299 --> 00:22:53,980
with everything else locked down but he

00:22:51,489 --> 00:22:56,470
needed to do that if he just puts out a

00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:58,119
ntpd container you just download it and

00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:59,860
run it it's going to blow up out of the

00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:01,570
box so anytime you do a doctor run and

00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:04,419
that's going to blow up unless you run

00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:06,639
with the cap add sits tight so as a

00:23:04,419 --> 00:23:08,320
developer I want to somehow specify in

00:23:06,639 --> 00:23:10,929
the container that the way you run this

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:13,629
application is by specifying so we

00:23:10,929 --> 00:23:16,360
worked a long time this is password

00:23:13,629 --> 00:23:18,850
difficult sublime to get in a way to add

00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:21,399
image data to the JSON file associated

00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:23,559
with the yogurt container image so we

00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:25,929
added a label patch of God talk of that

00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:30,100
finally add a label patch and developers

00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:31,690
can add the content image JSON data but

00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:34,299
one of the fields we've added is the

00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:36,070
label run so what you can do is you can

00:23:34,299 --> 00:23:38,609
put basically put an image data into

00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:42,970
JSON files that doc I run that's the

00:23:38,609 --> 00:23:46,080
ntpd container and then cap as to say

00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:48,850
admin and then we quit keyword image

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,340
what we can do with the atomic man when

00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:53,019
it sees image like this it will

00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:56,590
substitute the image that you run so if

00:23:53,019 --> 00:23:59,019
you say a tonic Ron ntpd it will change

00:23:56,590 --> 00:24:00,879
the image word is say MTP date we've

00:23:59,019 --> 00:24:03,330
added a few extra field since then and

00:24:00,879 --> 00:24:08,270
actually now it's dollar image button

00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:10,470
the idea so now to run if the ntpd

00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:12,840
container is built you run it with your

00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:14,580
topic run command it will go into the

00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:16,800
JSON trial associate will pull the image

00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:18,420
down you're going to the JSON file of

00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,950
the image figure out with the doctor run

00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:21,720
the label run command isn't that

00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:23,820
executes the label run for executing the

00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:26,160
command this container will work

00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:27,870
perfectly fine with darker and you can

00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,220
go in pull the image and you can go look

00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:31,170
at the label and it will tell you how to

00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:32,520
how to run it but you would have to run

00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:35,220
it manually all we've done is wrapped

00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:37,850
wrap the ability to look inside the

00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:40,050
container for your powers going wrong so

00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:41,670
let's look at containers differently

00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:43,880
container image is a new way of shipping

00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:46,080
applications we want to look at images

00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,970
software delivery mechanism to talk to

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,880
Ellie I package them a jboss application

00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:54,210
a docker image move to a repository and

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:57,810
then what at that point that's where to

00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:59,940
me everybody stops it's like okay here's

00:24:57,810 --> 00:25:02,040
my image go to my website and it will

00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:03,570
have 15 pages of description how to

00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:06,750
install anybody have a look at the

00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:08,820
installing OpenStack it is a freaking

00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:10,910
disaster it's like page after page after

00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:14,640
page of things you have to do anything

00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:16,050
huh yeah well I mean what did there's

00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,700
been like 10 different installation

00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:19,530
procedures of it but if you look at the

00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,660
way packs that's getting easier but if

00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:23,190
you look at colanow and what Cole is

00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:25,440
going to become it's going to be a

00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:28,040
single command and talk what I want it

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,360
to be as atomic install OpenStack and

00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:32,310
then it comes up and comes to give you

00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,780
come up to you and say how many versions

00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:35,610
of glance do you need how many versions

00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:37,710
of this do you need it'll just go out to

00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:39,840
KU benetti's and configure the whole

00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:41,000
thing I want to provide I don't want to

00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,650
do that

00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:51,210
I just like to call with ideas I want

00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:54,750
someone else yes I'm all about Tom

00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:56,820
Sawyer and the fence okay how does it

00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:58,950
how does custom install it how do i

00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:01,310
configure in Iran must width where is

00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:03,630
the config and weird install scripts go

00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:06,150
so we want to embed the installation

00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:08,010
procedure within the container image so

00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:10,440
we also added a label called label

00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:12,510
install so if you do an atomic installer

00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:15,630
to read this line I can do a dr. Ron

00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:17,190
privileged view the spc finance and

00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:18,240
actually run an install script from the

00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:20,580
side of the container that knows about

00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,680
/host and will actually put out the

00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:25,290
system to unify to set up to run length

00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:27,900
container it'll go out and do also its

00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:29,760
configuration data you might prompt the

00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:31,590
user for commands things like that so

00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,540
this is not we're not building up any

00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:35,610
high-level tools here always saying is

00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:37,110
is the command that I would instruct it

00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:38,790
use it right and I can embed my

00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:41,670
installation script right into the

00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:43,830
entertainment and then our products that

00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:45,630
need an uninstall people when i remove

00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:48,060
the application this does not mean the

00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:49,410
application has to be an SBC application

00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:51,510
just means when i'm doing the install

00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:53,540
and uninstall i required privilege just

00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:56,070
like when you're running an RPM in style

00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:58,230
patchy day you brown RPM install of

00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:59,550
apache you goes out and does privileged

00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:01,530
stuff on the system but when you run

00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:03,450
apache it doesn't require purpose run

00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:05,970
firefox or something like that so the

00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:07,650
idea is we can put built-in super

00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:09,630
privileged container activity for

00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:11,130
uninstall and understall you don't

00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:14,750
necessarily need super privileged

00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:14,750
container functionality for

00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:22,730
so we also came up with concept meta

00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:24,860
container images so we have an idea of

00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:26,510
something really complex like free IPA

00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:27,500
where it has ten different services

00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:30,380
running right we want to get to this

00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:33,580
microservices environment we have you

00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:39,500
know free IPA is made up of Kerberos

00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:43,130
ldap cert certain manager probably two

00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:45,260
or three other applications we really

00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:49,340
don't want again to go to the page of

00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:52,220
install our I mean right now free IPA

00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:53,600
has a full install script so I pulled an

00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:56,630
install script do I have to rewrite that

00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:59,240
to use containers how can I build build

00:27:56,630 --> 00:28:02,000
it directly into the tank so I envision

00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:04,789
that will have a atomic install hi PA

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,320
all I got free IPA and all that's in the

00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:10,580
free IPA image is the install procedure

00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,289
right and it comes down and it's going

00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:15,020
to prompt the user say how do i do

00:28:12,289 --> 00:28:17,659
certain things how do I you know install

00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:19,309
it all right and then the IPA can go out

00:28:17,659 --> 00:28:21,020
and show you the install waves precedes

00:28:19,309 --> 00:28:24,980
you can figure out is a coup benetti's

00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:27,260
available okay install I need a replica

00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:29,210
server kerberos slave servers running on

00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:32,330
these IPAs I need all that stuff and

00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:33,830
then I've already mentioned OpenStack so

00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:36,860
there's been a big effort to make all of

00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:39,320
OpenStack inside akola have these labels

00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:41,419
so that the you can start to automate

00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:43,460
the installation so again right now

00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:47,409
Kohler is actually made up of 10

00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:49,870
different or containers your glance Nova

00:28:47,409 --> 00:28:52,000
libera

00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:53,320
all those tools are but we want to get

00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,700
to the point that instead of doing

00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,950
instead of having to go out and get the

00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:58,240
packs tax script all you have to do you

00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:59,800
don't have to pull down anything onto

00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,260
the sheet all you have to say is atomic

00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:04,750
install OpenStack and it's going to

00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:06,520
download the method container image and

00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:10,870
that meant to contain image is going to

00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:12,670
start to prompt you to install stuff I'm

00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:15,700
not going to be covering Nuala Kuehl a

00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:18,280
newly cules goal is to get into a new

00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:21,010
way of defining these applications

00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:23,980
inside of the atomic application side of

00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:26,800
the atomic man aside the image so what

00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:29,410
might end up being these containers is a

00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:31,840
new low fuel specification so imagine

00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:34,240
that you get this newly fuel which would

00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,940
now my team is trying to rewrite it all

00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,260
and go as a static binary so now the new

00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:40,179
look you becomes it's not relevant

00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:42,160
offered or it's not anything from dual

00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:43,690
fuel application he comes down with the

00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:46,059
definition of how to install an

00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:48,190
application and then that thing goes out

00:29:46,059 --> 00:29:50,140
and pulls down additional containers

00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:51,670
onto the system or tell scuba nedick's

00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:54,130
to go out

00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:55,270
hangs onto the system so you start to

00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:57,970
build it again you're building an

00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:59,560
application a distributed application

00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:01,420
suite here and we're trying to make it

00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:03,520
as simple as humanly possible for an

00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:10,630
administrator to do this Khloe groans

00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:17,410
that pull up Kol LA and then yeah so in

00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:22,930
Boston was I Kohler okay who's a tonic

00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:25,770
ton would say yeah only old people in

00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:25,770
pasta the same time

00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:33,130
we've switched on you always switch to

00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:36,250
soda blast people don't understand in

00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:38,710
Boston when a word ends at ER you make

00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:42,160
it sound like a when it ends in a you

00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:49,030
make it sound like yeah so dakka dakka

00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:51,130
dakka his soda so now I'm going to

00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:54,390
demonstrate project with tonic I don't

00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:54,390
think I'm prepared for this but

00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:02,850
questions let's see if I can do this I

00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:02,850
mean okay so

00:31:05,789 --> 00:31:12,409
Anakin killed my name hopefully my set

00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:12,409
so here we have

00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:17,870
so one of the things I can do here is I

00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:19,430
can actually create my contains all

00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:21,290
sorts of labels in that this is a

00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:23,240
standard docker file it's not there's no

00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:26,150
special force no special packages

00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:28,520
without ya we also use labels for

00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:29,960
identifying resolved there's no

00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,810
information in a container right now to

00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:34,880
tell you what to name the applications

00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:36,710
it's not built into a gauge on crops and

00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,040
how we've added ability for us to say

00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:43,460
it's Apaches version 10 at least that a

00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:45,290
the vendor it's red hat with a licensing

00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:46,760
but we can basically put any screen we

00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:48,620
watching here we have a we have a

00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:50,030
document that we're trying to work we're

00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:51,830
working with that core OS and other

00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:53,930
people just sort of standardized for

00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:58,790
some of these basic labels our primary

00:31:53,930 --> 00:32:00,560
labels out and but basic so what this is

00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:02,540
going to theoretically if this works and

00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:06,350
I think tested before hand it's going to

00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:09,290
install a patchy server onto the system

00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:14,830
and it should set it up with a unified

00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:14,830
system to unify and let's see

00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:19,870
so I do a darker build

00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:41,530
perc should pretty priest ages now let's

00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:42,700
let's as this bill to anybody have any

00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:47,690
questions will jump ahead to the

00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:50,350
question section nothing

00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:53,059
because all think this is awesome so

00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:57,669
sanity I was talking to about issues i

00:32:53,059 --> 00:32:57,669
went into the doctor bill burr

00:33:00,509 --> 00:33:05,510
Miami your face yeah there's no like

00:33:04,139 --> 00:33:08,110
gases produced

00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:08,110
it was red

00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:14,760
is a doctor right now refuses to screw

00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:17,610
around darker build anymore there is a

00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:21,110
new tool called a Quran that's an

00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:21,110
experimental stage right now

00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:31,460
is why you don't do these live um all

00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:36,380
right you guys are gonna we're gonna

00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:38,960
leave this as an example for young needs

00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:42,530
to be day to be enough a difference it's

00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:45,010
something about it no I think DF every

00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:45,010
day to work

00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,740
I think they think this is related to

00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:57,630
the network network so yeah anyways

00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:59,310
trust me it works another bang people

00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:00,840
there you go out to do with atomic pull

00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:03,480
of rel tools you'll see all this stuff

00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:06,030
you could good basic go back and play

00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:07,380
with the atomic petronicus kind it's

00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:08,610
really kind of cool and what we're

00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,169
looking to do is add an additional

00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:12,450
commands they talked about earlier was

00:34:10,169 --> 00:34:13,950
going into talking skin which atomic

00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:16,970
scan will pull down scanning container

00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:19,470
run in your system actually expand from

00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:22,770
we want to stop to build out I can

00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:25,070
actually show you some other so I did it

00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:25,070
Sonic

00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,860
so right now we have the tonic post

00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:39,659
which I explained info basically shows

00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:42,030
you the labels install saying that

00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:44,129
image you list all the images when the

00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:45,839
interesting things here when we get to

00:34:44,129 --> 00:34:47,280
skin and we want to be able to mount a

00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:49,470
docket container without running the

00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,419
docket container minot docket has no way

00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:53,190
of doing that so we've done is we've

00:34:51,419 --> 00:34:54,679
built cooling to be able to mount up

00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:56,819
images without actually running

00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:58,589
containers so that we can examine and

00:34:56,819 --> 00:35:02,670
look at the images to see it what kind

00:34:58,589 --> 00:35:06,359
of content content they have these are

00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:08,700
all obvious we also added upload now

00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:10,140
upload upload is probably get changed to

00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,789
push because it does it pretty much what

00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:13,619
dr. push does except it allows you to

00:35:11,789 --> 00:35:15,900
push the satellite server it also

00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:17,099
logically push the pulp service but we

00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:19,049
want to use something other than dr.

00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:21,420
register you so you can pan is that that

00:35:19,049 --> 00:35:24,170
atomic verifies kind of an interesting

00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:26,280
tool in that it's looking at the labels

00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:28,289
imagine you have a container on your

00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:30,589
system that's MongoDB based on top of

00:35:28,289 --> 00:35:34,500
all seven on the DB based on top of elf

00:35:30,589 --> 00:35:36,539
top of fedora if Dora starts taking

00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:39,690
advantage of these labels I think we

00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:42,690
have we want to start incrementing the

00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:44,970
releases so we'd have Fedora 23 at least

00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:47,400
12 / 23

00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:50,760
three now I build an application on top

00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:53,820
of the door 23 days to and have a whole

00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:55,859
application suite on my machine when

00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:59,599
thomas becker verified will do is look

00:35:55,859 --> 00:36:02,760
at the application item stalled and mike

00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:04,830
post and will say oh you're ever get an

00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:07,830
application is based on fedora 23 got

00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:10,440
one i noticed a little fedora 23 dot

00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:12,690
seven available I want to rebuild a

00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:14,130
doctor doesn't that necessary to tell

00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:16,530
you the security vulnerability but just

00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:18,150
tells in the fodor's is like five new

00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:20,130
versions of the same image say we're

00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:23,849
using that you're actually applications

00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:25,920
based on so you think rebuilding so tell

00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:27,330
you that a tox scan is the one that's

00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,830
going to come in and actually boots with

00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:31,170
us carry the skin to look at the

00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:33,420
retainer see if you're susceptible to

00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:34,920
the ECB es or you have that

00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:40,320
configuration there are two password

00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:41,530
file is so those are all like all the

00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,440
commands that are available for

00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:47,610
time going back I've jumped off the dock

00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:52,440
our build problem dr. build right now

00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:56,040
does not support any type of

00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:59,000
so here inside

00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,000
to do special things

00:37:01,009 --> 00:37:06,139
you can build a container using dr.

00:37:03,749 --> 00:37:06,139
commit

00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:10,200
we also other

00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:18,839
y'all wanna play with us conceived

00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:23,309
let me give you a couple of SPC's that

00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:25,290
right now fix them so what happens if

00:37:23,309 --> 00:37:28,260
you have an SBC that's going to load a

00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:30,359
kernel modules a lot more than the

00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:33,059
colonel amount of time so right now we

00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:34,740
can do that with an spc but what happens

00:37:33,059 --> 00:37:36,599
if that kernel module is required to

00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:38,400
configure the network that darker needs

00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:44,010
to learn to run pronounced if I have to

00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:45,510
install a container before doctors so

00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:49,319
all of our containers right doctors

00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:52,230
basically tried darker corporation wants

00:37:49,319 --> 00:37:54,780
the darker demon to be central to the

00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:57,410
existence of containers I think it's a

00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:57,410
colossal mistake

00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:03,970
so we're trying to do is work with Daka

00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:05,830
to break the path that dr. Tenzo to the

00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:07,930
announcement earlier this summer who are

00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:09,970
around over container for maps of docket

00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:13,270
that no longer controls container for

00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:15,460
those mainly to get 40 West's and dr.

00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:18,030
anybody we don't I end up with we don't

00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:18,030
want to end up with

00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:24,250
two different corners that

00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:31,230
consolidate on one container format

00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:33,490
extraction relation of the fact that

00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:35,700
that's going to happen can't be under

00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:38,160
control of uncommon

00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:40,550
basically open container format basis I

00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,550
think not

00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:50,190
to specify what

00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:52,800
another thing to dr. spun-off is a thing

00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:55,050
called run c 1 c is a little tool that

00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,820
it allows you to run containers but it

00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:59,520
didn't spend linden split off it's the

00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:01,200
thing go gracias RAF driver though if i

00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:05,520
install a container image is going to be

00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:08,580
based on top us on my overlay FS place

00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:10,920
mapper gutter FS when i install the

00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:12,750
image installed and that's called a

00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:14,640
graph drive so where that content gets

00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:17,070
installed that's called the graph driver

00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:20,490
so right now there's no way to take a

00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:22,520
Tanner image mounted up someone so you

00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:24,960
can do it other than using the doctor

00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:26,670
but we're working real hard right now to

00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:29,640
get a proof of concept of the graph

00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:31,410
driving separately if we get graft

00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:33,420
arrival how the darker now we could

00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:35,940
build consistently union file that would

00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:37,680
execute the graph dr malcolm container

00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:39,630
and then you run saved run container

00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:43,269
super-focused container without ever

00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:45,380
have using the garbage what you do

00:39:43,269 --> 00:39:48,200
that's one of one

00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:50,940
gulps going forward is to get grassy

00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:52,730
grassy Intel into the open

00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:57,890
and I think we have a good chance or

00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:57,890
darker but likes my ideas much

00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:02,100
but then what we're starting we're

00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:03,810
trying to do is get the dog Athena now

00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:07,050
to have all these little other libraries

00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:12,630
of the level function costs that low

00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:15,060
level we're also trying to get lots of

00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:18,090
system the concert the systemd controls

00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:21,210
into doctor when I went to drop the

00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:23,340
crops in 99 is the document existed so

00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:26,130
I'm actually going systemd contribute to

00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:29,850
a talk called dr. Iverson systemd and I

00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:31,290
talked about on both sides or love time

00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:39,400
in the middle of the two sides fighting

00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:42,819
all the time yes feels like doctors

00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:44,549
one process per per container but one

00:40:42,819 --> 00:40:46,529
service

00:40:44,549 --> 00:40:50,249
hey what's up you to my classes was I

00:40:46,529 --> 00:40:52,170
had advanced runs five processes so it's

00:40:50,249 --> 00:40:55,939
one so microsoft the idea of

00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:58,979
microservices service bar container in

00:40:55,939 --> 00:41:00,179
that should be in what is full yeah but

00:40:58,979 --> 00:41:02,069
the problem is everybody's not going to

00:41:00,179 --> 00:41:04,709
get there very quickly yeah everybody

00:41:02,069 --> 00:41:07,589
the runs multi-service containers right

00:41:04,709 --> 00:41:09,179
now the problem is it's not a good tool

00:41:07,589 --> 00:41:10,650
for doing down so it's been a tool

00:41:09,179 --> 00:41:14,029
called supervisor d that's been a

00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:14,029
different multiple service

00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:20,380
there is a great tool for the Nats call

00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:23,200
system day because that's its Chuck the

00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:25,150
other kind of communication problem is

00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,030
that the bunch of did not endorse us to

00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:29,999
be brilliant

00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:33,019
da da

00:41:29,999 --> 00:41:33,019
they have excuse that

00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:43,900
so what I've been trying to do is get

00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:45,940
dr. to adopt sister to a doctor thought

00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:48,480
that dr. functions makes us to be work

00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:48,480
well inside

00:41:48,549 --> 00:41:51,900
it's a considerable

00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:58,910
trying real hard to block over

00:41:56,290 --> 00:42:01,020
this white and all I shouldn't say much

00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:03,740
more

00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:08,390
working out

00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:15,190
and of course we live in gdi+ just

00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:15,190
amusing in containers rough credits

00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:29,320
yeah i know that i know that is not

00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:31,530
today I know there's an atomic desktop

00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:35,860
after going on if you looked at what

00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:39,480
Alex Lawson is doing with XP GF he

00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:39,480
hasn't asked about that one

00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:46,180
that's what I transferred

00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:47,740
quite a lot of heavy pieces he actually

00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:51,130
got out Alex and I work together

00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:53,710
originally on and you would have to work

00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:55,990
on as I did that bad spec does not use

00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:58,010
docker doesn't that feel

00:42:55,990 --> 00:43:02,299
using a different flag but it's actually

00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:05,679
using African coast a strange well

00:43:02,299 --> 00:43:07,939
the SDG&E app is xdd app is a container

00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:11,059
format that's being developed we're on

00:43:07,939 --> 00:43:15,799
desktop applications sandbox

00:43:11,059 --> 00:43:18,529
applications take a look at this guy

00:43:15,799 --> 00:43:21,349
it's kind of neat sometime in the future

00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:24,069
you might be run Firefox and open office

00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:28,059
and other tools all afternoon in my

00:43:24,069 --> 00:43:31,010
glorious vision of the world

00:43:28,059 --> 00:43:33,020
android house

00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:35,240
I don't know that I don't know if that's

00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:38,770
really possible but it

00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,770
there's all the chromium

00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:44,430
right while notifying the Firefox that

00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:47,590
the latest firefox vulnerabilities also

00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:50,020
that what what the SDG app would allow

00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:52,120
you to do is basically take the open you

00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:53,770
put open inside of Firefox instead of it

00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:55,780
actually going out on open files on the

00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:58,220
desk he would send a signal to the

00:43:55,780 --> 00:44:00,310
desktop saying hey I mean

00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:03,670
the desktop and open

00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:05,339
browser go select a file the desktop

00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:07,440
which campus

00:44:05,339 --> 00:44:09,930
firefox and now firefox will have no

00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,210
access to anything other than project

00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:14,190
inside its container and the desktop we

00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:16,950
stay completely different than our

00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:19,140
firefox that i want to save content we

00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:24,630
go to file browser outside but think

00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:28,539
about think about applications the other

00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:30,519
use cases no virtual desktop

00:44:28,539 --> 00:44:32,030
multiple processes from it's not

00:44:30,519 --> 00:44:34,640
specific

00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:35,810
does every so the things things about

00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:38,180
running system be inside of the

00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:42,410
container was about five fundamental

00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:46,040
things of we look at my I haven't asked

00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:48,410
a cash so I gotta run dash in a

00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:50,360
vehicle system yeah cast evasion it

00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:53,650
fixes those five fundamental things and

00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:53,650
consistently decide

00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:07,320
autocad rakaji separately his doctor in

00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:09,180
your passenger doctor basically wants me

00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:10,619
to do it totally on the l they want to

00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:12,960
basically cut a command line that looks

00:45:10,619 --> 00:45:15,600
like a nice to see cumin to do it but

00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:17,130
there's a fundamental problems so doctor

00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:19,110
right now is trying to implement

00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:21,900
everything required to run system need

00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:23,940
as individual community so for instance

00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:26,340
they run system deep side of intangible

00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:29,250
/ run is the temp effects you have to

00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:32,030
have attained a uuid inside a container

00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:32,030
specified

00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:40,079
you need to have dialogue journal yeah

00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:43,620
uid now if you've been to the container

00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:46,800
because you want to see contest

00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:49,260
different and so they wanted to register

00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:54,390
machine so you have to have machine

00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:56,450
control registry machine so that it was

00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:58,470
like five things that have to be done

00:45:56,450 --> 00:46:01,770
the problems of the chicken-and-egg

00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:04,740
system is just fine i curated containing

00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:08,349
uid desperate my daugher inside of the

00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:12,390
cake I need that value

00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:12,390
right now so doctors say no

00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:18,300
the message I was like doctors

00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,690
willing to work with you guys

00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:28,310
and some of our responses

00:46:30,779 --> 00:46:34,759
slowly McDonald s

00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:43,710
that's one yet defining is lip container

00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:46,560
which a man is an open source project

00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:49,450
now actually so that's still control by

00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:52,130
dr. but they're more responsive

00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:54,449
translate

00:46:52,130 --> 00:46:56,549
Dargo needed one of the big problems to

00:46:54,449 --> 00:46:59,939
the doctor even two is that its client

00:46:56,549 --> 00:47:02,309
server so if you manage system deep

00:46:59,939 --> 00:47:04,349
service inside of a container that's

00:47:02,309 --> 00:47:05,550
running dr. run there's most people to

00:47:04,349 --> 00:47:08,400
read

00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:10,440
that dr. ron was not in child when the

00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:14,200
reptile consistently stretch out the

00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:16,780
doctor so the flying programs

00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:18,760
it communicates with the back so Hugo

00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:22,349
incidences when the unified say I want

00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:22,349
to have this secret life

00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:26,750
10 yeah

00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:26,750
you're applying

00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,760
watch

00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:39,250
but we've been working like something

00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:41,320
wrong last year and a half

00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:44,350
showing too much frustration so a tonic
