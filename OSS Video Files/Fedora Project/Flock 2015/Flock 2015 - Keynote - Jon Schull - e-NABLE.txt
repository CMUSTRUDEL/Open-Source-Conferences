okay Wow okay cool thank you so much for

00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:16,830
getting up in the morning hello ok so

00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:23,760
I'm Jon Schull I have to cool titles I

00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:28,019
am research scientist in magic do this

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:31,080
all right I have two titles and two

00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:32,969
voices research scientist in magic

00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,800
that's as you probably know RIT Center

00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:39,710
for Media Arts games interaction and

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:46,170
creativity and I am founder of enable

00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:49,140
the story I will focus on today our

00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:51,030
friends at Red Hat actually did a movie

00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,770
which is ruined my presentation because

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,260
it does a good job of telling our story

00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,360
so i thought i would pay tribute to them

00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,250
even though it didn't occur to me i

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,440
should plug in audio but i think it will

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:05,149
play all right and it's short so we'll

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,149
start with that if we can

00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:16,040
we made children smile we make parents

00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:19,580
week and we make nerds rejoice and any

00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,409
of those is actually a real bed people

00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:26,470
to do all three all at once which is

00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:26,470
what usually happens is huge

00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:38,330
the whole enable thing was a let's just

00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:40,210
see what happens and open source turned

00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:44,470
out to be TCS

00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:44,470
when I first walked into this lab

00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:57,250
so looking down at this

00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:05,549
says so I was born without

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:11,509
self-consciousness with a hand like this

00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:11,509
and my dad I designed this thing we pray

00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,569
our mission here is to make these

00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:59,939
designs available to anyone anywhere

00:02:36,569 --> 00:03:01,319
to provide access to those ideas what

00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:04,049
we're trying to do is we're trying to

00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:07,700
almost like fast pace what you would

00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:07,700
originally do is research and available

00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:17,650
how do you make that idea happen or even

00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:23,939
better 27 design talked to Katie

00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:26,799
together with Tory child and Mexico

00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:31,469
starting from his existing prosthesis

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,469
that was given to us in September

00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:50,439
that was all possible because of the

00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:52,900
technologies and the philosophies that

00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:56,400
allow good idea is to go around the

00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,400
world have the speed of light

00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:11,390
so that's applause for red hat but did

00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,860
such a great job on the video I have to

00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:18,019
say that's the first of at this point

00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:19,730
about four or five videos comparable

00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:21,620
length they have a longer version of

00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:22,970
this comparable quality that just tell

00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:27,110
this story this has become something

00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:28,850
about an international movement and I

00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:31,490
want to tell you about some particular

00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:35,180
aspects of this for two reasons I think

00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:37,010
it's one of the best stories ever and we

00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:39,080
need you and I think they're all sorts

00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:41,120
of interesting opportunities book for

00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:45,169
education as well as for open source

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,610
development so one of the things so also

00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:48,680
i'll give you the creation myth because

00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:52,190
because i like to and it's actually my

00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:54,050
major contribution here was just kicking

00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:55,940
this thing off and then running as fast

00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:58,400
as i could to keep up with the snowball

00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:00,440
a two and a half years ago I saw a

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,870
youtube video in which a South African

00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,610
carpenter reported that after a shop

00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:07,550
accident where he accidentally cut the

00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:09,950
fingers off one hand he was shocked to

00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:12,350
learn that partial hand of pro species

00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:15,080
are incredibly expensive and hard to

00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:19,160
come by and he did what you and I would

00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:21,410
do which is he googled his way to a

00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:24,140
Washington state puppet maker who had

00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:26,150
made a huge mechanical hand that was

00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,790
controlled by pulling strings connected

00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:30,140
to the

00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:32,910
annika fingers as a puppet for a b-movie

00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:34,800
and they spent a year collaborating and

00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:37,440
they came up with a simple mechanical

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,150
hand and he mentioned in this video that

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,830
he discovered that this hand would not

00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:44,640
only be useful for people like him but

00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:47,130
for children who are born the surprising

00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,450
frequency 1 in 2,000 kids formed with

00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:50,850
some kind of an upper limb abnormalities

00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:54,590
some of them with the equivalent of

00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:56,730
having no figures but having a palm and

00:05:54,590 --> 00:06:01,560
then he was putting the design on the

00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:05,130
internet and this gave me an idea and I

00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:08,550
engaged in a quick hack I made a google

00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:10,290
map mashup and I put a comment on the

00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:12,180
YouTube video now you guys know the

00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:14,520
YouTube video comments are the most

00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:16,890
demoralizing literary genre and the

00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,840
history of human literature and yet in

00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:20,910
this case there were a number that said

00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,910
what this guy the carpenter is doing is

00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:27,600
great I would do that so I added my own

00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:31,170
comment that said if you have a 3d

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:33,390
printer and you want to help or if you

00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:36,470
know someone who needs a hand put

00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:39,120
yourself on this map and within 60 days

00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:41,190
there were seven depends on the map and

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,170
people started calling me saying okay

00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:46,740
now what do we do and of course I had no

00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:49,020
idea so we created a Google+ community

00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:51,300
and it's been growing and that's sort of

00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:55,170
how it all happened I'd like to say I

00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:57,240
was dodging preparation of a course when

00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:59,430
I made this matchup and put this this

00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,530
thing it's sort of like being pregnant

00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:02,370
in a 40 minutes of self-indulgence the

00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:05,250
next thing you know you're responsible

00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:07,800
for all these children and so here we

00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:12,000
are now among the interesting features

00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:14,580
of this story is the explosion of design

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,810
work that's being done in a truly open

00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:21,330
source fashion by everyone from nine

00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:23,210
year old kids to some of the best

00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:26,960
engineers in the

00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:29,900
I end people in between like for example

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,870
the famous paragen author who you saw in

00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:35,030
the video who is visiting the disease

00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:38,900
he's going to start college here in the

00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:43,190
region any day now and he's wearing

00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:45,500
actually the Talon hand which he has

00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:48,919
been designing with his dad who you saw

00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:51,830
in the video and he's one of our leading

00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:55,180
critics of all of our designs and so

00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:55,180
it's become a really interesting

00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:02,449
collaborative community I this is the

00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:04,009
original I'm pointing at my screen which

00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:08,150
you can't see that picture to the right

00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:12,410
is the original plus one robohand snap

00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:14,630
together design crude but you can see

00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:16,639
the basic mechanism is apparent there

00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:19,340
there are two components one that fits

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:22,099
here one that fits here when again the

00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:26,120
wrist strings that can take vic connect

00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:28,729
them are pulled and that causes the

00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,860
fingers as my trusty assistant will

00:08:28,729 --> 00:08:34,849
demonstrate yet again to contract when

00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:36,229
you ban your wrist you make a fist as i

00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:39,579
like to say those little kids and

00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:42,709
grown-ups alike within months a

00:08:39,579 --> 00:08:45,829
university professor from nebraska

00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:48,260
designed these cyborgs beasts the name

00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:49,940
for which was proposed by his son and it

00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:52,160
has become one of our classics you can

00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,329
see it's got its got better lines but

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:58,279
you can also see that it has a fair

00:08:53,329 --> 00:09:00,380
amount of hardware but in fact a variety

00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:02,899
of designs proliferated including the

00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:05,930
talent hand the cyber beasts as i

00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:08,270
mentioned and in some great digital gene

00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:10,430
pool they started to produce hybrids

00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:14,770
like for example the talon beast which

00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:14,770
combines some of the features of both

00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:24,259
so these designs are coming however not

00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:29,269
just from university professors who did

00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:32,360
the cyber beasts French teachers who

00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:35,089
made the Talon ham but also this one

00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:37,639
weighed by Greg Denison who's an HVAC an

00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:40,399
air conditioner installer who learned

00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:42,740
how to do 3d printing and design from

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,360
another dad who learned how to do 3d

00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:47,209
printing and designed to make a hand for

00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:50,540
his son this kid is named Luke Denison

00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:52,370
and Luke and his dad together realized

00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,870
that in order to hold the things that

00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:56,170
really matter in life it would be really

00:09:53,870 --> 00:10:00,290
helpful to have a hand with two thumbs

00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:01,759
see that so this is the Luke hand and

00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:07,269
this kid is now known around the world

00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:09,620
as cool hand luke and at a conference in

00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:11,600
September last september's at Johns

00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:13,819
Hopkins Luke was walking around with a

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,399
napkin and he ran up and he said I've

00:10:13,819 --> 00:10:18,589
designed a new hand it's called the b2b

00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,089
design and get some diagram that I still

00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:21,889
not sure I understood why are you

00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:25,250
calling that he said because it sounds

00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:27,920
really cool but indeed they did

00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:30,709
eventually make a clam shape I guess

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,949
that's the V a clam shake hand which has

00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:35,680
an even better grip and that's sort of

00:10:33,949 --> 00:10:39,019
what of one of the examples of

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:42,529
recipients based design here's another

00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:44,300
one Towey his arm ends here and while we

00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:46,970
were telling him all about how we were

00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:49,339
building an arm that would work the way

00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:52,300
our hands do he said wait a minute I'll

00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:54,860
just put this on my arm which ends here

00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:57,500
so that was one innovation and indeed

00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:59,600
that's what he wears and when asked what

00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,520
color he wants his hand he said could it

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,490
blow in the door

00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:07,100
good idea right so that's the tully han

00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:08,960
he's a double innovator this is Derek

00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:11,000
who was mentioned earlier when I was

00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,920
explaining to Derek that we were trying

00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,260
to develop his arm and that we needed a

00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,210
test pilot and that that means that

00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:20,390
nothing would work but he we need him to

00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:22,070
tell us about it he picked up two of

00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:24,980
these prototypes he put them into him

00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:26,690
and he said could my arm be this long so

00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,190
the Derek arm allows him to pick things

00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:30,350
up off the floor and reach higher

00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:35,090
shelves and the rest of his classmates

00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:37,460
and he's the coolest kid in the class we

00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:41,450
also have three year old marketing

00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:44,930
geniuses this kid received a orange and

00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:46,460
red hand for Christmas in Hawaii and

00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:48,410
while he may have been born without

00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:50,600
fingers he was born with one of the best

00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:53,000
smiles in human history and they caught

00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:57,170
him at a moment when he said look I got

00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:59,630
an Ironman hand within weeks our

00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:02,360
community was churning out iron man

00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:05,390
hands Wolverine hands Teenage Mutant

00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:09,260
Ninja Turtle hands and as a matter of

00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:11,210
fact this poor kid walked out of a movie

00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:14,210
theater to be greeted by a bunch of star

00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:16,100
wars clone warrior the impersonators

00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:18,740
this is a whole subculture I'm not aware

00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:23,600
of but they approved a star worn theme

00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:27,370
star wars-themed arm so this whole thing

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,370
is sort of getting out of hand

00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:35,350
but it's not just the the community and

00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:37,600
it's not just the functionality it's

00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:40,330
really about the way this changes the

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,430
relationship of the individual recipient

00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:44,590
to their body and the way it changes the

00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:47,590
relationship the individual recipient to

00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:49,330
their environment this is this

00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:52,090
particular kid is holding up his hand

00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:54,280
and in the videos a little long but he's

00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:56,980
is a really great job as i mom porn with

00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:59,650
a funny hand I you know gonna do special

00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:01,960
things to pull fake but then he just

00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:03,970
articulated something that we've we've

00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:06,820
heard a lot but never quite as well as

00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:09,610
as he says if he says he said you know

00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:12,340
now this is six weeks before he's gotten

00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:13,990
in the device he says I'm counting the

00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:18,100
days until Christmas when i'm going to

00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:20,380
get my new hand but you know he says i

00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:23,110
have bad dreams and in these dreams and

00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:26,520
monsters are coming after me and it's

00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:29,800
scary but now i say you don't scare me

00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:31,600
because i have two hands and this is six

00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,990
weeks before he's gotten the device

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:37,210
parents tell us that their kids are more

00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:42,250
confident their kids are treated with

00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:45,340
envy by other kids we had a mother right

00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:47,560
and saying I was sort of skeptical

00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:51,870
because you know as Peregrine will tell

00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:54,670
you you can do almost everything with

00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:56,080
missing fingers and kids were born with

00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:58,000
this don't even realize there's a

00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:00,160
problem until they get older and it

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,600
becomes awkward with their peers is that

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,210
it's always a little skeptical about it

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,280
but but Billy wanted this and we were in

00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:09,580
the park the day after and not for the

00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:12,190
first time a kid came up and said how

00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:14,560
come your hand is fine and Billy said I

00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:17,430
have a special hand and if you want i'll

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,630
show you my new special robot hand and

00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:21,850
by the time they were done playing in

00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:23,920
the park the other kid said you are so

00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:25,100
lucky so it really just sort of changes

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,250
the social dynamic

00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:30,980
a really interesting way but it's a mega

00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:33,740
social dynamic as well because

00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:35,780
Nathaniel's hand was made by these girls

00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:38,420
in a Catholic High School who learned

00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:41,690
about open source technology and learned

00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:44,020
about 3d printing and if you look at

00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:44,020
their faces

00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:54,980
if you look at their hello I'm going to

00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,980
do something about them

00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:02,980
if you look at their faces you can see

00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:04,570
that they haven't just learned about

00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:07,360
technology they've also learned about

00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:12,400
what technology is good for and what it

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:14,320
is would be involved in this good

00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,000
thinking well the trick is I will do

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:22,440
that but I think it will pop up anyway

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,440
but we'll find out it and we shall see

00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:32,020
okay and it's so there are about 40

00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:34,630
classrooms around the country that have

00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:37,270
taken this on now and then there are Boy

00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:40,570
Scout troops that have taken this on and

00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:42,490
here you see a group in Baltimore which

00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:44,500
is meant about I don't know what dozen

00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:47,530
times now they get to whip together for

00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:49,450
weekend and Apple losses in which they

00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:54,280
receive hands that are printed by all of

00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:56,320
our volunteers and they assemble them in

00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:58,330
sort of a great big assembly party and

00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,160
in this in the case of the event where

00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:02,610
these pictures were taken up the hands

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:07,230
were then shipped to a hospital in

00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:09,910
northern Israel where they were

00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:11,830
evaluating them for use with Israeli

00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:13,810
children and with Syrian conflict

00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:17,080
victims who were smuggled across the

00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:19,360
border by the Israeli army because they

00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:21,910
needed help and about a month ago we

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:28,270
actually heard about their first case of

00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:30,850
a kid who had lost his hand while sorry

00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:34,570
thank you lost his hand will help

00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:36,520
protecting his mother and they said we

00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:39,139
gave him an enable arm and within a week

00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:41,779
he was on his motorbike riding home now

00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:44,059
totally sanguine about that aspects of

00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:47,119
that story but the point is it's become

00:16:44,059 --> 00:16:49,459
a multinational multi-religious I said

00:16:47,119 --> 00:16:51,649
boy scouts multi gender I said boy

00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:54,739
scouts but included Girl Scouts it

00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:59,689
included Catholic boy scouts Jewish boy

00:16:54,739 --> 00:17:01,279
scouts Islamic boy scouts and frontier

00:16:59,689 --> 00:17:04,250
Scouts which i think is the name for the

00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:05,990
other girl scouting group and the next

00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,760
time we do this kind of thing at the

00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:10,279
next level we hope to have these kids

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:13,819
teamed up with Scouts who are after all

00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:16,399
positioned all over the world in order

00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:24,380
to collaborate and to do this kind of

00:17:16,399 --> 00:17:26,089
thing together so it's a thing and I'm

00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:29,450
actually most proud of the fact that I

00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:32,269
sort of nailed it when I put up that

00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:34,610
initial google map I said this is and

00:17:32,269 --> 00:17:36,500
this was a lie but it was it was a good

00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:38,149
minimally Viable Product right it was

00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,820
that they was a prototype I said it is a

00:17:38,149 --> 00:17:42,500
global volunteer assistive technology

00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:44,990
network built on an infrastructure of

00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:47,510
electronic communications 3d printing

00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:49,789
and goodwill and if you put those three

00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:52,970
things together and I think it needs all

00:17:49,789 --> 00:17:57,110
three at this point I can say we have

00:17:52,970 --> 00:18:01,039
proven that as you all have known for

00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:03,919
quite some time that there are thousands

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:06,370
probably tens to hundreds of thousands

00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:10,580
of people who are ready willing and able

00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:14,269
to donate time and expertise in order to

00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:17,299
help other people because it's just the

00:18:14,269 --> 00:18:20,120
coolest thing ever and because it makes

00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:23,179
a really big difference so this is that

00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:25,730
conference at Johns Hopkins where and

00:18:23,179 --> 00:18:28,250
there you can see Peregrine and his dad

00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:31,039
as well as Greg Denison and Luke as well

00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:32,960
as a prosthetics manufacturer and a

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,750
trauma surgeon who's coming back within

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,870
weeks from his voluntary tour of duty in

00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:41,779
Africa he's a trauma surgeon he

00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:45,169
developed brain controlled super duper

00:18:41,779 --> 00:18:48,500
prosthetic arms and he's become a big

00:18:45,169 --> 00:18:50,059
supporter of ours that conference turns

00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,830
out to have been a real turning point in

00:18:50,059 --> 00:18:54,139
the prosthetics industry we brought

00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:56,389
together prosthetists as well as printer

00:18:54,139 --> 00:18:58,250
makers as well as parents as well as

00:18:56,389 --> 00:19:00,769
children as well as enable volunteers

00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:03,919
and media and we taught them all how to

00:19:00,769 --> 00:19:06,139
do and how to download the files that we

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,669
were making freely available those

00:19:06,139 --> 00:19:09,500
constituencies had never been in the

00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:11,120
same room together and they learned a

00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,950
huge amount from each other and everyone

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,080
said it was the coolest thing ever and

00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:18,260
I'm here to tell you that we're doing it

00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:21,169
again on October 24th in seattle

00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:24,230
washington which is also going to

00:19:21,169 --> 00:19:27,470
include the just-announced enable

00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:30,399
education exchange the 30 some

00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:33,830
classrooms that have adopted this as a

00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:39,409
stem and steam learning project along

00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:41,929
with another 50 school's classrooms and

00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:43,610
at utopia type organizations that are

00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:46,639
interested in this are now going to

00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:48,710
begin weekly online hangouts that we're

00:19:46,639 --> 00:19:51,440
going to organize and start contributing

00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:53,690
their course material into an online

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,029
repository and we're going to start

00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:58,820
trying to make it possible for mere

00:19:56,029 --> 00:20:01,370
mortal educators not just the heroes

00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:03,320
like you who will get up early in the

00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:05,659
morning and figure out how to do

00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:08,000
everything make it easier for classes to

00:20:05,659 --> 00:20:10,399
adopt what is already becoming one of

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:16,370
the go to stem steam and service

00:20:10,399 --> 00:20:18,860
learning technology projects around we

00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:20,720
are looking for sponsorships corporate

00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:25,580
and academic sponsorships and we're

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:28,340
looking for other offers of support and

00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:31,309
participation our operators are waiting

00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:35,179
for your call the point is it's become a

00:20:31,309 --> 00:20:37,220
pretty complicated ecology here there is

00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:39,620
now not only a community these numbers

00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:43,730
are not quite up to date of fifty eight

00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:46,159
hundred volunteers and three staff and

00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:48,139
may I say three staff the 5800

00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:51,710
volunteers is a problem that won't be

00:20:48,139 --> 00:20:55,010
solved by having more volunteers so we

00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:58,940
are seeking to raise money in order to

00:20:55,010 --> 00:21:01,010
bring a few more staff on hand but it

00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:03,409
continues if you want to get on the

00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:07,549
inside and just see this in action join

00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:09,619

00:21:07,549 --> 00:21:11,750
that when i made this slide we had two

00:21:09,619 --> 00:21:12,320
thousand and two members wasn't that

00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,669
long

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:19,269
less than a year ago now we're up to

00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:21,440
5800 it's a really interesting place

00:21:19,269 --> 00:21:24,279
you're familiar with this kind of thing

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,299
but somehow the google plus social

00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:29,750
environment with the pictures and the

00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:31,700
videos and the stories from all of these

00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:34,789
diverse contributors to the community

00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:37,639
make it just a fascinating and visually

00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:40,549
interesting online community and it's

00:21:37,639 --> 00:21:44,539
truly an open source community we are

00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:47,330
documenting as much as we can but as you

00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:51,350
know we always need help documenting the

00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:53,240
designs creating the designs and trying

00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:55,909
to understand where we fit within the

00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:59,570
general open source ecology it seems to

00:21:55,909 --> 00:22:02,090
me that we sort of won the open trifecta

00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:04,220
here right we're doing open source but

00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:08,210
we're also open in the sense of

00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:11,090
transparent everything that we do is is

00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:12,799
exposed to the world and by the way I'm

00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:15,049
about to argue that it's a really

00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,970
interesting laboratory for studying the

00:22:15,049 --> 00:22:22,389
kind of thing that we all this room are

00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:22,389
fascinated with namely an open community

00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:27,740
but in fact there's some interesting

00:22:25,639 --> 00:22:32,600
theoretical and legal work still to be

00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:34,940
done our members are using open-source

00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:37,669
licenses and Creative Commons licenses

00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:40,220
but the dirty little not so secret is

00:22:37,669 --> 00:22:42,590
that hardware is different from software

00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:45,710
and so license is created for soft grand

00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:50,690
for documents don't probably really

00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:52,519
protect hardware as one would hope just

00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:54,470
to give you one example it's not at all

00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:56,750
clear that there's any license that's in

00:22:54,470 --> 00:23:01,480
common use today which will prevent you

00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:04,100
from taking a novel design of an object

00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:06,740
scanning the object not using the design

00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:09,700
files and then rebuilding those parts

00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:13,330
from the mesh that the scan produced

00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:17,980
and that escapes the licenses so we are

00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:19,840
working with a law firm which and our

00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:21,610
liaison there is mark radcliffe to help

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:25,480
write the GPL three point out and we're

00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:27,940
just now initiating a project to try to

00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,620
develop open source hardware licenses

00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:32,100
that will work for us and perhaps for

00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:35,260
the hardware community modeled on the

00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:37,860
Creative Commons framework and we are

00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:40,419
not experts at this so some of you will

00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:42,070
understand these issues and be able to

00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:44,380
help us pull together the right people

00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:46,330
to figure out whether for example the

00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:48,820
same set of options that Creative

00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:50,230
Commons offers are the same set of the

00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:56,320
right options for us to offer to

00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:57,730
designers of all kinds of devices I want

00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,610
to take a few minutes and just say to

00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:02,409
all of you software types that there are

00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:06,070
some really interesting opportunities

00:24:02,409 --> 00:24:09,610
this evolutionary tree here was

00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:13,659
handcrafted by moi it took a long time

00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:16,120
and it's frankly terribly up to date if

00:24:13,659 --> 00:24:18,010
it were to be extended to the out of

00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:20,500
date is what I meant to say it were to

00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:23,019
be extended to the present roughly

00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:25,899
speaking it would reach to that corner

00:24:23,019 --> 00:24:28,120
and I'm going to guess the middle of the

00:24:25,899 --> 00:24:31,090
room the design proliferation has

00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:33,070
continued in this visual diagram which

00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:35,620
you're familiar with in

00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:37,659
in the open source software world turns

00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:40,330
out to be really useful there are

00:24:37,659 --> 00:24:42,549
designs knocking about it's not like

00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:44,769
everyone is using github for this we

00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:48,370
have Thingiverse we have you imagined we

00:24:44,769 --> 00:24:50,409
have cubify etc etc and it gets very

00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:52,269
hard for someone who gets a design to

00:24:50,409 --> 00:24:55,090
know where it stands in the in the

00:24:52,269 --> 00:24:56,830
evolutionary tree and whether it's the

00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:59,259
latest version and for that matter

00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:03,490
whether it's been superseded by some

00:24:59,259 --> 00:25:05,230
other interesting version now if you

00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:07,269
look at the bottom right you can see the

00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:10,149
thing of us which is the most common of

00:25:07,269 --> 00:25:13,870
these repositories has a remixed from

00:25:10,149 --> 00:25:15,759
tag associated with all of the designs

00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:17,740
that are available there and you guys

00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:19,809
will recognize that if I have a node in

00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:22,500
the graph and I know the parent of that

00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:27,090
node I can reconstruct the entire graph

00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:30,129
there is a really cool real-time dynamic

00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:32,830
visualization and data scraping

00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:35,169
opportunity for someone who wants to

00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:37,750
pull that information together and turn

00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:40,570
this not only into a map but also a user

00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:42,399
interface for finding your way to the

00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:44,830
appropriate design and documentation so

00:25:42,399 --> 00:25:47,559
that before you invest what will be 20

00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:48,759
hours of your time for inter time and

00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:51,580
your tongue and making one of these

00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:54,250
devices you're sure you're making the

00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:55,870
one you want to make or you're sure that

00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:57,789
there's an opportunity for you to make a

00:25:55,870 --> 00:26:01,179
new one which is to say that some of you

00:25:57,789 --> 00:26:04,840
how many of you do 3d design all right

00:26:01,179 --> 00:26:07,419
not so few okay well some of those

00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,679
should immediately join the enable

00:26:07,419 --> 00:26:11,370
community because there's plenty of

00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:11,370
opportunity

00:26:14,659 --> 00:26:20,450
so the community there you go has as I

00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:22,519
have said several times because I can't

00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:27,619
get over it just continued to grow like

00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:29,359
Topsy I there are any day now 6,000

00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:31,580
members and each of them probably has

00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:33,769
I'm guessing here I don't know new

00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:39,169
opportunities to do analytics on our

00:26:33,769 --> 00:26:42,139
community 30,000 hosts each post with a

00:26:39,169 --> 00:26:44,869
picture for the comment with a with a

00:26:42,139 --> 00:26:47,570
description and then with a thread of

00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:49,669
comments on it and Google+ gives you no

00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:53,830
particular way of navigating that it is

00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:57,470
a haystack of a stack of needles um

00:26:53,830 --> 00:27:01,729
here's an idea if you think about it

00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:03,139
each row in that graph represents one

00:27:01,729 --> 00:27:05,559
person from the moment they came on

00:27:03,139 --> 00:27:09,200
board all the way up to the present time

00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:12,309
if every moment of their activity

00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:16,039
produced a little pixel under the curve

00:27:12,309 --> 00:27:18,409
then this texture here would actually be

00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:22,009
a guide to activity day by day by day

00:27:18,409 --> 00:27:23,720
for the entire population furthermore if

00:27:22,009 --> 00:27:27,789
you were to mouse over the relevant

00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:30,649
pixel you might get a preview of what

00:27:27,789 --> 00:27:33,619
you could read if you click on the pixel

00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:35,299
and actually drill down into bed if you

00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:37,789
had some clever color coding you could

00:27:35,299 --> 00:27:39,470
begin to see that there were groups who

00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:43,099
were involved in certain conversations

00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:45,049
and it would become a really interesting

00:27:43,099 --> 00:27:50,499
forest and a really interesting

00:27:45,049 --> 00:27:53,210
navigational tool for exploiting what is

00:27:50,499 --> 00:27:56,749
frankly I happen to bleed a sort of

00:27:53,210 --> 00:28:00,590
historic petri dish of interesting and

00:27:56,749 --> 00:28:04,929
evolving open-source ideas prosthetic

00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:04,929
ideas social ideas etc

00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:13,330
similarly you could use the same data

00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:16,350
for social network analysis which is

00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:19,900
just the obvious thing to do and yet

00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:23,230
hasn't been done because Google has an

00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:26,559
exposed the API for private communities

00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:29,950
which is a tragedy but true I wrote a

00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:34,990
splinter script in Python which will go

00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:37,000
and click on every damn post read the

00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:38,740
data off the screen and could in

00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,960
principle capture at all and then do a

00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:42,220
visualization like this but my days of

00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,880
being able to actually complete a

00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:48,490
project like that seem to have passed so

00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:50,460
I'm calling out to you all and I will

00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:54,100
point out that in addition to the usual

00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:56,230
rat's nest of social network analyses

00:28:54,100 --> 00:29:01,410
there are some really interesting ideas

00:28:56,230 --> 00:29:05,530
here this one there you go this is from

00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:08,020
three DJ s and that guy whose name i

00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:10,860
forgot produced this wonderful

00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:14,320
visualization which shows for example

00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:17,799
every person and every person and if

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:20,470
they're part of the same node they've

00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:22,330
become a dot and then it automatically

00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:25,360
and dynamically sorts the rows and

00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:28,120
columns of the columns the patterns and

00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:30,400
the clumps jump out at you this would be

00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:32,950
really useful if which he didn't do

00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,660
again you could click and say what is

00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:38,850
this cluster what are they talking about

00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:38,850
okay I want to drill down into that

00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:45,070
software engineering social engineering

00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,460
information engineering big

00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:50,279
opportunities we don't have

00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:54,679
people flocking a little joke they're

00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:57,360
flocking to our community in order to

00:29:54,679 --> 00:29:59,190
solve those kinds of problems but as you

00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,679
can see those are great problems and

00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:05,279
they will really enhance the more

00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:07,140
general effort here's one more bit of

00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:09,750
bait I want to dangle in front of this

00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:11,309
particular community like everyone and

00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:14,250
their brother we too are thinking about

00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:17,850
badging and how it might end

00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:19,409
gamification although I I would like to

00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:21,720
be able to call this recognitions

00:30:19,409 --> 00:30:24,200
because it seems to me it's not just

00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:26,370
about giving somebody a gold star when

00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:28,289
you probably understand this but we're

00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:30,450
still thinking it through when you see a

00:30:28,289 --> 00:30:32,460
military person or a scalp with a bunch

00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:34,649
of badges on his chest you basically see

00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:36,990
the resume right there you know what

00:30:34,649 --> 00:30:41,399
particular topics this person would be a

00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:43,620
good helper and collaborator on in

00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:46,799
Google+ which happens to be for the

00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:49,020
moment where we live we've got we

00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:52,399
everyone has a round avatar next to them

00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:55,529
whenever they do anything so we propose

00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:58,649
that we can imagine at around the edge

00:30:55,529 --> 00:31:02,760
of the circle the circular avatar would

00:30:58,649 --> 00:31:04,710
be little clock positions and each

00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:07,399
position would represent a different

00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:09,870
part a different kind of achievement and

00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:12,210
as you can see this guy seems to have

00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:16,020
invested heavily in two particular kinds

00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:18,390
of activities and he's earned in this

00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:21,120
fictional example he's earned three

00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:25,590
levels in both of them and our idea is

00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:27,750
that someone someone could write simple

00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:32,029
program that would download somebody's

00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:35,820
avatar add a ring when they acquired a a

00:31:32,029 --> 00:31:38,520
merit badge and invite them or

00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:40,380
automatically update their avatar to

00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,730
show as one other piece of the puzzle

00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:44,100
which is sort of interesting because as

00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:45,130
per as per the fact that we don't have

00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:47,080
the staff to manage

00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:49,450
this kind of thing or to develop the

00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:51,640
software in full we'd like to allow the

00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:53,680
community to build this thing out and so

00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:56,080
the half-baked idea that I will share

00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:57,790
with you is that in fact the one o'clock

00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,700
position on the clock has to do with

00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:03,310
introducing yourself to the community

00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:05,200
the let's say minutes six on the clock

00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:10,090
has to do with welcoming a member of the

00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:11,800
community the second ring of menace five

00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:14,430
would have to do with updating your

00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:16,980
avatar because you've got a medal for

00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:20,470
introducing yourself to the community

00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:27,340
down near the bottom or in this case I

00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:29,520
say let's say in minute 35 would be a

00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:35,410
serious advantages for things like

00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:37,630
proposing a new badge like getting 20 or

00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:42,000
more votes and majority of which are in

00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:44,740
favor of adopting advantage for actually

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,400
identifying the validation criteria for

00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:52,330
the package and I would like to think

00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:54,580
that some five or six notions like that

00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:57,100
would be sufficient to create a machine

00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:58,990
that would then encourage and allow the

00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:02,170
community to start inventing and

00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:06,070
ratifying all of their own merit badges

00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:07,720
on their own because in fact one of the

00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:09,280
biggest challenges we have and I know

00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:12,400
you all are quite familiar with this

00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:16,029
problem is you know the expression

00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:18,039
herding cats all right but

00:33:16,029 --> 00:33:20,200
do you think that herding cats is our

00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:22,779
try putting cats in charge of the herd

00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:26,080
right we have a new enable Community

00:33:22,779 --> 00:33:29,219
Foundation whose mission one of his

00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:31,479
missions is carefully described as

00:33:29,219 --> 00:33:34,809
helping the community sell for

00:33:31,479 --> 00:33:38,139
difference right the volunteerism of

00:33:34,809 --> 00:33:39,999
what you and we do is really an

00:33:38,139 --> 00:33:42,519
important part of the miracle of what

00:33:39,999 --> 00:33:46,899
we're doing so we don't want to suck the

00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:50,139
life of that out of that however if I

00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:52,809
may there are a thousand people waiting

00:33:50,139 --> 00:33:54,519
for an able hands this at this time we

00:33:52,809 --> 00:33:58,179
have fifty eight hundred volunteers and

00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:59,950
we haven't made it easy enough rewarding

00:33:58,179 --> 00:34:02,379
enough or straightforward enough for

00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:05,259
enough of them to get organized and

00:34:02,379 --> 00:34:07,149
begin turning these things out so

00:34:05,259 --> 00:34:08,889
there's a huge opportunity for software

00:34:07,149 --> 00:34:10,950
development to facilitate the

00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:14,079
self-organization of the community and

00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:16,690
while it is true I'm happy to say that

00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:19,599
we just got a six hundred thousand

00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:21,909
dollar grant from google org to develop

00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:24,789
and improve our processes as well as our

00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:28,450
devices we haven't found the right

00:34:24,789 --> 00:34:32,559
people and you know that money is not

00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:34,179
necessarily going to allow us to develop

00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:36,129
this kind of software so we're still

00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:38,349
trying to figure that out work out the

00:34:36,129 --> 00:34:41,770
governance and the accountability for

00:34:38,349 --> 00:34:45,039
this but again we're new to this all

00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:47,859
right I mean I sort of have embraced the

00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:50,549
open-source philosophy but but we are

00:34:47,859 --> 00:34:53,679
doing we're not only open sourcing

00:34:50,549 --> 00:34:56,049
software we're open sourcing hardware

00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:57,849
and we're open sourcing in a way that I

00:34:56,049 --> 00:34:59,920
think goes beyond most of the ventures

00:34:57,849 --> 00:35:02,960
that you're familiar we're open sourcing

00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:05,720
the time

00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:10,130
and the compassion of a global community

00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:16,310
that is eager to change the world using

00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:20,980
this network this recipe internet

00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:25,640
communication technologies 3d design and

00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:28,580
goodwill you know I like to say that the

00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:31,670
enable Community Foundation and enable

00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:37,430
has got three missions the first of them

00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:40,490
is to make sure that inexpensive upper

00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:44,450
limb devices are available to anyone

00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:46,280
anywhere it's it's it seems audacious

00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:48,710
but frankly I think we're on track and

00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:50,930
that's going to happen even if we go

00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:53,780
away and there's no indication that

00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:56,869
we're going away we've demonstrated that

00:35:53,780 --> 00:36:00,070
you can use this technology to produce

00:35:56,869 --> 00:36:02,480
inexpensive devices that are

00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:05,869
substantially better than nothing which

00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:08,119
is what most children and most of the

00:36:05,869 --> 00:36:11,869
world's population currently uses for

00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:14,540
upper limb prosthetics and we have

00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:16,540
already begun to disrupt and influence

00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:19,220
the prosthetics industry which is

00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:21,109
ambivalent about what we're doing but

00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:22,970
recognizes that we've opened up a market

00:36:21,109 --> 00:36:24,830
which is probably 10 to 100 times larger

00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:27,980
than the market they have been serving

00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:30,530
for the last hundred years our second

00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:33,470
mission is to support and this is going

00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:36,349
to be a generic genericized version of

00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:38,599
the first mission to support a global

00:36:36,349 --> 00:36:42,080
community of humanitarians using

00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:45,700
emerging technologies not just 3d design

00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:48,650
and software but emerging technologies

00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:51,109
to innovate new solutions for

00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:53,000
underserved populations not just people

00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:57,140
born with

00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,880
upper limb differences but all sorts of

00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:02,960
tougher all sorts of underserved

00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:04,850
populations it's a noble and audacious

00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,950
goal and I think part of the reason

00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:09,500
people are so fascinated by what we do

00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:13,780
is because we've done the proof of

00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:16,610
concept we're not done with upper limb

00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:18,680
prosthetics and for that matter we're

00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:21,710
already expanding from hands to arms

00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:24,320
from arms to orthotics for for example

00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:25,970
people who've got hands but have lost

00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,860
control of their fingers so they can now

00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:30,590
bend and unbend their arms and that will

00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:32,540
open and close their fingers we had a

00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:35,180
new hack come out just yesterday which

00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:36,530
tickles my fancy a motorized arm for

00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:39,020
people who don't have enough of a

00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:41,750
residual them to move it mechanically

00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:44,060
the motor is a twenty-dollar electric

00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:47,420
screwdriver clamped on to the

00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:49,220
twenty-dollar plastic and when the

00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:51,110
screwdriver activates it's got a motor

00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:52,310
it's got electronics it's got a battery

00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:54,200
and it's available at your local

00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:59,210
hardware store for twenty dollars when

00:37:54,200 --> 00:38:02,120
it turns the hand opens and closes so

00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:03,560
we're moving towards motorized limbs and

00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:07,840
we're moving towards other parts of the

00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:11,030
body as well but this general notion

00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:14,090
goes beyond body parts all right heads

00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:16,250
up displays are we keep being promised

00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:18,980
going to be ubiquitous any day now and

00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:21,710
when they are everyone in this room is

00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:24,050
going to have the skills they can use

00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:26,480
those devices not just for entertainment

00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:29,830
or surfing the web but for example to

00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:32,600
produce heads-up displays for the blind

00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:34,310
reading glasses they've got a camera you

00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:36,260
put a book in front of it it reads into

00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:39,860
your ear so we call them reading glasses

00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:43,160
or subtitles speech to text for the deaf

00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:47,360
or facial recognition help for the

00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:50,150
autistic or you tell me the point is if

00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:53,380
in five or ten years the 3d printed

00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:55,460
prosthetics problem is a done deal our

00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:57,790
community will have moved on to the

00:38:55,460 --> 00:39:01,310
emerging sweet spot for the next thing

00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:05,240
until the third mission is to figure out

00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:11,210
what emerging tip of the iceberg so what

00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:12,980
iceberg we are the emerging tip of which

00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:15,290
is a really fuzzy and strange sentence

00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:20,050
but i think it's it's accurate but the

00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:22,670
point is the economics of this and the

00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:25,250
ethics and the social organization

00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:27,800
implied by all of these are really not

00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:29,570
clear and we have an opportunity to lead

00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,680
the way in exploring now it could be

00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:32,900
this whole thing is going to be

00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:34,970
assimilated kurma and commercialized and

00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:37,670
i will be provide happy to declare

00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:39,980
victory if chief commercial devices end

00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:42,410
up out in the world but it's also

00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:44,030
possible that the thing that's most

00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:46,030
striking about that's the fact that it's

00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:55,340
a volunteer distributed manufacturing

00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:59,600
process motivated not by dollars and not

00:39:55,340 --> 00:40:03,100
merely by the self-satisfaction of

00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:05,660
becoming better at technology but by the

00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:09,050
human spirit of compassion and

00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:10,790
collaboration that is people talk about

00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:12,590
open source and they now talk about the

00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:14,450
sharing economy which as you know is

00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:15,860
actually not so much when they talk

00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:17,360
about uber and these other companies not

00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:18,710
so much as sharing so much as

00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:22,700
collaborative consumption but they do

00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:25,010
talk about let's say collaborative

00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:27,890
consumption they talk about the sharing

00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:30,020
economy and my point is right now we

00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:34,910
seem to be getting a glimpse of a caring

00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:37,660
economy and like the open source

00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:41,480
movement of which we are a proud part

00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:43,610
it's not clear what all of this means in

00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:45,580
the long run but if you read the right

00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:49,130
books and I recommend these books to you

00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:52,910
we're entering an era in which energy is

00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:53,650
free and robots probably driven by you

00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:55,180
okay

00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:58,480
software are doing all of the heavy

00:40:55,180 --> 00:41:02,740
lifting right in a world like that what

00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:05,650
are people for but arguably people are

00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:08,410
for using these incredible technologies

00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:10,450
to better the lives of other people who

00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:14,289
are not quite on the other side of that

00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:19,869
of that Rubicon that's a possible

00:41:14,289 --> 00:41:22,630
interpretation / 10 to 30 to 50 years of

00:41:19,869 --> 00:41:27,220
what this more general movement is all

00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:30,339
about and since we have the opportunity

00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:32,859
of exploring that one too I think we

00:41:30,339 --> 00:41:36,880
have the responsibility of exploring

00:41:32,859 --> 00:41:39,039
that one too and so I want to urge you

00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,660
all to figure out how to get on board

00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:43,210
and help us make it better and work

00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:45,430
better and how to help us do it smarter

00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:47,859
building in part on all of the open

00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:51,809
source and educational savvy thank you

00:41:47,859 --> 00:41:51,809
guys are experts in thank you very much

00:41:57,519 --> 00:42:07,659
so did I go 15 minutes over or do I wake

00:42:00,649 --> 00:42:11,989
up time for discussion okay cool

00:42:07,659 --> 00:42:13,849
thoughts recommendations questions yes

00:42:11,989 --> 00:42:19,459
sir you talked a little bit about

00:42:13,849 --> 00:42:22,669
disruption in the existing cost I heard

00:42:19,459 --> 00:42:25,249
a story a tablet app for helping

00:42:22,669 --> 00:42:28,369
children communicate using icons that

00:42:25,249 --> 00:42:30,049
was then shut down by the FDA I thank

00:42:28,369 --> 00:42:33,109
you for making I'm licensed medical

00:42:30,049 --> 00:42:37,669
device have you run into trouble like

00:42:33,109 --> 00:42:40,129
that you know we everyone hear that no

00:42:37,669 --> 00:42:43,789
he says you know there was this company

00:42:40,129 --> 00:42:46,129
that made augmentative software for on a

00:42:43,789 --> 00:42:48,819
tablet for people with language

00:42:46,129 --> 00:42:52,159
disorders they were shut down by the FDA

00:42:48,819 --> 00:42:55,669
we've been worried about that a lot but

00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:58,609
in truth I can now report that the FDA

00:42:55,669 --> 00:43:00,919
has been watching us carefully and I

00:42:58,609 --> 00:43:02,389
have a video which I carry with me and

00:43:00,919 --> 00:43:05,389
we'll be happy to show anyone in which

00:43:02,389 --> 00:43:08,899
an FDA official in a moment of weakness

00:43:05,389 --> 00:43:10,879
at a conference says you know everyone

00:43:08,899 --> 00:43:15,169
is saying that enable is circumventing

00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:19,399
FDA regulations here but the FDA wants

00:43:15,169 --> 00:43:21,919
to support worthy efforts and in fact we

00:43:19,399 --> 00:43:24,619
have regulations which allow us to

00:43:21,919 --> 00:43:27,879
create discretionary categories in which

00:43:24,619 --> 00:43:31,719
our regulation need not apply and

00:43:27,879 --> 00:43:34,249
because they are dealing with upper limb

00:43:31,719 --> 00:43:39,349
given away for free there for an encore

00:43:34,249 --> 00:43:41,089
not warranty etc devices we think what

00:43:39,349 --> 00:43:42,140
they're doing is just fine they're doing

00:43:41,089 --> 00:43:44,660
just what we want

00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:48,710
no problem so that's given us a reprieve

00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:51,319
but in truth our strategy continues to

00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:53,960
be make sure the horse is way out of the

00:43:51,319 --> 00:43:55,339
barn before they figure out what the

00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:57,200
door is and how to close it and

00:43:55,339 --> 00:43:59,329
meanwhile they also are trying to get

00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:01,760
their regulations right they notice by

00:43:59,329 --> 00:44:03,980
the way that we are we're being quite

00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,750
careful and conservative and we're being

00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:07,970
even more careful about appearing to be

00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:10,760
careful and conservative so for example

00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:12,789
there is huge need around the world for

00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:16,670
these upper limb prosthetics and we get

00:44:12,789 --> 00:44:19,789
inquiries on an almost weekly basis from

00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:21,289
some orphanage or United Nations agency

00:44:19,789 --> 00:44:22,579
or so on saying we want to get a 3d

00:44:21,289 --> 00:44:24,230
printer and we want to do we want to

00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:27,260
solve our problem in the refugee camp

00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:28,730
with this and we have to tell them a few

00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:32,299
things which I want to mention here

00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:34,400
which is it's early days for 3d printers

00:44:32,299 --> 00:44:37,549
if you get a 3d printer and you want to

00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:40,039
do this be prepared to be tinkering it's

00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:41,269
a tinkerer its game these days you know

00:44:40,039 --> 00:44:42,920
I know for many of you that's part of

00:44:41,269 --> 00:44:44,000
the appeal but for Penny people are

00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:47,599
trying to solve the world's problems

00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,890
especially in difficult environments we

00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:51,769
have to give them that warning and we

00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:53,660
also have to say that we are actively

00:44:51,769 --> 00:44:55,849
looking for partners who can take

00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:58,069
medical responsibility for not

00:44:55,849 --> 00:45:00,170
congenital kids in upper middle-class

00:44:58,069 --> 00:45:02,660
families have found us so far but

00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:07,069
post-traumatic hits in unstable war

00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:08,660
zones and so it's a gradual process but

00:45:07,069 --> 00:45:10,849
the point is because we're taking it

00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:13,880
gradual because we're we're being

00:45:10,849 --> 00:45:15,980
because you know sooner or later some

00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:17,900
kid is going to get hit by a car while

00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:20,470
riding one of our bikes and at that

00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:22,910
point the FDA is perfectly able to say

00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:25,910
you know that discretionary category

00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:27,890
needs to be tuned up so it's it's a work

00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:31,809
in progress but I've tried to sort of

00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:31,809
sketch though our stance with regards

00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:55,500
right and yet let me say first of all we

00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:57,840
got a small grant small of a hundred

00:45:55,500 --> 00:46:01,350
thousand dollars and we had a team of go

00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:03,060
to Haiti got back last week they're

00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:05,100
going to be there all year to try to

00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:09,440
figure out what would be a good model

00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:11,990
for that kind of situation 50 countries

00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:15,090
around the world let me put it this way

00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:16,770
this week the latest of these videos

00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:19,040
that I'm so proud of came out of Al

00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:22,290
Jazeera they did a ten-minute piece

00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:24,210
about enable in Brazil I had nothing to

00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:26,490
do with anything just showed up by

00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:28,680
surprise this is happening all over the

00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:30,840
world with the same kind of ambiguity

00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:33,800
even though there are these regulatory

00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:33,800
questions

00:46:55,880 --> 00:47:03,150
so the community the enable Google+

00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:05,760
community and its affiliated Facebook

00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:09,090
and websites and so on is really focused

00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:11,520
on 3d printed upper limb assistive

00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:14,760
devices right now there's a lot to do

00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:16,200
and it is in a regulatory sweet spot so

00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:19,650
we may as well work all of this out

00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:23,870
there the autistic story the heads up

00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:26,790
display story for that matter the home

00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:28,350
genetically engineered nutraceutical

00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:32,610
story which i haven't mentioned but is

00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:34,920
going to happen next I think are just

00:47:32,610 --> 00:47:37,110
things like one can see coming on the

00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:40,040
horizon and it's quite possible that the

00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:42,480
aptly-named enable Community Foundation

00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:45,900
could become the umbrella for a

00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:47,670
community of such ventures some of which

00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:49,260
would focus on heads-up displays an

00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:50,550
autistic spectrum some of which would

00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:52,950
focus on other opportunities as well

00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:56,940
that has to do with you know goals two

00:47:52,950 --> 00:48:02,430
and three and we're learning a lot as we

00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:06,140
do gold one so that's where we're at yes

00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:07,640
I see your talk at the summit

00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:09,710
kind of assumed that the Hughes more

00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:11,090
around research and development but he

00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:13,050
also touched

00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:15,030
it sounds like you're also doing

00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:17,820
manufacturing and distribution you bet

00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:20,100
so what seems to be the relationship

00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:22,590
between you know the maker in the user

00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:23,850
and how do you do quality industry what

00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:24,990
does that actually so really it's a

00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:26,640
really good question and it's an

00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:29,190
involvement question the standard

00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:35,370
answers which has been probably still

00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:40,500
the most common case is so here's a case

00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:43,650
study so a month ago six months ago we

00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:45,750
got an email from China actually we got

00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:49,020
an email from Canada from a Chinese

00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:52,800
woman who's Chinese sister had heard

00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:55,440
about somehow saying this would be great

00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:59,400
for our little boy so the Canadian

00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:01,590
sister rights to us and it goes to an

00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:05,580
email address called enable mature @

00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:12,510
gmail.com that's known as Molina Brown

00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:15,840
in Alabama for one of her minions her

00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:18,330
job is to look at the is to is to get

00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:19,890
information about the patient from the

00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:21,150
parents and the family using a

00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:23,760
questionnaire that we have including

00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:26,640
some photographs then to decide which of

00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:29,580
our existing volunteers would be a good

00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:31,650
match for that person has it happened

00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:33,630
that same week probably because the same

00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:35,880
news report was circulating somewhere in

00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:40,650
China we had our first Chinese volunteer

00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:42,210
so she hooked the two of them up and I

00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:44,300
gotta say this doesn't happen very often

00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:47,280
within a week that kid had a hand

00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:50,190
usually it takes one to six weeks it can

00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,750
even take months so so that's that's

00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:56,820
sort of the standard process but another

00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:58,920
process is one where 3d print calm last

00:49:56,820 --> 00:50:01,650
night published an article which caught

00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:05,220
me by surprise saying he naval seeks

00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:07,320
1,000 hands by mid-september

00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:09,930
it's true but it escaped me that we put

00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:11,880
out this call but several companies are

00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:13,440
now offering little goodies and rewards

00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:15,960
for people who will print those hands

00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:20,609
those will then be shipped to classrooms

00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:22,080
and scouting troops and parties assembly

00:50:20,609 --> 00:50:24,210
parties including autodesk university

00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:28,230
we're going to be there doing this in

00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:30,630
december in las vegas where they get

00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:33,300
assembled and then they get dispatched

00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:35,099
under that model ideally to someone who

00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:38,460
can then you know deal with a local

00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:42,750
population we're also working with

00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:44,640
groups like 3d hubs 3d hubs and pie

00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:48,270
maker have something similar is a

00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:51,540
network of 17,000 3d printer people who

00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:55,020
affiliated with this uber for 3d

00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:57,630
printing and they've just put out a call

00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:59,340
and we have an initial pilot team of 30

00:50:57,630 --> 00:51:02,640
people who've said sure we'll print

00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:06,840
these for free so that's another way

00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:12,030
which will happen it is you know

00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:14,609
distributed not-for-profit manufacturing

00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:16,380
and design comparable story about

00:51:14,609 --> 00:51:19,470
matching designers and problems and so

00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:21,650
on and it's it's evolving as fast as we

00:51:19,470 --> 00:51:21,650
can

00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:41,240
actually there are opportunities to do

00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:44,390
it either way I'm the assembly is sort

00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:46,369
of like like a star wars lego project

00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:50,980
right not impossible it takes three or

00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:53,690
four hours but we do have calls out for

00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:55,700
unassembled hands because we've got

00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:57,920
classrooms and scouting troops that do

00:51:55,700 --> 00:52:00,140
this social thing where they get into it

00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:01,700
by doing the assembly so you know you do

00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:04,400
not have to master the fine art of

00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:05,869
assembly although our new designs are

00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,360
going to make assembly easier and easier

00:52:05,869 --> 00:52:10,430
and in a few years they're probably

00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:11,750
going to be printing place suckers where

00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:13,850
you don't even have to assemble them

00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:16,610
they're just you know ready to go minus

00:52:13,850 --> 00:52:19,100
maybe minus the strings make me not it's

00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:20,690
an evolving story the simplest way if

00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:22,880
you really want to start printing and so

00:52:20,690 --> 00:52:28,600
on is to send an email to let's get

00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:30,860
started at enabling of the future lrg

00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:33,200
that's probably the ending commercial

00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:35,810
break let's get started and enabling the

00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:38,030
future 0rg or go to enabling the future

00:52:35,810 --> 00:52:40,460
or the enable Community Foundation and

00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:42,410
don't fail to notice that we're looking

00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:45,050
for volunteers of whole stripes

00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:47,150
including those who want to help sponsor

00:52:45,050 --> 00:52:48,890
or come in conference thank you I love

00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:51,970
to talk to any of you who want to

00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:51,970
continue the conversation

00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:09,340
for those who don't have these three

00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:11,200
rooms today one two three and four are

00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:14,110
what used to be four five and six and

00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:16,110
wandering pasta so we go over there army

00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:22,020
you like a draft that I don't know go

00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:22,020
