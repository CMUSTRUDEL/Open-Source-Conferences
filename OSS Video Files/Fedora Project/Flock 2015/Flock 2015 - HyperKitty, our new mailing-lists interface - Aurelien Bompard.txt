Title: Flock 2015 - HyperKitty, our new mailing-lists interface - Aurelien Bompard
Publication date: 2015-08-26
Playlist: Flock 2015
Description: 
	The mailing-lists have always been heavily used across the Fedora Project, but haven't seen a lot of changes since the beginning of Fedora. During that time, web usage has skyrocketed and forum software is very common, being now the type of UI that most users prefer. But other contributors, developers and some users, like mailing-lists better. We don't want to choose between those UIs, we want both, and we want people talking to each other. Mailman, the piece of software that powers our lists, has just been updated to a brand new release. Its new architecture allowed us to contribute a modern and powerful web UI that bridges the gap between those two forms of communication. In this talk you'll learn: - how HyperKitty is deployed and used in the Fedora Infrastructure, - how you can use it to be more efficient and get more meta-information when using the Fedora communication channels - which new features are coming to HyperKitty - how you can hack on it and help the whole project communicate better

hello record button so yeah we have room

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,509
full of people first question so I'm

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,360
going to talk about how back eating

00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:18,660
first question is who has already seen

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:23,189
one of my talks about hyper cake you do

00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:26,849
you do I know you do yeah alright cool

00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:29,010
so a lot of new people I will give a

00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:32,219
brief presentation of what the state of

00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:34,350
our mailing list is it will be quick

00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:36,510
because you all know what it looks like

00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:41,000
and then I'll show you where we're going

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:43,350
to so first one I my name is over young

00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,329
you can come you're a lien or anything

00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:48,719
that is used that is easy to pronounce

00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:50,789
for an english-speaking person I'm in

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,780
Paris I've been contributing to a

00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:59,190
federal ship for a long time and I've

00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:03,030
been endangering team since 2012 so be

00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:06,540
three years I'm developing I'm the lead

00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:09,689
developer Piper GD I'm trying to help

00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:13,740
fix the mailing list problem that we all

00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:15,630
know about or guess at with the help of

00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,540
a lot of people here like this person

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:20,060
here and and her name numerous interns

00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,280
that I've been helping me over the years

00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:25,350
for example Karen she was there last

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,850
luck she's very interesting person work

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:32,220
on the design so that mainly consists of

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,200
development of ipod read writing the

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,320
gold deployment and mentoring people

00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,950
communication which is not my first part

00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:43,200
and all the rest as usual for a software

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,210
project

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,380
so this is what we're going to talk

00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:51,780
about I will try to give a demo of what

00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,880
we have right right now if the network

00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,280
does not fail which is a way to gather

00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,700
the case at a conference so we'll see

00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,289
how it works so my mind to that one is

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,840
the current version that we are all

00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:06,149
using all over the world it's it is a

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,310
maintenance branch it has seen one

00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:11,039
release a year adult ones of group 1

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:14,250
release of years since 2006 so it's kind

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:17,069
of a dated it's a very monolithic

00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:22,140
package that was designed in the last

00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:25,130
century it's a so it's as amazing miss

00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:29,250
engine and there is a weber khyber that

00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:31,590
produces static HTML it has a weapon min

00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:35,250
interface that is CGI base it's a lot of

00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:39,090
90s era technologies the problem with

00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:41,730
that yeah I've just said it CGI is not

00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:44,160
very nice for admins they don't like it

00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:49,440
a lot especially in the sea linux days

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:52,380
they hate it HTML well say HTML we've

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,120
done better of other years and it's a

00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:56,519
lot of different environments and skill

00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,799
sets that are necessary a lot of

00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:01,500
different technologies so the people who

00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:04,730
write died and maintain that don't know

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,989
all the ends of everything that they are

00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:10,260
dealing with so it's kind of hard to

00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:12,720
it's kind of hard to do Melvin main

00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:15,630
three tries to fix all that it's a much

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,819
modern and modular design there are a

00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:21,209
lot of improvement that you will see

00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:23,329
when we switch to it which is soon first

00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:27,810
you will not get an email every month

00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:29,549
okay no more hot slave in there yeah you

00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:32,310
will not receive your plaintext password

00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:37,590
valya you may every month so that's even

00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:39,239
better more foreign for the third recipe

00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,459
there's a REST API which is very

00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:43,800
excitable you can do a lot of things

00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:46,170
that the other rest api actually the web

00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,120
admin interface only uses this rest api

00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:50,129
so everything can do in the web

00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,220
interface you can do via the recipe I

00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:56,549
it's very very easy to extend to to work

00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:59,360
with it it handles by virtual domains so

00:03:56,549 --> 00:04:01,769
you can have one server that angles

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,080
federal debt for a project that power

00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:06,569
off a train track down after a hostage

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,879
of it or anything and other domains like

00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:10,890
tiger wants to buy go that I owe wants

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:16,739
to go into that too so we can have

00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:18,720
virtual domains very easily it handles

00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:20,639
the concept of having one single user

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,930
with multiple addresses so you can be

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,669
subscribed to different mailing lists

00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:25,470
with different addresses and it will

00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:29,789
reconcile all that and let you handle

00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:32,729
your preferences globally it's been

00:04:29,789 --> 00:04:35,460
raised it has been released this year in

00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:38,610
April just a swipe icon which was in

00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:42,030
Montreal it has been released in a form

00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:44,430
that is considered good for new

00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:47,550
installations the momentum right now

00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:52,410
does not feel like the three that orbit

00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:54,360
ease is easy to upgrade from the

00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:57,300
mainland toodle one but I've been

00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,880
working on a lot of that great procedure

00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:03,090
and I think for fed where we can do it

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:04,950
and we've been doing it recently so

00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:06,750
hyper give you what it is it's an

00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:09,990
archival problem packing for main memory

00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:12,599
so the ID that in main man 3 you have

00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:14,280
this mailman core that is doing with

00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:16,380
that is dealing with the routing of

00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,479
emails and the distribution and the

00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:21,120
housing of error all that stuff and you

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:26,250
have to web interfaces that are

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:28,320
different the web interface is is

00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:30,990
connecting to mailman we are the rest

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,870
api with as we say before and you can

00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:36,630
have any number of archivers that are

00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:39,030
all independent and the main one is hi

00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:42,360
Peggy it's so it's just a plug-in but

00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:44,789
it's a big one and you can have other

00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,100
archivers or you can do you can write

00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:47,740
plug-in that work

00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:51,500
canvas but actually do other things

00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:53,590
Ralph he wrote plug-in that gets the

00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:56,030
email from yeah that's this guy agreed

00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:58,730
that gave the email from the from

00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:01,160
mailman and routes them as head messages

00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:07,310
so you can do that too it's very easy to

00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:09,590
extend well you won't look at but Mayor

00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:13,070
hyper kitty is a web app it's based on

00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:15,890
python and django the emails are story

00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:18,290
destroy database in a sequel database it

00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:21,590
runs a lot of some analysis in

00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:24,440
statistics over them and and it looks

00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:27,200
like Oh some sort of web forum but not

00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,760
only a web forum it has a full text

00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:32,000
search engine that can search across

00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:34,160
list so you don't have to our if you

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,540
don't know in if you don't know the

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,070
exact mailing list where you mail was

00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,780
sent you can just sort globally and you

00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:41,570
can find any man that is very

00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:44,090
interesting for private lists which are

00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:48,680
not archived by global search engines

00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:51,230
such as google it has a lot of modern

00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,360
web features like vibrating posts and

00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:55,250
liking disliking normal stuff and it's

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,510
very it's low by friendly you will see

00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:00,770
that so i have this nice drawing of what

00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:02,840
happens when you receive an email in

00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:05,600
main memory so you get the email from

00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:08,540
prospects for example I think that Exim

00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:11,210
is supported but not as well as stores

00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:13,460
at specifics right now so well we just

00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:16,550
got six anyway if we see the email they

00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:21,320
are led into main memory that has its

00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:25,780
own database and the emails are stored

00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:29,930
into hyper Kelly via the archive our API

00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:33,680
so hyper christos the email itself into

00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:35,420
instant a base and you have then you

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,450
have the friendly users who go into

00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:42,470
hyper ke and request the Stations of the

00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:44,660
mailing lists the archives hi perkiness

00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:46,910
has sown rest api that you can interact

00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:48,890
with with dreads if you want to get the

00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:53,270
emails or guest get information such as

00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:56,630
what email was which was the top

00:07:53,270 --> 00:08:00,290
posted email with this week this this

00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:02,120
month who favorited well who what was a

00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:05,270
rag doll of this month this kind of

00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:08,900
thing then you have poor posture Idi

00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:12,890
Amin UI which is another a new UI for

00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:14,810
other people is Forrest amines and both

00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:17,390
of them enter interact with mainland 3

00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:18,920
via the rest api and of course you can

00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:22,280
have your friend lisa's amines who write

00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:25,690
scripts to interact with the recipe I so

00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:29,050
that's maybe the main center of action

00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:33,110
yes the recipe is that just for

00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:35,060
administrators or the end users this one

00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:37,700
here this one who is only fed with

00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:40,970
stretchers or yeah for the local

00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:43,640
administrators the wonderful had vomit

00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:45,290
in hyper kitty is a is authenticated in

00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,330
the same way hi Peggy so you get the

00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:50,690
same permissions you can use that virtue

00:08:47,330 --> 00:09:00,380
but you can do less in what kind of

00:08:50,690 --> 00:09:03,410
different things but I'm right it hasn't

00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:08,120
been a real priority i would say my

00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:16,700
friend his face but but yeah possible

00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:19,100
aces yeah i can improve it no no a good

00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:21,280
good if you have questions interrupt me

00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,930
that's fine i will get back to my time

00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:25,610
I'd rather you interrupt me then you

00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:32,120
stole your question for later and never

00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:34,460
ask it about the pilot now for new

00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:38,330
instances of maple tree where isn't a

00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:40,430
small small burner script that will

00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:42,610
install me man 3 and hyper contempo

00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:44,080
stories at the same time in the same

00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:46,000
environment

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,860
Vernon's it's all very well integrated

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,980
and ready to go so you can do your proof

00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:53,320
of concept install with that it's a it

00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:55,480
work it's working and it's what the

00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,820
mainland team recommends to install a

00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,350
new stuff of course for real production

00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:03,420
deployment you will probably want to

00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:06,400
have something more isolated and more

00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:08,320
well that you will integrate with your

00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,480
own infrastructure so you won't will

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,480
probably want the separate project in

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:16,570
two separate environments I have options

00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,610
for l7 that are working there they are

00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:21,190
also working with this Linux enable so

00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:23,290
you can use that if you want volumes

00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:28,450
orphan rubber dolls are bit bold into a

00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:31,270
datum the migrations are really

00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:33,310
simplified for reproduction deployment i

00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:35,140
have a shoe script that are that are

00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:36,580
available and i have written about

00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:40,750
products for the federal infrastructure

00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:44,680
that you can reuse most of the federal

00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:46,690
intraspecific parts are exploding two

00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:48,640
variables like than southern names and

00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:50,650
the database name all my stuff so you

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,570
can use this and i'm not sure you can

00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:58,750
just take them and apply them but this

00:10:52,570 --> 00:11:01,360
will be very easy to adapt so that's

00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:02,440
what it looks like currently it's just a

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,470
screenshot i'll show you the real

00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:08,620
version that's the main page it's not

00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:11,130
the main is not the most well still very

00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:14,020
big improvement over what we had before

00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:16,720
so the other first glance what you can

00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:18,760
see is that you have an ID of which

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,790
lists are the most interesting when one

00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:23,379
activity you haven't done well this one

00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:26,349
here had the big spike of you of

00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:28,239
recently this devil list has a lot of

00:11:26,349 --> 00:11:30,899
activity that is evenly return

00:11:28,239 --> 00:11:33,789
distributed and you have all those solid

00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:36,189
solid by what is the most popular you

00:11:33,789 --> 00:11:39,489
can sort by different criteria and you

00:11:36,189 --> 00:11:40,809
can filter them so you can get by

00:11:39,489 --> 00:11:43,329
default you will hide the inactive list

00:11:40,809 --> 00:11:46,769
so you don't have all those inactive

00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:49,209
list cluttering your your your screen

00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:52,629
and it will hide the private is by

00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:55,059
default if you're not logged in so you

00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:57,999
don't yeah it's protected but you it

00:11:55,059 --> 00:11:59,470
will not message of you this is the

00:11:57,999 --> 00:12:02,499
front page and this is what it looks

00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:04,479
like when you go into when you go in

00:12:02,499 --> 00:12:08,079
visited with a mobile you on a mobile on

00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:09,849
a mobile phone for example or a table so

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:14,829
this collapse is nicely into something

00:12:09,849 --> 00:12:17,619
that you can use and I'll show you more

00:12:14,829 --> 00:12:19,389
in depth demo but I this is interesting

00:12:17,619 --> 00:12:20,889
to see if you want to use it so you will

00:12:19,389 --> 00:12:26,169
able be able to grow your mailing list

00:12:20,889 --> 00:12:27,519
with your phone yay currently in the

00:12:26,169 --> 00:12:30,879
Pharaoh infrastructure we have for

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,889
several deployed the development server

00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:34,689
that i'm using there was a staging

00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:38,109
server and we have two production

00:12:34,689 --> 00:12:40,119
servers we are deploying the RPMs

00:12:38,109 --> 00:12:42,909
because that's our policy in the federal

00:12:40,119 --> 00:12:45,159
infrastructure and we're using ansible

00:12:42,909 --> 00:12:47,379
playbooks as I said it's mainly using

00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:51,459
roles so you could you could extract

00:12:47,379 --> 00:12:52,860
those roles that use them oh no way I

00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:57,810
don't have to process

00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:59,460
right if you want to try hyper kitty and

00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:02,660
check it out you can use the staging

00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:05,490
server this is one of this address here

00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:07,140
well that's until your favorite mailing

00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:11,850
list is my granny which is going to

00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:13,860
happen soon it mirrors the federal mean

00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:15,480
is it's a manual process right now

00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:19,500
because I don't want to have something

00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:22,080
automatic SSH into production server

00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:24,420
from a staging server that will not be

00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:29,130
very nice so it's maor so sometimes you

00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:30,990
will see emails well you will see that

00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:33,180
the latest emails were like a week ago

00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:35,520
because I didn't do them I didn't run

00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,930
the script but that's at least that's a

00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:39,410
good way really enough way to test

00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:41,610
happen again the production's our

00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:44,340
production servers are real functional

00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:45,960
main memory instances there is a test

00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,610
main entry list that you can use if you

00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:51,450
want to just try it out with no

00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:53,160
consequences and we I have returned a

00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:55,170
few scripts to transition from the old

00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,420
service to the new ones so when you're

00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:58,920
mailing lists or your mailing right when

00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:02,820
your mailings all your mailing lists are

00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:06,330
migrated to the new server I will first

00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:09,210
notice you and then you will you will

00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:12,830
see that the transition is actually you

00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:15,240
will get a lot of redirections that will

00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:17,340
that will avoid you being lost between

00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:21,660
the old server on the new server so it

00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:24,020
should be pretty transparent for you and

00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:28,020
our view is that our librarian already

00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:30,900
most of them are automatic list like SM

00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:32,490
commits and commit lists but we have the

00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:36,050
infrastructure is that has been migrated

00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:38,940
very very very recently like last week

00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:41,400
it's working and people are actually

00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:43,890
communicating with it and it's it is

00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:47,280
working I've been migrating a few lists

00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:49,230
over the last weeks and the only road

00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:51,510
blocks that we've hit is the feature

00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:53,950
that is not yet into main memory it's

00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:58,330
it's a feature that is called topic

00:14:53,950 --> 00:15:00,450
yeah topic lists and it's very we don't

00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:02,650
use it a lot we use it only for one list

00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:04,390
to my knowledge which is package

00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:07,720
announced list it's a feature that will

00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:10,390
let the list admin define subtopics

00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,430
based on the based on the subject of the

00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:14,350
emails and people can subscribe to those

00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:16,660
topics instead of subscribing to the

00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:19,270
whole list and they will only get emails

00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:28,020
that match the topic that has they have

00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:28,020
selected so we yeah yeah yes

00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:51,260
well first I would recommend using the

00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:53,330
band our script which is called mainland

00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:57,880
earlier you will find it be for the more

00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:57,880
brainless oaf or a list like let's say

00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:08,840
okay what's the procedure you talk to me

00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:12,080
yeah I just have a very small procedure

00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:14,930
to migrate lists and I I just do it but

00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:23,030
yeah you just ask me I'll be very happy

00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:26,840
to have new guinea phone users so yes

00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:29,270
yes so yes where this topic features is

00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:31,520
not very widely used in the federal

00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:32,870
infrastructure but when I migrated this

00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,250
package lists a lot of people were

00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:36,920
complaining that they were getting all

00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:39,350
the emails for all the released version

00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:41,210
of federal and they will not very happy

00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:43,630
about us who are rolled it back and I'm

00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:47,570
waiting this feature will be implemented

00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:49,490
as well differently as the result of a

00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:51,080
Google small project is here so it's

00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:54,620
going to wait a bit but we can migrate

00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:57,020
all the other lists and wait for this to

00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:58,810
be done to make my packages package or

00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:00,700
not

00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:04,000
what's done right now is a lot of

00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:08,050
commits list as I said most I think all

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,670
of them and the infrastructure there's a

00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:13,060
few things to watch out for when you may

00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:17,319
rest first the next beanthere header

00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:19,990
that was added to two emails by my men

00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:21,699
to that one he's not added by women

00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:24,040
three anymore because it's been

00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:27,760
deprecated for years but no one knew it

00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:30,370
since there was no release so this has

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,380
been replaced by this tiny so if you

00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:34,750
want if you were doing your filters on

00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:37,690
eggs in there you will have to edit your

00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:40,720
photos and usually study instead it's a

00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:43,690
fairly simple thing people from the

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:47,380
infrastructure have done it already most

00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:50,200
web most web males use this die anyway

00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:52,830
so if you were using them bro I think I

00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:55,540
think gmail does it uses this idea too

00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:57,460
it's just like blood some people who are

00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:58,960
using proc mares and well my unit

00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:03,400
filtering and I think there will have to

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:08,560
change their ways so yeah that's things

00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:10,330
change over 15 years yes and there is no

00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:13,780
lease topics yet but it's going to

00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:17,310
happen probably in September when the

00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:17,310
google Summer of Code finishes

00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:24,020
so what we're going to do next we have a

00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:26,330
few technical improvements to do we were

00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:31,360
doing our CSS with less than is getting

00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:33,800
a bit a bit spin it's not outdated but

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:38,090
SAS is getting ready getting traction

00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:39,770
and less needs requires us to have a

00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:44,800
note on the server which is not very

00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:46,880
nice energy is so it's some some

00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:49,010
administrators are not very happy about

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:54,680
the list of dependencies that comes with

00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:57,020
it so i'll probably change that we're

00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:59,450
all using bootstrap as a framework for

00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:03,850
CSS so it should be not too hard to

00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:06,140
change because we structure supports us

00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:09,350
there is a new attachment system that i

00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:10,910
was i'm going to write currently you

00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:13,580
can't add an attachment where you reply

00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:15,020
from the from the web interface did i

00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:16,670
mention that you can reply from the web

00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:20,450
interface I've probably didn't measure

00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:22,550
that yo ok ok so that's one of the main

00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:24,560
improvement what one of the nice

00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:26,750
improvements of hyper kitty over the

00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:28,690
previously static HTML that you can

00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:31,040
actually reply from the web you can

00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:33,800
you'll see you have a reply button link

00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:36,110
that you can use and and post your

00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:38,360
emails from the web but you cannot

00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:41,200
attach anything right now so that's

00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:43,100
something that I'm going to add next

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,200
that's a feature that I've been

00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:48,890
requested a lot of time but it's more

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:51,950
complicated but it looks the previous

00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:54,620
main web interface allows people to

00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:57,260
download the mbox file for the lists

00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:59,540
which is this an imbecile with all them

00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:01,640
so just mailbox size with all the emails

00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:05,350
in the list this has not been

00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:07,640
implemented yet into hyper Kelly because

00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:09,920
since the all the emails are into the

00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:13,450
databases has to be built on the fly and

00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:15,760
can be pretty hot load on the server

00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:18,220
I want to make something a bit as a

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:21,190
synchronous I will not cause a lot of

00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:24,909
load for the South so taking a bit more

00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:28,240
time than expected and then since it's

00:20:24,909 --> 00:20:32,200
all out I shall help people while we

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,580
should help people install it and so

00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,539
there are a lot of mainland communities

00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,220
across the world that would be

00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:39,100
interested in that I've been contacted

00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:41,950
by the apache software foundation by a

00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:44,980
lot of people are cup of people who use

00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:47,230
memory in France to some organizations

00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:49,419
are really eager to move to too many men

00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:58,539
and red hat of course isn't interested

00:20:49,419 --> 00:21:03,909
too so what hello is okay perfect more

00:20:58,539 --> 00:21:06,700
people yeah and and hear some people

00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:09,610
will also be happy to see images virtual

00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:13,679
images that setup men and application

00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:18,750
Pistorius you know in a nice container

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:21,370
could be used so i have i've had someone

00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:23,289
propose me to write the kermit animate

00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:26,500
docker image for main men and hyper

00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:29,289
kitty but it had it doesn't have any

00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:32,460
results yet and I think guy didn't reply

00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:35,639
back to ease if someone wants to do that

00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,639
it's open

00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:42,890
so on the technical side you can help by

00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:45,050
testing the same of course trying the

00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:47,600
installation trying to do strange things

00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:51,800
that I haven't thought of which probably

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:53,660
a lot of things if you no tengo very

00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,820
well you probably know of a lot of

00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:59,000
optimization that I've haven't yet put

00:21:55,820 --> 00:22:00,830
to use there is a lot of stuck in a

00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,210
statistical analysis elaborate that is

00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:04,070
very interesting to do a mailing lists

00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:07,910
because a lot of people use it a lot of

00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:12,470
people use me is for very strange

00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:15,980
personal and social things that are very

00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:17,600
interesting to analyze people talking to

00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:22,610
each other on public lists it's always

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:25,820
very interesting to analyze for example

00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:29,090
that you can if you have an idea about

00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:30,710
if you know that visualization and dr.

00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:32,780
very well who would be interested in

00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:36,110
that too but it's not only about

00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:38,600
technical issues you can be sharp design

00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:41,090
ideas to improve the minis feasibly I'm

00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,950
sure marine and I would be very

00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:45,350
interested you still have a dull obliges

00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:48,920
on your website but but what we can do

00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:51,740
but yeah it's if all the people have

00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:54,200
already thought anything to end

00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:57,020
tutorials for installation it's has a

00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:59,120
hold of this poverty the installation

00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:01,340
has been as may has been made easier and

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,380
easier but it's still it's interesting

00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:08,650
to have tutorials and it will probably

00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:08,650
make people more comfortable in studies

00:23:11,929 --> 00:23:18,169
so now to the demo yay if the staging

00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:22,059
thirudan versus the address if you want

00:23:18,169 --> 00:23:24,919
to try it we have documentation here and

00:23:22,059 --> 00:23:26,720
that's the new that's a place where we

00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:28,070
have the code with all the rest of the

00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,379
main man project so that's where you'll

00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:34,999
find the mailman burglar protective in

00:23:30,379 --> 00:23:42,190
the get that main man group so i'll show

00:23:34,999 --> 00:23:42,190
you that probably need to do that

00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,980
ok

00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:20,070
oh that is kind of a dirty know we'll

00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:21,809
get there oh yeah that's old okay cool

00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:25,919
I'll show you I'll show you the real one

00:24:21,809 --> 00:24:30,830
so you will be in 10 moisturizing the

00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:30,830
new i'll show you the infrastructure one

00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:47,380
so that is infrastructure list that I've

00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:47,380
been migrated recently I don't need you

00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:53,870
so I have other games you can see home

00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:56,390
if there were big spikes of post

00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:59,390
recently that's over the last all this

00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:01,309
is data over the last 30 days you can

00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:03,380
have you can see who is the most active

00:25:01,309 --> 00:25:10,940
Busters and how many posts they have

00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:13,460
sent what can I say about this I'm

00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:15,830
logged in with my email address so i can

00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:20,270
go directly to the discussion that i

00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:23,900
have posted to which is very useful all

00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:27,500
this this grey envelope here shows the

00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:30,800
topics that i haven't yet seen so if i

00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:35,860
go to this one here for example i can

00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:39,650
read this topic and all the new emails

00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:41,300
and i have if there are new emerging the

00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:43,580
australia i will i can go to them

00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:45,730
directly with giving this ski here so

00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:09,440
for a day and it's the description that

00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:11,850
is seven days old that's as useful and

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:14,179
for example if I want to add something

00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:14,179

the proper it will the proper link with

00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:59,670
the proper headers that will actually

00:26:55,530 --> 00:27:01,050
put the email back into the slider i can

00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:02,490
create a new thread if I think that's

00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:08,570
more relevant and changed the subject

00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:11,100
it's necessary I can send that yay

00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:13,800
Uruguay has been sent and since that was

00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:18,600
so extremely useful and i will like I on

00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:24,170

can i can go to my profile for example

00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:31,800
see that the three with red which thread

00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:35,730
i have read over the overtime see my

00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:39,800
votes though this puzzle i just liked or

00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:39,800
cancel see my subscriptions

00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:44,399
see my favorites oh yeah I didn't show

00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:48,899
you that I can favorite as a thread

00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:52,860
let's go back to it I can favor this

00:27:48,899 --> 00:27:56,690
right and now I'll get it back I will

00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:56,690
get it in my favorite list here

00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:05,250
so this is very yeah it's not maxi be it

00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:12,140
it's not actually me know because I've

00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:24,150
just sent I'm getting tools oh yeah

00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:26,299
vested yeah what else can I show frozen

00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:26,299
pool

00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:41,809
yes this is good but it's subscribed by

00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:45,440
fake email address huh which is just I

00:28:41,809 --> 00:28:54,440
never get it out I just use ok so we

00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:55,639
subscribe yeah which is nice yeah you'll

00:28:54,440 --> 00:29:01,850
probably have to go back to your

00:28:55,639 --> 00:29:03,679
subscription list and edit so yeah and

00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:06,830
you can you get go to subscribe to this

00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:08,749
list the button here and and and change

00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:14,899
the subscription and change the which

00:29:08,749 --> 00:29:16,759
address you're subscribed with yeah yeah

00:29:14,899 --> 00:29:18,950
so so yeah when you reply to a list that

00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:21,679
you have are not subscribed to it will

00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:24,529
subscribe you with non delivery option

00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:27,379
so you will not get them into a uml it's

00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:29,210
supposes that you want to check if since

00:29:27,379 --> 00:29:31,669
you've been into the web interface you

00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:34,580
want to you want to just use the web to

00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:36,320
browse this list so that's easier when

00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:37,580
you just want to interact with quickly

00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,980
with the mailing list and you don't want

00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:42,080
to get the flower emails if it's a

00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:44,600
private list of course it will just say

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,279
something like your email must be or

00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:48,619
your subscription must be approved or

00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:51,109
your mms Beatrice and have us because

00:29:48,619 --> 00:29:52,999
you you can't you can be automatically

00:29:51,109 --> 00:29:57,230
automatically subscribe to a private

00:29:52,999 --> 00:30:01,999
list of course so there are huge corner

00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:04,639
cases boilers usually weeks yeah you can

00:30:01,999 --> 00:30:11,109
add text to tourists say oh very

00:30:04,639 --> 00:30:11,109
interesting and everybody can add text

00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:19,340
can make it to be here what else can I

00:30:15,859 --> 00:30:20,989
show oh yeah searching so on the bailing

00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:26,029
on the federal forest we've been talking

00:30:20,989 --> 00:30:29,840
about lock search for clock and get a

00:30:26,029 --> 00:30:33,320
list of email that are relevant for now

00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,639
it's solid by relevance it's of the pen

00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:38,320
text search engine but you can choose

00:30:34,639 --> 00:30:42,269
the search by the by date you can

00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,269
Sean that's easier

00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:49,449
okay let's go back to the list all of

00:30:47,269 --> 00:30:49,449
you

00:30:51,580 --> 00:31:02,500
oh yeah and I'll show you the I'll show

00:30:54,520 --> 00:31:04,510
you the mobile view so yeah you can see

00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:07,360
you can you can see it collapse when the

00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:10,810
screen size changes into something that

00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:15,880
you can actually use but you will have

00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:20,160
the same categories here and you will

00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:20,160
have tabs for for the statistics and

00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:26,240
descriptions

00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:28,960
and this will collapse into a menu that

00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,960
you can you see

00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:46,799
so currently it works the only problem

00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:49,649
that we've had is the ex been handing

00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:53,039
their header but people I that some

00:31:49,649 --> 00:31:55,500
people use there is a sort of minor bug

00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:57,029
that sometimes blocks main man 3 but

00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:00,029
I've found a way to reproduce it this

00:31:57,029 --> 00:32:03,389
morning so I'll fix it otherwise it's

00:32:00,029 --> 00:32:05,940
all good and if you want to try this

00:32:03,389 --> 00:32:11,159
year interface or just you know ask me

00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:14,659
come to me and move your list yeah

00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:14,659
that's that shaft questions

00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,230
we still have a lot of time so if you

00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:25,740
want to lose see things and try things

00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:25,740
by yourself

00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:52,480
yeah you can say that I don't think we

00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:54,640
have recovered we will send an email to

00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:58,330
do this first and explain what's what's

00:32:54,640 --> 00:33:00,580
going on see and so but I don't have a

00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:03,100
we don't have well the idea is not to

00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:04,809
get a big date where everybody is

00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,370
switching at this which is at the same

00:33:04,809 --> 00:33:08,950
time we're just moving least one other

00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:10,840
time it's we can do it and I think it's

00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:13,929
better than having a big day switch

00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:16,620
where everybody is concerned it will be

00:33:13,929 --> 00:33:16,620
surprised me

00:33:22,099 --> 00:33:29,399
sure whoa people nice I think it's

00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:32,009
better to get one least at a time and so

00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:34,409
that goes here and then we can this way

00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:36,989
we can see which lists are aren't very

00:33:34,409 --> 00:33:42,299
active and are you know lagging behind

00:33:36,989 --> 00:33:43,649
right yes are we creating new list that

00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:49,789
is that's a good question i think we

00:33:43,649 --> 00:33:49,789
should we should yeah yep yes

00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:59,280
there isn't something about at the

00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:01,500
moment but we should maybe yeah which I

00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:03,960
think we should send an email to like

00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:05,610
the whole list and so tell them find

00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:13,940
ticket if you want to meet to review

00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:13,940
list infrastructure I think yeah yes Ben

00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:23,639
yeah we yeah we can do that we can I can

00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:26,970
extract the list of Lists that I've been

00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:33,640
migrated and put that into wiki and keep

00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:36,530
that late yeah that's easy to do yes

00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:39,110
yeah so we were just talking about which

00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:41,000
it migrates 19 what will be really nice

00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:43,160
because right now we have a lot of

00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,960
discussions and then somebody we don't

00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:47,270
tend to put too many attachments because

00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,670
our graphics tend to be very large we'll

00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:52,160
put a link to like to meet you are some

00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:54,950
piece or something 3d up inline images

00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:57,860
so it goes to link to an image it

00:34:54,950 --> 00:35:02,360
displays in the conversation yeah yeah

00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:04,250
why not I'm really just yeah there are

00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:06,020
things to make sure of like it's not

00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:09,950
make sure it's not a huge image that

00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:12,260
will destroy other the layout but why

00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:13,670
not yeah that could be something and you

00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:16,850
can add them back at the bottom of the

00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:22,630
emails but in my images and get them all

00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:22,630
down can you send me an email about that

00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:28,780
yes

00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:43,960
that will be that's that's a kind of

00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:49,970
warm that I'm not sure I should open I

00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:54,100
the question of rich formatting is very

00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:59,300
touchy for a lot of people in many years

00:35:54,100 --> 00:36:02,660
as some people I've got some people told

00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:04,310
me you'd better not make an HTML editor

00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:13,070
into the thing because otherwise I will

00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:16,130
never use it so I don't know maybe then

00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:18,860
trying to detect Markham why maybe I

00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:23,000
don't know I that could be fun though

00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:24,860
but I don't know there is something like

00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:29,270
the others those JavaScript plugins that

00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:31,610
inspect areas and turn into into rich

00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:32,990
text if the planet that's like something

00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:37,940
interesting it like you know what we do

00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:46,900
what the code I think it's a minefield

00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:46,900
but you know we can yeah maybe later

00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:54,069
yeah you have questions

00:37:00,859 --> 00:37:02,920
you

00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,200
however

00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:41,400
I know we have two problems piracy

00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,400
mm-hmm

00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:52,539
in lining images that should be not talk

00:37:55,059 --> 00:38:02,089
using Susan values for passing our

00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:06,319
pictures the end is always it just just

00:38:02,089 --> 00:38:08,180
have a look at you want to use pace well

00:38:06,319 --> 00:38:10,990
you don't let them give you a directory

00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,990
and as I

00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:20,079
and if it's theirs I would say this and

00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:23,170
we're going to think I'm awful I use the

00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:24,549
mac was ten years ago okay and I had

00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:27,009
this I receipt client called

00:38:24,549 --> 00:38:28,210
colloquy and the one this is like the

00:38:27,009 --> 00:38:30,640
only thing I've ever liked about

00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:32,829
anything back is this one flying in the

00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,420
IRC channel not have to be in okay

00:38:32,829 --> 00:38:37,119
channels those channels you don't want

00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:38,950
this topic track but if somebody posted

00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:43,499
a link to an image it would just load it

00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:43,499
in line in the channel so much

00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:51,200
and that's it was just dead simple just

00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:51,200
did not eng

00:38:54,020 --> 00:39:03,750
right yeah why not shouldn't be should

00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:07,800
be hard not really i can sell something

00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:10,530
and I don't know I'll see okay what the

00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:18,570
if it maybe it's not necessary necessary

00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:20,850
to tuesday yeah wonders right happen

00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:24,810
yeah the people ready throw up pretty

00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:27,630
freaky thanks to your help teach its up

00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:30,380
you know you cannot see in the picture

00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:34,710
you know I had to see to I always

00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:37,140
downloaded and which version was now

00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:43,470
from the dock without him you're strong

00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:45,870
threat yeah we're also doing out ideas

00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:47,820
so like we don't really in oracle record

00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:48,919
of all what was the 20th version of that

00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:51,719
thing that

00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:55,499
go back to the our accent I look at it

00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:59,459
we don't need any other people my budget

00:39:55,499 --> 00:40:05,519
Vietnam it's just a wedding to and type

00:39:59,459 --> 00:40:11,150
post it outside okay I don't have a case

00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:11,150
cool yep cool yes

00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:41,220
they would you can make it pull the

00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:45,240
inversion but I guess my concern mrs.

00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:48,330
somebody a lot of people are feeling

00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:54,090
through the interface somebody might

00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:57,330
start yeah but we have moderation stuff

00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:58,730
so we can shut it down I I mean can you

00:40:57,330 --> 00:41:03,870
believe in the ditch or something

00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:06,770
attachment to britx just going to for

00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:10,050
this set say for this list we turn right

00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:14,120
maybe the design was once that within

00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:14,120
somebody subscribes and trolls

00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:23,650
well there is no murderer no hype

00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:30,850
Achilles specific moderation so it's

00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:38,380
just famous so we have designed this one

00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:40,540
person I motivate each so this is

00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:43,550
moderation

00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:47,120
yes oskaloosa so if he had this guy on

00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:48,950
moderation it would show up and Sophie

00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:50,600
personal stories you would need to

00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:55,790
approve the emails well if you have like

00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:57,980
that people behave badly put the

00:41:55,790 --> 00:42:00,410
moderation it's not gonna stop man

00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:04,210
stammers but if you have good rule set

00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:04,210
up in place by fall

00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:15,460
ya can it's kind of become a bit hairy

00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:17,470
it's okay well I've seen this happen

00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:19,480
before with our mailing list like

00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:21,820
they'll send something so I mailing list

00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:23,890
and it's innocuous there's nothing wrong

00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:27,150
with it they'll get very upset because

00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:27,150
then it gets part5 going

00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:40,490
yeah I don't think there's currently a

00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:42,660
way to delete a post yeah there is no

00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:45,200
party no way to do you posting hyper

00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:45,200
kitty but

00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:59,820
one

00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,820
our base

00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:10,690
so there's anything you can show you

00:43:06,579 --> 00:43:15,880
maybe just regular month based view of

00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:17,950
what is happening to your list that's

00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:22,230
right I have favorited so that's okay

00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:22,230
there are new emails really out there

00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:31,730
oh yeah hello thanks

00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:44,589
sorry

00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:55,210
I don't think that's I don't think I can

00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:58,780
do that yet there is no advanced search

00:43:55,210 --> 00:44:03,640
yes yet where you could have a multiple

00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:07,210
criteria but the tags here are such a we

00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:13,330
can click on them and you would a wait

00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:16,360
oh really hmm well this one I can do it

00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:20,710
because I have said it yes well that

00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:22,510
should okay strike all right this the

00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:24,340
text here you should be able to click

00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:26,620
them and get a list of the threads that

00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:29,260
had this guy I'm not sure you can do

00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:37,750
both they can do we can do multiple tags

00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:41,230
at the same time good question i don't

00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:44,580
know maybe i don't know but it's easy to

00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:44,580
do if necessary yep

00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:59,300
and

00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,700
right

00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:34,350
yeah it I don't I'm kind of what what

00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:38,270
are your differences on that but do you

00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:38,270
need on the server to others running

00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:42,320
right

00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:50,770
right

00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:54,950
yep

00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:59,010
yeah I

00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:08,170
mm-hmm okay I agree with it will be

00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:10,300
interesting I have currently not added

00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:13,540
because of the dependencies and I wanted

00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:15,369
to make it easy to install first and so

00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:19,930
it should be optional I agree with that

00:46:15,369 --> 00:46:21,460
yeah yeah that would be nice that would

00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:26,500
be nice off everything show up in an

00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:38,920
update dynamically yeah cool anytime do

00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:42,550
you have time to cut that go ahead so

00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:44,410
yeah that's about it oh yeah I can just

00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:52,380
answer a question by searching at this

00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:52,380
new interesting time do I get it

00:46:54,020 --> 00:47:02,960
that would be by date of course now I

00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:05,780
don't think doesn't look like I get it

00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:08,090
but it should be should be it should be

00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:18,890
in the South creditor it's very easy to

00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:21,110
it I don't trust my memory at all yes

00:47:18,890 --> 00:47:23,360
you can yeah that's just our wonderful

00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:26,540
ideas are good too you don't have to

00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:33,860
implement everything but but yeah

00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:35,680
working edges it's even better yes

00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:39,260
something else when you are good to my

00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:41,810
if well it's kind of hard to do that

00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:44,270
right now but if I go to subscribe to

00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:46,550
this list here i will get into any i

00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:50,600
will get nice error message now i will

00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:57,530
get into this i get into a post aureus

00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:59,870
which is a web admin UI and this here is

00:47:57,530 --> 00:48:01,760
well that's a view of the list that you

00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:03,560
will not see because that's what that

00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:07,010
means only but you can go to your

00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:08,360
account my setting here and you can add

00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:10,490
different email addresses to your

00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:13,610
account so if you if i'm logged in with

00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:16,460
with this this one here i can add my

00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:17,660
other email addresses and when I see my

00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:22,700
subscription when I look at my

00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:24,080
subscriptions I will it will collect all

00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:26,210
the subscription with the different

00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:28,460
email addresses that i use i have this

00:48:26,210 --> 00:48:29,840
one here but i also have this one here

00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:32,630
that I used to subscribe to different

00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:36,430
lists and I have a historic address that

00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:36,430
is not shown here perfect

00:48:38,970 --> 00:48:48,360
you will get three notes you will get

00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:50,280
three males in that case I don't know

00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:54,900
though oh yeah I know the one you you're

00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:56,970
logged in with but I think if you

00:48:54,900 --> 00:49:01,200
subscribe with two addresses i think you

00:48:56,970 --> 00:49:02,880
will get two emails because well why

00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:14,310
would you want to subscribe with two

00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:16,410
different addresses otherwise yes you

00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:20,250
can still do that you can still go to

00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:30,060
your subscription settings and and and

00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:34,850

00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:34,850
