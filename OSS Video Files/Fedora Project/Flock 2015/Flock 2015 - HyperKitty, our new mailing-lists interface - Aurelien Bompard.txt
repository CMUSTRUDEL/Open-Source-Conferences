Title: Flock 2015 - HyperKitty, our new mailing-lists interface - Aurelien Bompard
Publication date: 2015-08-26
Playlist: Flock 2015
Description: 
	The mailing-lists have always been heavily used across the Fedora Project, but haven't seen a lot of changes since the beginning of Fedora. During that time, web usage has skyrocketed and forum software is very common, being now the type of UI that most users prefer. But other contributors, developers and some users, like mailing-lists better. We don't want to choose between those UIs, we want both, and we want people talking to each other. Mailman, the piece of software that powers our lists, has just been updated to a brand new release. Its new architecture allowed us to contribute a modern and powerful web UI that bridges the gap between those two forms of communication. In this talk you'll learn: - how HyperKitty is deployed and used in the Fedora Infrastructure, - how you can use it to be more efficient and get more meta-information when using the Fedora communication channels - which new features are coming to HyperKitty - how you can hack on it and help the whole project communicate better
