hello

00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:16,550
oh my god I welcome questions and

00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:18,920
comments so feel free go ahead so

00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:23,360
distributing secret my focus i'm talking

00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:28,189
about a problem at possible solution

00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:30,710
wave distributed secrets in networks so

00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:33,850
what happened historical aside from

00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:37,480
their simple game historical secrets

00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:41,510
we're using i saw a boat for what

00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:43,070
usually what happens that the Syrian

00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:47,120
secret just made giving passwords to

00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:48,949
users that was the simple 40 monolithic

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,949
applications even over that person have

00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:55,070
just had one server at one password that

00:00:51,949 --> 00:00:57,980
wasn't very same phone there isn't much

00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:59,539
to distribute except for classic users

00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:02,700
but there was Lynette the problem was

00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:08,680
like interaction wish

00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:11,020
then containers k9k but this event

00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,340
system cakes and distributed consistent

00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:15,700
they contain it up like this to the

00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:18,940
system to the matter so let's see what

00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:20,800
happen what happens there now they're

00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:22,869
not just going to one single place

00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,229
what's the capacity of something now

00:01:22,869 --> 00:01:28,450
people are using directly or through

00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:30,820
devices like a wire funds are the

00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:32,710
services that use other services because

00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:36,520
other services that talk to other things

00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:38,680
and most of this thing to somehow

00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:41,410
authenticate each other because they run

00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,360
on the network and sometimes maybe

00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:45,310
degree virus within network different

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,060
kind of trust maybe within a single

00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:50,500
machine to have connections that I'm not

00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,170
authenticated or maybe even unaffected

00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:56,220
but in most cases you cannot assume that

00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:58,210
it has actually at Prevention's

00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:00,789
certificates when you introduce us

00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:03,810
connections and all I know keys for us

00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:09,149
three or grin other classrooms you have

00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:13,200
furniture thinking of secrets everywhere

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:13,200
in any instances

00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:19,430
so how do people tend to address this

00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:22,130
problem if the illness different system

00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:24,070
i canna microservices we're a bunch of

00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:30,860
volcanoes running off all over and

00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:34,340
services they use provision systems is

00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:36,740
nice big centralized systems with all

00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:40,820
the configurations and on the side own

00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:42,500
passwords in the clear all the admins

00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:45,710
that do anything industries issues

00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:48,320
Kristen can access these data and they

00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:51,830
just get distributed memory to all the

00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:54,080
hassle purveyors some people go to the

00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:56,120
great steps of baking signals or the

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,460
images and then house in them and find

00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:01,340
out over all my hands and keys are there

00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:05,470
what happened why might a cattle truck

00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:09,140
doesn't of dollars per day or maybe in

00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:11,600
git repositories which is also bad

00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:13,100
because if you remove the password

00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,340
accidentally can become a different

00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:18,470
predatory is still there it just passed

00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:22,030
it out but a previous match is still

00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:24,250
interpreter so it's kind of an

00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:27,140
interesting

00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:29,900
big and if you're doing that yeah

00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:31,940
there's a problem told me you're

00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,560
officially give me four things you do

00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:38,209
and I find five things you have been

00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:42,650
wrong but execute button so we're on the

00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:44,930
same boat battery the main thing i think

00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:47,900
that people need to really realize

00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:50,959
especially in infrastructure is that

00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:53,900
secrets are not configuration sure

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:57,050
secrets are kind of a figure and

00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,730
applications very often but they have

00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:01,700
enough configuration most of the case of

00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:04,010
configuration can always be public there

00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:07,120
shouldn't be much in your configuration

00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:10,670
files that really compromise here

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:13,810
critically either except except for

00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:13,810
secret which are

00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:23,580
so maybe there is a better wife and I

00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:26,490
don't like you re maybe in Derek be able

00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:29,040
to compete for them so let's start of

00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:30,750
the final in the problem space and if

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,970
anybody speaks it on you know what

00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,710
should it be so good don't worry about a

00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:37,550
cup and accurately and after it means

00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:37,550
something

00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:42,849
so that's why things I kind of

00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:49,140
find out are really interesting when

00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,090
they take a problem i distribute all

00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:54,780
this ticket to have around in a plant

00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:58,020
and on our how to provide a secret

00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:00,360
update them preserve them protect them

00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:03,090
and finally out of them so in the next

00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:06,140
few slides that two statements about

00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:09,060
having any of these problems and one is

00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:10,860
what happens in traditional provisioning

00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:13,110
system is used to distribute this

00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:17,670
information and what happened if you

00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:20,100
were to sleep yet so provides it what

00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:22,050
does it make you get a secret form

00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:24,000
application and need to private it so

00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:26,970
you have a bunch of containers that new

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,600
taxes an orphan system hardware giving

00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:33,600
credentials all the classic revisionist

00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:38,790
system will just have this user or pass

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:42,510
or key in fig.5 which which is pushed to

00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:44,910
the machine in may carry world what

00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:46,860
happen is that if you can you make the

00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:49,650
application actually for the secret shop

00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:52,550
when they did or you have a helper is

00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:57,270
posing when you started you don't

00:05:52,550 --> 00:06:00,780
babysitter in the present system update

00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:02,400
what does it mean well crisis might be

00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:06,370
compromised

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:09,220
or make them so in the tradition of a

00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:11,500
region in worm or you can do is to

00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:13,810
change the configuration some point and

00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:16,690
then push our new configuration problem

00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:20,680
which the servicing of filmmaking radius

00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:22,960
near secret music maker you can have

00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,340
notifications and have application

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,290
actually pull it when it's ready and

00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:29,670
without maybe even your starting the

00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:33,190
application just stop using a music

00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:36,130
preserve so these this is something that

00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:38,200
acts mostly the container were and I

00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:40,120
think in a container water have images

00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,770
but when you have me to do updates for

00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,350
to do is that you just wipe the image in

00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:47,110
every log a new one and you have the

00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:48,790
problem data they have to preserve part

00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:50,950
of these data usually is password access

00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:54,220
or service because yes one thing suffer

00:06:50,950 --> 00:07:00,310
but we won't just keep collecting

00:06:54,220 --> 00:07:02,230
and so again you need to have a way to

00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:03,700
either preserve these credentials in a

00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:05,620
way that when the container just started

00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:10,060
are still there or you need to inject

00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:11,840
them and here they are what happens when

00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:16,050
the revisions

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:18,270
justices are a club again the nacre case

00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:20,610
you just look at the picture política so

00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:23,639
you don't care how you update they don't

00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:25,590
have a preserve is there something is in

00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:30,419
the service that hands up secrets and

00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:32,490
applications of the hotpoint protect so

00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:34,560
how do you leave an access to the city

00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:37,889
and one of the big issues i see ethics

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,960
and you can provision in system is that

00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:41,820
you have this all this bunch of sticker

00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,410
for all these applications and the

00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:45,630
provision system uses in the hands of a

00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:47,430
specific group of people I raise this

00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:49,169
group of people access to all the

00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:51,289
credentials for all the applications

00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:54,300
even though they are not disturbing

00:07:51,289 --> 00:07:58,500
manage the application maybe just try

00:07:54,300 --> 00:08:00,849
the service to push popular genre in the

00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:04,569
working world and I categories

00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:06,819
and do is it can access control we need

00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:08,919
specific seekers maybe database ticket

00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:11,709
on only two people together only to the

00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:14,619
application address specifically this

00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:16,869
season of all accessible the same time

00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:18,909
same place item people i don't have to

00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:21,039
have people get it right what if someone

00:08:18,909 --> 00:08:23,619
sends a burner configuration browser and

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:29,770
you don't have to worry that much about

00:08:23,619 --> 00:08:32,440
that hands and find it all so how do i

00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:36,370
know that a secret lobbying purple box

00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:39,099
in a traditional cage for me just after

00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:44,769
yeah sometimes used to scripting

00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:49,860
directions you have to start it at an

00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:52,800
epic are seeing an NFS I mean yeah

00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:55,320
best impossible actually retrofitted

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,640
auditing and such a system so that we

00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:02,820
can track who has seen this secret code

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:05,360
in a cat world much easier you will have

00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:08,250
one service that has a faster learner

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,410
what app knows what application is

00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,910
trying to pull it and so they can drop

00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:14,399
that much more easy because you have

00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:16,050
just two points the place where their

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,519
store and the place that has to commence

00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:21,709
you don't have owned our infrastructure

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,709
amido it's not for service secret

00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:31,630
but what I am talking about IP i right

00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:34,480
how do i add indicate any tie I don't

00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:36,610
have secrets well here's where preceded

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:41,259
by I'm talking all the time out

00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:42,839
applications write the day is a great

00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:46,449
question that i'm talking about

00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:52,569
applications you kind of have to trust

00:09:46,449 --> 00:09:55,209
the house but it barrett at least first

00:09:52,569 --> 00:09:59,100
can be something i want to define that

00:09:55,209 --> 00:10:02,259
in the cases that I've been looking at

00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:05,259
sickest one hour the ends or containers

00:10:02,259 --> 00:10:07,120
involved you have to trust the Houston

00:10:05,259 --> 00:10:09,339
snow white the house is active story it

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,810
doesn't matter what happens the house

00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:12,250
will have a personal research that we

00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:16,569
need in the end it's all within the

00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:18,940
context just another way around so you

00:10:16,569 --> 00:10:21,759
have to press their host what you have

00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:24,100
to do is that provision of the house is

00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:26,290
not solar power yet but it's probably

00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:28,899
much easier to handle that where your

00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:30,010
asana credentials to the home first and

00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:31,390
then it doesn't matter how many

00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:34,450
applications around

00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:37,120
yes you have something you can trust

00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:43,270
there and you can build that trust the

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:48,010
transfer of everything else so let's see

00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:49,870
an example you scale that come out the

00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:54,040
made me think about this problem first

00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:55,420
and why inclusion in API is probably

00:10:54,040 --> 00:11:00,340
much better than to reach our vision

00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:03,910
system so we had a problem trying to get

00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:07,120
free again running contains at least

00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:11,140
just a tryout it could be made aware and

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:13,150
prepared by itself if you don't know

00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:16,240
what it is it's just that and then we

00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:18,520
measured system always like a

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:22,000
centralized authentication system that

00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:24,070
has ton of secrets in it and it allows

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,220
you to authenticate on your point and

00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:28,780
one of the features of criteria is that

00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:32,430
it is distributed in the sense it can

00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:34,690
have multiple servers all sort of same

00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:38,230
kind information and have to replicate

00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:41,500
it for each other so when you have a set

00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:43,450
up another copy to a lot balance do you

00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:47,910
know just geographically distributed

00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:50,550
your service we had a pretty manual

00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:53,640
system where you go on

00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:55,890
it's just an existing server will run a

00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:58,170
command that generates a GP g encrypted

00:11:55,890 --> 00:12:00,600
file we need all the necessary secret to

00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:04,790
Greece drop a new server that you have

00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:07,740
to transfer these five new server

00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:09,839
physically be there or for sticking

00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,360
they're putting a couple of boxes to

00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:15,420
unpack the gbg file get all these things

00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:22,190
now and boots truck is new image using

00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:25,410
server it works if these rapid secure

00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:28,890
its it doesn't scale in the dynamic

00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:31,010
environment very hot chocolate because

00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:33,300
you have to have very privileged access

00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:36,300
to both the machines don't you have to

00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:39,000
install and one existing one it's a lot

00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:42,079
of steps you have to do transplant ah I

00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,079
can be kind of

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,820
plus we were adding features like this

00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:54,340
google subsea a feature we allow you to

00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:57,220
create multiple CA instances with that

00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:59,140
yay where you can do that on the fly and

00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:00,970
later on across this is the healthiest

00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:04,150
and install distributed I don't know

00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:07,180
that 15-20 service and when you create a

00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:08,800
new CAA you create a new subject but at

00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:10,780
CIA when your private key and you need

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,200
to distribute that so a number of

00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:16,780
chickens we have not only need to be

00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:19,660
distributed epic on you create in your

00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:21,040
corner of the system but at times you

00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:23,140
are normal touching that you have to

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:27,940
transfer them in a dynamic way on the

00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:30,250
fly and that doesn't work good what an

00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:32,620
advocate Lucien that goes and blocks on

00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:36,700
your the service rapid speed paint

00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:40,540
another strawberry you're probably

00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:44,050
goodness of the problem so we needed to

00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:46,960
have one way to fetch now credentials

00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:49,270
observer a second rendered transfer them

00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:51,280
and i were to authorize access the

00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:53,880
Mystics these are the three main issues

00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,880
we have

00:13:54,550 --> 00:14:00,399
so what I need to be able to perform

00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:03,040
actions well I mean I can in the service

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,600
two sequences I cannot do that manually

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,080
I really need a service through that

00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:10,870
link i adopted I need to be able to

00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:16,690
previous formation at rest and in

00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:19,360
transit and you know I don't technically

00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:22,690
the rest of you either they sent us

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,910
together and I either especially a

00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:28,350
modular design because what they give

00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:32,350
out this thing I kept coming across

00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:36,310
other similar problems in sewer

00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:38,019
application of a soccer game but Connor

00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:39,880
eyes and occasionally have this kind of

00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:42,120
problem so I wanted something was module

00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:46,540
or not that it could be easy to extend

00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:48,430
who usually another situation and well

00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:51,250
thinking about things like open for

00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:52,959
example another service that are not

00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:56,709
just even infrastructure that go all the

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:59,589
way the user and have multi-tenancy that

00:14:56,709 --> 00:15:02,350
was also a German are able to proxy

00:14:59,589 --> 00:15:06,190
around this data and

00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:10,660
many masses say I wanted something very

00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:14,790
broad and so I decided to build a

00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:14,790
prototype and this prototype was they

00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:22,810
meant to create a basic such a ride for

00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:27,970
38 days I could use it in there but also

00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:31,060
explore the promises I wanted to build

00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:34,150
it as an HTTP server mostly because the

00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:36,670
container to the latest dr. Deb option

00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:41,320
one is really involved HTTP and it's

00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:44,110
kind of the new IP transport of up in

00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:46,330
the world but I wanted it to be able to

00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:48,519
missile unique socket because I want to

00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:52,490
be able to use

00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:54,980
extractor fan on Captain next problem

00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:57,699
was how do I make sure that within

00:15:54,980 --> 00:16:00,199
transfer secrets I can do that secure

00:15:57,699 --> 00:16:02,260
this it was suspicious visiting

00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:05,330
important

00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:07,790
looking at what they could use to

00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:11,450
encrypt data over the wire in a white

00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:13,610
and wasn't invented by me and I knew

00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:16,880
amanda j that river is not a project

00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:18,800
that justify meows a standard now thank

00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:23,540
us traumatized while i was building it

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:26,420
and that's just a hawaii is jason and a

00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:30,800
bunch of privileged do great tokens

00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:33,830
creep the horse song over any data have

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:36,320
any Jason structure and had the pricker

00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:42,440
song plays on Keys impersonating over

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:46,910
the land and also k is existed so other

00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:51,260
than working and it worked as a kind of

00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:54,740
pipeline to be your are you passing is

00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:57,770
basically the address of the secret or

00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:59,810
crashes on taxes it could be local very

00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:02,720
good variation yes very simple so you

00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:05,079
have this filing ones and ask please

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:13,419
everyone you have a service one

00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:14,949
give me the signal it can also be if

00:17:13,419 --> 00:17:16,689
it's ever immediately if you're talking

00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:19,480
to the serve the actually has my secrets

00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:23,019
or maybe that service a moment a single

00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:26,949
knows how I wear to my regular quests

00:17:23,019 --> 00:17:30,429
and just passing it on the net server

00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:32,740
and in movies URI and change it up and

00:17:30,429 --> 00:17:35,289
stuff or actually prevent stuff whatever

00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:37,990
fence them and that can go to another

00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:41,220
shirt whatever that is useful is where

00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:44,019
you can have making a lot of the secrets

00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:46,750
store in one system and part of other

00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:48,639
for a reason there's a base on which

00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:52,389
security asking you could be redirected

00:17:48,639 --> 00:17:56,880
to different services any one hand up

00:17:52,389 --> 00:17:56,880
translating that again into database /

00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:05,620
both requests and work at the coming and

00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:08,559
the president go bible second respondent

00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:10,799
anybody want and it's just example to

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,799
show how

00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:21,530
so how do we transfer sages in this

00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:26,740
product I came up with two API is on a

00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:31,160
simple fact of simple are you just going

00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:33,800
contact service a task force to goodbye

00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:37,640
Meg and it hasn't leakage get back to

00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:40,340
you as you can see i'm not showing any

00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:42,380
investigation here authentication can be

00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:44,980
formidable whatever you want it would

00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:48,140
probably something a header it was a

00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:51,320
stupid message far and we send the

00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:54,680
pastor there have problems but we be off

00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:56,450
could be just API that there be anything

00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:59,440
or it'll be just about communiqués i'm

00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:02,320
using and then we adjust

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,240
check what is the cost of the other side

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:08,080
of is the acid in each life of it has on

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:12,549
so authentication or an organization is

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:15,090
kind of legion also we poor people who

00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:17,850
study but it's not I'd like to do any

00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:20,799
specific application architecture money

00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:24,580
and the stores think the same we just

00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:26,500
put and if you're a lot to do something

00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:31,330
in the namespace that you choose in this

00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:35,470
case yes then we get back okay you put

00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:37,360
your ticket or is the very simple one

00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:40,840
the simple one has a maximum problem

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,490
everything is in the clear so image you

00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:45,779
with problem with that I don't want a

00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:45,779
collection of connection

00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:57,870
this is the more complex it's still just

00:19:53,610 --> 00:20:00,530
thing yet and you still have to provide

00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:03,750
the name of the secret of operation but

00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:07,050
then you have to provide something else

00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:10,560
that's something else it's a JW so web

00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:12,690
token defensively solid potential

00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:15,450
encrypted believe this gaze at care

00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:19,080
about the sign request this weekend trip

00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:20,820
on the protocol requires you to basics

00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,830
different curve things because you know

00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:26,210
you're sending you our eyes to web

00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:30,360
service but for these three pieces

00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:34,290
parent Jason blocks Vicente general are

00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:38,220
the first ones header header he's not

00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:40,530
perfect it is protected but you have to

00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:44,100
be careful when you are sick because you

00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:47,310
will read it before you can verify and

00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:49,140
it contains the publicly identified so

00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:53,610
it remains a little higher public key

00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:56,490
the revolution H&M and that you use your

00:20:53,610 --> 00:21:00,150
private papers to sign

00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:03,120
and we'll also to an algorithm that you

00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:08,260
can choose many other

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:09,940
Jose starla you can choose one one of

00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:13,560
those on the other side you can choose

00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:19,810
to accept that then are the class and

00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:21,790
this is completely arbitrary standard

00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:26,890
service so that came up with police

00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:29,560
arrested one is these subject which has

00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:33,940
to be correspond what we were asking

00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:36,550
they have to put into the request the

00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:39,640
name of the secret this way I can as we

00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:44,100
silently without having to do anything

00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:50,090
for I self and you have to bother

00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:53,220
send a query then another one signature

00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:54,840
on a special time you want to do that

00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:57,419
because you don't want to have some will

00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:59,160
be able to capture very fast and then we

00:21:57,419 --> 00:22:03,480
fight later maybe after think vertical

00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:06,480
to the Crypt their teams to just like

00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:09,270
there was something and then another

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,370
value value much too long when you're

00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:14,429
trying to put the secret because they're

00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:16,460
supervised and then you get the

00:22:14,429 --> 00:22:21,590
signature when the signature signs

00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:26,640
reflective all times so you replace

00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:30,140
finally key it reveals that check the

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,140
signature and then you trust

00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:39,490
and then we get to the ceiling clock

00:22:36,309 --> 00:22:41,500
then the service need to send you back

00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:43,630
the city requested this point of

00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:45,040
creatures is English necessary because I

00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:48,070
don't know whether this thing is going

00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:51,130
out of here now it probably won't use

00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:56,380
the ls little way around things but it

00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:58,390
won't have to and is yet another is a

00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:01,420
webcam but at least K is using the end

00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:04,360
this web encryption work of blacks as

00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:07,049
part parts one is the energy use one

00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:11,370
although in addition to the excitement

00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:16,140
you also have to provide it originally

00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:18,700
then rings are the actual encrypted key

00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:21,640
or the whole bob is not encrypted

00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:25,360
directly you will never part of a party

00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:28,929
hat but you create a temporary cement

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:30,390
their only that's a little disappointed

00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:34,530
with your

00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:36,920
i thinkI in this case the service from

00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:36,920
usual

00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:46,960
party initialization vector be needed by

00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:51,330
the encryption algorithm features so if

00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,330
you may yet succeed you have 90

00:23:52,770 --> 00:24:00,070
psychopaths that things in here come in

00:23:56,590 --> 00:24:03,700
the key in here and another indication

00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:07,320
that to verify that the encryption was

00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:07,320
actually faster

00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:21,080
that's it so that's for the problem of

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:27,550
it is to present two tokens types and

00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:31,790
that's it now authentication director

00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:35,230
usually in there creating a different

00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:37,580
way and here is how you profess to

00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:39,860
configure time there's a computer five

00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:43,040
blocks to the civil service and you can

00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:45,920
say authentication header header is the

00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:49,820
name of the model it has handler which

00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:51,260
is a python module potential of

00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:57,430
aggression and this game is it one of

00:24:51,260 --> 00:25:00,880
the example classes which simply uses

00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:04,790
priests the header remote user and

00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:08,150
digital so that's something we want to

00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:10,100
use directing our network it's more

00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:13,520
interesting where you have a proxy

00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:15,140
between you and historian that actually

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,640
does some of application and then sticks

00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:22,710
we go

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:25,590
request there are a few of these version

00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:27,750
available to the project and then

00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:31,289
there's an exam optimization directly

00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:35,580
instead of Z and this is taken from the

00:25:31,289 --> 00:25:38,220
arcade product in the hassle temple is

00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:41,610
it says this is it anything on there

00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:43,650
flash keys in your eyes I can buy it and

00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:46,470
there is not as much geez just think a

00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:50,370
lot of fire it tells you that the store

00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:54,870
can use IPA and was directed at

00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:57,320
different story and as you work sir the

00:25:54,870 --> 00:26:01,020
best and easiest views when you're

00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:03,620
signing and encryption tokens and red

00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,620
shirt on

00:26:05,849 --> 00:26:14,619
so how does it work within rkin you have

00:26:12,249 --> 00:26:17,109
one provision instead and that the

00:26:14,619 --> 00:26:21,039
reasons that a story in that p.m. server

00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:24,309
user has a lot of storage the public key

00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:27,129
that you want to trust for exchange a

00:26:24,309 --> 00:26:30,909
few material was added incentive public

00:26:27,129 --> 00:26:34,029
key in elba the corresponding private

00:26:30,909 --> 00:26:36,700
key can make requests and accept any of

00:26:34,029 --> 00:26:38,799
the students communication and that

00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:40,299
publicly has to be stored specific

00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:49,570
flights around after all the habits

00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:52,509
Laxus then you can start creating new

00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:56,499
server replica or simply an urban center

00:26:52,509 --> 00:26:59,080
stone is just to remove key it will send

00:26:56,499 --> 00:27:03,369
the request sign the topic trip before

00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:07,059
using some honky but the study will do

00:27:03,369 --> 00:27:09,700
is look at if that he's available elva

00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:12,830
it is available in the patch also

00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:17,090
encryption public key because

00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:19,700
keep air in this case find out in the

00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:21,799
secrets of a loop wrap it up encrypted

00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:25,730
in their encryption Afghanistan Iraq and

00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:27,710
that's it how do we do of the division

00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:33,169
conversation this case is interesting

00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:37,309
the idak any machine is drawn and terror

00:27:33,169 --> 00:27:40,940
has a key town so there is a best beer

00:27:37,309 --> 00:27:44,510
double opt application system one is in

00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:49,190
order to even talk to story you must

00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:52,519
have Akita and you must be losing this

00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:57,019
together negation against the web server

00:27:52,519 --> 00:28:00,889
password server IP install if you are a

00:27:57,019 --> 00:28:02,600
prized there then the passwords have a

00:28:00,889 --> 00:28:04,370
proxy to your request to a terrific

00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:08,260
start a new one which is listening only

00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:13,159
on a local soccer until you will check

00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:17,210
that the service send a request has the

00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:21,110
Apache guity and has the SMS context of

00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:26,649
Apache and you will check that the road

00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:26,649
user can't reset actually

00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:38,620
and that after contains the actual

00:28:32,409 --> 00:28:41,840
principal name Keita 30 years that game

00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:47,210
that principal named allows you to go in

00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:49,669
and out and search for entry that has

00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:55,039
the physical name in it and the two

00:28:49,669 --> 00:28:56,870
properties so it doesn't matter really a

00:28:55,039 --> 00:29:00,710
descendant of the key in the Simon

00:28:56,870 --> 00:29:02,570
Templar we only allowed you to access

00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:05,120
the public is by are associated with

00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:06,799
that principle and then we double check

00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,630
the diagraph course they will check the

00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:10,730
signature but if they're on the brown

00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:13,429
keys so if you get access to the key

00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:16,610
done but you don't get access the

00:29:13,429 --> 00:29:18,409
designing keys is there an IT service

00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:22,809
and vice versa so you have to have both

00:29:18,409 --> 00:29:22,809
the kingdom and encryption

00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:27,750
and that's all

00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:43,040
okay so you can have to contain

00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:43,040
tomorrow you have something

00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:58,230
how yeah yeah so let's try to do better

00:29:53,220 --> 00:30:01,200
with this which this one so that's a

00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:03,090
good question so in this case you can

00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,520
imagine that this one is a written

00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:10,500
amazing local gusto destroyed and these

00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:13,470
forms actually contain so this one will

00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:15,570
probably be related somehow if you're

00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:16,890
using google nexus for example Tokra but

00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:21,030
we will make it to that in the sense

00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:24,000
that when they spin a container they

00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:27,000
will tell their servers or maybe because

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:31,890
they're single query what is the

00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:34,080
container ID so on and what is the

00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:36,030
socket is Potemkin phone home so when

00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:40,590
this for their of that log on a unix

00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:42,390
target local tradition and only now real

00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:45,310
up

00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:48,130
because we ask the operating system who

00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:50,620
is a UID other side what is the socket

00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:52,720
installing any harm and then we can

00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:56,350
match that the container that point this

00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:58,050
one knows who's the container and then

00:30:56,350 --> 00:31:01,750
it can use for example TLS certificate

00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:05,320
to comendo centralized histories and ask

00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:08,640
for between this secret and you know

00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,640
augment here

00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,620
either with the name of the painter or

00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:16,380
more probable to a label that is

00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:18,990
associated I pampanga that the remote to

00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:23,760
the same all about so if you have let's

00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:25,950
say three application to permit bunch of

00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,250
containers that do I didn't work for us

00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:30,600
to location button containers that to

00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:33,930
run a frigate gear and a bunch of

00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:35,550
container to do something else then when

00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:37,260
one of these containers compact the

00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:42,300
robot to exert that will get a label

00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:46,310
basically workers so when they will ask

00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:52,050
the next one it would put more pressing

00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:54,690
now the other one will know that the

00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:56,190
server can't ask for more press secrets

00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:58,590
because it's one of the house and is

00:31:56,190 --> 00:32:02,130
allowed granted wordpress com panies and

00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:03,730
then trust was host that he's asked to

00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:05,920
be have

00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:08,800
or crystal tennis elbow hopefully

00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:10,840
request if you have your setup setup we

00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:13,690
are serving them in a white where you

00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:16,450
have only specific post doing stuff with

00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:19,840
more pressing Congress pacific coast to

00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:22,810
a stop to create and the host that

00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:25,389
Gilbert crustal pain is passing we

00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:29,969
create a level the central system

00:32:25,389 --> 00:32:34,200
now that first is information your life

00:32:29,969 --> 00:32:37,690
so basically you have a chain of trust

00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:41,220
by which you can segment and partition

00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:44,720
or infrastructure know to which

00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:44,720
specific single now of course it's

00:32:55,039 --> 00:33:03,000
possible right so that's something that

00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:06,090
is not feel at all like ooh studies will

00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,970
be flexible so it's probably 15 lines

00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:12,510
thing to be honest simple transition

00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:15,390
phase and that get what I want to

00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:20,120
protect an external systems for policies

00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:22,049
or not my idea is that if we can

00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:24,840
something like this something like

00:33:22,049 --> 00:33:27,929
turbulence on dr. google is already

00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:30,179
using tcp to do stuff you so you would

00:33:27,929 --> 00:33:32,100
have a policy and then moving around

00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:35,179
eight books of accounts at least the

00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:38,250
harpies will get that process where and

00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:40,049
how we can be slave all day and we

00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:43,020
already know how to label this contains

00:33:40,049 --> 00:33:45,450
these parts plans simpler the only thing

00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:48,120
to do is to associate okay no pretense

00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:51,780
of label and then the only needs to know

00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:53,610
where to go next that the central things

00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:57,030
will be more perplexed

00:33:53,610 --> 00:34:01,350
have some berenice anyone who's are

00:33:57,030 --> 00:34:03,900
allowed to do what but again nothing

00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:06,480
impossible and easy to manage in the

00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:09,480
center of everything in a few

00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,850
centralized places and you managed over

00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:14,460
secret there or you can say with a

00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:17,300
double you can update secrets army admin

00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:20,300
from another coat all sort of things

00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:20,300
that's

00:34:21,619 --> 00:34:32,179
also system so in the government is

00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:38,389
incorrect expect that there will be

00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:42,750
instance of Australia serving cannon or

00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:45,329
what well again that's actually deploy

00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:49,109
the decision so if you're doing your own

00:34:45,329 --> 00:34:52,379
infrastructure you hold it up to battle

00:34:49,109 --> 00:34:54,599
then if you just place at astoria share

00:34:52,379 --> 00:34:58,380
it on the house now and be done with

00:34:54,599 --> 00:35:00,450
everything just talk to it but you're

00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:02,579
running under that that's a good point

00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:04,920
sir given in this case I have different

00:35:02,579 --> 00:35:09,150
applications running on top of that how

00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:14,549
I can make sure that my civil server and

00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:17,760
my paramount messaging server they don't

00:35:14,549 --> 00:35:20,160
try to ask for cigarettes from the mount

00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:23,490
so as I said you can have a sound like

00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:26,730
doctor you will have a way to know based

00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:28,079
on the socket who's asking for

00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:30,059
information at the very least you have a

00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,640
user ID of the process of its funding

00:35:30,059 --> 00:35:36,420
and probably in the similar to they go

00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:38,900
on vascular case you have to be able to

00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,900
dynamically

00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:47,119
yes label but on the lotto system and

00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:49,369
easy experience who as long as we have

00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:51,319
that information provider someone who

00:35:49,369 --> 00:35:54,650
have made got to press the publish

00:35:51,319 --> 00:35:57,079
that's that's their only if I wear or we

00:35:54,650 --> 00:36:00,109
set up your system in a region rights of

00:35:57,079 --> 00:36:03,220
you know yet you know specifically you

00:36:00,109 --> 00:36:03,220
need specific areas

00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:11,119
I think it's for interesting this case

00:36:08,869 --> 00:36:14,960
may be where you have to actually over

00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:17,509
the network at the side for two but I

00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,000
would ever say that this is not an ally

00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:22,039
because of the opponent random container

00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,220
can be run and this case is more about

00:36:22,039 --> 00:36:26,869
policy so here your body label and there

00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:30,650
you have a more rigid policy to

00:36:26,869 --> 00:36:32,660
associate a label with a hand and so if

00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:36,289
it's all your infrastructure in order /

00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:39,230
reputation probably if it is a more

00:36:36,289 --> 00:36:42,200
complex system write down how much it

00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:46,039
online or you have actually two parts we

00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:47,480
have infrastructure people and you have

00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:49,970
a tandem and the family can have

00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:52,130
multiple applications in that case we

00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:53,990
you may have a three-layer approach

00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:57,700
where you have a host system that

00:36:53,990 --> 00:37:00,799
allowed us something to a container

00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:03,410
storage memory but that containers is of

00:37:00,799 --> 00:37:06,849
Alabama panel which is besides phone

00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:06,849
policy it's completely different

00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:15,400
infrastructure clauses but its own but

00:37:12,109 --> 00:37:17,810
it did I stated that this is flexible

00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:20,570
bicycle pipeline your horse back so

00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:22,490
theoretically you have a group of

00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:24,770
containers that represent an application

00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:27,619
and each roof of containers could have

00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:30,950
their own just 32 server they could with

00:37:27,619 --> 00:37:33,500
each of them that would decide yeah you

00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:36,710
probably most probably have just one of

00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:38,240
those to their service pennant even if

00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:39,950
you have 10 applications you just don't

00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:42,890
want because it's you don't want to have

00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:44,660
to manage that out there so you will

00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:47,480
have access code for at least within

00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:49,040
your service members to know what the

00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:52,760
big your home so one of the amount of

00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:56,540
ethical leg space it's easy just click

00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:59,330
the local database where you have a

00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:01,700
secret my name's thanks to have I don't

00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:03,279
want to impress the namespace that have

00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:06,880
a nice day

00:38:03,279 --> 00:38:10,469
canasta expect these labels will trigger

00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,469
everything there's a lot of taxes

00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:18,220
and your configuration politics then you

00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:20,740
can have different authorization

00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:23,440
providers where our paths but do those

00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:27,549
staff like I have a default provider

00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:29,170
reaction / and / through be something

00:38:27,549 --> 00:38:35,170
yeah they can be stacked there some

00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:37,599
relations there especially for three so

00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:40,000
they're ordering I might be an issue if

00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:41,500
you want to do strange things but the

00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,260
nice thing is that these are patent

00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:46,150
classes if you just give me because if

00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:48,040
you cannot resolve something you can

00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:50,530
always get a sub class and then you do

00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:55,619
your own thing and I did they do that by

00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:58,329
okay actually so it's kind of flexible

00:38:55,619 --> 00:39:00,869
up to your heretical you're usually

00:38:58,329 --> 00:39:04,150
probably wanted I think you can do the

00:39:00,869 --> 00:39:06,069
salinity that you use to authorization

00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:08,440
talking to the same time one texted you

00:39:06,069 --> 00:39:13,480
are you and one checks very well then

00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:18,540
Heather I check though right like it yes

00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:18,540
that the people passed Murray are a fail

00:39:23,299 --> 00:39:30,450
yep have you written your own German you

00:39:27,809 --> 00:39:33,150
know how it works all product yes so

00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:34,829
many people came to me while I'm writing

00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:36,750
this thing I've seen this call whole

00:39:34,829 --> 00:39:39,569
thing and the thing is quite interesting

00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:41,940
as a project the main difference is that

00:39:39,569 --> 00:39:45,240
both is not maybe I involved is a

00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:47,130
natural storage solution it's true today

00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:49,680
you know they don't have to go to the

00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:52,829
whole database but it's not like you can

00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:54,809
proxy to involved or anything basically

00:39:52,829 --> 00:39:57,170
it's different things I seek restore

00:39:54,809 --> 00:40:00,180
their something useful in the back end

00:39:57,170 --> 00:40:03,000
so maybe you noticed on the store always

00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:05,579
on stuff involved and basically from

00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,890
hands balled exposing actually a scene

00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:10,450
where a guy because for most uses you

00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:13,250
don't actually care about that mate

00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:15,550
the cases just need to store to a secret

00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:17,870
but it won't happen again access control

00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:19,760
so I see their example anything and

00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:22,250
manage access controls or anything what

00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:24,890
kind of cell sort of out of band maybe

00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:26,960
not exposed publications at all

00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:30,020
and so yeah both there is a vote

00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:32,510
featured in IPA as well but we can still

00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:34,580
secret unfortunately same name and

00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:36,650
they're coming at the same time but they

00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:39,080
vote through the same thing they

00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:41,540
actually do the final step of storing

00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:48,370
something somewhere but they don't have

00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:48,370
any of the pipeline feature so you

00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:56,470
I have worked into yet because idea yeah

00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:58,869
I haven't working for lettuce yet I

00:40:56,470 --> 00:41:01,410
think finishing the integration of

00:40:58,869 --> 00:41:03,730
babies are we actually need these for

00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:06,820
feature come is coming out in the next

00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:09,700
version actually permanent the normal

00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:11,380
machine to erotica and for the subsea

00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:13,150
eight meters are agree that they talk

00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:16,300
like that and actually that if

00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:20,800
demonstrated ok action points for you so

00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:23,170
now almost done and I consider the basic

00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:26,109
IPA when I'm solid because it's actually

00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:31,900
tested by me it wants to do the whole

00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:35,700
thing so then I don't try to expand the

00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:40,300
years to random applications to find out

00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:43,410
so yeah the plan is to look at probably

00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:46,160
building a module in girl so they can be

00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:53,870
embedded by dr. Cooper meta

00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:56,000
you have yeah but when I your neck yeah

00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:58,970
I don't plan to push you know the doctor

00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:02,000
soon as what you spied on the cell but

00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:04,430
that's what we had okay the core is

00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:08,540
simple stop translating to electrically

00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:10,990
feel your energy and will the plug-in be

00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:16,490
beautiful or you know to rerun go now

00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:18,470
the power just bite on the targets are

00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:24,980
really i think the most common spark

00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:26,600
plug ins probably at the rest ago but

00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:29,900
was important for me is to create a

00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:33,520
structure that is probable but now when

00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:36,760
they want innocent but hopefully

00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,760
perfectly works

00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:42,970
