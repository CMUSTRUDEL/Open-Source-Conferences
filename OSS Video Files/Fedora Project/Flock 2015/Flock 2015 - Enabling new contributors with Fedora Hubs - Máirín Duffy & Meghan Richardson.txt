Publication date: 2015-08-26
Playlist: Flock 2015
Description: 
	Come learn about the design and current development progress of Fedora Hubs, which is a new social-media style playground to enable Fedora contributors. This space will make it easier for folks who are non-packager contributors to collaborate by providing them more integrated tools.

okay cool hi so my name is moe

00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,630
we've been working on a project this

00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:12,460
summer called fedora house it's been

00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:15,580
Megan's big intern project this summer

00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:20,130
I'm a UI designer on the Fedora

00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:21,880
engineering team the user experience

00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:24,310
d

00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:27,189
and we're just going to walk you guys

00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:29,439
through the Fedora hubs project we want

00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:32,529
to start kind of with where did this

00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:35,230
come from why are you doing this what

00:00:32,529 --> 00:00:37,149
what is it going to do megan is going to

00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:39,010
walk you through some of the mock-ups

00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:40,629
that she came up with this summer for

00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:43,089
some of the major features just sort of

00:00:40,629 --> 00:00:44,649
like overview highlights and then we're

00:00:43,089 --> 00:00:46,899
going to show you the actual running

00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:48,579
prototype right now the code that's in

00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:50,800
place which it's not as far as the

00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:52,809
backups but it's still you got something

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,960
there and then we'll kind of conclude

00:00:52,809 --> 00:01:01,119
hopefully with rails help with some

00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:03,309
information about how you can help us so

00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:05,259
the idea for for our hubs is that it'll

00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:07,960
kind of serve as like a fedora project

00:01:05,259 --> 00:01:09,450
internet and so like to consolidate all

00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,710
the information because right now

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,630
although contributor information is

00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:15,340
across like a million different apps and

00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:18,250
it can get really confusing

00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:20,259
so in sort of consolidate that and also

00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:22,030
kind of serves like a social network to

00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:26,609
kind of streamline communication between

00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:30,369
your ears so the goals then of our to

00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:32,319
help new contributors get on boarded

00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:34,689
because it can be really confusing to

00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:36,549
try and start keep your readings and you

00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:38,950
want to make it easy and accessible as

00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:40,079
possible to get involved and then look

00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:42,810
without before streamline communication

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,219
and the kind of workflow areas among

00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,739
experienced fedora contributors without

00:01:45,219 --> 00:01:51,099
actually disrupting the things that do

00:01:47,739 --> 00:01:53,319
work fine so kind of makes kind of a

00:01:51,099 --> 00:01:55,739
bonus but not force anybody to use

00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:55,739
something but

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:02,399
so this is sort of the beginning of

00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:05,789
Fedora hugs it's actually whiteboard I'm

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:10,080
still having erased Oh sometime in March

00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:12,420
2014 me and Ryan March and matthew

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,310
Miller were just talking about also

00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,510
within our next we kind of have to

00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:18,269
figure out where we're going to our

00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:22,440
website because I one product website so

00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:23,819
we started breaking down like we even

00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,380
like we list it out like these are

00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:27,300
things that people use the wiki for

00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:30,209
right like these are for develop dogs

00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:32,459
personal pages strategy worked like all

00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:35,010
this stuff we kind of broke out our

00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:37,560
entire web presence into little chunks

00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:39,060
of functionality and then we said in an

00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,040
ideal world if we were going to organize

00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:44,010
this into different sites how would we

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,930
do it so how it kind of hung out and you

00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:49,380
can like up here we kind of talked about

00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,579
audience but and tried to figure out you

00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,200
know like we talked about there's

00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:53,880
full-time contributors is part time

00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,730
there's like a long trail with part-time

00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:59,160
contributors and the biggest challenge

00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:01,650
for them is keeping up like I can't keep

00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,510
up with DeBellis and I work read so I

00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:06,329
can't imagine how like a part-time

00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:08,280
contributor would keep up with it so you

00:03:06,329 --> 00:03:11,220
know what one big need we have for

00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:14,000
contributors is just keeping up being

00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,740
able to follow stuff so we were thinking

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,410
you know people don't use the main

00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:20,300
website to do that they basically use

00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:24,110
the main website to learn what is fedora

00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:26,560
how do you get it and the actual work

00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:29,390
happens someplace else so we thought and

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,070
here is labeled developer dashboard but

00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:32,720
that's house but we came up with the

00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:35,600
name pops kiss there's more contributors

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:39,200
and developers and then we also have

00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:40,970
this idea yes all right right okay know

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,540
that developer dashboard is actually to

00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:47,330
open up fodor project org as it is right

00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:49,040
now it points to get fedora the idea was

00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:51,560
that for our project that word could

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,660
point to hubs and hubs would be because

00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,459
it's the project this is where the work

00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:57,440
gets done and then gets the door it

00:03:55,459 --> 00:03:59,209
would be that site where you learn about

00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:02,870
it you download it and it's kind of

00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:06,110
really aimed at users yeah so we kind of

00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:10,670
came up with this master plan and then

00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:13,040
we shared it I sort of took our notes

00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:15,620
from that meeting and made these little

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,229
tiny thumbnail mock-ups the little

00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:20,510
wireframes and did this big blog post

00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:21,720
the URLs here the slides are actually on

00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,670
the flock skype

00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:27,240
if you want to see them and this is

00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:29,310
actually a full first not a joke oh we

00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,610
got no negative feedback people seem

00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,469
really excited about the

00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,990
yeah and they seem to think that it was

00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:37,139
going to work well um another thing that

00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:39,430
I want to point out is this whiteboard

00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:41,199
talks about parts of the photo our

00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:44,020
website that we're not going to talk

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,969
about today but in this very room after

00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,259
this session me and Robbie doc are going

00:04:45,969 --> 00:04:48,699
to be talking about them so if you want

00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:51,969
to learn about them and come to that

00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:54,189
session um this is the first mock-up

00:04:51,969 --> 00:04:55,840
which happened a couple weeks later and

00:04:54,189 --> 00:04:58,449
it was just sort of a rough stab at

00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,849
taking real data from a team you know

00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:05,500
well the design team you know taking a

00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:06,969
blog post some posts from IRC an actual

00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:10,180
conversation that took place all the

00:05:06,969 --> 00:05:14,500
mock up of being made actual people on

00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:17,680
the team are highlighted in it and again

00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:19,990
posted to planet fedora we got a lot of

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,990
positive feedback so like okay this

00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:29,090
works and in your passes

00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:31,730
right but we were getting stuff done we

00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:34,430
were doing get food or org we did spin

00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:36,350
stop pro projects we did laughs stop

00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:38,570
foreign objects and we did the new arm

00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:44,390
site so it's not like we were just

00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:46,940
sitting around so um yeah so then we got

00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:49,490
all that stuff out and it production and

00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:51,140
then okay what are we going to do now we

00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:54,230
should do that hub thing that was kind

00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:58,250
of a cool idea right so um to kind of

00:05:54,230 --> 00:06:01,610
kick started we hosted this sort of

00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:05,360
google hangout brainstorm session we

00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:07,850
actually tried to use open talk RTC but

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,890
we exceeded the number of people who

00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:11,780
could join so we ended up and hang out

00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:15,140
it's not my favorite food but that's

00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:17,720
okay we got the work done and we did

00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:20,290
some design thinking games to think

00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,760
through the problems faced now another

00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:25,130
little advertisement here is I'm doing a

00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:27,380
design thinking workshop later in the

00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:28,970
conference I think it's think it's a

00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,680
friday morning i'm not a percent sure

00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:31,790
but if you wanted to learn a little bit

00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,550
more about the type of stuff that we

00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:35,520
were doing

00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:37,830
that but yeah we basically grabbed a

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,570
cross-section of Fedora contributors

00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,880
there was an open call on planet fedora

00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:45,180
we have people from dogs from

00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:47,280
ambassadors translators like people from

00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,690
all different teams in fedora because we

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,480
talked about well how do you

00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:53,430
contributors join your team because each

00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:55,020
team to process is really different and

00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:57,840
they kind of care about different things

00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:59,250
and then we took the information they

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,020
gave us about their new contributor

00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:03,150
workflow and try to apply it to the

00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,400
hub's idea to see if it would pan out

00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:07,200
and it did it actually panned out really

00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:11,700
well we got ideas for new features as

00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:14,760
well okay and then this is this past

00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:17,520
April um Ralph started prototyping it

00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:19,530
and you can love to commit it started

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,880
out on github but now it's on Boog array

00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:28,500
am i pronouncing it right now biggert ok

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:30,210
which is a much better system and this

00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,490
is sort of some of the mock-up mania

00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:33,960
from this summer megan is actually

00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:35,580
Dougal's of it you can see I just

00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,500
committed the same thing multiple times

00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:41,750
because I hit the control of ski a lot

00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:45,210
oh but yeah so we kind of started

00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:46,520
fleshing out different areas of the UI

00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:49,190
that we knew have to

00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:51,110
and building out sort of informal specs

00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:52,490
for each feature based on that we

00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:56,690
actually came up with a really cool

00:07:52,490 --> 00:08:00,080
system which I think will show you is it

00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:01,849
the next one no it's not okay we do have

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,440
a cool system where we follow ticket and

00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:04,759
we put the mock up in the ticket like

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,220
any mock-ups that pertain to that

00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:08,930
feature and then we sort of right out in

00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:11,090
the ticket how it should work so it's

00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:12,349
like a really light weights back people

00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,629
could write comments and the ticket new

00:08:12,349 --> 00:08:17,030
things like that so it was kind of a

00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:19,669
neat thing this was the hackfest that we

00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:20,780
did in June and if you follow connected

00:08:19,669 --> 00:08:23,060
or you've probably seen a lot of this

00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:26,060
stuff already but we did another design

00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:28,370
thinking game thinking through this is

00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,259
what we were talking about with other

00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:32,089
with other projects that we've done like

00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:33,979
this for our packages have I don't know

00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:37,310
if anybody in here uses that door

00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:39,669
packages right okay the problem that

00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:41,479
we've done traditionally in

00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:42,919
infrastructure tools when we're trying

00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,990
to build out and you have to help with

00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:47,720
our contributors is that a lot of stuff

00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:49,850
is focused on packaging and the problem

00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,529
with packaging is that people could do

00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:53,300
packaging have a workflow that works for

00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:56,329
them so it's really hard to convert them

00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:57,920
they're experienced so we wanted to make

00:08:56,329 --> 00:09:00,020
sure we didn't fall into that trap with

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,970
your Hobbs is like Megan was mentioning

00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,529
earlier like

00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:04,360
so we make something that forces

00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:07,089
experienced users to drop their workflow

00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:09,040
but we want it to be enough I read that

00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:11,170
maybe they'll try it but we really want

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,569
to enable new contributors so we sort of

00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:15,790
walked through for experienced

00:09:13,569 --> 00:09:18,910
contributors what are problems they have

00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:20,319
today what have a fedora hubs help them

00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:22,360
and then we did the same thing for new

00:09:20,319 --> 00:09:24,399
contributors what problems do they have

00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,470
and how would help us help them and

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,930
we're actually really surprised at how

00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:30,579
many gains its this called a pain gain

00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:32,379
chart we were surprised at how many

00:09:30,579 --> 00:09:33,910
gains experience contributors would get

00:09:32,379 --> 00:09:37,269
from the system so that was kind of

00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:40,920
reassuring actually you go through yeah

00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:40,920
and then we had a hack fest after that

00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:46,380
okay

00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:48,720
so

00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:51,030
basically all summer I've been working

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,240
on the UI mock-ups for hubs and there's

00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:55,890
a couple just principles that we've been

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,740
applying as we're kind of designing

00:09:55,890 --> 00:10:00,420
these so the there's two main types of

00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:03,210
Cobbs the individual club is like your

00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:04,920
personal profile whereas the team based

00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:07,740
or project based how it's kind of like a

00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,780
group effort so kind of not to use

00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:12,030
Facebook but your your facebook profile

00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:15,000
versus a Facebook group that kind of

00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:17,390
idea the other thing is we kind of

00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,400
redesigning it based on specific widgets

00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:22,350
so that each team hub could be really

00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:25,290
customizable and your personal thing can

00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:27,310
be customizable and then also kind of

00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:30,430
going to build it in a more

00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:31,600
way there's a lot more mock-ups if you

00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:33,910
want to look at more of them than I'm

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,920
going to go over there on the get the

00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:37,950
Fedora design for Dora hubs github and

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:41,830
I've also been blogging about it

00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:44,110
semi-regularly all summer some going

00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:46,300
through the first concept is you know

00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:49,630
the personal hub stream so on the left

00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:51,400
the main body kind of collects these

00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:55,150
what we've been calling notification

00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:57,970
cards that kind of pull from across all

00:10:55,150 --> 00:11:00,910
buff adoro apps things so like you know

00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:03,040
a ticket has been assigned to you you

00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:05,949
know somebody commented on your

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,889
let's post you know a new package is

00:11:05,949 --> 00:11:11,160
ready for testing all these things that

00:11:07,889 --> 00:11:13,269
pull from your past account and kind of

00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,190
you know let you know is happening then

00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:17,410
the right sidebar is these kind of more

00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:19,360
permanent thing so if the notifications

00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:21,699
are time-based and updated than the

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,500
right sidebar is a permanent info so

00:11:21,699 --> 00:11:25,120
like what how do you remember up we have

00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,610
the idea about libraries so you can kind

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:31,149
of store links to use as like a personal

00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:33,970
reference and for me you know have a

00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:36,579
profile of badges that kind of thing

00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:39,009
and then the team hub uses the same kind

00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:40,430
of logic where the stream is kind of

00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:44,930
updated based

00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:48,110
time so again mailing lists posts that

00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:49,779
sort of thing and then communication and

00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:52,779
coordination

00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:55,660
the right sidebar so like tools to help

00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:57,160
people collaborate while also collecting

00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:59,889
everything that's kind of happening so

00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,600
it's easier to not miss relevant

00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:06,910
information

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:10,910
and then going into you know so and then

00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:13,670
because it's based on the fast system a

00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:15,589
lot of it if you want to set up a new

00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:17,689
team hug you don't have to go through

00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:19,670
and manually add every person you're

00:12:17,689 --> 00:12:21,709
doing if you can just set it up and

00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:24,170
it'll pull it from fast and then you can

00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:25,579
add widgets so so you want to pull from

00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:27,860
a specific mail and let's do you want a

00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:32,749
full of a blog feed you it's easy to add

00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:35,839
it so that it's not a huge there's not a

00:12:32,749 --> 00:12:38,749
really high bar for entry so we wanted

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:41,119
to make it so that it's you know so

00:12:38,749 --> 00:12:45,110
there's a value add without taking a ton

00:12:41,119 --> 00:12:47,269
of time to invest so that there's the

00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:50,600
kind of workflow you know you click add

00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:52,700
a widget and you know you selected do it

00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,950
yeah

00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:56,830
and then yeah so talk about a fast

00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:58,950
integration

00:12:56,830 --> 00:13:00,940
because a lot of you know the

00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:02,590
difficulties to getting on board it is

00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:04,720
you know if you're not super technical

00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:09,190
you make a fast account and it wants you

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:11,170
to remember is called the key yeah see

00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:13,630
exactly exactly and then you should wait

00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:16,030
what you have to join us feel like a

00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:17,680
plus and Cl a +1 what does that mean and

00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:19,210
then you have to join that group and

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,100
then you have to wait a certain period

00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:23,200
of time like on the hour and the metro

00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:25,260
project email works then you get your

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:29,050
fedora penis face it's like this whole

00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:30,490
thing yeah so the idea is if you already

00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:33,610
have a fast account that becomes your

00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:35,620
clubs account it you know so you don't

00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,940
have to have a ton of different accounts

00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,200
and it pulls all your information but

00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,490
then if you don't have a fast account

00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,710
you just make the Hudson gap and you

00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:42,370
don't have to do all this super detailed

00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,750
things

00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:46,210
we're not you know how to present your

00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:47,800
help Pacific we going to happen but

00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:53,560
that's the idea so that it works both

00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:55,420
ways and helps both people yeah then you

00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:57,160
know we have idea of you can subscribe

00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:58,839
to a hub and that's you know then you'll

00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,270
get updates and then you can join the

00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:03,610
hub which a lot of times based on

00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:05,560
different teams that's a that's a

00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:07,150
process we approve

00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,400
and then starring is like starting a

00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:12,720
github it's kind of a notification that

00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:14,100
it's more for projects than teams

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,920
kind of thing like oh this is a really

00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:18,720
cool idea and liking it showing that

00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:21,000
you're interested a good thumbs up yeah

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,889
and then when you join as a member of a

00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,480
hub like you're basically doing the

00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:26,250
equivalent of going into pass and

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,259
applying to that group so there's a

00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:30,750
whole workflow that make it work out

00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:33,269
where like if I show up to the design

00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:35,370
team up and I say I want to join it then

00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:36,540
it'll send a thing over to the admin's

00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:38,220
to improve it because we're going to

00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:40,800
prove on the group you have to do a task

00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:42,959
before you're qualified so there's like

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,089
a whole flow behind that but it makes it

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,949
a lot less intimidating you can see what

00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:49,050
the group is actually working on and

00:14:46,949 --> 00:14:50,910
make a decision based on that one or not

00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:52,589
you want to be a part of it rather than

00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:55,050
just see like the name of the group and

00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:56,550
fast and like oh that has the word

00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:58,259
design in it that's not look killing

00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:02,310
I'll apply and not really know what they

00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:06,720
do it's linking the joining of the group

00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:09,149
with the actual activities it goes the

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,069
thing across the bottom is call it like

00:15:09,149 --> 00:15:13,230
the bookmarks bar but it's all the hugs

00:15:11,069 --> 00:15:15,269
the Euro member up or subscribe to and

00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:16,720
it's kind of the main navigation idea

00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:20,199
these are all

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:23,199
ABS across so you can kind of see you

00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:25,480
know what your it's the you know can

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:28,350
easily put all the hugs that you want to

00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:31,650
check up on there's a whole

00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:34,950
stuff and everything grab from the idea

00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:38,010
from that is is from reddit we're like

00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:40,710
you can have infinite reddit spaces and

00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:44,820
you can be subscribed to like a you know

00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:46,770
long list of them and we have designed

00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:49,200
like we megan designed a whole system

00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:51,480
around them where when when we first

00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,920
turned this on like I can't promise is

00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,510
actually in the case

00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:57,329
the plan is that when we first turned

00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:58,589
this on whatever teams and they're

00:15:57,329 --> 00:16:00,810
probably be some calling in the

00:15:58,589 --> 00:16:02,940
beginning like which teams are you know

00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:05,010
like a git commit team is probably not

00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:07,589
going to get a teen club but you know

00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:09,060
maybe but like the design team is going

00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:11,279
to get a hug the marketing team is going

00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:14,160
to get help and the idea is that when we

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:15,660
turn this on those hubs will come on so

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,510
you don't have to go in and create them

00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:19,060
manually

00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:23,380
will do sort of a mirror What's in facts

00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:25,450
and accordingly for individual users you

00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:27,970
know these are actual teams that tactica

00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:30,370
who's sort of guinea pig example who

00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:33,070
volunteered for this these are actual

00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:35,710
teams that she's a part of and there's a

00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:37,480
whole idea behind the arrangement of

00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:39,910
these that Megan came up with for like

00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:41,560
what order do they appear in you know

00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:42,970
based on your activity in that group

00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,860
they'll appear in a certain order and

00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:46,630
then after that we don't switch it

00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:48,490
because we don't want people to get

00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:50,800
confused about oh this button was here

00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:53,200
and outs here based on what I did so we

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,120
use sort of your activity to make an

00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:57,460
initial guess at what things matter to

00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,550
you we'll try to do a best guess at the

00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:04,089
nav and then you tend to it yourself so

00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:06,010
the hope is that you know if over time

00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:09,250
you decide oh I don't want I don't care

00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:10,810
about planet fedora club anymore you

00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:14,160
just go and remove it and it's like a

00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:14,160
whole edit system there that she

00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,740
in addition to like following joining

00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:23,550
like team hubs we also have like a

00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:25,079
subscribe idea to individual which is

00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:26,790
kind of you know like being a facebook

00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:28,530
friend well we don't want to count on

00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:30,600
Twitter it's like technically in the

00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:32,940
interface we have it kind of subscribed

00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:35,130
uted for which personal information but

00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:37,260
it's all everything's available in fed

00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:40,590
message but the analogy moat came up

00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:42,540
with was like you know you could even if

00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:44,550
you put a block on your buddy somebody

00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:48,210
so you know cut the lock off was better

00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:50,720
that we have about so like here with not

00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:52,950
a good profile if I'm not already

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,810
there's like it's almost like a hang

00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:56,730
cheek right yeah I subscribe to someone

00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:59,040
so sciatica hasn't confirmed me as a

00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:00,480
friend yet so when I go to her profile

00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:03,330
I'll see you like the five most recent

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,340
cards for her and then you know it'll

00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:07,410
invite me to you know it'll either

00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:09,330
invite me to follow her or it will

00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:12,030
invite the Earl tell me you know your

00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:14,820
invite is pending or whatever and the

00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:17,490
idea here is just to not make it quite

00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,990
so easy to stop people I mean again you

00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:21,840
could sit on fed message and sit there

00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:23,730
and listen but you know it's this is

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,690
more like the bike lock but not really

00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:26,850
make it

00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:30,390
and it's not like there's anything

00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:31,710
sensitive you're usually but you know

00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:33,090
like if a team meeting is happening

00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:35,010
you're going to know where the person is

00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:38,360
going to be in IRC to sort of time or if

00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:38,360
they're going to flop and you back

00:18:47,879 --> 00:18:51,959
yeah I think it goes to a drop there's a

00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:53,369
it's hard to see because it's really

00:18:51,959 --> 00:18:54,959
small on the screen there's a little

00:18:53,369 --> 00:18:56,429
carrot at the bottom that I'll drop down

00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:59,389
kind of like you know your bookmarks in

00:18:56,429 --> 00:18:59,389
firefox or whatever

00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:09,630
yeah oh no yeah that I said yeah yeah

00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:12,659
but I think I might have even fixed that

00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:15,010
in a later version be weird you know

00:19:12,659 --> 00:19:18,760
just constantly everything

00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:22,279
screenshot from the wrong file you know

00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:26,960
that the next operator

00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:29,059
that is your app and then one of the

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,649
things that's probably the thing that's

00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:32,119
going to be most challenging to

00:19:30,649 --> 00:19:33,289
integrate also one of the things that I

00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:37,609
think is gonna be the most useful is

00:19:33,289 --> 00:19:39,950
kind of having an IRC immigration in in

00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:43,219
the you know personal messages and also

00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:45,169
in the group in the brew pubs because I

00:19:43,219 --> 00:19:48,019
received it's really confusing to people

00:19:45,169 --> 00:19:50,330
who don't already use it and it can be

00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:52,879
kind of a really high bar for new users

00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:54,230
don't you know don't use IRC need to try

00:19:52,879 --> 00:19:56,900
and you know

00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:58,790
figure out what's going on so then we

00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,740
had you know a concept for you know on

00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:02,299
everybody's profile these little widget

00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:05,809
work some we can send my personal

00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:08,630
message and then yeah and then there's

00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:11,929
also like the channel is associated with

00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:14,210
the teens when you know

00:20:11,929 --> 00:20:15,950
ideas for what happens if you mentioned

00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:18,669
in a channel and every single you know

00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:23,090
arguing are not that kind of thing and

00:20:18,669 --> 00:20:25,159
then also you know kind of a private

00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:26,990
messaging system so that if somebody

00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:30,139
messaged me kind of manage it and then

00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:31,940
you see that's in that at all I kind of

00:20:30,139 --> 00:20:33,679
the upper right that takes you to yeah

00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:36,259
Thank You mo it takes you to kind of

00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:40,659
this area where you can you know talk to

00:20:36,259 --> 00:20:44,480
people fake conversation about cats

00:20:40,659 --> 00:20:46,249
that's that the two big hurdles that

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:50,649
we've been told for new contributors

00:20:46,249 --> 00:20:50,649
like across groups basically it was

00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:58,040
but also on IRC and mailing list right

00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:00,350
so mailing list three of hyper kitty so

00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:03,410
we're in good shape there and the idea

00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:05,660
here is if we integrated IRC into Hobbs

00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:07,430
I mean people figure out and chat

00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:09,200
facebook so you think they figure out

00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:11,060
how to chat using a system like this

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,340
which is built like a social network so

00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:15,230
we're hoping that you know in the same

00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:19,490
model that hyper kitty uses i'm a

00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:22,040
developer i use my you know you claw it

00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:24,470
from my cold dead hands right that's

00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:26,360
fine keep using but it still works just

00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:30,880
the way i always did and the new users

00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:30,880
can use the web forum area mine's better

00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:37,280
but you know that the new contributors

00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:38,990
can use the web site and you guys can

00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,850
talk to each other and it doesn't affect

00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:42,920
you right like your workflow is not

00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:45,440
impacted in the same way we're taking

00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:48,650
that philosophy with this if you know

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:51,770
your what is the

00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:53,500
I use X chat I know there's a command

00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:57,760
line one than the name is like fishing

00:21:53,500 --> 00:22:00,830
perseus see I would use the end I RC

00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:03,080
very much here but anyway yes so you

00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:05,300
have your ear obscure chat client or

00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,830
you're popular chat client then pry it

00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:09,410
from my cold dead hands I have scripts

00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:12,050
and I have this fine keep it but new

00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:13,820
contributors can now talk to you using

00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:16,010
this as an interface it doesn't really

00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:17,870
affect you we'd like it to affect you as

00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:20,300
little as possible so you can't even

00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:21,710
really tell they're using this and they

00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:24,410
can talk to you and they don't have to

00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:27,140
worry about you know what is all this

00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:31,130
stuff coming through saying someone join

00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:33,320
the room or whatever weird IRC server

00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:35,090
logs get thrown in with ascii art they

00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:38,070
don't want to see that so when you be

00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:42,600
running an air sea bouncer

00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:44,820
or well because yeah the analogy to like

00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,680
Facebook messages if we want it for it's

00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:48,570
awful it was when the person is not

00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:50,310
there yeah but if you separate it out

00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:52,350
there's going to be like a disconnect

00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:53,880
between people who are using traditional

00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:57,400
clients

00:22:53,880 --> 00:23:00,370
right so the idea is that we would be

00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:03,970
using something called porta which I

00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:06,700
think operates as a proxy so does it

00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:09,460
operate the frantic yes it does so we

00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:13,060
would be using that app to sort of build

00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:14,710
on top of to do this and yeah so people

00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:17,760
would have sort of constant presence if

00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:17,760
they're not logged into this

00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,090
hang out

00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:26,820
so just a question

00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:33,330
so that means that the IRC server that

00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:35,340
 anyway right yes and we do we know

00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:37,049
that especially with our community and

00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:41,490
many open source communities privacy is

00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:43,770
of concern and I think I think we talked

00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:45,929
about we talked and we definitely talked

00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:47,549
about when you're talking to people and

00:23:45,929 --> 00:23:50,789
when you get mentions and stuff there's

00:23:47,549 --> 00:23:51,440
like a white time limit like do we say

00:23:50,789 --> 00:23:53,389
we

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,250
I think I think we did a based on

00:23:53,389 --> 00:23:57,019
numbers at a time so that your follower

00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:59,750
Bozek mentions are saved and everything

00:23:57,019 --> 00:24:01,279
else is just right so we try to like you

00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:03,799
know and obviously the server is going

00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:05,750
to keep logs for a certain period but I

00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:08,049
don't think it's going to be a forever

00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:10,490
and everything like I think that

00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:12,710
anything that's stored is going to be on

00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:14,419
the server it's not going to be like a

00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:16,129
meatball or something right like it's

00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:19,429
not going to be formal logs if you want

00:24:16,129 --> 00:24:20,840
formal logic happens so you know I'm

00:24:19,429 --> 00:24:21,560
hoping people are okay with that it is

00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,730
something we have

00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,730
only talks about the inception

00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:32,110
not especially to young people like us

00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:35,110
to the owner

00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:35,110
in

00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:39,720
they just really don't like it

00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:49,200
so the idea here is um people have hopes

00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:51,510
and groups happens when you go to a

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,610
group home there's a little chat panel

00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:55,559
in the right sidebar and that's for the

00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:57,510
team's channel and whoever admin's that

00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:58,799
group hub sets that so it could be on

00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:00,899
give net it could be on freenode

00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,669
whatever the channel is you put the

00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:03,840
network and the channel name and then

00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:07,230
that would be the channel link to that

00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:10,169
home so with people it's a private

00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:12,120
message area the problem is i'm not

00:25:10,169 --> 00:25:14,519
going to go to my own profile to talk to

00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:16,200
someone who messaged me so then Megan's

00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:17,880
idea was well we'll just give people a

00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,590
message center for where they can deal

00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,179
with the received messages and that

00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:23,309
makes a little bit more sense so that's

00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:25,710
that's what this side is so if you're

00:25:23,309 --> 00:25:28,370
talking to katica you're typing to her

00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:31,260
here and then she's typing to you here

00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:33,310
think one so this is great this is

00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:36,590
really good

00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:38,620
11 please keep on being on the role

00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:40,200
outside

00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:42,840
over there

00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:45,539
because so for example the board

00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:49,019
notification stuff that happened it was

00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:53,250
really cool but I've on my own I've seen

00:25:49,019 --> 00:25:55,670
bounce I mean I've seen you sexy right

00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:57,320
so it says me

00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:59,330
I receive people are going to do it

00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:04,970
sends me text messages and it's great

00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:07,130
limited just arrest because where does

00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:08,600
happen if someone a big space and they

00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:11,000
come up with my watch it's great little

00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,860
hack it's you know whatever right but

00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,900
but when the notification stuff started

00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:16,490
happening for the full Morris things

00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:18,770
might watch that I might not have chosen

00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:21,110
for example the colonel every little

00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:25,280
girl has ever done right I started

00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:28,460
getting text messages like whenever it

00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:29,810
shows that I never chose to get a memo I

00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:31,640
mean like they write the things just

00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:33,890
happen in sequence such that it ended up

00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:35,540
with a point where I don't notification

00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:37,550
of your time so that's the papal of the

00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:41,090
worst space and the other side I see is

00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:43,250
people suddenly going to their account

00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:44,930
and it's like the guy who never build

00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:46,760
into reads there this is the voice note

00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:48,410
in the office oh my goodness I got 50

00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:50,960
messages here that I never even notice

00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:53,240
you got I don't know how you do it got a

00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,000
social network piece works because

00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,770
everybody give me to bulldoze me nobody

00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,150
reads all the things I look yeah I was

00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:00,500
in there reading there so addicted to

00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:02,450
Facebook that they're on it all the time

00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,950
and I have a see stuff you need to have

00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:05,360
that kind of how do you get that balance

00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:08,200
between making sure people see it

00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:14,410
without being so

00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:17,940
so do we have the most

00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:17,940
that language idea

00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:26,010
and then I do the best we got

00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:28,529
the fire hose versus the filter yeah so

00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:30,630
we did for that specific point we did

00:27:28,529 --> 00:27:32,909
think about you know you don't want

00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:34,559
people to feel like I'm underwater so

00:27:32,909 --> 00:27:37,380
like we have what we call the fire hose

00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:39,020
cab and that's not the default we also

00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:42,029
have people to meet up Columbus for the

00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:44,130
notifications loop the contextual

00:27:42,029 --> 00:27:46,830
technical team I you know I don't think

00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:48,240
okay let's show it to you I mean we can

00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:51,330
show you the mahkum so basically the

00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:55,200
idea we had a fake has this 24 like you

00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:56,730
know NRA and your hippie like me and you

00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,740
don't want to see the self about guns

00:27:56,730 --> 00:28:01,200
like I no problem gun owners whatever

00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:03,270
but I filter that stuff out and you can

00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,890
just facebook has a thing that it's like

00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:06,419
a contextual filtering and you hit the

00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:08,460
arrow and you say I don't want to see

00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:10,260
post like this so we have something like

00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,700
that built in for the notification cars

00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:13,799
that go to your personal fee I need a

00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:15,840
thought made up song about me but yes I

00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:17,520
mentioned it was because what I do is

00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,110
like when it's Notification Center and

00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,299
I'm like I've never used this this is

00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:22,830
annoying me I'm going to know everything

00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:24,720
right so we don't want people to do that

00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:26,130
yes I heard of my account I just said ok

00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,650
I'm going to know everything because

00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:30,560
they don't ask me and so

00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:32,600
push back my boob resistances fine be

00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:34,220
like that I'm gonna get nothing right so

00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,830
he needs to make sure that well I mean

00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:38,990
the other thing is like you have to use

00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:41,840
hubs to get the notifications and the

00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:43,700
notifications are as innocuous as i know

00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,320
we keep use it like it's an oculus is

00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:47,360
the Google+ through the Facebook once

00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:50,600
it's just the little thing in the corner

00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:53,240
or whatever so I mean and actually if

00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:54,560
like yeah we don't actually have one

00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,730
like we don't use the Facebook model of

00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,530
having like a little number thing

00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:58,970
because that was part of that we didn't

00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:00,530
want it to be overwhelming so you have

00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:02,630
your personal hub is the first one and

00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:05,720
if there's new stuff there you can do

00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:08,750
god it's just a bulldog you know and

00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:11,030
it's like that's it I like the Fedora

00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:12,590
next the store next hub it has a blue

00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:14,600
dot okay there's no content i haven't

00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:16,250
seen on it that's all it is so you're

00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:18,500
not going to get emails you're not going

00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:19,940
to get you know iris lee messages or

00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,190
whatever you know where you had your

00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:24,460
hand up

00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:27,250
so I are sequins a new service that's

00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:29,720
basically designed to allow on IRC left

00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:32,600
p 90 comparison or evaluation

00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:35,600
of that sort of I actually hadn't heard

00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:42,670
of it IRC plug by rashouk la Ric cloud

00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:42,670
okay is it what oh ok yeah

00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:50,150
what 11 that one bit of bias we have is

00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:52,280
that the war tubbing developer is what

00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:54,020
happened pointy so that's that's why

00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,520
we've just I mean we knew about it was

00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,930
looking at it but yeah I haven't heard

00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:03,640
of that so the definitely take a look at

00:29:56,930 --> 00:30:03,640
that that might help too so

00:30:04,029 --> 00:30:08,070
I'm a selfish observed on the local

00:30:05,739 --> 00:30:08,070
tiger

00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:11,450
because

00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:16,750
fish

00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:25,280
so if they try to contact him via homes

00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:28,750
you'll get an IRC Prime message he's on

00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,750
life that's true

00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:37,410
that is the case we did not think so

00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:39,930
well if you extend it naturally to just

00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:43,050
I mean this is the big undertaking but

00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:45,060
we're running IRC bounce just an IRC

00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:49,590
kind of an IRC bouncer as a service

00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:51,810
almost four for fedora contributors you

00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:53,250
know you could you know a big sense you

00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:55,380
can bridge that gap people who want to

00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:57,480
use traditional IRC clients they just

00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:59,340
connect instead of connecting to

00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,740
directly to free

00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:05,340
whatever they just get to that they can

00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:07,320
act done bouncer hub started or project

00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:08,760
but if Pingo decided he didn't want to

00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:11,850
do that I mean we could probably do like

00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:13,770
a bot that's like the message box so if

00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:16,470
somebody messages finger when he's on

00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:28,790
vacation when he logs back on IRC the

00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:31,590
next time the fedora was looking at I do

00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:33,330
you can do it like send a daily summary

00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:35,490
great suit so what mine does is I've got

00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:37,920
this custom plug-in hybrid on my company

00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:39,930
he neither see everybody uses are see

00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:42,090
how do we can go away right so i have

00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:45,290
this custom plugin i work museums see

00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:45,290
years ago it's horrible

00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:51,730
great limits messages I get and it does

00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:53,140
things like periodically send me summary

00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:56,920
who's been trying to hold me what they

00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:59,500
said patrocle so I think like you can do

00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:03,220
that thinking subway of a

00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:04,770
patient-centric well stuff exists my

00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:07,020
main concern is on the other

00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:09,000
because I don't want people thinking oh

00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:12,300
you're the sort of our contributor and I

00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,400
can't bother watching eye contact it

00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:16,530
kind of

00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:18,750
on the other end on the receiving end

00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:21,180
like me and Megan talked about this a

00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:22,560
little bit like we're not as concerned

00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:24,120
because you know what if somebody needs

00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:29,880
to reach you and they're pinging you an

00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:32,010
IRC oh I use it email the southern ways

00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:34,050
to contact people and if they tried to

00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:35,550
pin you a month ago if they probably

00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:38,370
don't even remember what was about a

00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:40,530
month later so at a certain point like

00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:42,030
it's easier to think about it on the

00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:43,440
receiving end than the sending it we

00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:46,130
just don't want people to feel like it's

00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,130
a brick wall I can't

00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:07,670
and ever since

00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:17,010
right

00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:22,230
message

00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:31,520
no I think we definitely can and I think

00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,830
water does this like you know if you've

00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:35,570
been idle for so long you marked his

00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:37,220
idol which is you know you're in

00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:38,300
facebook you see someone's online but

00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:40,540
they're on their cell phone that's

00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:43,040
probably not the answer right so I mean

00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:45,050
yeah I mean we're definitely layering

00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:47,840
some things on top I think most of what

00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:51,200
I would like to do with the hub's IRC

00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:52,850
client on top of IRC is actually taking

00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,140
stuff away you know the server join

00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:56,420
message is

00:33:54,140 --> 00:34:00,070
think things like that that just confuse

00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:00,070
your users that aren't really

00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:08,560
shadows that came back by

00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:25,580
what was I lived up to twitch okay yeah

00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:25,580
yeah neither chat was a quite excellent

00:34:26,589 --> 00:34:29,909
but for my thought

00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:34,660
yes exactly

00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:46,190
exact

00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:49,060
as a business little by why it's an

00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:49,060
option for people who

00:34:55,740 --> 00:35:08,200
yeah yeah well this one

00:35:02,109 --> 00:35:09,789
yeah okay taco I'm biased but this is

00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,769
this is what I want because i have to

00:35:09,789 --> 00:35:13,660
say i do the design team meetings every

00:35:11,769 --> 00:35:15,249
two weeks and it takes me more than

00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:17,499
twice and like the meeting to document

00:35:15,249 --> 00:35:21,369
the meeting which is you know not cool

00:35:17,499 --> 00:35:22,960
so here's the idea helps with when you

00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:24,880
end there's there's a lot more makos

00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,099
behind this but basically you have a

00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,019
team hope a lot of teams have regular

00:35:27,099 --> 00:35:30,880
recurring meetings so you can set up

00:35:29,019 --> 00:35:32,680
this is our team for current meeting it

00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,349
happens tuesdays at noon every other

00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:38,319
week and then automatically how to set

00:35:35,349 --> 00:35:41,769
up meeting reminders okay the next team

00:35:38,319 --> 00:35:43,900
meeting is coming up you know here's we

00:35:41,769 --> 00:35:45,489
mop this up for marketing so like here's

00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:47,589
the marketing page for more information

00:35:45,489 --> 00:35:52,539
whatever here's who organized it this is

00:35:47,589 --> 00:35:54,539
the channel the time in UTC and then you

00:35:52,539 --> 00:35:57,260
have your meeting you use meet bought

00:35:54,539 --> 00:35:59,390
magic happens maybe it's the name

00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:01,490
use something like that marketing dash

00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:04,700
meeting and then once the meetings over

00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:07,280
hug sends out a notification from meat

00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:09,350
bought everyone who is in that team okay

00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,820
the team meeting minutes are here and it

00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:12,050
uses the summary meet bought generates

00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:13,610
so these are the topics that were

00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:15,500
discussed these are the action items

00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:18,530
here's the people who are in the meeting

00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:21,470
and how many lines they said and then

00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:23,060
the other idea is you could also do a

00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:24,890
one-off game in which we do sometimes

00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:26,890
right you're talking about you know are

00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:29,810
we going to implement this in-house so

00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:30,950
then what can happen is you kind of send

00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:32,900
out because right now a lot of people

00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:34,340
use like when is good dotnet and like

00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:37,310
there's some other services that figure

00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:38,870
out like who's available when so you

00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:41,120
know people use services somewhere

00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:43,400
without a source was actually or not for

00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:45,710
that sort of thing we actually tried to

00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:48,440
find an open source one that worked and

00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:50,900
we couldn't so we decided taking like a

00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:53,540
very open policy you put the URL to

00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:56,840
whatever reading with an angler tool you

00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:58,550
want use so we just have a URL field you

00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,630
put that in and then just say I want to

00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:02,450
request the meetings with the design

00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:04,370
tools like meetings about it gets posted

00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:06,110
on the design to hook people can click

00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:08,690
on the URL pick their times that they're

00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:11,600
available and then whoever set up the

00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:13,470
request at some point hopefully will

00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:15,480
I'm going to call the meeting for this

00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:16,890
time people can make this time and then

00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,290
once they do that they'll do that

00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:21,450
through hugs then hugs will send out the

00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:23,490
meeting reminders and everything are

00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:25,170
going to be attending so it sort of

00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:27,720
helps you manage meetings and a little

00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:28,869
bit better of a way than just random IRC

00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:32,829
and

00:37:28,869 --> 00:37:35,259
was links and then also for each hub

00:37:32,829 --> 00:37:36,430
there's like a whole meetings list of

00:37:35,259 --> 00:37:38,980
these are sort of this is like the

00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:41,200
docket of meetings that are coming up so

00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:44,490
and then that's where you would initiate

00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,490
the requested meeting to

00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:59,040
where is the committee's

00:37:53,430 --> 00:38:00,240
oh yes yeah that's really restore then

00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:03,839
the next part is just go over the

00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:15,410
prototype this description like you want

00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:21,300
um but you know it's up on Roger anyway

00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:27,290
I'm sorry um but yeah so um Oh No so I'm

00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:29,460
going to pull that up yeah so its up um

00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:31,349
there's not a lot of it yet but

00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:35,400
everything up here is like actual data

00:38:31,349 --> 00:38:37,619
pulling from fast so you know here's the

00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:43,069
activities blank because it's based on

00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:45,690
commits and I don't commit things yeah

00:38:43,069 --> 00:38:49,319
here's the badges you know these are

00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:55,099
actual things based on fasters drop down

00:38:49,319 --> 00:38:59,250
this now you know here's the fake

00:38:55,099 --> 00:39:01,050
team hug there we go this is if this is

00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:02,970
a feature area that Megan had where if

00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:04,080
you have a home that you know like

00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:06,450
people get together and they do a

00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:08,670
project you know like the fedora next

00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:11,099
right let's meet your next web sites

00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:12,780
they're out now they're gone I mean we

00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:14,160
all really have to work on it at like

00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:16,890
this integrated project anymore we're

00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:19,650
maintenance smaller so you know people

00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:22,380
stop sort of doing activity on it and

00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:24,180
then you know after certain cared about

00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:26,220
connectivity we don't want to become a

00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:28,290
wiki where it's like sort of the hopes

00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:34,109
and dreams that have died and it's not

00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:36,180
really so use the little with a little

00:39:34,109 --> 00:39:38,670
creepy cobweb and it just lets you know

00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:41,640
this hubs not active anymore you know

00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:43,500
we've archived it and you know if

00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,510
there's information that happens here

00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:48,320
you can look it up

00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:51,500
but you can't participate in any so this

00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:53,900
is their manual archive action that is

00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:56,480
what i was going to say next I think

00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:58,250
it's here yeah there's a manual one only

00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:02,210
the event can archive it and once it's

00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:05,560
archived it's locked nobody else can you

00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:08,630
know contribute to things via the pub's

00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:10,550
interface yeah you know you can unlock

00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:11,860
it but there's you know sometimes you

00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:17,150
just want to be like look we're done

00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:20,900
stop sending us mailing lists um yeah I

00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:22,430
think that's everything on the Emmy this

00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:25,820
isn't everything that it's just a quick

00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:28,490
you know run through of did you order

00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:30,200
yes OSHA says so the incident idea of

00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:33,200
archiving is that

00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,200
hi

00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:44,340
yeah yeah it's still available for

00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:46,680
somebody right or so he's like searching

00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:54,750
for the history of something it might go

00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:58,710
in circles I don't think it should now

00:40:54,750 --> 00:41:00,540
because yeah you can't reuse name then

00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:02,479
you're just talking about how confusing

00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:05,520
that is

00:41:02,479 --> 00:41:08,990
something is called IT yeah

00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:10,920
well that would you actually brought

00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:15,210
we've decided to stop

00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:18,090
internationalisation here we go I i know

00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:21,990
i said that it it wasn't fake but dis

00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:24,600
parts make the best is I'm pretty clean

00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:27,080
up absolutely encourage that you should

00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,080
think about

00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:45,380
well if it's like an effort let's say a

00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:45,380
project

00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:54,220
in my mind before

00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:57,849
the way I would propose thinking about

00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:59,650
it is do you reuse mailing lists I have

00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:00,240
actually the server mailing list is one

00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:02,799
that we

00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:05,319
there was a server saying a long time

00:42:02,799 --> 00:42:07,809
ago and the list went inactive and we

00:42:05,319 --> 00:42:10,030
just contacted the amends for the new

00:42:07,809 --> 00:42:11,589
server working group like hey could we

00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:13,660
reduce this list for the server working

00:42:11,589 --> 00:42:15,789
group no problem so you could do

00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:18,430
something like that which happens rarely

00:42:15,789 --> 00:42:20,079
but you could contact the admin and just

00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:23,440
be like hey you i have this new project

00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:26,049
called i18n we kind of you serve your

00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,910
hub ok no problem and the way that it's

00:42:26,049 --> 00:42:29,829
set up again is it's all backed by fast

00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:31,869
so basically the current and we could

00:42:29,829 --> 00:42:34,809
just add you as a min and kind of take

00:42:31,869 --> 00:42:37,109
over move in and it's reactivated in

00:42:34,809 --> 00:42:40,320
exactly so if the name really matters

00:42:37,109 --> 00:42:42,270
you know it's not like you're

00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:45,840
but it's you're not starting with them

00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:48,570
fresh but it's like Facebook you know

00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:51,470
nobody reads it to the end so it doesn't

00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:51,470
matter that it's not fresh

00:42:55,510 --> 00:43:00,490
each other's I owe this

00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:20,270
yeah that's where the contextual like

00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:21,710
they'd be a little menu here and that's

00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:23,960
where the contextual filtering types of

00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:27,280
software should pull up the contextual

00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:30,770
time yeah we're talking about a musician

00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:34,670
okay my I'm really bad as horrible

00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:38,930
naming things so it's going to get weird

00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:41,280
but um and all these mock-ups I get

00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:44,360
modulus

00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,360
think it's in here

00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:56,110
oh this is the this is one of the early

00:43:53,080 --> 00:44:01,990
mock-ups for the filter like the fire

00:43:56,110 --> 00:44:09,619
hose is there jeez here we go oh yeah

00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:13,609
they're hit one and then he pie

00:44:09,619 --> 00:44:15,349
there we go okay yeah so then you know

00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:18,309
in the right there's a little drop down

00:44:15,349 --> 00:44:19,900
and you get you know hide replication

00:44:18,309 --> 00:44:21,849
I design teen updates hide meeting

00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:24,819
reminders and then the idea for saving

00:44:21,849 --> 00:44:26,680
the link is we have a rough idea of like

00:44:24,819 --> 00:44:28,509
a personal place you can save things for

00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:30,579
later kind of like apparently there's a

00:44:28,509 --> 00:44:32,109
stifling function of Facebook and then

00:44:30,579 --> 00:44:34,150
pain length it's it's your public

00:44:32,109 --> 00:44:36,130
library that's kind of one of the more

00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:38,619
you know really detailed things that I

00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:40,180
need to talk about much before but and

00:44:38,619 --> 00:44:41,619
then the permalink that the bottom will

00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:43,989
take you to the source on whichever app

00:44:41,619 --> 00:44:46,449
is actually made of two so for me or my

00:44:43,989 --> 00:44:49,390
arrow comes from 50 Cal but yeah there's

00:44:46,449 --> 00:44:51,489
the filtering Boston I'm over yeah ok

00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:53,619
let's neighbor brief quickly sir how you

00:44:51,489 --> 00:44:56,309
can help even know we probably really

00:44:53,619 --> 00:44:56,309
did you help so

00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:07,570
yeah so I'm into some more interviews

00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:09,310
keep working on it once we have enough

00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:10,750
to start testing keep testing kind of

00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:16,210
just keep going moving forward and

00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:17,620
please help us so yeah like you said the

00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:20,230
mock ups are on github if you want to

00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:25,750
look at them and then we're developing

00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:32,020
it to pitcher I think I'm so sorry for

00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:34,210
what I'm telling you this if you want to

00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:36,850
like figure out you know it just needs

00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:39,340
to know python better than i do but you

00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:41,050
need to know python and then we have

00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:42,580
this is sort of that list i was talking

00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:44,890
about earlier these are like little

00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:47,440
widgets and features that we SPECT out

00:45:44,890 --> 00:45:49,630
most of these that the ones that donor

00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:52,000
my fault but most of these you click on

00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:53,950
them and you can get little mock-up

00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,570
thumbnails and it kind of a description

00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:57,640
of the behavior the widgets supposed to

00:45:55,570 --> 00:46:00,119
have and i just would like to point out

00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:02,769
how many of these are unassigned

00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:05,349
right right for the picking here if you

00:46:02,769 --> 00:46:07,299
want to help out as these are like nice

00:46:05,349 --> 00:46:09,250
because they're little contains help

00:46:07,299 --> 00:46:11,619
contains little widget things that you

00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:13,839
can just start crank out your site's not

00:46:11,619 --> 00:46:15,930
fun okay just make one widget but of

00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:22,070
course it's going to be awesome o'clock

00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:25,990
that's one way you can get involved yes

00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:28,520
documentation on what's the minimum

00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:32,030
support for like fun designing of which

00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:37,520
is right and I decided oh man i really

00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:40,180
want to use flexbox CSS to get my way

00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:42,500
out just right well supported by

00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:44,990
someone with browsers like is there a

00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:48,230
document that says

00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:49,670
target we don't have but the one thing

00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:52,100
that we've been talking about a lot is

00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:54,500
what comes default with fedora we should

00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:55,910
be able to install fedora workstation

00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:57,410
and out of the box they're going to eat

00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:59,410
it without problems so that's sort of

00:46:57,410 --> 00:47:15,980
the one way we've been thinking about it

00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:19,300
if that helps all right I hear more

00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:19,300
