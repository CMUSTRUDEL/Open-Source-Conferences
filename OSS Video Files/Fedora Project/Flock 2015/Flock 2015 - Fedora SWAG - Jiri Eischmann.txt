Title: Flock 2015 - Fedora SWAG - Jiri Eischmann
Publication date: 2015-08-26
Playlist: Flock 2015
Description: 
	I've been a Fedora swag wrangler for EMEA for the last three years. I'd like to share our experience with different kinds of swag and stir a discussion about what we should focus on in the future because preferences are changing, e.g. DVDs are not cool any more etc.
