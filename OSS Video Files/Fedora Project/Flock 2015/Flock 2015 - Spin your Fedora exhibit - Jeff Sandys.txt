Description: 
	Use a Fedora Spin to create a focus for your Fedora exhibit and be the hit of the show. Spins answer the question, "What can you do with Fedora?". Spins open the door to other exhibits besides Linux Fests. Spins encourage application development to build Fedora repositories. We will show a examples of a Spin focus exhibit, give ideas for other Spin exhibits and show the benefits Spins for the guest, the exhibitor and Fedora.

actually pay you know the registration

00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:48,470
fees to have a sitting at tail why are

00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:51,680
they getting none sitting there what do

00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:54,200
you think well it's every time at the

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:58,280
coast yeah the more people we get to use

00:04:54,200 --> 00:05:01,250
the door but let's be truthful with the

00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:03,890
research and developments in ranch

00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:07,730
already and more people we get using the

00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:10,009
door and come back as contributors help

00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:13,129
spread

00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:14,800
supports always other conferences get

00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:21,009
their name out there and get the fedora

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:25,099
yep yeah by against i'm usually intended

00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:27,310
as an entender of a conference I

00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:29,800
appreciate that

00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:32,130
I appreciate person sitting there so

00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:38,760
that if I have to question on whatever

00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:42,160
it is I have somebody I can do sometimes

00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:44,710
maybe 50 times they don't know

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:50,650
answer

00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:50,650
yeah yeah yeah yeah

00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,880
it's the same idea yeah

00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:39,400
yeah he's never been more gentle baby so

00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:41,949
and then again I think this is kind of

00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:44,860
going back to Maslow's hierarchy of

00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:48,000
needs and you really understand that so

00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:50,320
what is the guests why why did they go

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,270
spend their day going to conference

00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:55,750
walking around all the goods what are

00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:58,840
they getting out sorry so I yeah that's

00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:02,370
a good one yeah that's one forty percent

00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:06,840
of it because it's a people that's due

00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:11,880
to start a sticker our informations

00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:13,889
information and information of network

00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:18,499
who we were

00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:18,499
yeah you have any other ages Oh

00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:37,540
yeah now they do I kind of think that

00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:39,790
when that guy goes to work on Monday

00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:43,300
what what is he going to talk about no

00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:45,550
you know i went to linux fest and i saw

00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:47,670
what are they going to say they saw you

00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,670
know

00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:53,580
well the thing that will come up first

00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:57,880
is the thing that gave them the most

00:07:53,580 --> 00:08:00,460
memorable experience okay so that's

00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:03,390
that's what I think is the common

00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:06,580
denominator of all these things that I

00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:09,270
like exhibit e because it gives me a

00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:12,130
very pleasant and memorable experience

00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:15,550
madura wants people to have a memorable

00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:18,880
experience remember fedora and the guest

00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:23,560
wants come and have a good experience

00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:27,070
and remember something and we go there

00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:30,880
remember something okay so the goal is

00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:34,300
really let's give the gas a memorable

00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:36,780
experience and if you I think you as a

00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:39,340
fedora booth trying to cover everything

00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:42,610
that you're not going to do that I think

00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:48,850
is with a spin you can focus on the

00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:51,090
depth and get and focus on on experience

00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:51,090
and

00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,770
you're going to lose some people who

00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:01,740
aren't interested in what your spin is

00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:04,830
about but considering the large group of

00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,870
people that attend the there's going to

00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:10,400
be a large percentage that will have

00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:16,140
some interest in your skin via security

00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:18,510
scientific music design whatever okay so

00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:20,970
what I'm trying to do here with this

00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:24,830
workshop is let's create some guidance

00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:27,830
to help people make an exhibit baselines

00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,830
okay

00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:39,270
so this is the graphic that the design

00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:46,110
team made for us for linux fest

00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:49,380
Northwest Brian Monroe did a music spin

00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:52,020
did the door jamb spin at scale and it

00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:55,920
was hugely successful and I had intended

00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:59,610
to do music and linux fest or Brian help

00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:03,300
me out we've got a real nice graphic

00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:06,300
made for it and the things I want to

00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:16,589
focus on here is the entry level

00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:18,839
applications so we want to give our

00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:24,029
guests entry level application something

00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:25,620
that if they use Windows or Mac or just

00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:27,870
kind of generally interested in the

00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:32,010
subject they would look at it and kind

00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:36,110
of understand it so for our exhibit we

00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:39,000
use audacity it's a really simple

00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:41,610
recording program we have Mike person

00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,240
could sing into the mic playback we

00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:48,110
could add an effect it was very easy for

00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,110
a person to use

00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:56,940
and then that you also need to address

00:10:52,170 --> 00:11:01,250
the power users the expert users so we

00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:03,570
showed our door which is a full future

00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:07,020
recording the studio digital audio

00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:10,170
workstation you can actually mix sync it

00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:13,860
with movies and everything and also

00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:15,510
guitar X and a Jack of course you need

00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:23,490
Jack when you're working with high-level

00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:28,080
music applications and showed off the

00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:31,410
tam tam mini and the 10-pound step clap

00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:36,170
this is awesome application you should

00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:36,170
know that right your work is sugar

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,080
those little green things really bring

00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:45,330
people into the table especially young

00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:48,300
people and families so these are the

00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:53,000
people that we really want to engage to

00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:53,000
to help spread limits

00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:01,330
we want hands-on activities you want to

00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:06,580
give some people some physical to do to

00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:08,970
touch something so we didn't have any

00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:11,589
contest we were thinking of a beam up a

00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:15,130
guitar riff contests or a drummer of

00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:17,380
contests or karaoke type contest karaoke

00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:18,910
is kind of hard because the copyright

00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:23,040
thing the door doesn't like getting

00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:25,740
involved with but gives something

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,850
something hands-on for the people to do

00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:32,320
so that's going to create a more

00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:36,610
memorable experience and the specialized

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:38,950
hardware if you're a geek and you're

00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:40,750
interested in that subject there are

00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:42,820
some special equipment that you're going

00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:45,520
to want to look at and have your hands

00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:47,020
on and ask questions about having that

00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:57,459
on your table is going to draw people

00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:59,740
into to talk to you and the swag

00:12:57,459 --> 00:13:02,170
you got to be able to get stuff out and

00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:04,059
you want to give out something unique

00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:05,589
and memorable something that when they

00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:11,110
look at that later on they're going to

00:13:05,589 --> 00:13:12,579
say yeah that was the door jamb me I try

00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:14,589
to get these printed and couldn't get

00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:18,160
him print it on time so i hand wrote for

00:13:14,589 --> 00:13:22,269
door jamb a gross of control pics and

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:27,939
had those out you gotta have business

00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:30,689
card and handles out so people ask

00:13:27,939 --> 00:13:33,579
questions I like putting on a USB stick

00:13:30,689 --> 00:13:34,959
have it available somebody's going to

00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:38,379
spend a half now we're talking to you

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:43,569
you want to give them some even like

00:13:38,379 --> 00:13:46,149
extra special people I USB out and you

00:13:43,569 --> 00:13:49,149
can think of like value-added things is

00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:51,850
there something that you do that you

00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:57,189
could like put on that USB stick or

00:13:51,850 --> 00:14:00,220
share with the guests brian had a whole

00:13:57,189 --> 00:14:05,220
bunch of patches for guitar X he sound

00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:10,059
just just like slashing YouTube

00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:12,339
echo and his plane ambient drone thing

00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:14,529
and he had all this patches and guitar

00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:17,309
axe and he was sharing the guests that

00:14:14,529 --> 00:14:17,309
came through our booth

00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:31,400
the Lord

00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:33,860
I haven't yes new you have I like the

00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:36,620
paper ones it's so easy easy to reach in

00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:40,160
your pocket and add without do the

00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:43,160
Hustle start but I do put up a page with

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:49,750
not about the door

00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:51,320
mm-hmm and my RC general Johnson I'm not

00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,760
you know

00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,840
it's something when you get on a

00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:57,800
conference and you've been here for

00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:59,990
seven years income status oh it sounds

00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,850
like you got the door your talk to this

00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:05,090
person but we never made a higher

00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:07,340
addition to this yeah yeah sometimes I

00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:10,100
get where you want to go to website for

00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:12,080
six years and they'll say Oh bins here

00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:16,490
go talk to him he'll help you get it set

00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:19,250
up mm-hmm exactly itself she'd been

00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:23,840
trying to stop the war and couldn't get

00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:26,030
it in song I am I'm kind of surprised

00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:28,820
about that yet the other thing about

00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:31,160
focusing on a specific topic is it opens

00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:34,580
you up to give your exhibit at other

00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:36,260
places than like spouse I mean going

00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:38,870
down what expenses kind of like

00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:44,450
preaching to the choir isn't it what

00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:48,830
you'd like to do scientific exhibit you

00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:54,110
could go to the high side wait what is

00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:56,900
the Python scientific one and choke door

00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:59,330
there sugar on a stick you could go to

00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:02,690
educational conference choked or there

00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:06,350
these are opportunities to expose fedora

00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:08,210
to people that are outside the realm

00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:10,870
that we normally involve our soaps but

00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:15,930
this this is a good thing

00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:18,760
we want to take the door jamb to namm

00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:22,810
that's the National Music at national

00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:30,670
association for music manufacturers

00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:35,610
music merchants and preneur jam is in a

00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:35,610
way of merging old bull offering

00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:43,150
grabbing some political issues with red

00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:45,100
cat to try to do that that's why I'm

00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:48,089
going to attend the next stock on what

00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,089
this red hat

00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:56,420
let's not cook a week we'll assign in

00:16:52,370 --> 00:17:02,720
one or so to get to be a member of namm

00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:05,299
you have to show that you've sold you

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,809
you have to show three receipts to three

00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:13,610
different music companies now Red Hat

00:17:08,809 --> 00:17:17,540
probably runs the servers for fender or

00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:21,589
Gibson or mo but they're not going to

00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:25,290
release those invoices like so okay it's

00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:28,080
not really others look newest

00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:30,030
well yeah and so we're trying to work

00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,920
our way around that I we think there

00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:34,410
might be some other ways but right now

00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,790
we tried to get to namm this year and we

00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:37,830
couldn't do it because we couldn't get a

00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:41,780
membership in time we're going to try

00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:44,160
next year also make sure you don't do

00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:45,650
about that

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:53,540
with

00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:56,020
okay so let's see we have someone who's

00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:58,730
interested in scientific and someone

00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:01,400
interested in sugar on a stick right and

00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:04,490
you're interested in maybe make or is

00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:10,370
there another one water slide will show

00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:15,020
all the best times okay so if you want

00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:19,460
to take that sheet and let me know what

00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:22,100
what are the applications that your spin

00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:24,940
what would be an entry level application

00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:28,370
for your skin what would be an expert

00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:32,900
application for your spin is there a One

00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:36,230
Laptop Per child application that's kind

00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:38,870
of affiliated that would be

00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:43,580
representative I have them all listed on

00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:49,970
back what what sort of hands-on things

00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:52,940
could you do with your spin good or even

00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:55,220
a contest or so analogy somebody from

00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:58,130
the graphics and the games spins here

00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:59,360
because we want to do games next year at

00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:01,890
Linux

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:05,460
is there any specialized hardware that

00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:08,280
you're spinning would use that would

00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:11,840
attract customers write those down and

00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:19,530
is there any like unique swag that would

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:21,539
go with your spin and and is there any

00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:26,429
other conference or things that your

00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:28,460
spin will be applicable and while you're

00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:28,460
doing

00:19:29,639 --> 00:19:32,450
then I say

00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:44,980
in play it's my cursor

00:19:48,740 --> 00:20:02,410
this is our Brian or put this together

00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:06,559
from the pictures he shot in linux fast

00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:12,050
well you guys are writing down even

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:17,059
watches nor also stops him to gain mine

00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:20,950
so that's very popular and that's why I

00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:20,950
want to do games next year

00:20:27,389 --> 00:20:31,099
he's mostly by on guitar

00:20:40,300 --> 00:21:01,240
no fun okay identity yeah Pete's in

00:20:46,360 --> 00:21:08,140
their gangs now that gal research spirit

00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:10,590
X plus maybe he still wasn't enough he

00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,590
is able

00:21:23,059 --> 00:21:27,519
and my wife wants that cards coming down

00:21:27,639 --> 00:21:31,779
cards against me yes

00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:42,299
so we were able to help out the linux

00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:46,530
fest because the game night is the day

00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:49,679
before the fest we help register people

00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:51,690
get out of their badges so saturday

00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,370
morning those people are the other

00:21:51,690 --> 00:22:00,780
bathroom to walk right into the exhibit

00:21:53,370 --> 00:22:03,500
without waiting room line and it gave us

00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:06,360
opportunity to give up t-shirts to

00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:09,120
people and we the only caveat we said

00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:11,630
you have to work tomorrow so you got a

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:14,010
lot of door t-shirts walking around the

00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:16,380
conferences I like a little note with a

00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:22,679
gun right be in okay you have to put it

00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:25,250

sure we have about 2,000 attendees is

00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:03,140
because bill there is work so Bellingham

the eruption well yeah I don't know how

00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:33,560
big scale I mean oh yeah scale it

00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:38,450
probably baby now like look but not as

00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:45,350
much fun right to me this was more

00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:49,540
Thunder stable still needs to all we got

00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:49,540
her in the face the laptops

00:23:55,230 --> 00:24:06,160
this message right before their lot of

00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:10,810
people have you ever it was so crowded

00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:13,050
that people came back on Sunday to talk

00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:13,050
to

00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:41,620
it's free what is your book so community

00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:45,610
exhibitors can get a six foot table for

00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:49,060
three grunting sign up in time fedora we

00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:54,820
sponsor so we we pay for a larger table

00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:57,430
we also sponsor the game the door is

00:24:54,820 --> 00:25:00,460
pretty good enough you're at least a

00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:07,170
fragment other scholarship prevent

00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:18,060
sticking definitely one yeah those come

00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:20,520
oh yeah we have thoughts gasps really

00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:23,510
interested in trying out the effects

00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,510
with card decks

00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:30,870
no we if you asked to pick up the guitar

00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:34,650
we'd let you do it and we had a keyboard

00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:42,230
too we had the little drum kit this is

00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:42,230
brian has that's my wife on the violin

00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:34,350
how was it a little something infinity

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:41,039
to do is take exit ready kick-starts for

00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:45,419
work will actually get the advisor disk

00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:48,200
installed of the live CD tools the dork

00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:48,200
it starts

00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:55,740
skin tape stops your kid sizes

00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:58,310
if all three of these things are

00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,310
partners

00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,100
what

00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:30,090
I put the question

00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:38,790
what you need is the blood seeing grade

00:27:41,639 --> 00:27:47,520
but you need to know guys so

00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:51,960
no that's what you wanted is currently

00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:54,750
accent real-life city create column to

00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:56,929
correct yes i'm thinking of the USB

00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,929
creator

00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,240
yes

00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:16,490
still has its own number usershare span

00:28:14,989 --> 00:28:20,100
big stars

00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:23,100
you will see every one of the

00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,100
gentle

00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:31,210
we'll see how

00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:36,260
get the kid start there so you can see

00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:40,630
what activism in size

00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:40,630
so what's a movie

00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:48,110
to be great

00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:00,400
what you said

00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:07,109
the other thing I really think about

00:29:04,379 --> 00:29:10,399
focusing on spins is that it would help

00:29:07,109 --> 00:29:13,499
drive down to application developers if

00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:16,440
you're giving it exhibited on your

00:29:13,499 --> 00:29:20,609
subject and there was an application

00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:22,470
developer who had one of the

00:29:20,609 --> 00:29:25,379
applications that was on that spin they

00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:28,109
may want to sit at my door booth with

00:29:25,379 --> 00:29:30,389
you and talk about their application and

00:29:28,109 --> 00:29:33,179
that's going to help build the bond

00:29:30,389 --> 00:29:35,099
between Dora the application which i

00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:38,539
think is when things would really need

00:29:35,099 --> 00:29:38,539
to work over

00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:50,269
ok so did anybody write down anything on

00:29:46,109 --> 00:29:54,830
person your security span looks like

00:29:50,269 --> 00:29:54,830
scientific I know

00:30:01,909 --> 00:30:15,919
yeah well that's okay something that

00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:15,919
graphs maybe wrapping functions

00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:29,210
oh and so expert applications on the

00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:30,260
scientific stand on the side to side

00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:32,710
we'll use our

00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,710
which

00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:40,520
but having it is it part of the spin and

00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:43,160
so it's something you can show is it's

00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:49,400
in the door well I know it's Endora I

00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:51,530
wonder about how I well so it would be a

00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:56,830
thing when you're engaging a guest and

00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:59,830
they say when I reuse art work like this

00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:59,830
there

00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:13,820
that's me

00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:18,110
so there is some on the ball pc they

00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:25,490
analyze that will actually do a Fourier

00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:28,460
analysis show waveforms there there's

00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:31,280
supposed to be one in every kid that we

00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:37,180
don't you get there's supposed to be

00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:37,180
three kids one's good see in action by

00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:56,830
then so boy scientific oh yeah

00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:56,830
oh my

00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:03,530
listen monkeys yeah this but insisted

00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:19,149
after a maze game

00:32:11,049 --> 00:32:23,950
yeah yeah I know exactly what it's one

00:32:19,149 --> 00:32:27,929
of the marble out and then a specialized

00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:27,929
hardware for scientific that

00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:34,340
raspberry pi

00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,360
Oh

00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:56,669
hey raspberry PI's there you have the

00:32:50,420 --> 00:33:06,059
work yeah for those generals shout out

00:32:56,669 --> 00:33:08,309
oh yeah okay and in any specialized swag

00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:14,149
that would appeal to the scientific

00:33:08,309 --> 00:33:14,149
community I decided this

00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,880
the door I had

00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:27,440
ok and then are there other conferences

00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:29,470
that outside the next this way to appeal

00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,470
to

00:33:39,389 --> 00:33:43,190
Oh

00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:47,240
I

00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:50,240
they don't loose oh yeah

00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,240
inside

00:33:54,380 --> 00:34:00,710
he give you know it's pretty well yeah

00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:07,780
it's Stella commercialization yeah

00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:07,780
want they don't wake up got your sister

00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:17,380
well

00:34:19,169 --> 00:34:28,700
indeed some input for sugar on all these

00:34:25,319 --> 00:34:28,700
yeah yeah

00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:34,050
it's more than

00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:34,050
uh

00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:41,590
and maybe more than spin

00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:41,590
ok

00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:48,840
certainly

00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:48,840
they're all perfect

00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,690
Mulder

00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:02,660
something that I show off not sure

00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:08,280
yeah exactly what it might be

00:35:14,589 --> 00:35:19,240
gigabyte

00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:19,240
I you

00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:27,690
is this how's that

00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:48,860
the idea is shove it up the ass

00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:52,300
we're actually not doing we're actually

00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:52,300
not doing the classic

00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:56,750
returning it into the digital library

00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:59,150
because MIT stands high confidence and

00:35:56,750 --> 00:36:00,810
we're sending actually all the schools

00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:03,260
were bolted against

00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:07,160
why

00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:07,160
educational background a teacher

00:36:13,339 --> 00:36:16,180
both the content

00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:27,210
yeah we have very easy sales pitch for

00:36:22,999 --> 00:36:29,099
many years agreement well they're very

00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:32,380
excited that subjects keeping their

00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:35,500
language yeah

00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:37,680
and yes like you know in English but

00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,680
also

00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:52,010
we don't run away from sugar yeah this

00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:53,990
is a

00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:56,180
quite a sophisticated attack we're

00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:58,630
putting together and still picking out

00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:58,630
where we

00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:01,520
this could be a great

00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:10,200
okay it is an olive on here

00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:10,200
I

00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:14,530
landed late

00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:20,040
yes

00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:24,780
and before you walk out what if what

00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:26,640
about original a real person oakwood

00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:29,610
meet my new version oh there's their

00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:34,460
tablet a bunch of burden they have the

00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:38,670
new version of course we going for oh

00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:40,320
well they're going to a tablet oh that's

00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:42,450
happened been dumped but the our

00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,660
partners sent out for a long time this

00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:44,660
is a

00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:53,200
this is our Harbor yeah I I one of each

00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:57,540
yeah I like the arm one we can all see

00:37:53,200 --> 00:38:04,510
how I doesn't mean they're not not touch

00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:09,810
the XO for has festered oh the new

00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:09,810
version I'm running away from

00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:32,130
Oh windows yeah anyway crazies are some

00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:34,950
of your sweater yeah the contest will be

00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:36,810
wonderful and it's a very different

00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:40,950
appeal that

00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:48,120
together which is which is more towards

00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:54,720
educators engagement hands-on stuff

00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:57,770
scrubs is a weird nothing you're

00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,770
interested yeah

00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:04,950
anyone at least have folks so the

00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:08,290
teachers go together go to sprint back

00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:10,800
or find their release of Khan Academy

00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:10,800
they don't like

00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:22,120
it's a broad there's a lot there funny I

00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:27,640
don't have to spin technically but it

00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:30,070
will all be all ya go it'll make me

00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:32,860
disappear it turns on it like weird

00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:36,340
aren't you sugar will beat it well done

00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:39,190
me top I think they say won't be primary

00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:48,250
because people understand if your

00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:51,310
library sounds very ominous spray around

00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:54,280
your village it'll be a hot spot yeah

00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:57,700
all the drivers ready but so we're

00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:59,650
taking me the one to one model these are

00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:03,190
littered around the world literally yeah

00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:05,380
toxic waste around and sorry you can

00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:10,360
make them into something turn it into an

00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:12,829
actual library for that yeah that sounds

00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:32,660
pretty awesome answer all your questions

00:40:12,829 --> 00:40:35,690
oh yeah yeah cool sounds like a great

00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:38,809
idea like no more about it and then the

00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:42,559
ebony did you want to talk about

00:40:38,809 --> 00:40:46,700
anything spin well I'm thinking about

00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:52,849
making the scale and what to bring it

00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:54,709
yeah there you go look we don't we've

00:40:52,849 --> 00:40:58,279
got actually in fact is that we don't

00:40:54,709 --> 00:41:01,539
have an amateur radio spear I got made a

00:40:58,279 --> 00:41:01,539
kick start that feels

00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:11,070
to get going I have my hand at all also

00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:16,720
a ve everyone wants even the test on

00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:20,530
study and you know what OSU eight ER and

00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:22,900
so that's a great idea and and you have

00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:26,310
tons of places tons of hands-on

00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:30,400
specialized equipment I can pouring in

00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:32,860
when a lot of times you have the lenox

00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:35,170
and a half check out show up they set up

00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:40,030
the statute what we definitely four more

00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:43,099
walks to Utley visual that would be

00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:47,180
that would care with that just show

00:41:43,099 --> 00:41:50,030
people that you know camera here was the

00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:52,790
first social network yeah and we also

00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:57,740
read the first text message yeah it

00:41:52,790 --> 00:42:00,170
doesn't and so this is a lot last night

00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:03,790
I'm just asking you think about how to

00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:07,180
create a memorable experience by using

00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:09,560
