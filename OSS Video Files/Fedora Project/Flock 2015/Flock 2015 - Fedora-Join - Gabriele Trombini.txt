Description: 
	The rescue of marooned Mary from the Fedora sea: Mary would join the project, but she doesn't know how make use of her skills. The process can be simplified asking the join group. One contributor from each area of interest is available for all the questions related the join steps and the workflow. If Mary doesn't know how make use of her skills, the join group can do this for her.
