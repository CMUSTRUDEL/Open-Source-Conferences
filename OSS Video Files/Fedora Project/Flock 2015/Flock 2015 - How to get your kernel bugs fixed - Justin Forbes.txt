I know

00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:08,309
no breakages been certainly the

00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:16,560
employees heard then the burden now fell

00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:18,929
on him okay we're all set we can get

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,539
started now uh welcome to me how to get

00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:23,039
your Colonel bugs fixed talk one of the

00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:24,449
reasons we decided to have this talk I

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,419
said if you need to have this talk is

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:30,179
we've got a lot of complex we have a lot

00:00:27,419 --> 00:00:32,040
of people upset that their colonel plug

00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:34,500
is not the top priority is not getting

00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:38,390
fixed and there are things that you can

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,830
do to help us fix your Colonel bucks so

00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:46,830
the state of our current pound bugzilla

00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:49,530
as of august first there are 702 total

00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:53,160
internal parts there are three people on

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:54,720
the chrome team that that makes it

00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,540
fairly difficult to address every single

00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,579
bug obviously we look at everything as

00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:03,270
it comes in but it becomes a question of

00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:04,680
well what is the priority on this what

00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,450
kind of information is there how much

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,409
work am I going to have to do to see if

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,219
this is even something that's

00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:12,710
reproducible that can be addressed in a

00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:14,520
timely manner

00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:16,680
bugs that come in with no information

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:22,050
things that are just straight-up avrt

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:24,030
bugs with no context around them those

00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:26,280
types of things they honestly see them

00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,750
they go in and they're kind of at the

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,300
bottom of the cube we don't pay a lot of

00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,400
attention to them until we have cycles

00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:34,250
to go back and say hey let's get some

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,610
more information here things like that

00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:42,840
so we would like to get bugs that are

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:44,760
easier to fix and so how can you help us

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,100
do that how can you make sure that your

00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:51,060
bug your little bug in this this massive

00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:54,360
haystack of bugs gets fixed most

00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,160
important thing is filed better box that

00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,590
means you might have to do some work yes

00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,840
abrt will pop up and say and you've got

00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,450
a curl oops and we'd like to file a bug

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,400
for you and it will file a bug for you

00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:10,020
there are fields there where you can add

00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:12,210
more information please do importantly

00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,310
see if you can reliably reproduce the

00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:15,960
problem if you can't reproduce the

00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:17,400
problem and come down to a small set of

00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,290
steps that this is what I have to

00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,470
reproduce the problem every time it

00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,850
makes it much easier for us to fix now

00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:26,370
some problems are not that easy to

00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:29,160
reproduce I've seen problems that take

00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:31,320
two days to reproduce and even then it

00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,550
wasn't quite reliable so it's not

00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,350
something you can do every time but if

00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,270
you can do it and you can include the

00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:37,980
information on this is how we reproduce

00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:40,320
this problem it's going to make it

00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,750
easier for us to find the issue fix the

00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,319
issue another thing to do see if people

00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:49,420
are having a similar issue

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:51,730
Google is your friend there are tons of

00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,079
other distributions that have bug

00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,700
tracking system clear different types

00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:58,060
there is several different kernel

00:02:54,700 --> 00:03:00,340
mailing list chances are if you've hit a

00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,290
bug unless you have a problem with your

00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:05,859
hardware you will probably not the only

00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:08,079
one who's ever hit that bug so a quick

00:03:05,859 --> 00:03:11,230
Google search you might find a link to a

00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:13,450
launchpad entry or a cruel little

00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:16,030
discussion ok Mel discussion and things

00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:18,370
like that if you can include that

00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:20,500
information in the bug entry that gives

00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:22,810
us a great place to start looking you

00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:27,669
don't have to be a kernel developer to

00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:29,439
understand the dude there's a discussion

00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:32,709
happening around that Destin what about

00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:35,560
and then we can go in and and figure out

00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:36,819
the problem or perhaps even better

00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,019
someone else has already figured out the

00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:40,780
problem for us and that will be a patch

00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:42,849
there the other thing that's really

00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,290
important because the Fedora chrome was

00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:47,319
quickly is make sure that it's an issue

00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:49,540
with the most recent tunnel we get a lot

00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:54,970
of bugs file on we're still getting bugs

00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:59,129
fell down three to 14 preparatory 21 for

00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:59,129
dot one dot 55

00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:06,770
try your entry that's that's an even

00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,810
better solution but sometimes that

00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:10,640
requires some extra steps and actually

00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:12,740
you mention here we would love for you

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,060
to try the rock normal skateboards that

00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,650
might require configuring of the

00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,239
repository things like that but

00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:21,079
everybody should at least read the most

00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:24,410
recent criminal it's an updates a lot of

00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:26,630
code turn happens in the frontal and the

00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:29,690
difference between feet up 14 and four

00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:31,520
da 105 is me massive so a lot of things

00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:32,870
get fixed unfortunately there might be

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,320
some new bugs introduced in there as

00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:39,050
well it happens but if you've not tried

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,120
the most recent kernel is it's kind of a

00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:44,690
width of time to go through and say is

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,430
this still a problem reporting to go

00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:49,070
through taking what was the problem in

00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:54,110
314 upstream people don't really care

00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:56,690
about people taking on in fact a 40 I

00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:58,669
think just had its last stable release

00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:01,130
so it's done nobody cares about 40

00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:05,750
anymore for that one is kind of it and

00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:09,380
then everybody's working on 42 if we are

00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:12,350
still supporting that if let's say for

00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:15,290
fedora 20 report was in life we did not

00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:19,940
push out the rebase there if there's an

00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:21,320
issue with 40 on for 20 then yes we

00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,850
still care about it whether or not

00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,500
upstream cares we still here because

00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:26,750
we're still supporting that Colonel but

00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,950
those are fairly rare instances usually

00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:31,320
we move along with upstream

00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:33,990
again because there's three of us and

00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:36,720
lots of bugs so anything up to can help

00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:40,430
us with we're happy to have the other

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:43,110
thing is include relevant information so

00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:45,210
avrt and a lot of times people following

00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:47,580
their own bugs will just confuse the

00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:49,470
hoops that I got that's the only

00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:53,580
information they get what we would like

00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:55,680
to know is not only what is the use but

00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:58,200
what is your D message output if this

00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,380
started happening with this particular

00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:03,570
kernel version we need to know that I

00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:05,100
just ran for dot one dot 4 and this was

00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:07,200
not happening and it started happening

00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:13,530
before I wind up five that narrows it

00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:15,810
down a whole lot if it's a divisive

00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:18,510
support pci device USB device we might

00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:20,640
need lsusb out but i was pci output

00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:22,890
those things are great to include

00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:25,230
proactively because when that bug first

00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:26,910
gets filed we can look to and say all

00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:29,370
right well here's a lot of information

00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:30,720
you know we have use we have a lot of

00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:33,000
information surrounding it and we might

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,220
be able to see the problem right away if

00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,710
not at least we know that you're

00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:41,220
providing information and going to be

00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:44,160
fairly responsive as far as taking care

00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:46,220
of that bug we might ask for more

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,220
information

00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:55,310
sighs

00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:06,110
don't there used to be why doesn't it

00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:08,500
work it up right well it does it doesn't

00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,500
quit

00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:14,250
is always purpose e issue first if you

00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,320
include too much that I might have

00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:19,590
something no though I think that the is

00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:22,890
not a that's nervous there needs to be a

00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:24,780
hurry to let all know that the ones

00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:29,160
that's not true people we know it in

00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:32,060
turn up there's always an argument are

00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,060
considering

00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:42,120
well it doesn't horrible at me in fedora

00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:43,800
in the photo there was one simple too it

00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:48,539
was up call it or something like this

00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:51,150
haha which had to run she'll run this

00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:54,840
talk in phone number and presently in

00:07:51,150 --> 00:08:00,419
other came through a lounge bar and

00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:03,479
other lspci USB device every the people

00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:06,300
set of stuff right who's given probably

00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:09,150
selling digital items right something

00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:13,949
but it was just one started set of all

00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:18,449
data without a kidding well asking user

00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:20,430
what you have to provide you well not if

00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:22,349
I have is a detriment of the bugs alone

00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:26,340
that way that it was cuttin data may

00:08:22,349 --> 00:08:28,409
select yeah that's better there is the

00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:31,130
decisions over sine waves on a

00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:31,130
statistician

00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:37,300
watch them on that matter I'm not sure

00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:45,280
exactly what it is unless that's part of

00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:47,320
that face yeah awesome info I was not

00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:49,480
older than that would be good to see

00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:52,150
whatever what it collects I'd also

00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:54,370
notices that it's true the attitude I

00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:56,200
mean I know they do that but if they

00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:57,670
come back to us and say we don't know

00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,490
how to do that it's pretty easy to be

00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:03,460
able to say open the terminal and type

00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:05,920
this is bro and I guess I think she does

00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:08,590
together the goal of the plan oh well

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,720
they don't necessarily have to Antonio's

00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:12,460
triaging above the memories we have

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,420
that's where we are triage of the funds

00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,420
nobody else

00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:25,319
we do have a country on page that walks

00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:27,600
you through it has links to all of the

00:09:25,319 --> 00:09:32,720
bugzilla you know here are the bugzilla

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:34,889
queries for untriaged bugs nobody used

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,800
every once in a while we'll get somebody

00:09:34,889 --> 00:09:39,509
who comes along and doesn't great job

00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,990
for a week or two and then they

00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:45,600
disappear so you know I understand it's

00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:48,240
over it's over one was not easy to tell

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,649
another one they do yeah it's a

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,569
thankless job except for me really

00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:53,839
really appreciate it so thank you when

00:09:51,569 --> 00:09:57,980
you do that but we haven't had that one

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,980
last year somebody did it

00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:10,010
you remember the colonel ugh thank you

00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:11,390
so much now go in the trash edge and

00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:19,370
here's some the other stuff we need to

00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:21,880
really work Logan but I wondering about

00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:24,920
another open on the front side it if

00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:27,230
Aaron is filing a lot for you we can

00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,790
also still meeting screeching you to say

00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:31,220
by the way your way Smith is better

00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:36,230
growling and that means interaction with

00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:38,690
that team I me after you listen if

00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:41,750
you're geniuses that they're actually

00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:43,190
very responsive live only they've done a

00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,330
great job of filtering out a lot of the

00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:46,700
croft and making sure we're not eating

00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:49,640
bugs filed with tainted and things like

00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:52,310
that that are important that actually is

00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:54,170
another very important point is if your

00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:58,220
problem happens and you've got a

00:10:54,170 --> 00:11:00,380
changing nvidia driver or anything like

00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:02,210
that you're going to have to reproduce

00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,350
it without that or honest that are just

00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:06,800
not going to work

00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:08,720
i will say that tainted doesn't mean

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,310
necessarily what it used to i mean

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,470
there's a tainted fiberglass as you loot

00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:13,760
the force right there it well so there

00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:15,050
are multiple team flag and that's

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,480
another important with no the one that

00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:19,820
says you lose before we into your system

00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,920
is an upstate we want to know the

00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,390
original loop saying go back you don't

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,340
you know grab that you don't grab that

00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:27,050
last one that has the tainted plug go to

00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:29,750
the original limits not tainted and that

00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:32,120
tells you what started all right is it a

00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:35,030
lot of us have machines that just throw

00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:37,490
a loose it and boot just because there's

00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:39,770
like all of the acpi cabling that

00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:42,350
doesn't necessarily render any further

00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:47,030
one report useless so right it's a tough

00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:51,800
that is a that's a very problem we can

00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:53,630
solve yes yeah that's see if you find

00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,880
enough copies of this that grabbed us on

00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:58,130
manchester and somebody doesn't flip

00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,630
right when you're probably examples of

00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:00,790
that

00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:02,650
I think there's for example if I have a

00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:05,620
new one though is that we're not that

00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:07,300
you know willful d Mars Nexus is your

00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:10,270
kernel is fine but it's still worn for

00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:12,640
different bragging right probably

00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:14,080
leaders together by default in Mozilla

00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:17,800
weakens it dispersive are both of these

00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:19,870
forever and these are probably called a

00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:22,450
plasma cause of the candidates right and

00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:24,820
then separate math based on which part

00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:27,270
repeat on other systems do we used to

00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:30,250
have two and David was really good at it

00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:33,100
just just by looking here we have it

00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:35,800
like there are people with that mark

00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:38,110
where that file a ton of yaks and it was

00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:41,440
weird I guess Dave remember to every

00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:43,900
strange bug and identify this person has

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,490
filed 18 bugs under left and they won't

00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,560
reject our hardware like we've asked so

00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:50,200
we just kind of need to ignore them

00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:52,150
because it's bad hard work and he was

00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,440
really good at that several times he

00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:55,150
would comment that in people like oh

00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:59,860
yeah I have replaced my memory and it's

00:12:55,150 --> 00:13:01,420
all gone away some extra helpful items

00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:05,760
the things that are going above and

00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:08,000
beyond just doing a google searching and

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,500
guessing your fellow people

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,770
or making sure that we give the relevant

00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:14,900
information around if there's discussion

00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:16,430
upstream about to issue the google

00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:19,850
search will probably help you find it

00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:22,520
you link it to the bug then that helps

00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:26,180
us a lot if it doesn't exist you can

00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:28,130
start one there is a maintainer spy on

00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:31,130
the colonel and we don't actually ship

00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:32,330
it by default on the system but i think

00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:35,480
i should probably just go ahead and add

00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:37,280
in on the colonel wiki this is a link to

00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,690
the maintainer spell so you can go and

00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:41,720
see who's the maintainer for this

00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:43,070
subsystem I know that it's it's kind of

00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,990
daunting if you are not a kernel

00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:46,970
developer not a member of the colonel to

00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:49,850
communicate to send an email with a bug

00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:53,570
report but really it can be a very

00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:56,510
simple email to the maintainers list to

00:13:53,570 --> 00:14:00,410
el kml than not as useful because it's

00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:02,210
very noisy saying hey I ran into this

00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:04,010
problem with this kernel version and as

00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:05,780
long as it is the most recent stable

00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,510
kernel version or what we're shipping

00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:09,860
will probably get some difference month

00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:11,090
yeah it should at least be interesting

00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:14,420
and if you if you send in that first

00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:16,220
email even if you don't want to continue

00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:18,650
in the discussion or the discussion goes

00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,970
above your level you have a link to you

00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,680
know this is the email I sent to the

00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:24,140
list we can follow in on that discussion

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,600
as well and hopefully you get good

00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:28,310
things happening in there a lot of times

00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,010
that's what we're gonna have to do

00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:32,000
anyway we don't have the cycles to go

00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:34,100
through everything we don't have the

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,330
hardware that everybody has so we're

00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,980
going to have to start the discussion on

00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:38,720
the train anyway and if you've already

00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,750
started it for us that's a great head

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,750
start

00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:48,880
that's true that's true i mean the the

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:54,760
flame the flame part of it we can do it

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:58,300
pretty well ok i'm johanna users yeah

00:14:54,760 --> 00:15:00,040
actually the opposite I found them look

00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,930
word of your writing the person you're

00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:05,530
attempting to make a regional bug report

00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:07,120
you'll generally be accepted fairly well

00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:10,090
in terms of this hearing someone

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,680
experienced person who's screwing up or

00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:13,900
you're a new person living communities

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:20,140
up then you will get yourself right so i

00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:22,840
have ios app well you may or may not

00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:24,940
have luck but if the conversation is

00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,590
started then yesterday so if somebody

00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:29,890
replies then maybe we can jump in it as

00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:32,140
well and and also the up three mailing

00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:33,670
list at pretty if you lose so later when

00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,290
somebody gets their problem they're

00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:40,380
going to find that post and say hey I'm

00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:40,380
also see that's right it helps a lot

00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:47,090
if you do find a patch somewhere even if

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,420
you're not sure that it fixes the issue

00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:52,520
you think hey this patch see you can win

00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:54,500
that up to up its it's much easier for

00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:57,410
us to look at it and say oh well now

00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,820
that patch doesn't fix the issue or yes

00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:00,230
that patch looks like a mud fix the

00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:02,600
issue participants are preceded by this

00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:04,250
patch things like that you know we can

00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,500
address that it's still a huge help if

00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:09,140
you include on if you include a link to

00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,880
a ballad patch that definitely fixes the

00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:12,770
issue or probably looks like a fish it

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,180
fixes the issue we're probably going to

00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:16,550
build you a criminal very quickly a

00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:17,660
scratch kernel and say test this and if

00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:19,250
it works in a getting to the next

00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:22,700
release we're releasing kernels pretty

00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:26,900
much weekly so that gets an issue quick

00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:28,550
fixed very quickly if you can tell us

00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:31,490
the most recent kernel that did not have

00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:37,160
the issue that's great if you installed

00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:39,230
on on 314 and you know for f 21 you just

00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:43,070
updated from a fresh install it jumps to

00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:44,480
415 there's an issue there well maybe

00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:46,460
you should go back and check the first

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,520
of all one really speaking for it check

00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:51,020
the last 40 release we get bored if you

00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:54,470
can just check those things very quickly

00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:56,510
and then say hey this this colonel had

00:16:54,470 --> 00:17:00,590
it this one did not that really helps us

00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:02,000
narrow it down and then as someone else

00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:03,650
mentioned earlier if you can test with

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,550
the rawhide colonel that is a snapshot

00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:09,220
of witnesses treat daily we are well

00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:11,980
almost daily inter

00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:13,510
and so if you can touch with that and

00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:16,150
the issue has gone away that told us

00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:17,650
that it's fixed upstream and makes it a

00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:19,990
little bit easier for us to first track

00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:22,600
down where it was fixed and try to get

00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:24,069
that patch back board again and for an

00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,600
issue that's that's causing problems for

00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:27,970
users would probably also want to get

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,429
that into the stable tree so that not

00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:32,140
only do our users receive the fix but

00:17:30,429 --> 00:17:40,900
everybody running the stable for almost

00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:43,330
gets to fix general tips a little bit of

00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:45,309
kindness goes a long way and we don't

00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:46,630
like to see chronic issues any more than

00:17:45,309 --> 00:17:49,870
you guys like to see Colonel issues

00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:53,080
another affecting your systems but we're

00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:56,020
not we're not sitting there laughing at

00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:57,970
Colonel bugs we would rather there not

00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:59,590
be any and that doesn't mean we would

00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:01,480
rather you not file any it means we

00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:03,400
would rather they're actually not be any

00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:07,080
bugs impacting our users it's an

00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:09,520
impossible goal but we do want to help

00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:12,400
due to volume a lot of issues to do take

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,950
some time to get to but if you're nice

00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,169
about it we are certainly much more

00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:19,150
likely to get to your issues with more

00:18:17,169 --> 00:18:22,080
quickly than people who are throwing a

00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:24,760
fit why is this not being taken care of

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,080
especially especially when it's not

00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:29,289
something that's affecting many users

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:31,240
all right the reality is if you are one

00:18:29,289 --> 00:18:33,429
user who's followed bug against one

00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,620
problem your sound device or something

00:18:33,429 --> 00:18:37,120
like that it's not going to take

00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:39,760
priority to

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:43,120
that 15 people appear to top that

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:46,150
including or effective especially things

00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:49,940
like data or things of that nature

00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:51,200
and be responsive when we ask for

00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:54,440
information that means we're actually

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:57,110
looking at your butt you know right now

00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:59,360
I understand email takes a little bit of

00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:01,309
time if we ask for more information and

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,160
if you can respond within a few days

00:19:01,309 --> 00:19:06,260
that's great if you're taking two to

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,030
three weeks to respond a lot of times

00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:11,150
it's going off our radar again you know

00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:13,700
plus it's out of date well sure that

00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:15,200
that can be the case as well in two or

00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:19,190
three weeks we've probably done two more

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:21,860
Colonel bumps so hit-and-run bug filings

00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:24,350
are bad for everyone and their there are

00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,760
a lot of bugs that get filed as a hey

00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:27,650
here's this oops I ran into this issue

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,650
and we never hear from that user again

00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:33,470
we can ask for it asked if they all the

00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:37,010
only time they ever hear closed is when

00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:39,559
we do the auto we've done a full rebase

00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:41,419
we would like you to test this nobody

00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:43,040
responds within three weeks events and

00:19:41,419 --> 00:19:44,330
you need info then they get closed and

00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:48,049
we don't know if it was actually fixed

00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:50,419
or not those types of bugs add to the

00:19:48,049 --> 00:19:53,120
volume significantly they add to the

00:19:50,419 --> 00:19:55,490
noise and it makes it harder for us to

00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,070
get to other box right the time that we

00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:59,690
spend looking at that bug ends up being

00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:02,419
waste of time because you're not going

00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:03,919
to help us fix the bug you're not going

00:20:02,419 --> 00:20:05,150
to help us help you and that doesn't

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,960
mean that we need you to go and do the

00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:11,210
code you just need some information so

00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:15,380
now please be responsible

00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:17,690
bonus points yeah if you can find a

00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:21,500
patch that is the quickest way to get a

00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:23,510
boat fixed I'm not saying you will over

00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,610
time in fact you probably want to a lot

00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:27,950
of different but if you can include one

00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:30,500
you get big bonus points for that it's

00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:34,669
going to be fixed very quickly the

00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:36,520
second is write a test the we've been

00:20:34,669 --> 00:20:39,860
talking for a couple years now about the

00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:42,890
desk sweet that we run every tunnel gets

00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:46,250
tested as soon as it's built for issues

00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:48,320
that are quick to reproduce easy to

00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:49,700
reproduce it might be worth writing a

00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,830
test it doesn't require colonel

00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:53,360
knowledge there's a link right here on

00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:56,539
the testing guidelines but really the

00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,460
testing harness is all in batch so if

00:20:56,539 --> 00:21:02,390
you have these commands that can

00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:04,100
reproduce that problem quickly and write

00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:07,039
the test and submit it to the to the

00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:08,809
fedora Colonel knowing list will get it

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,190
included in our test suite and hopefully

00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:15,169
make sure that the issue just come back

00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:16,970
up so it's not a requirement and a lot

00:21:15,169 --> 00:21:18,590
of times we'll look at at bugs and say

00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:20,630
oh yes that was quickly reproducible I

00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:22,460
can run a test for that really quick but

00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:25,640
if if you do one that's even better than

00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:26,559
if there's a badge for people writing

00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,379
test

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:31,809
if not if not there's i put in a

00:21:29,379 --> 00:21:43,779
proposal for one I haven't seen how that

00:21:31,809 --> 00:21:46,480
fell out we are only primary arches

00:21:43,779 --> 00:21:52,799
right now except for arm and that's a

00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:52,799
lot of hard work so it's x86 so

00:21:52,830 --> 00:22:01,200
probably it is no but they think it

00:21:58,409 --> 00:22:03,299
actually we could find a tiny and beyond

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,919
nothing about somewhere right that's

00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:08,640
their forward well actually though they

00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:10,980
could run know how they can run them up

00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,720
another part of the issue with that is

00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:15,480
because Koji's not doing those bills

00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,529
directly they go through so they would

00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,510
have to have actually there would have

00:22:16,529 --> 00:22:19,830
to be a second monitor that says we need

00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:21,659
to kick off these jobs because those

00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:24,690
folks finished I know it fed message we

00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:27,510
see the map so I see every time a 390 or

00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:31,769
power bill is done yeah but it doesn't

00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:33,899
do anything is it they could easily run

00:22:31,769 --> 00:22:35,760
the test suite as well well well what

00:22:33,899 --> 00:22:37,350
we've done on all of those systems

00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,840
actually all the beams that are running

00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:42,570
the test which set it as startup it

00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:45,299
grabs the latest kernel runs the test

00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:47,399
and then shuts itself back down so I

00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:48,929
mean it's pretty easy to add to start

00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:51,510
off to an existing system and say hey

00:22:48,929 --> 00:22:53,700
just test every time people and those

00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:56,279
results even if community runs them

00:22:53,700 --> 00:23:01,820
those results still get submitted to our

00:22:56,279 --> 00:23:01,820
server woods you hold it there arches

00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:10,799
yeah but right now arches don't I don't

00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:12,419
think they show up unless they run from

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,400
our harness because we didn't want a

00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:15,600
bunch of but if people are testing

00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,940
kernels and they're building in those

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:23,690
things yeah I don't think they'll show

00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:23,690
up so but we can make those visible

00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:29,290
really that much that you can actually

00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:31,130
do an automated test for given a

00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:32,840
significant portion of this is going to

00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:35,480
be completely hard work related so

00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,860
there's not a ton there actually is a

00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,260
mechanism in the harness where you can

00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:41,300
say this is a hardware specific test and

00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:42,500
it checks to see so there's there's

00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:45,260
three things you can do with the test

00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:47,810
you can either executed successfully you

00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:49,070
can skip prettyful failing obviously you

00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:52,610
don't want to fail it but you can say

00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:54,830
hey is this is this module installed do

00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:56,120
it am i running this hardware oh and if

00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:57,800
I'm running it then I'll run this test

00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,990
and if I'm not then I skip the talk just

00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,820
run the thing on my hardware to write

00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:03,500
and if it's in the sweet than anybody

00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:05,300
else who has that hard work and also run

00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:07,040
it so there are badges for running the

00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,540
test suite which means we get a lot of

00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:11,540
users actually running the test suite

00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:13,430
and submitting results it's great so

00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:14,630
even if it's something that if it's

00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:18,730
hardware that we're not going to get an

00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:21,170
RBM somebody out there might have it and

00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:25,070
it's worth testing their a master wiki

00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:27,440
page there goes to all these or well

00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:30,700
there's the just the colonel wiki page

00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:33,470
has all the things on it so it's got

00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:36,399
that the testing information it's got

00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:38,809
the triage information

00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:40,100
some of it does need to be updated I

00:24:38,809 --> 00:24:41,389
actually went to update something this

00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:43,249
morning realize their couple of other

00:24:41,389 --> 00:24:47,090
places we need to update but that'll

00:24:43,249 --> 00:24:48,559
happen hopefully in the next week I'm

00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:51,529
not sure where all the window plumbers

00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:55,549
next week to set yeah and weird right

00:24:51,529 --> 00:24:59,240
yeah so yeah so I'm home Monday and then

00:24:55,549 --> 00:25:01,700
I'm back out Tuesday later guys so you

00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:03,259
have this summary it's it's pretty

00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,629
simple we've got a ton colonel bugs

00:25:03,259 --> 00:25:08,980
we've got three people if we have your

00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:11,659
help we can get to your bug more quickly

00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:14,840
the more information you give us more

00:25:11,659 --> 00:25:16,369
likely to find a fix and a little bit of

00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:20,179
work that you do on your end is actually

00:25:16,369 --> 00:25:23,059
greatly appreciated by us so when we fix

00:25:20,179 --> 00:25:24,259
a bug it might if it's your bug it makes

00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:25,580
the door better for you but it also

00:25:24,259 --> 00:25:27,860
makes it better for anybody else who's

00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:30,320
when you cross that same boat and not

00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:31,970
willing to put forth the effort yeah we

00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,240
we want to make the door as good as it

00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:34,240
can be

00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:42,570
that we the people use it most people

00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:49,590
who do yet most people do most people

00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:55,350
are not just saying them hmm baby crying

00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:56,820
haha do that taro family so you

00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:58,470
mentioned that occasionally somebody

00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:00,899
pops up out of the community and does

00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:05,260
trey ultimately yes so it sounds like

00:26:00,899 --> 00:26:08,870
what you need is five or ten people from

00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:12,350
triage and not moving sure well I mean

00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:14,780
if we have five people who can do and

00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:18,170
maybe did a half hour a week apiece hmm

00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:20,630
that would be no got massive so it is

00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:23,990
okay from your standpoint for some money

00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:26,120
to drive by do some triage according to

00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:28,160
the documents that you laid out and then

00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,870
maybe they're you know they gotta go

00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,030
back to work the next week but sure they

00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:33,620
did something okay sure so why do we

00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:36,470
screw this differently obviously there's

00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:39,410
a dick get a badge that's a one of those

00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:41,540
level badges series that is I stuff

00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:44,180
around doing colonel free guys don't

00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:46,700
matter about the badges but right there

00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:49,700
a lot of me well dude it's working

00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:51,920
pretty well as in 10 days okay and then

00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:54,470
say you know you get the first one for a

00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,850
fur for showing up a 90 day and learning

00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:58,490
the triage and doing this and realize

00:26:55,850 --> 00:27:02,360
that day and every release we have one

00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:06,500
of those one activity day and you give a

00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:08,120
badge for showing up consecutively that

00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:10,630
would be kind of awesome that would

00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:13,190
actually be really awesome we could do

00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:14,630
we could do some of that and that's so

00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:17,540
we have test days that are that are

00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:20,090
formally organized from a fedora singh

00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:23,169
point for all sorts of subsystems it

00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:27,080
would be a good idea to throw in a tree

00:27:23,169 --> 00:27:30,289
particularly probably late alpha or very

00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:33,049
early light up yeah I mean you know

00:27:30,289 --> 00:27:35,750
they've got back fences around your team

00:27:33,049 --> 00:27:37,760
is that well young people through this

00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:39,110
girl but you can get well you don't have

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,090
to a new room I mean you can do it in

00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:42,440
Irish solid course yeah so we can just

00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:44,659
I'm just saying here we have a little

00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:46,940
conference to know everything that's

00:27:44,659 --> 00:27:49,970
true we do but there's there's usually

00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:52,279
there's a lot more development that

00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:53,990
happens in the hackfest on Saturday but

00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:55,909
really can't require people being in the

00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:58,730
same room or yeah it's really helped by

00:27:55,909 --> 00:28:01,549
that whereas I think we would be taking

00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:04,639
away time from people here so I'm doing

00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:06,080
I was checking the page to see if my

00:28:04,639 --> 00:28:08,890
questions are already answered before I

00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,630
asked questions but it's

00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:12,610
there's a couple asian I mean assuming

00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:14,560
we're of the technical level that we can

00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:18,100
build our own damn cards right Heston's

00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:20,680
right um you run into an issue or the

00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:22,510
Fedora kernel is not vanilla you can't

00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,890
really get bisected for one thing but

00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:26,530
you've actually been working on that I

00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:29,770
wrote of scripts that I've sort of been

00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:32,620
to be able to bisect for first off end I

00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:33,980
have to do a trial run defined above

00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:36,590
being good

00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:38,870
are you the new Carl persons come on

00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:42,770
board name I forget okay this is Laura

00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:45,290
this is this is Colonel person three so

00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:49,100
it's Carl person to here as well yes

00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:52,010
Josh he's in love I know it doesn't

00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:53,990
really matter what station is if I see

00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:55,910
what people look like you'll be doing

00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:58,100
the stick of the colonel talk this

00:28:55,910 --> 00:29:01,429
afternoon to which is kind of the pump

00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:05,480
we get everyone as well oh yes I'll be a

00:29:01,429 --> 00:29:08,720
believer best oh yeah yeah so let's see

00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:11,270
so the time i get my sect ability um i

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,520
have this problem where I know how to

00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:14,980
build the door packages so I will tweak

00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,720
something in the kernel and then I'll

00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:19,970
kick off a mock build and wait three

00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:23,510
hours for the whole kernel package to

00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:26,179
dump out right I know that the colonel

00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:27,350
you can just build source in there

00:29:26,179 --> 00:29:29,210
without I'm going to go through all the

00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:31,580
pain in the rear of doing that but I

00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:34,490
have no idea how you actually get that

00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:36,440
installed as a regular colonel so that i

00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:39,410
can leave intuitive then move back out

00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:41,660
of it right so um there's actually a

00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:44,540
great big me dot and the kernel source

00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:46,580
that kind of joke i do which honestly is

00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:49,970
a shell script in the package directory

00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:51,530
but runs the RPM dash B dash without

00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:53,120
that's what it without that without oh

00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:55,460
right right right and it makes the

00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:58,700
smallest point to be a lot faster that's

00:29:55,460 --> 00:30:01,010
true yeah I mean I don't even need an

00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:02,960
RPM if I know that it's going to show up

00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:05,179
in the grub menu after i finished make

00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,860
install right but i have no idea if it

00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:09,470
actually well so there's a new kernel

00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:11,750
there's a there's actually a script that

00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:14,270
should work okay so once you copy the

00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:17,330
colonel over to boot and then it may be

00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:19,730
followed yeah but I never Dale I'm

00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:21,200
what's up what I'm wondering is I don't

00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:23,430
know that we've patched make install to

00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,530
work correctly with everything being

00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:28,830
user now and I don't know if new kernel

00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:32,910
sort of thoughts for Delta money it's

00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:36,870
working for me on it about left 23

00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:39,030
Robert you are the classic case f 21 the

00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:43,440
other question so it's working for you

00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:45,000
and for me yeah it's under yeah right to

00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,730
a huge communist last moon diamond bar

00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,410
matter running tolerantly it's also kind

00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:51,480
of annoying that we have to copy it to

00:30:49,410 --> 00:31:05,430
be down here when you get a good thing

00:30:51,480 --> 00:31:07,440
there but yeah captions yes right well

00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:09,420
that was just pages for John may reach

00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,860
your hands there is a dildo so there's a

00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:13,170
lot we shouldn't do they're probably

00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:14,760
just be right now like you've done that

00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:18,000
you've got this Colonel seems like

00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:20,370
forever and rubbing is forever and we

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,350
don't really have a way to say hey I was

00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:24,650
on a desk Erna now I've done that

00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:28,260
hospital in that kind of raising me

00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:30,960
there is a way to which we could write

00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:34,050
relatively easy we could there's also a

00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:37,230
pretty simple way to do in our noodle

00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:38,910
it's just a quicker yeah yeah so if you

00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:42,930
tell you don't want to debug you don't

00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:44,520
want that's a lot of it in which case so

00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:45,660
if you're making a release Colonel

00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:49,149
you're also building in to book travel

00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:52,539
right yeah yeah and that takes it all

00:31:49,149 --> 00:31:55,659
to dust some of this data is some logs

00:31:52,539 --> 00:31:58,869
going with this conversation ceased

00:31:55,659 --> 00:32:03,249
people's hopes that our clue with

00:31:58,869 --> 00:32:08,379
Colonel boys right you know I'm seeing a

00:32:03,249 --> 00:32:11,909
bug up an X it started with three point

00:32:08,379 --> 00:32:16,210
18 right and I when I cry every kernel

00:32:11,909 --> 00:32:20,349
and I it happens again right a week I go

00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:22,570
back 316 yeah ok so that's accident

00:32:20,349 --> 00:32:26,559
that's so yeah that's how do I know

00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:29,679
original to do ok I've and my two cents

00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:32,559
to the bugzilla right before it I bad my

00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:36,099
few cents to the free desktop one and I

00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:38,369
think it's kind of getting the what it's

00:32:36,099 --> 00:32:43,349
kind of getting lost is everybody saying

00:32:38,369 --> 00:32:47,529
right I problem well so do most of the X

00:32:43,349 --> 00:32:50,320
bits are you know a lot of it is Colonel

00:32:47,529 --> 00:32:51,669
now so it's it's you've got usually the

00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,879
same people were looking at both sides

00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:57,729
of it so it's okay to file a bug is

00:32:54,879 --> 00:33:00,609
Colonel right now well if we're actually

00:32:57,729 --> 00:33:03,429
from a triage standpoint when when a bug

00:33:00,609 --> 00:33:05,289
is filed against Colonel and it's in drm

00:33:03,429 --> 00:33:07,269
it actually gets read filed against the

00:33:05,289 --> 00:33:09,999
x-component anyway because that's how

00:33:07,269 --> 00:33:15,789
our graphics guys want okay so it would

00:33:09,999 --> 00:33:17,710
be it would be be filed against 115 or

00:33:15,789 --> 00:33:19,330
whatever in the appropriate maintenance

00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:21,429
will take a look at that there that's

00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:22,809
the method that they so you can't you

00:33:21,429 --> 00:33:25,149
can't really put in the wrong place yeah

00:33:22,809 --> 00:33:26,889
but yeah the lesson here is do whatever

00:33:25,149 --> 00:33:29,019
seems right it'll get right okay well

00:33:26,889 --> 00:33:30,940
the problem is you're talking about you

00:33:29,019 --> 00:33:32,529
know we can't do the triage which means

00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:34,960
we can't because there's not enough

00:33:32,529 --> 00:33:36,789
cycles so we can't necessarily make sure

00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,619
the bug hits free to write a sentence

00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:41,799
nobody has a chance to look at bretts up

00:33:38,619 --> 00:33:44,289
right and so if I'm doing triage hello I

00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:46,509
know whose bug it is there so there's

00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:48,249
the treehouse patient includes some of

00:33:46,509 --> 00:33:54,399
them no does it go get well yes I'll

00:33:48,249 --> 00:33:56,340
which walks to a lot of that okay is

00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:59,640
that helpful is it

00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:01,980
figure out how to prioritize culture

00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:03,480
well with the retrace changes that have

00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:05,730
been made recently I just gotten a lot

00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:07,529
better and loresmen goons who worked as

00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:10,409
well too I did some work on there but

00:34:07,529 --> 00:34:13,560
still on the daily basis I probably in

00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:18,599
terms of katie's there's still a lot of

00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:20,339
noise I think specifically Europeans

00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:21,839
through the certification for very old

00:34:20,339 --> 00:34:23,429
Colonels so for example like you know

00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:25,080
the problem point about 30 to 40 minutes

00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:27,220
of identification for that for

00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:31,790
rehabilitation

00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:33,620
100 na which still happens and then it's

00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:35,690
so the other thing I thought is that

00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:37,550
year he is still unfortunately it only

00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:38,960
gives the back try since partner them

00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:40,580
aren't be able to the rest of the girl

00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,230
venus angelo some actual files are

00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:44,800
clogged so they just having a year to

00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:47,120
report then the million back rays which

00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,860
there's a few of them where it's just a

00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:50,980
little bit more information we could

00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,980
actually

00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:57,800
so it's step in the right direction but

00:34:55,099 --> 00:35:01,160
I still found it to be very hard to sort

00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:04,010
through to figure out what is actually

00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:06,770
doing something it means that give your

00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:09,260
facebook passive so if someone is that

00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:11,410
community to file a bug that's still

00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,410
mama

00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:18,030
so very nasty

00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,030
Oh

00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:42,060
wait guys because we follow request

00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:54,400
because you are being common to work

00:35:56,180 --> 00:36:01,809
and for first time that I hear that

00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:08,990
he's not touching

00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:18,310
we are much happier than but okay it

00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:20,860
sounds like what you're saying is just

00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:24,930
give me this a little bit more comedy my

00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:27,340
sources it's an that is really good

00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:30,090
those are the way there's certainly more

00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:30,090
work to be done

00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:36,950
it's is your problem of compromise and

00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:36,950
other things that I remember

00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:47,660
ok this will kind of pretty obvious a 40

00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:51,349
I saw so it's a couple in consolidating

00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:52,320
I would say it's lesson from with amir

00:36:51,349 --> 00:36:54,380
people before

00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,380
Oh

00:36:55,940 --> 00:37:00,570
well I mean the biggest problem that I

00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,210
think we have with a VR T is not

00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:05,480
actually an aviary problem it's just a

00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:08,580
because of the way that it pops up

00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:10,080
people file bugs and they click the

00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:11,700
input to save file the blog and have a

00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:14,700
VIP for all the bug and it claims just

00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:17,220
assume they're done so we get a lot of

00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:18,780
bugs or a B or C file bugs that they

00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:20,160
file in and walk away we never get

00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:21,720
anything from them again you asked for

00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,880
more information you don't get it would

00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:26,670
you classify that is better than nothing

00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:28,230
or you wish it would be better if people

00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:33,140
just didn't file them at all that's

00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:35,340
actually a really tough call sometimes

00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:37,050
yeah there's some of those that aren't

00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:39,060
that pretty self in pain you can tell

00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:42,060
exactly what's going on but the problem

00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:44,280
is is that it's sort of obscure it if

00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:47,630
it's something like if there's success

00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:52,580
by morning than even hear myself

00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:53,990
just like a random right it's time also

00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:55,910
sometimes helpful when you have somebody

00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:57,230
who does actually file the bug and then

00:37:55,910 --> 00:38:00,080
you've got all these other aviary

00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:01,280
reports that they're hidden runs but you

00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,750
know all right there are a lot of people

00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,610
hitting this problem and i do have

00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:08,300
somebody who's responsively going to

00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:09,770
help me fix it so they're useful a lot

00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:12,170
of the time and then a lot of times you

00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:14,180
do get the it was a one-off it'll never

00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:16,040
happen again you've got this bug fell

00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:18,500
they're not responsive about it so it's

00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:21,110
just noise but I don't know that you can

00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:23,360
I don't know a way to effectively get

00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:25,100
rid of that noise with the tioga what

00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,660
saw it just has signal is it look we

00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:28,820
asked for info it's been a month ago in

00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:31,430
the box all right into the part that is

00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:32,960
is something that we need to work on a

00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:35,570
different scale than talking about the

00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:38,600
colonel bus because what I hear you

00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:42,980
saying is we given these our own

00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:45,260
mechanism wherein they can report that a

00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:47,930
fault has happened without becoming

00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:50,240
involved in reporting the breath right

00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:51,860
nope I mean and now they're not

00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,810
responding running hot involved but

00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:56,690
doesn't want to that not go to bugzilla

00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:59,150
noun don't you have a large I just

00:38:56,690 --> 00:39:01,730
collected officer or isolated we get

00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:04,160
retraces retrace it and that retraces

00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:06,350
nice yeah getting much better for us

00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,300
where we're seeing to from escalating to

00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:12,380
the point works in way as much right but

00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:13,940
it still doesn't doesn't increase the

00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:16,580
incidence of solving users problem that

00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:18,200
deep right thinks up yeah but is it

00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:22,030
going to not necessarily the number of

00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:22,030
the New York dressing is low

00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:29,730
the prospect is relatively complete

00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:37,420
it's a lot of my every language I was

00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:42,250
going to have good bugzilla links or so

00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:45,140
where's the 20 to go back up to the top

00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:46,790
yeah it's the very top of the page okay

00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:48,589
i'm looking at the link i'm just trying

00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:50,030
to figure out here not reviewing the

00:39:48,589 --> 00:39:51,680
source what i'm saying though they might

00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:54,049
give you a normally without without the

00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:58,069
source no see it I'm just trying to add

00:39:54,049 --> 00:39:59,630
the f 23 languages right so that was

00:39:58,069 --> 00:40:02,180
what I've seen part of this out of date

00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:04,099
there 23 stuff needs find it edit it in

00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:07,839
right now if I could figure out even

00:40:04,099 --> 00:40:07,839
better change me every URL

00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:17,160
first

00:40:17,609 --> 00:40:19,670
