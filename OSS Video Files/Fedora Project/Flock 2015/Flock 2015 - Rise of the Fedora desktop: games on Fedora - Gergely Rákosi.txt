Description: 
	Games on Fedora Linux, its the best thing which help distribute Fedora. All of game companies are started developing linux binaries of their game engine. We have a working UT4 demo,Blizzard have 1k signed petition to turn their eyes to linux gaming, Steam evolving fast, and more and more games are available from their shop. The Linux desktop year its not too far....

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,700
okay so let's path again so next

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:18,139
presentation it's about gaming nothing

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:18,139
serious just fun at first time

00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:27,850
I want to

00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:37,050
oh yeah yeah

00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:42,310
so in briefly we go to these topics

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:44,470
first at all we look for a pest what

00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:49,510
happened in the past and the five the

00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:55,900
bat last five years and then we look

00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:58,720
around what's happening now in the

00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:02,410
gaming world under linux word and then

00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:08,830
let's see the future after that we look

00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:18,250
for how this all gaming topic started in

00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:22,320
my mind and how can i do that why i do

00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:28,380
that and what will happen in the future

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,380
we type the requirements does the most

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:38,770
hard part of the game let's see some

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,890
open opportunities and some details for

00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:51,420
example vine steam those blocks and any

00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:57,909
other games so yeah past the whole thing

00:01:51,420 --> 00:02:04,750
started five years ago I start to play

00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:13,020
games on linux and it wasn't as easy

00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:17,260
thing because there are no games which

00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:21,540
is running easily only knows i always

00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:23,370
need to hack something on on the system

00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:28,819
but

00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:35,730
of now as you can see there are many

00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:39,569
game engines which are growing the

00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:43,040
developers take a tension about Linux

00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:51,930
gaming so they release linux binaries

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:56,700
for their games the big game studios get

00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:59,700
this developers in one group and they

00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:05,250
give the give money to develop a new

00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:11,940
game we have steam of course is going

00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:20,310
and many of games you can find in it

00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:24,319
more than 3,000 and 400 games in steam

00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:28,560
and of course the illness GPU drivers

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:33,329
are mostly equal with the Microsoft

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:36,180
drivers that's a sorry that's two for

00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:39,359
the gossip for true for the nvidia

00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:43,139
drivers only I don't know the AMD

00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:47,419
drivers of course we have a bleeding and

00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:50,849
Chinook system so for example fedora

00:03:47,419 --> 00:03:54,269
yeah the future the future is not

00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:58,980
written yet so we decide what will

00:03:54,269 --> 00:04:04,250
happen if we want to play games on linux

00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:04,250
done let's go do it that's all

00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:13,260
how does it start that once I checked

00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:17,220
usually I checked the redhead page and

00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:20,730
they found the fedora core operating

00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:25,650
system I download it install it and I

00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:28,260
start using it and it was a fantasy it

00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:30,960
is a fantastic system it's working

00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:35,580
everything is bleeding edge on it so

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:39,780
it's no problem with it okay i decided i

00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:45,300
want to play some games I found the east

00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:50,580
games for example Mario or or punk or

00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:55,820
the easily instead of games but it's not

00:04:50,580 --> 00:05:02,340
enough so I look for how can I run

00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:08,820
windows games and I've found mine so I

00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:13,650
try to configure it and patch some code

00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:18,000
and I can run windows games a little and

00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:24,720
that was the first step for me to join

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:29,610
these linens gaming stops what's our

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:33,240
goals as we know linux desktop use

00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:37,410
nothing on the door in this year so it's

00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:40,860
not too far but we know we have more

00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:45,990
doors in the next year so there will be

00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:48,140
more knocking on the door so but we are

00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:48,140
waiting

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,840
the other important thing is a install

00:05:54,780 --> 00:06:05,010
operating system at least a fedora

00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:06,570
operating system most of the pcs I think

00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:09,389
this is a good thing catalyzed the

00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:14,490
working system and everything is working

00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:16,650
on it any programs and of course we have

00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:21,240
verse station server and cloud system

00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:26,639
with Frederick so you can try on server

00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:30,900
as I do as I DS and I do and of course

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:35,430
diverse station with different VMS and

00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:39,960
of course we have a very very early

00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:42,840
community so if you need help then just

00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:46,740
ask or write an email or keep in touch

00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:48,930
in IRC and you can get help and the most

00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:56,990
important thing is distributing in

00:06:48,930 --> 00:07:01,139
schools but this topic was yesterday

00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:07,710
yeah from Jionni's constant adidas okay

00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:10,229
i'm almost got okay okay so so this is

00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:14,160
the name or panting because the habits

00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:17,820
habits are important and the kids use

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:20,789
linux then they want to use linux after

00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:25,740
five years so this is the importance and

00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:29,010
of course game is important too and the

00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:39,570
last one last but not least is fun it

00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:41,699
was we love fun okay right is need yeah

00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:44,419
as I say the games are the part of the

00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:44,419
littles desktop

00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:54,750
with groups we can easily distribute

00:07:49,350 --> 00:08:01,250
fedora and if we distribute fedora then

00:07:54,750 --> 00:08:01,250
we get more contributors who maybe

00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:09,000
translate programming developing or

00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:16,350
again called distributing fedora so it's

00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:18,770
a circle learning other things as you

00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:29,070
can see we can do on fedora so I think

00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:33,330
the Fedora desktop year is here hey why

00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:37,650
choose fedora it was very expensive all

00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:42,420
of my money going to eat something but

00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:47,010
not for the operating system so i spent

00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:49,500
the money somewhere aguilas and of

00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:56,220
course there are many extra ordinary

00:08:49,500 --> 00:09:00,360
people who can good for many things and

00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:05,850
and of course our friends so it's

00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:10,450
important anyway who use federal hill

00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:15,890
everyone I think good okay

00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:21,350
he does because now sometimes they said

00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:22,640
Mac OS X or something like that so okay

00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:25,640
heather has a shiny toward the

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:29,029
distribution show so you can do it do

00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:32,540
everything on it and this look very very

00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:39,350
very good and of course you can install

00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:42,260
easily just few just a few clicks yeah

00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:46,760
as I know if you need a operating system

00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:49,339
with really SAT words can wine and

00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:54,680
drinking driver source if you want to

00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:58,130
patch it for the latest games and I

00:09:54,680 --> 00:10:01,279
suggest you download the GPU driver from

00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:06,830
the developers homepage you can install

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:08,930
it from with dnf but the maybe that is

00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:11,420
some modification in it and it's not

00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:15,440
working all of the games with that

00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:18,200
driver and you need you need to decide

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:22,610
you use the closed GPU driver or the

00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:25,670
open source which one is better I bet

00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:32,200
the close at one sorry that's working

00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:35,709
better once I know envidia give a

00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:38,990
developer to the open source group and

00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:42,770
now they work together so maybe the open

00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:49,880
source driver really better few years a

00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:54,800
few years later I the sensitive thing is

00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:57,980
the hardware environment the gaming it

00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:00,620
is an expensive game so if you want to

00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:05,029
play games the latest games when you

00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:06,740
need a good hardware you decide AMV ati

00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:10,700
or nvidia i prefer

00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:15,220
as I said and of course you need minimum

00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:15,220
intel five or inter seven processor

00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:24,040
their arms is depends on your packet

00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:31,220
much more than much more better so but

00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:36,740
it takes time so you decide you want to

00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:43,640
pay only lose or not okay we can install

00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:48,529
games with dnf easily we can play native

00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:53,300
games from the developers we can play

00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:56,410
games with emulated environments we can

00:11:53,300 --> 00:12:01,730
run run those games only knows with ryne

00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:06,560
we can buy things from Humble Bundle we

00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:10,930
can use steam linux for games we can use

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:14,450
the surah for linux for games and we

00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:18,950
rose Kickstarter from some of these

00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:21,980
games but it's not naturally good source

00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:25,279
for gaming and of course we have try

00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:29,690
engine and the engine unigene one and

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:32,450
two and unity 3d for dnews so we have a

00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:38,890
bunch of games and games engines on

00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:42,050
Linux let's see that this is the most

00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:45,790
native command dnf installed and the

00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:49,899
game name and you get the basic games

00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:49,899
not a big deal

00:12:50,920 --> 00:13:00,070
okay you can buy nothing games from the

00:12:54,670 --> 00:13:06,220
developers as you can see but better if

00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:08,980
you look for it instinct I'm going to

00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:14,740
get you can run those games for example

00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:18,010
lost begins or do or adding or lion king

00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:26,560
with those box this is things even two

00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:29,589
or you can play cabinet games do you

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:32,889
know what's that everyone knows somebody

00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:36,630
knows that yeah when you put the coin in

00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:41,500
the machine and you play with some games

00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:43,810
yeah this this game was my grandmother

00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:46,180
biggest enemy because I get my money

00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:52,149
please please keep my money and then put

00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:54,720
a machine gun on his gun yeah okay you

00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:59,800
can use Sony Playstation a minute or two

00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:05,860
easy to install with the NF the piracy

00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:09,329
is not really legal in Europe so you

00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:09,329
decide you use or not

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:19,079
okay you can play play in those games

00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:22,290
easily you can install I me dlf or from

00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:24,389
source and you can use that command vine

00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:28,879
and the program name and then you can

00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:34,230
play three a rank at games that's the

00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:36,899
point it's not on how to do it if you

00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:43,230
program at the end ebook divine message

00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:46,829
and you can join your buying group why

00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:51,439
never has a configuration tool it's

00:14:46,829 --> 00:14:56,850
called vine CFG there you can set

00:14:51,439 --> 00:15:00,709
application separated settings so you

00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:03,839
can select the windows version or the

00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:08,339
graphical option with a sound option for

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:12,839
the application and they have a registry

00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:16,259
settings so you can edit it but this is

00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:19,709
an important link here you can set the

00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:25,079
3d options separately for their program

00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:29,189
this is important okay if you are not

00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:31,889
really happy about this hacking then you

00:15:29,189 --> 00:15:36,360
can download play only knows it's a GUI

00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:42,930
interface it spread to find vine for

00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:45,300
success included in this gooey so you

00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:48,230
need to just install the game and around

00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,230
the game that's all

00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:58,380
hey handlebar low pay what you want and

00:15:54,730 --> 00:16:02,110
you get more than one game in a package

00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:06,520
ever it is there somebody you ever try

00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:09,570
this and this working it's okay yeah

00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:12,580
okay once i have a problem with that i

00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:14,890
sent the money and I gonna get the link

00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:18,970
so i need to contact with ambegaon do

00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:28,779
stuffs and so it's okay it's okay but

00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:32,230
it's not really good I think yeah yes of

00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:38,310
course I think there is no d i'm all

00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:38,310
games only looks in the arm free yeah

00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:46,300
austin seems the trm are you carrying a

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:49,390
gun without stain again from command

00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:55,209
line so you don't need to need any

00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:57,550
twisting we just need the node

00:16:55,209 --> 00:17:00,880
application directory and the

00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:08,260
application name and the game ID and you

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:11,860
can run it the closest thing okay i do

00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:16,199
master I I need to run metro last light

00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:16,199
without seeing this work

00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:31,060
I don't know because I play single

00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:36,390
player is maybe I don't know okay steam

00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:44,760
for Linux yeah as I said it's developing

00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:44,760
very hard many games in it and it's full

00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:54,310
full of extra options you need for

00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:56,980
example day it has a bad system and of

00:17:54,310 --> 00:18:01,650
course you can chat for your friend with

00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:04,810
your friends and you can buy new games

00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:08,440
the problem is you can easily send spam

00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:14,980
send your money because five or six

00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:18,960
click and you and you spend maybe 50

00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:18,960
euros for a game

00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:34,950
oh sorry thank you thank you yeah okay

00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:38,840
ha become a star steam you have see

00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:43,760
version for that for example if an insta

00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:46,200
yeah or dnf from sports repository or

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:50,250
you can download it from the steam

00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:53,730
homepage extract the deep file or come

00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:57,720
back into RPM and then put everything in

00:18:53,730 --> 00:19:01,500
a man of good place with directory and

00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:05,610
then run steam all you can install it

00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:11,370
from a PMC journal etc so it's a piece

00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:15,480
of cake yeah the other option we can you

00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:22,100
can install steam for windows with wine

00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:22,100
so you can run windows games on windows

00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:29,190
so this is the steps first you need to

00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:35,310
install line from source the new

00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:38,010
starting with vine with this option and

00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:39,710
you need to use know the right option

00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:43,250
because then you

00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:45,590
have characters in the steam window and

00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:48,770
then you can leave in those games of

00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:54,620
course you need 3d acceleration on your

00:19:48,770 --> 00:20:01,510
pc so this is a society okay we had Ezra

00:19:54,620 --> 00:20:05,270
Ezra is almost the same like Steam but

00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:09,580
this program is not really concentrate

00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:15,110
the big names mostly they're smaller

00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:18,169
developers and independent developers so

00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:22,669
it's it's good for small game smaller

00:20:18,169 --> 00:20:28,520
games and of course it's a development

00:20:22,669 --> 00:20:34,210
by bit chromium embedded framework okay

00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:39,039
the Kickstarter project all of the

00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:46,340
developer get money from the public and

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:49,940
if the developers can't make it in time

00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:57,110
or the goal then they not get the money

00:20:49,940 --> 00:21:01,659
so it's a little bit of strange thing

00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:10,700
but it's working okay we have added ng

00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:14,120
we will open fast last year was for dot

00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:19,450
one version and now we have four dot

00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:19,450
eight as you can see

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:30,930
yeah the last first-timer what I show

00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:34,890
you this was made with this engine so

00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:39,810
it's working so they just looking for

00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:44,730
companies who needs this engine we have

00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:48,990
try engine to sew and this message but

00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:54,450
you can find on the homepage they also

00:21:48,990 --> 00:22:01,080
looking for companies and developers for

00:21:54,450 --> 00:22:03,780
the engines so I think it's the gaming

00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:05,640
staff is working on the news and of

00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:11,070
course the eternity in an immunity in

00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:13,650
two ng some of the games are working

00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:17,430
with this entry for example a rash or

00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:22,910
the cable and Tristan de otras is made

00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:30,810
on windows only what I know but they not

00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:37,110
develop only games use it for simulation

00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:43,800
programs and of course veria have steam

00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:48,000
box many of the companies as you know

00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:52,920
the same box running Debbie em so what

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:55,400
if they running for the world you can

00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,400
imagine that

00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:10,010
because I brought an email to the one of

00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:13,340
the company and they said they need to

00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:16,760
test it so if we can make a good and

00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:23,180
working stable federal system they they

00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:26,660
can test it on their harbor it's secret

00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:30,860
no really I don't want to share it

00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:34,400
because it's it's too so I want to share

00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:40,370
it that information but if I have the

00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:43,820
final as garden is ok so i think it will

00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:50,260
be a good thing if federal running on

00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:50,260
some of the machines ok let's go

00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:56,400
conclusion games are needed to

00:23:53,830 --> 00:24:03,370
distribute Federer it's easier

00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:07,960
especially in schools gotta be the

00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:12,220
normal question X epsilon games run on

00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:14,850
Linux or not it's not gaming topic but

00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:19,000
it's important to sort of legal fees and

00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:22,990
microsoft office compatibility this is

00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:26,980
one of the problem to make linux a

00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:28,870
desktop system and of course sometimes

00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:32,700
we need to patch the boat and someone

00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:36,520
tried for the work because i'm not sure

00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:41,710
basic user can use for the water with 3d

00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:44,650
acceleration and of course we can do

00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:50,620
this fed water too so it's not

00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:54,820
impossible the last event we just

00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:59,380
connect the mixer pad on fedora and use

00:24:54,820 --> 00:25:02,640
mix and we can use music mixing that's

00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:02,640
all and it's workable

00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:15,799
a dilemma but I have you can help as I

00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:22,130
said I start this gaming topic five

00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:28,429
years ago the last flock in charge stone

00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:33,049
start these presentations and what I see

00:25:28,429 --> 00:25:35,710
the gaming stops on linux is working so

00:25:33,049 --> 00:25:39,620
as I said many of game and jeans

00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:42,470
developers big names are coming to linux

00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:46,220
oh I think we reach that point which is

00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:49,309
ok for us so I want to drop the gaming

00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:54,200
topic for the next vlog or next

00:25:49,309 --> 00:25:56,919
conferences and I have another one which

00:25:54,200 --> 00:26:00,040
called dominate the word with fedora

00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:03,559
it's some kind of distribution topic

00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:10,480
which is connected two games but natural

00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:10,480
games related so I want to make a vote

00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:20,030
may I drop the gamestop 'ok please put

00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:27,950
your hands up or not drop the game stop

00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:29,929
it okay yeah I took the gaming topic and

00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:32,210
the next then the dominate the world is

00:26:29,929 --> 00:26:35,470
federal will hit an ass okay drop again

00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:35,470

00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,780
school back

00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:55,580
and I we want to show you some of games

00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:57,960
and demos yeah okay so all questions

00:27:55,580 --> 00:28:01,410
then thanks your attention and don't

00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:03,800
forget to infinity and beyond because

00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:17,250
that's important so let's see the games

00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:24,720
okay let's see another demo it's called

00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:28,230
elemental it's unreal engine it's

00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:39,110
working with and thus working under an

00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:39,110
unreal engine so let's do it

00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:53,840
it takes sometimes by loading the

00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:56,300
textures of course the slope laptop have

00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:58,970
an optimist technology so is have a

00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:03,080
interview and it have an immediate

00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:07,960
review so it's decide which one is

00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:07,960
active but now of course it's that video

00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:13,030
it's a sketching

00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:21,240
oak tree on bumblebee and octagon

00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:36,970
yeah it's catching rd okay knightsen

00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:36,970
oh really

00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:50,500
the Austrian no I think so see smaller

00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:50,500
screen because it's not really fast

00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:55,520
maybe

00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:15,240
it's really so no but maybe I can

00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,240
disable the screen

00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:50,000
you

00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:14,140
baby

00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:43,350
off that's why slope

00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:11,529
sorry maybe a game who was that no key

00:32:12,309 --> 00:32:15,309
okay

00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:30,090
so the one of the newest games it's

00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:39,020
released on Steam it's called lord of

00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:46,200
the rings battle for Mordor it has a it

00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:56,030
have a testing feature so we can test

00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:59,300
the settings let's see yeah that's

00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:59,300
that's it

00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:14,350
hey

00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:23,920
maybe we can turn out deep lamps

00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:35,260
farrell company is the most active at

00:33:31,779 --> 00:33:40,600
now in Linux gaming this is the 4th

00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:43,110
games we imported for news so they work

00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,110
very hard

00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:49,210
days so

00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:01,800
benchmark for you

00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,730
sorry

00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:29,450
it will be 25 25 no the 25 frames per

00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,450
second

00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:36,099
is the actual

00:34:41,419 --> 00:34:44,679
I've been so nice I think

00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:04,900
it's similar to SSN screen

00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:17,040
so that's what a good benchmark and 76

00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:19,860
frame per second beverage so

00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:30,720
and this I think is beauty so it's very

00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:34,190
nice sorry the game with the game

00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:41,480
without mance yeah that's that was weird

00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:50,700
it's unplayable absolutely yeah I know

00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:52,470
so um I want to show this one so there

00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:57,570
are many games which are running low

00:35:52,470 --> 00:36:02,280
littles I think it's it have no lower
