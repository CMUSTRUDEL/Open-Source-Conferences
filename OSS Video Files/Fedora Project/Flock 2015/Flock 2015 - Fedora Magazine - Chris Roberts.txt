hi everyone their way to their come on

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,880
more

00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:24,829
alrighty so during presentation in the

00:00:22,609 --> 00:00:26,300
Fedora magazine I think most people in

00:00:24,829 --> 00:00:29,840
the community at this point how we heard

00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:33,890
of it if not to either a new contributor

00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:44,030
or living under a rock I'm waiting for

00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:46,399
my subscription sure it's a little about

00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:49,010
me just hook introduction so I've been

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,730
with the door since about mid 50s a team

00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:54,199
I started it with actually the docs team

00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:55,820
started doing some stuff there come to

00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:57,289
find out that I enjoyed a little bit

00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,690
more marketing and a little more

00:00:57,289 --> 00:01:03,320
technical so I kind of was trying to

00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:04,580
find my place and so after going through

00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,380
and talking to a few people the

00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:09,320
marketing team was the best choice so I

00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:12,590
went up and joined with them here's my

00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,969
contact info case anything ever blows up

00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:19,729
with the dora magazine or anything like

00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:21,469
that so what I kind of do is the Fedora

00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:23,840
magazine we kind of split up between two

00:01:21,469 --> 00:01:27,109
different groups so we have contributors

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,909
who write articles and I kind of do the

00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:32,030
more technical standpoint to make sure

00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:34,549
that it stays alive and running as you

00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:36,880
probably noticed everything Fedora now

00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:39,859
whether it be facebook twitter google+

00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:43,340
comes back to the site so this site

00:01:39,859 --> 00:01:44,689
cannot go down so it's been I pretty

00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,489
much do the back end so I kind of stayed

00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:48,890
behind the scenes I'll do an article

00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:50,689
every so often but mostly to stay behind

00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:54,789
the scenes and help out with other

00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:54,789
marketing related tool tasks as well

00:01:55,650 --> 00:02:00,930
so we're going to cover today is

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,850
actually what is the store magazine what

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:05,400
it looked like when we first started up

00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,020
to now how we do updates and

00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:10,170
enhancements so we can add more things

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,310
like translations so forth and then how

00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,460
can you contribute which is the big

00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,460
question

00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:20,480
so the Fedora magazine does every

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,730
remember the Fedora weekly news alright

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,480
this is what the Sonora magazine is now

00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:29,090
is officially the Fedora weekly news so

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,580
everything that come is official fedora

00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:33,470
comes to this site we have the blog or

00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:36,470
the planet which is more user-friendly

00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:39,920
or more personable for like a blog type

00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:44,900
item but this is anything official with

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:47,180
fedora and it's actually runs WordPress

00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:49,910
so most people here I think have played

00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:52,190
with WordPress at all so we've taken a

00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:55,000
basic WordPress site and made it awesome

00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:55,000
thank you to Ryan

00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:03,420
so some of the items that are on the

00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:05,160
Fedora magazine we have general

00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:07,200
announcements news so you guys have seen

00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:11,570
when we launched Fedora alpha or the

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,710
elephant a phase theta energy a

00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:18,870
development announcements so if we're

00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:20,040
going to launch say if the development

00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,750
team comes out there going to be test

00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,320
days anything like that they report on

00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:28,320
that as well event reports flock any

00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:31,440
type of event but cons Asia any feel

00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,790
will report back that's supposed to be

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,830
one of the things the ambassador's do is

00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:36,390
they submit an event report and then

00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:39,080
they can leave the right article or hand

00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:41,670
it off to somebody who will help do that

00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,530
and then we have matthew Miller who is a

00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:46,500
big contributor to the Fedora magazine

00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:48,390
he writes a five weeks in five things in

00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,810
fedora every week I think it's every

00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:53,190
monday and so it's basically a summary

00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:55,980
of what's happening for the world this

00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:57,970
week and so that's our main big post

00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,980
every week

00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:02,110
and then anything else that anybody who

00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:04,060
wants to really write about related to

00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:06,460
fedora in general that's not kind of

00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:09,780
like a personal story so that's what the

00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,780
flirt with the door plans for it

00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,700
so I know a lot of people in here are

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,560
technical and they want to hear the tech

00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,450
side of it too so I'm going to cover

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,970
both how to contribute and will lay out

00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:22,470
how it's actually laid out because most

00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,650
people have kind of heard that we're no

00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:27,840
longer on openshift so I want to just

00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:31,800
highlight how this how this site keeps

00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:34,200
up with all the traffic that we have so

00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:37,230
we have WordPress right now running on a

00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:43,020
normal lamp stack on route 6 so we're

00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:49,979
using apache PHP MySQL it's a virtual

00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:52,169
machine runs on a houston machine it

00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:53,729
runs on eight gigs so what this is good

00:04:52,169 --> 00:04:55,979
for is the site right now runs usually

00:04:53,729 --> 00:04:57,479
around four we use 84 when we launched

00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:59,460
when we launched a new version of fedora

00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:01,800
or when we see any type of traffic

00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,389
coming in so we can scale up and then as

00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,729
we see the traffic come down will scale

00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:07,979
down so right now we're running about I

00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:11,190
think six because the site is getting

00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:12,660
hammered because the flock so but that's

00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:16,310
nice because it allows us to scale up

00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,310
and down based on what we need

00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:22,830
and we use puppet and katella to manage

00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:25,740
the site so the site right now is pretty

00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:27,630
much automated so both of these projects

00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:32,130
are upstream so we try to keep up with

00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:34,050
the open source as well so puppet

00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:37,080
manages the configuration management of

00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:41,039
the site and then cotillo actually

00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,509
manages the patching management so we

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:45,539
have a staging site where you can play

00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:48,599
around with tests move plugins and so

00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:51,270
forth and so what we do is we when we do

00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:53,610
patching we patch the staging site first

00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:58,169
make sure that any of your kernels come

00:05:53,610 --> 00:06:00,389
in any new packages will survive that

00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:02,400
first and then if that survives will

00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:03,900
push it into the production box that

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,840
we're not like we're not just doing them

00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:09,330
update dash wide and blowing up the box

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:11,780
so to tell oh and puppet help out with

00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,780
that a lot

00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,930
so this is the site so when I first came

00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:22,090
into store marketing roofs was like

00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:23,590
we've got this magazine site and we

00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:26,110
really want to do something with it I

00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:28,599
was like all right so there's me and

00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:30,460
another guy I think it's a cure ious or

00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:34,330
Mitzi and IRC so we were like all right

00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:38,229
what can we do with this and so this is

00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:41,199
what it looked like now anything like it

00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:46,210
is today and so we were kind of like how

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:48,400
do we make this popular for fedora so

00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:52,599
with the consistent talk with Ryan and

00:06:48,400 --> 00:07:01,240
the design team we improved it a little

00:06:52,599 --> 00:07:04,090
bit and then we even made it more and

00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:08,139
now we have today where it is completely

00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:11,080
revamped and this is by far when we

00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:13,990
change the theme / matthew Miller

00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:16,419
tweeted about it and it is by far the

00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:19,020
best thing that we've ever heard back

00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:19,020
from on the thing

00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:25,410
even other distributions you on Twitter

00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:28,669
have you been comment on it oh my god

00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:33,949
Avanti even plays tile the theme looks

00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:37,490
so this is our driving site for anything

00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:37,490
nor related

00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:46,600
and so I actually when I was going

00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:47,860
through the slides this was from 2014 I

00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,900
was actually just going to delete these

00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:51,610
but I was like you know what it really

00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,950
be kind of cool to show in retrospect

00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:56,470
from last year how much traffic we've

00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:58,570
gotten since we've changed over and made

00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:04,030
our magazine official for any

00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:06,850
documentation so John June we hit 60

00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:09,910
thousand views which really in a place

00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:12,340
okay some of that robots getting it some

00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:17,830
of that's just but for us back then that

00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:21,490
was really huge so we're getting 2,000

00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:24,850
page views a day so now I want to put

00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:27,400
that in perspective with today so now

00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:29,980
this is anybody who has access to the

00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,390
site which is anybody who signs up you

00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:34,479
don't have to be an admin or anything

00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:38,050
can see this so right now I took this

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:43,390
picture today so so far today we've hit

00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:48,280
4,000 views our best ever was 31,000 and

00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:51,070
at one point we had yeah almost million

00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:54,580
seven hundred thousand and so far right

00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:57,340
now may we find over a hundred and

00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:59,800
twenty thousand views so our traffic as

00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:02,200
you can see his almost quadrupled since

00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:05,320
we've

00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:11,870
put in perspective source com averages

00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:14,070
about 560,000 so that's

00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:16,310
yeah and one of the things too and

00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:18,990
Robert mentioned this in his talk is we

00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:20,970
made it widget now is start that fedora

00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:22,950
died project of art which will pull in

00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:25,800
the articles from the car magazine so

00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:28,110
that has increased traffic traffic

00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,700
anywhere in general ever since we've

00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:33,240
changed the theme around and started

00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:34,950
putting things to fedora are putting

00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,800
everything out the door magazine is

00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:41,130
really help and so it really hurt us so

00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:44,460
about about a year and a half ago the

00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:46,560
site crashed around December and we

00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:48,500
started tweeting and posting things for

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:52,920
fedora magazine not as much as we do now

00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:55,350
but the site died people who are helping

00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:58,410
me with it we kind of just it just kind

00:09:55,350 --> 00:10:00,270
of died for a lot and so we really we

00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:02,220
brought back the door magazine back up I

00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:05,010
built it back up from the ground up on

00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:07,110
openshift and so but everybody was kind

00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:10,140
of afraid to post stuff because as

00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:11,520
anybody seen we would have people would

00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:15,780
go to it and then we'd have

00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:18,210
outages and so forth and so something

00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:20,340
just you know not to recently ago we

00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:21,810
tweeted about something and then we went

00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,580
to the site and the site wasn't there

00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:25,890
because it was a crash that worked an

00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:28,980
open shift so people on Facebook and

00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:30,660
Twitter like where is the post and then

00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,340
I think one time I had to message Erie

00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,780
and say hey can you take this down

00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:36,240
because the post doesn't exist anymore

00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:39,410
when I brought it back up it's not there

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,820
so a lot of issues but now that we're

00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:43,170
stable and we have a traffic coming to

00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,660
it and we're tweeting about it is

00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:47,190
official that we've really brought the

00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,960
store magazine back to life whereas

00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:55,170
before it was like a project that you

00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:57,600
kind of have okay but now it's but if

00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:59,070
traffic is amazing on it right now gross

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,470
move you're going to give your

00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:13,260
disposition the fact or me

00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:18,320
curious versus how much comes in

00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:18,320
by design

00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,699
outside

00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:35,249
right right so the next slide covers a

00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:36,779
lot of it is is we do have a reddit a

00:11:35,249 --> 00:11:39,299
lot of it's coming from right at it a

00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:40,619
lot is coming from start a fedora let me

00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:42,419
actually go to that page it's kind of

00:11:40,619 --> 00:11:47,309
right here but i can let me I took the

00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:48,929
next one I'm actually now it's right we

00:11:47,309 --> 00:11:50,339
can actually see where the traffic's

00:11:48,929 --> 00:11:51,389
coming from I can get to the side a

00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:53,339
little bit later but it will actually

00:11:51,389 --> 00:11:54,989
show us like this one start out fedora

00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:58,439
here's all of our search engines or

00:11:54,989 --> 00:12:00,689
reddit a Twitter I can't read what those

00:11:58,439 --> 00:12:02,849
two are a facebook google+ so the

00:12:00,689 --> 00:12:06,149
majority of its first social media site

00:12:02,849 --> 00:12:09,119
that gets the most twitter i meddle in

00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:11,160
facebook and then google plus I've got

00:12:09,119 --> 00:12:17,990
all the times

00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:20,320
the biggest starting page yep it's like

00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:23,590
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:26,160
it's and then Google of the second is

00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:26,160
google plus

00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:33,370
facebook with

00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:36,760
got another

00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:38,589
correct they will do the search terms

00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,450
too so like down here a little bit more

00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:42,370
so actually show us which pages are

00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:44,740
actually clicking akzo sometimes even if

00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:46,270
they go to the start or they just go to

00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,710
the main page to actually have to click

00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:49,600
on something so that's what this site

00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:52,300
this plugin will do is actually tell us

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,070
which sites so example no key today i

00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:56,380
published an article for him yesterday

00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:58,630
and he asked me where's my paycheck how

00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:01,570
many views do i have and i actually sold

00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:04,089
him yours actually had over a thousand

00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:05,980
views are ready so we can see which

00:13:04,089 --> 00:13:08,250
actually where they're clicking the

00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:11,820
first terms of their using and so forth

00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,820
and one thing is

00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,120
right

00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,160
Oh

00:13:34,499 --> 00:13:37,249
that was

00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,800
multi

00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:46,010
who's

00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:49,150
but no I

00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:49,150
is as bad as it was

00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,550
I

00:13:53,490 --> 00:14:08,600
it it really would make some

00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:10,700
yeah we still remain a growth of the

00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:14,090
design sure whatever helps in social

00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:17,840
media is d by violence we have because

00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:22,180
you for example post about the article

00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:22,180
about fios then you've got a nice

00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:28,750
one of the things too is that is

00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:31,029
definitely the desire I really think if

00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:33,010
you look at when we went to this and we

00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:36,279
were on not to renege on go to that one

00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:37,540
we were on this one and I started trying

00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:38,950
to tell people about fedora magazine

00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:40,779
nobody really could take it seriously

00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:43,300
because they just like no it's just a

00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:44,650
wordpress blog so why what's what's

00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:48,400
really going to be different about that

00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:50,710
compared to the planet fedora planet so

00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,750
then when we went to this one it looked

00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:54,670
a lot better but people were still kind

00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:58,300
of not really taken seriously and I

00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:59,680
think as soon is like that right there I

00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:02,740
mean as soon as we made the switch to

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:05,110
this I everybody who didn't take fodor

00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:08,529
magazine seriously it just a change our

00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:11,080
perspective on it I mean definitely I I

00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:12,640
think we've got better country it's a

00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:15,070
combination of multiple thing we've got

00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:19,089
a better design we've got better content

00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:20,830
let's go into it and we also have I also

00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:23,350
notice when going through the site

00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:25,390
there's every so often where the door

00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:28,350
will make an announcement and it doesn't

00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:31,210
get an article on fedora magazine and

00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:32,830
something slightly like ZDNet or

00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:34,990
somebody will share something older

00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:38,050
article on for our magazine and we'll

00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:39,790
get a ton of traffic from that so that's

00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:42,430
what we see a lot of as well so some of

00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:45,420
the older magazines or older articles

00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:46,950
will get shared for some reason

00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:49,920
and they will just generate a whole

00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:51,900
bunch of traffic as well but one of the

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,450
things definitely is it's the design

00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:56,160
that's definitely changed ever since we

00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:57,900
change the design the start doeth door

00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,850
if he's had nothing about the increased

00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:03,300
traffic which is good and quality

00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:05,670
articles I can say from when we were on

00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:09,030
gilder design some of the articles were

00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:11,190
not quality so they're more content

00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:12,900
based how can we get more stuff onto the

00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:16,680
site and we've kind of change that

00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:18,710
approach now to more quality articles so

00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:22,760
it's starting to get because I remember

00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:26,450
my first are doing so

00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:28,790
we need more stuff well we posted our

00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:37,880
army taught me that's exactly right

00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:40,520
right yeah meeting notes and all kinds

00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:42,890
of stuff yeah or people would just

00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:44,090
upload a video and just not comment

00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:45,560
about it or anything to stop load a

00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:48,080
video and that we go up there so yeah

00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:51,290
definitely more quality content up there

00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:52,790
now one thing you know Paul you found

00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:55,220
the plug-in for search engine

00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:57,050
optimization so one thing a post has to

00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,520
go through now is when you write a post

00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:00,800
we need to make sure that always the

00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:02,360
featured image is very good we don't

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,510
want something like before we used to

00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:08,570
have just a fedora logo now we have the

00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:12,350
tailor to every little that one does but

00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:17,000
that's my fault I had to get that one

00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:19,430
out let's say but most of them as you

00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,810
can see are definitely the matthew

00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:23,089
Miller has got his signature one but

00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:25,190
every article that's different has a

00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:26,480
very good featured image so right off

00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:28,790
the bat we are looking at that and

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:32,120
saying okay we've got something that

00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:34,100
very beautiful so that and also right

00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,420
now too is you can actually comment so

00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,920
you can actually see that these have

00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,390
comments on them so they're almost the

00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,100
posts are almost interactive at this

00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:42,080
point now whereas before you'd have to

00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:44,540
click on the post see if anybody

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,010
commented it wouldn't send an update to

00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:48,670
you if you did get an update so a lot of

00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:48,670
people would comment

00:17:49,049 --> 00:17:54,049
you give me vivid metrics

00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,130
or more

00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:08,190
in fact

00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:13,200
I think it does actually track it yeah I

00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:16,290
can pull up hold up just to see it yeah

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,730
yeah definitely but he had overall

00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:19,620
definitely much better and I think

00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:21,180
definitely happy note mostly it is a lot

00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:23,070
of design that's also how we've taken

00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:26,760
the approach to articles not just

00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:28,830
posting I hate to work with garbage up

00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:33,350
to the site to get people to look at it

00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:33,350
so now we maintain an image with

00:18:35,779 --> 00:18:41,239
so yeah we're averaging about 3,700 page

00:18:37,969 --> 00:18:43,700
views a day this today I actually when I

00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:45,229
took that picture we're 3700 and when I

00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:49,219
was in the last talked we're up to over

00:18:45,229 --> 00:18:53,119
almost about 4,400 just today so we're

00:18:49,219 --> 00:18:55,369
definitely so this is I think the

00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:58,099
article everybody was looking at our way

00:18:55,369 --> 00:19:00,859
everybody can see it look we've got the

00:18:58,099 --> 00:19:03,619
search engine terms the clicks of where

00:19:00,859 --> 00:19:05,419
they're actually clicking it and then

00:19:03,619 --> 00:19:07,399
we've got the top posts and pages and

00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:09,080
then if you actually expand these out

00:19:07,399 --> 00:19:11,690
you can actually see what the search

00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:13,839
where they're actually coming from and

00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:15,889
so forth so it does get pretty detailed

00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:23,509
especially for a free plug-in which is

00:19:15,889 --> 00:19:24,919
really nice so the future of it so

00:19:23,509 --> 00:19:28,489
definitely I think we're already kind of

00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:29,779
there with quality content but I kind of

00:19:28,489 --> 00:19:32,389
want to see what for most of you guys

00:19:29,779 --> 00:19:34,729
what you think would kind of even help

00:19:32,389 --> 00:19:37,029
it more I mean we definitely we hit the

00:19:34,729 --> 00:19:38,960
nail on the head with the theme change

00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:41,269
and we definitely are getting more

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,509
quality content but one thing I am

00:19:41,269 --> 00:19:45,950
seeing to though is we're not getting

00:19:43,509 --> 00:19:48,979
it's from the same people so it'd be

00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:52,039
nice to I want to see more computers

00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:54,139
come to the site so one thing that I've

00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:56,269
done is a lot of people and this is

00:19:54,139 --> 00:19:59,299
great brought up is there's a roadblock

00:19:56,269 --> 00:20:01,610
for every every group to join

00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:03,259
so at first we wanted to now cover this

00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:05,929
later but I wanted to stay ahead of time

00:20:03,259 --> 00:20:08,749
is you get to join a mailing list hop on

00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:10,940
IRC what I right about then I have to

00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:13,100
get an account on the magazine I've made

00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:14,899
it now so anybody can sign up and write

00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:17,059
an article it will give you it will give

00:20:14,899 --> 00:20:18,619
you admin access it will give you the

00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:21,259
permissions to write an article and you

00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:22,820
can't publish it so what I've done is

00:20:21,259 --> 00:20:25,159
I've tried to make it as easy as

00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:27,499
possible by taking up any roadblocks and

00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:28,429
you just log in with your FAFSA count so

00:20:27,499 --> 00:20:31,879
you don't even need to make a username

00:20:28,429 --> 00:20:34,210
or password so we've eliminated any

00:20:31,879 --> 00:20:38,859
roadblocks I can possibly think of to

00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:40,850
not getting an article in the magazine

00:20:38,859 --> 00:20:42,889
but I wanted to kind of see what you

00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:46,809
guys thought of what would make it

00:20:42,889 --> 00:20:46,809
better to get more contributors

00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:52,539
like

00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,970
ok

00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:17,309
def I guess okay I idea when you okay

00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:17,309
we have always

00:21:20,409 --> 00:21:25,620
vote

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:29,610
we had always a burglary that was shown

00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:32,280
their pre-war is presenting on

00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:36,270
it was always second due process was

00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:38,990
never can we have to be clear or

00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:43,900
something like that and

00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:43,900
law and put next

00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:48,730
and what will happen here

00:21:51,049 --> 00:21:57,820
really that could be like a five minute

00:21:53,940 --> 00:22:02,400
job geez updated

00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:02,400
their third in fact that the sticker so

00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,350
may not be

00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:15,220
that's something we can actually ask

00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,220
them

00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:23,029
you know what well as I think we get

00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:26,360
something the other day that's for you

00:22:23,029 --> 00:22:32,059
just all the sigh parts of looking very

00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:32,059
question magazine

00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:50,900
well the reason where I'm going to

00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:53,390
badges where I'm going to that is would

00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:57,200
it do you think we would get more

00:22:53,390 --> 00:23:00,320
contributions with someone

00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:03,509
two sugars

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:06,049
that was sort of exclusives actually

00:23:03,509 --> 00:23:06,049
operate

00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:15,099
we have to pay people or anything it's a

00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:16,640
pipeline in right by Walker its lair is

00:23:15,099 --> 00:23:19,360
a decent article

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,360
perfect

00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:33,649
by the way Wayne I feel very conflicted

00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:36,979
about encouraging yeah so if i didn't

00:23:33,649 --> 00:23:40,779
get not a suggestion for and this is not

00:23:36,979 --> 00:23:43,249
as a message to ripon but they underlie

00:23:40,779 --> 00:23:45,200
think that we need to get right here oh

00:23:43,249 --> 00:23:49,820
you're the seminary I'm sorry senator go

00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:52,820
ahead dig through a web page within the

00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:55,729
walls that statistic that she is always

00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:59,479
positive manner or disney in the world

00:23:55,729 --> 00:24:01,999
where you really did put out statistic

00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:04,429
he wants from the design team more

00:24:01,999 --> 00:24:06,999
polished papers but i think he has a

00:24:04,429 --> 00:24:06,999
fallen

00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:17,330
then this into the magazine and his

00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:20,050
patience nor to given more more

00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:20,050
statistic

00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:28,590
istic always

00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:28,590
I love you SEO optimized

00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:32,940
do you have everything

00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:39,520
if something is interested in that I

00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:39,520
think it's

00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:04,230
see

00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:13,590
so sorry I need

00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:17,760
smart first to acknowledge that I think

00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:20,500
there's a couple different how whether

00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,050
the magazine is very long

00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:26,110
loser

00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:29,450
user user foot the stories

00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:41,780
separate is something there's a there's

00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:44,240
a session I think that what we have seen

00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:49,370
what we can factor a show is that the

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:52,370
user the user for the stories that or on

00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:54,200
certain number of users from the injury

00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:56,909
of resource even though they all again

00:25:54,200 --> 00:26:00,080
the same

00:25:56,909 --> 00:26:00,080
get me all the same

00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:03,820
twitter

00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:13,100
you

00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:19,030
that would say you also acknowledge that

00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:22,960
there are not a lot of places where

00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:26,320
people can get filtered content whereas

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:29,700
close of the raw of a planet you know

00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:33,070
they can get my children stories manager

00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:35,290
so anyway having said that I don't even

00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:38,530
like to get us walk down that especially

00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:40,540
I have a have in a year or lose

00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:43,510
something that that we ought to we

00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:47,050
should think about seriously which is in

00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:51,570
order to engage contributors employee

00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:51,570
stories for the magazine being involved

00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,010
that's what

00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,640
schedule

00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:05,710
true

00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:05,710
process so that people's voices

00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:12,450
some

00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:18,160
that's a to distance learning and they

00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:20,370
might hear we might have someone saying

00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,370
well I

00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:30,269
because it's just like celery right in

00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,090
order to do that we also have to have a

00:27:30,269 --> 00:27:33,900
tap

00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:36,990
so yeah

00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:41,120
I put on threat like I'm less reasonable

00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:43,860
was let's set up of managing a portable

00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:46,260
so that we can have escaped under the

00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:49,380
tools exist on its site they the tools

00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:51,300
exist so we can schedule and actually no

00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:54,050
we're going to publish this on Tuesday

00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:56,380
this Wednesday this curves they have a

00:27:54,050 --> 00:28:00,530
rotating relief

00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:07,059
track crucifix or so if somebody they

00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:07,059
have only one sorry we just like

00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:15,279
so

00:28:12,909 --> 00:28:17,169
a lot of that my granny help I think it

00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:19,590
would I think if nothing else ever

00:28:17,169 --> 00:28:19,590
created

00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:24,350
yes oh yes

00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:39,830
I'm guilty of that mess I have some

00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,830
hostages so I've been writing for

00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:43,100
so

00:28:49,789 --> 00:28:55,969
as nice

00:28:51,389 --> 00:28:55,969
places where the articles that

00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:14,460
once

00:29:11,539 --> 00:29:17,440
often the North Pacific content doesn't

00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:19,950
translate well to the plot some places

00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:23,330
so if there was a

00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:26,030
set up syndication channels

00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:31,060
you will have our shots but also need to

00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:31,060
take already edited already been

00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:35,830
moreover

00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,600
love

00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:48,400
that's the other one

00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:52,110
this is good

00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,110
they just have like spreadsheets

00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,170
sometimes if you were

00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:06,549
rather than me

00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:09,830
i think it's i just discovered JC me

00:30:06,549 --> 00:30:13,790
last week or so

00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:13,790
Aeschylus in there are

00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:23,870
you're stuffing

00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:28,260
no they were else was as usual

00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:30,650
yeah tacitus is actually

00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,650
these

00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,360
they change the capacitor

00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:44,970
we aspartamay takes to the community

00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:59,320
I mean there's some consternation this

00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:59,320
is my heart

00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:06,750
otherwise you

00:31:12,379 --> 00:31:16,159
okay well

00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,700
but

00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:32,880
experienced a year ago an article for

00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:42,240
stop does anything really know how to

00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:46,920
forward push an Anderson I didn't have

00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:49,980
time breyer was branded so we I know

00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:53,120
that that was a year yeah made a lot of

00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:57,000
change but anything that to have a

00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:59,220
central yeah we already searched and how

00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,070
to yeah I mean we can easily add the

00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:03,930
links back to loggin just because I

00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:05,910
haven't really seen any emails like the

00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:15,660
marketing Dino thread or mailing list is

00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:20,570
kind of so how to sign up on the wall

00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:20,570
there or the pages this is

00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:27,680
and it's definitely not pages after

00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:29,779
Ryan's actually put together a page a

00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:31,760
page for power

00:32:29,779 --> 00:32:34,370
and there's

00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:40,000
there's another page which is what you

00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:43,790
just kind of wonder why University yes

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,760
and that's for a perception standpoint I

00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:47,870
just I only seen like maybe one to one

00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,250
or two emails across the mailing list

00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:51,350
saying I have trouble walking and we

00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:53,240
used to before we incorporated Pfaff's

00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:55,190
you would have your own username and

00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,870
password and that brought up a lot of

00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:58,880
risk with the security team they didn't

00:32:56,870 --> 00:33:01,250
like that being housed on the set of the

00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,410
server we also had a lot of people like

00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:05,390
I signed up by sign on with my fast do I

00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:07,610
sign up with this then we had to reset

00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:09,620
passwords so we would just went over to

00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:11,990
letting fast handle it and that ever

00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:13,550
since then it's all that's tapered off

00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:16,610
so yeah I mean we can definitely add

00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:17,810
those back so I just didn't think from a

00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:20,510
perception standpoint from not seeing

00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:25,340
any emails that everything was was good

00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:28,610
with it so that brings us into our next

00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:30,230
thing so how do we update and make an

00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:32,420
announcement so you guys have seen all

00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:34,250
the theme changes the search engine

00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:36,350
plugin that both found we have some

00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:38,450
translate plugins so how do we used to

00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:41,570
test it and this is also brings into why

00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:43,880
it went down so much before so we used

00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:46,010
to test it just if we would install a

00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:48,020
plugin and this plugin could be from

00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:49,550
somebody that's tested it one that

00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:52,880
matter needs and they'll be really it

00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:54,380
wasn't ever updated put it in hey guys

00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,730
can you try this in an email to the

00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:59,350
mailing list so it works alright cool

00:33:55,730 --> 00:34:02,090
off it goes not the best way to do it I

00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:04,010
think anybody in here any technical

00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:05,120
person here know that you never should

00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:10,310
push anything

00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:13,669
without testing it first so so that's

00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:16,010
the old boy I tested it and okay it

00:34:13,669 --> 00:34:18,590
works good to go and then I get an email

00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:20,629
from j zv or root for somebody the

00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:23,450
site's down huh okay here you'll figure

00:34:20,629 --> 00:34:24,740
out what I did wrong there come to find

00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:26,659
out that author never updated the

00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:29,020
plug-in and like a year but it worked at

00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:29,020
that time

00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:36,240
so the new way so we have a staging

00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:38,220
instance that mirrors the fedora

00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,660
magazine it may not be up right now

00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:42,030
because I was having some I was having

00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:45,390
direct change from vns stuff on it but

00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:47,429
it Mears this adore magazine anybody can

00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:49,679
log in and goes for your fast feel free

00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:52,169
to blow up the site you can test plugins

00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:54,360
there you can test themes you can test

00:34:52,169 --> 00:34:58,530
anything you want and the goal of this

00:34:54,360 --> 00:35:00,240
is because as again we're a community so

00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:01,620
I can't figure out all the things that

00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:04,440
we need like Paul found the awesome

00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:07,080
search plugin I know I forget the name

00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:09,750
of the person but he found a really good

00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:13,140
translate plug-in so a lot of the

00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:15,270
plugins are found by people and we

00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:17,580
welcome ideas we want to make the site

00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:19,800
better we want plugins that are really

00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:22,740
good that are not going to bog down the

00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:24,710
site but we also don't want a thousand

00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:26,970
plugins floated into the site as well so

00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:28,530
but one thing that we want is as a

00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:31,350
community we want to make our site

00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:33,600
better and rather than having to go

00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:35,790
through all this red tape we've set up a

00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:38,250
staging site where you guys can test

00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:44,130
things it's snapshot so if it blows up

00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:45,870
it's no big deal the specs are pretty

00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:48,840
much similar and so what we've done is

00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:50,940
if it lasts a plug-in last for two weeks

00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:53,730
without really causing any issues we'll

00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:55,290
go ahead and push it so

00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:57,420
if there's something that you guys need

00:35:55,290 --> 00:36:00,810
immediately you can always email us Paul

00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:03,990
me JCB any of the admins on the site and

00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:05,940
we can put it into but this is the way

00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:07,800
that we wanted to do things and make it

00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:09,420
more community so it's not like

00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:14,690
everybody doesn't think it's locked down

00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:14,690
or anything so get a question

00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:21,589
so how can I contribute so this is the

00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:24,109
big thing so the number one thing is is

00:36:21,589 --> 00:36:26,810
I don't know what to write about how do

00:36:24,109 --> 00:36:29,990
I join what do i do how do I actually

00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:31,970
get an account and so forth so again

00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:33,800
we've we've all heard about this all

00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:35,480
flock we have a mailing list the

00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:37,520
marketing mailing list is the main

00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:39,829
mailing list for anything we used to

00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,930
have a magazine one but we figured that

00:36:39,829 --> 00:36:43,760
they'd be better and seen by more people

00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:45,680
if it was on the marketing mailing list

00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,869
and that way we can also too if somebody

00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,579
says hey I need help there's more chance

00:36:47,869 --> 00:36:51,200
to get a response and also spawn off

00:36:49,579 --> 00:36:53,089
different ideas like oh this person what

00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,859
about this now I have an idea to write

00:36:53,089 --> 00:36:56,780
something about this and that could be

00:36:54,859 --> 00:37:02,089
put into marketing as well so we've

00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:03,500
condensed into one so again if you don't

00:37:02,089 --> 00:37:07,400
have an account of fast account you do

00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:09,530
need one to see you can contribute but

00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,150
it's you know just to actually say hi on

00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:13,579
the mailing list and so forth or even

00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:17,810
toss about an idea not needed to send an

00:37:13,579 --> 00:37:19,160
email to the mailing list and the third

00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:21,200
thing I actually took off I should have

00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:23,060
taken off but this was our number one

00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:26,359
blocker how do I sign up for an account

00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:28,819
I signed up for an account it needs to

00:37:26,359 --> 00:37:31,010
be approved by somebody I'm only a

00:37:28,819 --> 00:37:33,260
subscriber and you bump me up it's like

00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:36,619
a right article and again thank you for

00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:38,150
wordpress for their limit changing how

00:37:36,619 --> 00:37:40,490
they do their security settings but we

00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:44,390
now anybody who signs up can write an

00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:46,250
article it can't be published so we

00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:47,930
prevent that blocks people from spammers

00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:49,790
signing up and writing bad things that

00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:54,490
would show up on the site but anybody

00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:54,490
can sign up and write an article so

00:37:55,830 --> 00:38:01,040
and again with people mentioning things

00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:03,330
so the mercury if you write an article

00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,530
feel free to send it out and the mailing

00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:06,720
list and say hey can somebody look at

00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:08,370
this can somebody do it I know it hasn't

00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:12,210
been sometimes lady lately the best

00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:14,910
response but it's really we have three

00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:17,280
rolls of users we have authors or we

00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:19,410
have for subscribers anybody who wants

00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,410
to make an account and just look on the

00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:25,140
site for read stuff or comments we have

00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:27,060
authors which is the default account for

00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:28,740
anybody who wants to write we have

00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:31,560
editors and those are the people that

00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:34,050
should be going through and looking at

00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:36,780
articles proof reading them and helping

00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:38,840
mentor that person to kind of publish

00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:41,580
them or work in critiquing the article

00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:43,230
it really shouldn't be go change it it

00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:45,000
should be work with that person to kind

00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:48,900
of learn how to write an article better

00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,670
and then in that person will then move

00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,320
up then as well so they look like a

00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:54,930
ranking system and then the final one is

00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,550
admin which is just the same as ever but

00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:59,400
you can install plug-ins and change

00:38:56,550 --> 00:39:01,020
plate settings so probably the two are

00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:06,230
really now there's only needs to be a

00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:06,230
few atoms on it so huh

00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:15,230
we should be able to stop plugins yeah

00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:16,849
nice i go mmm i said the default level

00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:20,300
for admin so everybody's an admin on the

00:39:16,849 --> 00:39:22,220
stage one side just because like i said

00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:25,070
if it blows up I just revert the

00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:27,230
snapshot and its back to normal so the

00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:29,720
only thing that's not different about it

00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:31,430
is it doesn't always is I have to do a

00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:33,349
manual sync for it to pull in all the

00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:36,200
update so if you go to staging it may be

00:39:33,349 --> 00:39:38,000
like a few weeks behind what you see but

00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:41,690
it's still functional to test updates

00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,940
and so forth but everybody who's an

00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:45,500
editor that's one of the things on the

00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:48,320
wiki is that you should go through

00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:50,869
review comments because there's a bot

00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,940
that will span the comments to make sure

00:39:50,869 --> 00:39:54,200
they're not spam but we all know

00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:57,560
computers can't do everything correctly

00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:59,240
so if you do get through and a few our

00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:02,270
normal people who do need their comments

00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:03,650
actually approved so the authors you're

00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:06,130
the editors job should be reviewing

00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:10,130
articles for spell check translations

00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:11,599
and also reviewing comments because it

00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:13,760
is crucial if we don't approve comments

00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:16,670
and somebody is legitimately asking a

00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,380
question that looks bad too because now

00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:20,950
i groped my comment but my comments

00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,950
never shown up

00:40:22,779 --> 00:40:26,259
so the other thing actually forgot your

00:40:24,579 --> 00:40:28,859
questions is one thing I've seen with

00:40:26,259 --> 00:40:31,390
post is if you write an article and

00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:34,059
somebody comments on your thread for

00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:36,819
your post do not please do not just

00:40:34,059 --> 00:40:38,829
abandon it because a lot of times those

00:40:36,819 --> 00:40:40,509
questions are people actually asking for

00:40:38,829 --> 00:40:42,099
things yeah they'll be like okay it's a

00:40:40,509 --> 00:40:45,429
good article but a lot of people are

00:40:42,099 --> 00:40:48,009
asking questions and if you just abandon

00:40:45,429 --> 00:40:50,169
the article that really looks bad on us

00:40:48,009 --> 00:40:52,119
because somebody's coming to you and

00:40:50,169 --> 00:40:53,739
asking for help or a question on your

00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:56,769
article and you're just basically

00:40:53,739 --> 00:40:58,630
ignoring them so it's always good to

00:40:56,769 --> 00:41:00,400
double-check your article especially if

00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:02,229
it's a really popular one just to go

00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:14,309
back maybe every once once a week or so

00:41:02,229 --> 00:41:14,309
and just check it will still do play

00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:46,240
yep yeah it is also yeah he catches it

00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:47,920
so what's the other thing too is if

00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,160
somebody really has a grudge or

00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,450
something and they come in yeah so I

00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:54,520
easier just to kind of what the bots

00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:56,290
catch it and go through and read there's

00:41:54,520 --> 00:42:02,590
heavy kids sound like they're mean

00:41:56,290 --> 00:42:07,500
people never fall never here was I think

00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:07,500
because I we are much painting

00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:14,980
so that goes back to the technical side

00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:17,500
this is a site is has a firewall role

00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:19,869
for sim packing and dropping so if with

00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:22,570
using what is it patches load balancer

00:42:19,869 --> 00:42:25,030
test program we've hammered it multiple

00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:26,530
times and it's never dropped a bit never

00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:28,089
drop the connection so the firewall

00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:34,540
rules are set up to block any type of

00:42:28,089 --> 00:42:36,339
DDoS attacks so I now I say that and

00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:38,800
somebody probably do it in here but it's

00:42:36,339 --> 00:42:40,570
not guaranteed but it has survived the

00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:46,560
patches load balancer test so which

00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:46,560
should simulate a DDoS attack music

00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:05,250
so I I brought that actually to go back

00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:07,680
look at the old one I brought it up when

00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:10,500
Ryan was designing the theme and I

00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:12,900
mentioned to him about we we took these

00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:15,349
away and I actually personally like

00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:19,170
these ideas because we can kind of see

00:43:15,349 --> 00:43:22,020
the man of the wow that was impressive

00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:26,609
yeah I wasn't having a good house it

00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:28,230
hitting it but now say I when we were

00:43:26,609 --> 00:43:31,890
designing the theme that's the one thing

00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:34,410
that from this right here is I I really

00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:36,119
do being able to miss like being able to

00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:38,190
filter I mean definitely we don't really

00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:39,780
need like door news kind of repetitious

00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:43,190
there but it would be nice to have a way

00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:45,900
a search box or a way to find something

00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:47,579
like especially like this one events was

00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:50,460
really nice because any events we would

00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:56,359
do we cook right there you can see fun

00:43:50,460 --> 00:44:01,099
cons flock videos everything and so I

00:43:56,359 --> 00:44:01,099
right so

00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:11,220
and when you click on it it would be old

00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:11,220
news ok so the amount of people like

00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:22,520
and that's why related content Arkansas

00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:32,060
my questions for war years and then run

00:44:29,089 --> 00:44:35,089
to the stories yeah that's yeah and I've

00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:38,900
also just the awesome buckets were for

00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:44,230
walk with you were gender what started

00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:44,230
my fat boy is my question so let's say

00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:53,980
switches

00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:53,980
both sides

00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:07,599
I don't know

00:45:03,559 --> 00:45:07,599
I just meant scrolling back

00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:15,690
Edmondson

00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:22,490
I

00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:27,390
and then I turn on these ones these

00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:29,490
little sidebars and that really destroys

00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:34,440
the theme so we can't even use like the

00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:37,619
widgets I think with the theme so we had

00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:38,970
so so these widgets right here you can

00:45:37,619 --> 00:45:40,440
add these and kind of have like a

00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:42,000
calendar-like on some wordpress site

00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:44,040
social the days and then how many post

00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:48,119
but if we add that to the current theme

00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:51,030
it really it actually yeah yeah look it

00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:59,550
looked like this one yeah yeah I'm also

00:45:51,030 --> 00:46:01,290
like to be honest nothing I saw this for

00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:04,579
me it's like I say this kinds of

00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:04,579
fighting people who did

00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:15,780
many quote from come I remember this

00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:20,490
story that's why right they care about

00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:24,950
all access to the dashboard no you drive

00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:24,950
a different I knew them right outside

00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:30,080
once

00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:43,900
you one article

00:46:41,509 --> 00:46:48,430
it's not just you looking for

00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:50,760
also for a title but you do it in an

00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:50,760
archive

00:46:55,890 --> 00:47:02,710
another awkward zombies also in every

00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:07,799
article every other side starters there

00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:07,799
I will grant you that most people

00:47:11,589 --> 00:47:21,369
presentation it's a what was going

00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:28,180
shoes

00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:28,180
female

00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:39,950
well they're just keep you better like

00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:44,800
for me it's like whether we put it a

00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:44,800
muffin value is to majorities

00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:48,710
No

00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:07,500
what we're looking at i just wanted to

00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:09,900
show so remember that picture i took of

00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:13,110
3,000 just to show you guys how much in

00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:17,790
that a happens we're already up to 5800

00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:19,440
oh yeah yeah so one thing I tell people

00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:22,860
to is I encourage people to write for

00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:25,350
the magazine because you a lot of times

00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:30,750
somebody will want to get it's a good

00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:32,250
way to get seen as you can see so I mean

00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:33,840
a lot of I know sometimes one of the

00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:35,370
blockers people are kind of afraid

00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:38,700
because of how much traffic the site

00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:40,410
gets like oh I don't want to get on this

00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:42,510
thing of having a repeat article I just

00:48:40,410 --> 00:48:43,830
want to do a one time thing that's fine

00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:46,770
but like i said it's definitely a good

00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:49,340
way to kind of like get in a series of

00:48:46,770 --> 00:48:53,490
something i used to do the badges and

00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:55,380
it's it's it's a good way just to just

00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:57,840
to contribute to its a very easy method

00:48:55,380 --> 00:49:00,490
of contribution it's a very very

00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:02,550
streamlined in

00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:02,550
you

00:49:05,299 --> 00:49:09,920
no go all the way

00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:20,770
so I add so verra fine so some water

00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:32,100
site like this in the front page we get

00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:32,100
we do spot although I also

00:49:35,309 --> 00:49:47,289
also just in a fit of like I don't know

00:49:42,869 --> 00:49:50,220
20 year or high roller except the

00:49:47,289 --> 00:49:50,220
burning central patch

00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:55,430
nice

00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:06,640
swamis so what is this we're doing

00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:08,380
instead of talking we're doing what

00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:13,510
everybody every everybody will love it

00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:15,990
but the great thing is yet we can we put

00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,990
in there see

00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:22,799
I think we like eight minutes the idea

00:50:22,890 --> 00:50:30,089
all right well said

00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:42,980
yeah we've got another instance just

00:50:40,289 --> 00:50:42,980
like the WordPress

00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:55,730
such as

00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:55,730
white

00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:04,560
also section

00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:21,119
you there you are notified when you are

00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:25,259
just wondered yes we're watching another

00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:27,859
hero good yet we needed children some

00:51:25,259 --> 00:51:31,170
executed tickets I can't grieve it but

00:51:27,859 --> 00:51:34,309
to go to that I'll agree with that but

00:51:31,170 --> 00:51:34,309
I'm saying

00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,839
yes quite so

00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:48,530
some

00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:54,290
like are we questioned if this is dead

00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:56,620
loss let me no longer acting as long as

00:51:54,290 --> 00:52:00,440
we don't shut down Apache we're getting

00:51:56,620 --> 00:52:06,620
my army the way we were discussing about

00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:09,140
that was the match basically and see

00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:12,410
almost this summary of what's going on

00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:18,230
this is what's happening right what I'm

00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:22,210
saying is another see the problem is

00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:22,210
like my car example is the

00:52:22,799 --> 00:52:30,269
election interview course there was 15

00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:32,479
of them and each part was an engineer

00:52:30,269 --> 00:52:32,479
with

00:52:34,789 --> 00:52:39,289
and that was going forward yeah I know

00:52:37,729 --> 00:52:45,509
that we've done it in the past as well

00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:49,649
but then there's even like very people

00:52:45,509 --> 00:52:52,219
magazine com human part when I was in

00:52:49,649 --> 00:52:52,219
the duct tape

00:52:55,650 --> 00:53:04,479
and okay so there's a quote maybe

00:53:00,059 --> 00:53:06,819
million uber you can have data let's

00:53:04,479 --> 00:53:10,869
look at the great if all we have is

00:53:06,819 --> 00:53:13,359
opinions what's going no the vertices

00:53:10,869 --> 00:53:15,869
the day says most people don't come the

00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:15,869
magazine

00:53:18,770 --> 00:53:24,230
they're not going in and browsing enjoy

00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:24,230
there's too much

00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:40,290
through social you know so there's

00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:43,560
nothing to argue that everything else in

00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:48,840
this entire presentation has argued that

00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:53,030
you barely have resources one so still

00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:53,030
need two publications is

00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:17,609
not have resources very oh hey moe I

00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:19,050
want you to write about festival you

00:54:17,609 --> 00:54:23,240
right

00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:23,240
happy with no

00:54:25,029 --> 00:54:28,109
so nobody's sitting like

00:54:32,829 --> 00:54:42,849
we don't turn the weight those those

00:54:38,359 --> 00:54:48,040
verizon I'm just feel like with the

00:54:42,849 --> 00:54:48,040
other house assistance without having

00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:52,670
things were kind let us

00:54:54,230 --> 00:55:00,200
we can make sure that there is a steady

00:54:57,750 --> 00:55:00,200
stream

00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:20,810
approval

00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:23,020
yeah I wondering with how do you know

00:55:20,810 --> 00:55:23,020
that

00:55:23,279 --> 00:55:29,410
about 20 interviews that we do you know

00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:32,890
why we don't want to discourage you you

00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:43,890
need to have a more manageable for me

00:55:32,890 --> 00:55:43,890
once a week it's like we had articles

00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:53,089
if the

00:55:49,609 --> 00:55:55,730
devil I still feel very much that I want

00:55:53,089 --> 00:55:57,040
to be I be able to use your Fergus the

00:55:55,730 --> 00:56:00,780
user focus

00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:00,780
you know the Lord Jesus

00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:17,470
sometimes if

00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:20,970
ok

00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:26,060
maybe bigger

00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:30,300
chemistry so do

00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:34,410
having a working

00:56:41,630 --> 00:56:44,630
whatever

00:56:50,930 --> 00:56:58,079
equals 3 that's what I've already is

00:56:55,170 --> 00:57:00,119
that he wanted content I'm not right you

00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:02,640
just sort of let anything in that

00:57:00,119 --> 00:57:06,630
skillet over the good cook but I would

00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:09,329
rather have one or one every two weeks

00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:15,120
that's a really good music hypothetical

00:57:09,329 --> 00:57:17,130
it like then is that what I love her

00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:21,530
this Christmas stack another domain

00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:21,530
policy and with reference instance a

00:57:24,299 --> 00:57:30,220
multi called a theme their multi while

00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:31,930
they say it Corey pro sites because

00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:33,790
that's what in my head that's a sitting

00:57:31,930 --> 00:57:38,460
like even if I don't care about the back

00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:40,440
in but like they could close together

00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:42,780
it's helping the hemisphere we're going

00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:45,720
to go through the same furious with the

00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:49,349
same first world but at the end you say

00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:50,840
published to the developers site and for

00:57:49,349 --> 00:57:53,630
public

00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:56,590
education site for the vision say

00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:59,120
anything Jose concerned about the mystic

00:57:56,590 --> 00:58:01,010
segment it out too much then you're

00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:05,050
going to have to have all the things

00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:05,050
around me knocking

00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:11,810

00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:19,539
and

00:58:17,329 --> 00:58:19,539

good we're an advocate please keep one

00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:40,740
thing in mind what Chris say this is now

00:58:38,010 --> 00:58:45,289
federal medicine has a stage if it is

00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:49,550
not in medicine it that is efficient and

00:58:45,289 --> 00:58:55,820
please stop thinking in riddles numbers

00:58:49,550 --> 00:58:59,210
if I condition article which was went by

00:58:55,820 --> 00:59:04,030
michael moore other and he posted two

00:58:59,210 --> 00:59:04,030
hornies it's one

00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:11,810
right window and giving a story added we

00:59:08,690 --> 00:59:14,260
have definitely also a real situation as

00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:20,950
we have published white how people

00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:22,840
how it's it's not so easy to say that

00:59:20,950 --> 00:59:26,320
some

00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:30,220
that's what I learned from my personal

00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:34,710
God I did not kiss I never fought a duet

00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:34,710
not much traffic on that trouble

00:59:36,829 --> 00:59:39,969
I am

00:59:42,390 --> 00:59:52,590
it was stupid initiate very Michael

brother so he picked up my

00:59:52,720 --> 01:00:00,850
we have ordered of certainly potassium

00:59:55,430 --> 01:00:00,850
is exclusive to say

01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:06,130
so but you know at the same time I'm not

01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:09,730
trying to write I'm not trying to write

01:00:06,130 --> 01:00:13,200
the fence here fine but I'm really but

01:00:09,730 --> 01:00:15,910
from this chakra faculty magazine has

01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:17,600
really focused on something that beaver

01:00:15,910 --> 01:00:20,289
project

01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:30,190
that is in your

01:00:20,289 --> 01:00:30,190
audience this that's all

01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:40,340
you know we

01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:44,100
how much

01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:49,190
does not deceive you should stop

01:00:47,330 --> 01:00:50,900
then we should stop

01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:53,740
but we should stop pursuing

01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:53,740
but it's not

01:00:54,360 --> 01:01:03,410
magazine is up so so absolutely

01:01:05,799 --> 01:01:12,410
send word to the lowest one sister it

01:01:10,390 --> 01:01:18,570
makes it up from the

01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:22,580
personal opinion pizza in the dorm

01:01:18,570 --> 01:01:28,520
as a visual opinion of the device pixels

01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:28,520
so should order to keep your eye on that

01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:35,880
so I

01:01:32,090 --> 01:01:40,019
here's what is

01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:42,319
across all our projects every place

01:01:40,019 --> 01:01:42,319
where we

01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:45,980
really depend

01:01:47,279 --> 01:01:49,909
polish

01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:56,020
there is a difference it's quiet

01:01:57,799 --> 01:02:02,060
those

01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:04,100
it's we have this like we don't want to

01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:07,420
do values car

01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:07,420
this contribution is not

01:02:08,069 --> 01:02:15,170
but there is a real curation it needs to

01:02:11,609 --> 01:02:15,170
be a highest in

01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:23,690
really trust inside

01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:32,859
I think that having the pleasure we can

01:02:29,870 --> 01:02:34,839
throw as much sausage making

01:02:32,859 --> 01:02:37,970
it works that we need that channel and

01:02:34,839 --> 01:02:40,099
the period from natural

01:02:37,970 --> 01:02:43,090
rather than using the magazine as the

01:02:40,099 --> 01:02:43,090
curation cute

01:02:56,620 --> 01:03:01,790
because some of the ideas of having for

01:02:59,470 --> 01:03:04,790
the country

01:03:01,790 --> 01:03:04,790
Wow

01:03:07,089 --> 01:03:13,980
scanning through developments in the

01:03:10,210 --> 01:03:17,760
post here some interesting

01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:22,020
much like to me is more of a normal old

01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:24,720
style and actual service it's the new

01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:27,930
source for the community so then and we

01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:30,320
never had that all over the planet is is

01:03:27,930 --> 01:03:30,320
sort of

01:03:39,290 --> 01:03:45,310
stop the people of the door repair nor

01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:45,310
stuff

01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:51,740
sooo I don't express

01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:02,070
I

01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:13,730
or

01:04:11,450 --> 01:04:16,220
you're a designer let's music scary

01:04:13,730 --> 01:04:19,270
let's just say we're designer which I

01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:19,270
you are

01:04:21,510 --> 01:04:28,810
sir

01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:34,820
I can't draw but it's not good yeah and

01:04:28,810 --> 01:04:37,540
so I will not presume to say like this

01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:37,540
is bad design

01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:45,750
this whole experience

01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:54,870
my 15 years plus

01:05:04,710 --> 01:05:12,360
for sure for sure

01:05:06,970 --> 01:05:12,360
have a lot of really strong awesometown

01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:18,200
Marketing has to cover every base at

01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:18,200
those times

01:05:20,490 --> 01:05:27,260
you really do need

01:05:23,570 --> 01:05:27,260
somebody who sits between

01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:30,800
and

01:05:33,509 --> 01:05:37,759
of knowing

01:05:35,069 --> 01:05:37,759
listen

01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:46,340
like real real hangup like a lot of

01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:48,050
times that I see where the locker rooms

01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:50,870
and the design team is desperately

01:05:48,050 --> 01:05:53,650
trying to keep the backlog down because

01:05:50,870 --> 01:05:53,650
there's very

01:05:54,250 --> 01:06:00,490
all of the everything from t-shirts team

01:05:56,860 --> 01:06:06,180
looks like we're in the same position

01:06:00,490 --> 01:06:06,180
with stories for stories

01:06:07,650 --> 01:06:14,329
asking where

01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:16,099
we're creating huge queue tasks but that

01:06:14,329 --> 01:06:18,740
just means more work it's like a excited

01:06:16,099 --> 01:06:20,980
appears all the stories that also be

01:06:18,740 --> 01:06:20,980
stuck here

01:06:22,869 --> 01:06:27,950
really you just need to ask there are

01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:30,440
people are interested in doing this kind

01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:32,480
of stuff and there are a lot of you know

01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:35,480
obviously done is just like most of the

01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:37,760
trying to stuff that we're meta

01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:41,320
standpoint relatively new so bear with

01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:41,320
me off base

01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:46,880
can't take anything else

01:06:47,030 --> 01:06:53,500
we need to have people who aren't

01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:53,500
peripheral

01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:59,580
me

01:06:59,810 --> 01:07:07,200
that's I think your help

01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:09,570
you're talking when the blocker isn't we

01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:12,800
have it's a great problem we have too

01:07:09,570 --> 01:07:12,800
many stories between entities

01:07:14,470 --> 01:07:19,600
we need to do

01:07:16,270 --> 01:07:23,530
I don't think anybody is saying you know

01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:28,240
this is we don't want to make her sign

01:07:23,530 --> 01:07:31,720
know how to butcher this is your house

01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:33,849
we're talking about God

01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:36,049
we just need to add people who can take

01:07:33,849 --> 01:07:39,679
direction

01:07:36,049 --> 01:07:40,770
neither side is like to two straps you

01:07:39,679 --> 01:07:43,660
cruise

01:07:40,770 --> 01:07:49,200
to polish it for two

01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:49,200
just got a lot of the stuff

01:07:49,339 --> 01:07:54,990
holy sir

01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:54,990
a lot easier

01:07:59,150 --> 01:08:05,650
so I'm doing my best here to get this

01:08:03,270 --> 01:08:08,279
constant

01:08:05,650 --> 01:08:08,279
let me talk

01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:14,020
toyota has this metal

01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:19,359
water slippers and their folks

01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:21,190
in a assembly line or any of the

01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:24,469
production process that folks whose job

01:08:21,190 --> 01:08:26,859
is it between the processes to be able

01:08:24,469 --> 01:08:31,299
we're

01:08:26,859 --> 01:08:37,380
this station is resources that's like a

01:08:31,299 --> 01:08:37,380
horrible simplification but it is that

01:08:38,049 --> 01:08:41,159
like Jeremy cats

01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:51,690
fly over the dome recent years I thought

01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:51,690
right

01:08:51,950 --> 01:08:55,060
in 14 right now

01:08:56,450 --> 01:08:59,230
pcs promise

01:09:00,630 --> 01:09:05,359
we don't have ninjas that are working on

01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:06,969
things that are necessarily

01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:09,589
and we're still figuring that out

01:09:06,969 --> 01:09:11,200
because everybody has to be community

01:09:09,589 --> 01:09:14,310
building

01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:16,460
community as everybody's weather

01:09:14,310 --> 01:09:19,009
so

01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:21,920
I've taken a list of stuff and job

01:09:19,009 --> 01:09:23,970
descriptions stuff in your sex Sasha to

01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:26,670
the council

01:09:23,970 --> 01:09:29,820
eight different categories of linksys

01:09:26,670 --> 01:09:32,790
operations ninjas would be interested in

01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:35,310
a people self identifies those and then

01:09:32,790 --> 01:09:37,740
just say here's your relief pitcher or

01:09:35,310 --> 01:09:40,650
each of the teams so the design team

01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:43,470
needs to go to a person you are going to

01:09:40,650 --> 01:09:45,030
be almost like an intern almost like it

01:09:43,470 --> 01:09:47,400
just someone who's there provide

01:09:45,030 --> 01:09:49,290
actually asked you what your main side

01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:52,080
you might identify me in a little

01:09:49,290 --> 01:09:55,280
gentler side you self-identify that's

01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:55,280
definitely interested and

01:09:55,770 --> 01:10:02,370
join sig Xers much mother

01:09:59,090 --> 01:10:06,440
who are about onboarding contributors

01:10:02,370 --> 01:10:06,440
but it's mostly on the ground

01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:14,219
logs and the ups which is a little bit

01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:14,219
so the island

01:10:16,989 --> 01:10:23,110
so for me at least I think that you Cass

01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:25,559
initiators I think you've got some tool

01:10:23,110 --> 01:10:25,559
boxes

01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:39,900
yet he

01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:39,900
voters

01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:46,340
many

01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:53,020
so

01:10:49,090 --> 01:10:55,230
may take some time so I guess that won't

01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:55,230
happen

01:10:55,590 --> 01:11:02,390
or how how that souls

01:10:59,510 --> 01:11:04,679
each and every system

01:11:02,390 --> 01:11:06,570
see

01:11:04,679 --> 01:11:09,599
I'm so trying to get things I'm trying

01:11:06,570 --> 01:11:13,939
to understand how how that flies to

01:11:09,599 --> 01:11:17,989
here like your ideal when we open doors

01:11:13,939 --> 01:11:23,150
Jonas you're feeling side your wireless

01:11:17,989 --> 01:11:23,150
the magazine's focus

01:11:24,940 --> 01:11:27,930
we come father

01:11:28,970 --> 01:11:32,800
on their combinations

01:11:36,079 --> 01:11:42,239
conversation at home yeah that's how is

01:11:39,630 --> 01:11:45,000
a distant from from actual conferencing

01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:46,590
man praying about to say we've got

01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:50,269
people with all other than I just right

01:11:46,590 --> 01:11:50,269
how do we walk out of here

01:11:54,059 --> 01:11:57,439
I'm not saying

01:12:13,749 --> 01:12:20,909
I don't mean any disrespect

01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:24,330
oh I here's a very strong

01:12:27,350 --> 01:12:37,949
I can only see or so hi I feel like that

01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:41,699
deter your content is give of other nope

01:12:37,949 --> 01:12:45,890
what happens five pockets something that

01:12:41,699 --> 01:12:49,590
you also something that is during

01:12:45,890 --> 01:12:52,700
like riding with money throughout

01:12:49,590 --> 01:12:52,700
specific pages

01:12:56,990 --> 01:12:59,890
I want to

01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:05,590
ya heard

01:13:07,890 --> 01:13:14,470
Adam da just post from that so far my

01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:18,070
magazine you're all i think how do we

01:13:14,470 --> 01:13:22,330
say this expertise and you know what i'm

01:13:18,070 --> 01:13:24,239
saying is like the top first occasion

01:13:22,330 --> 01:13:26,599
this is how you can build

01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:26,599
and

01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:38,950
this is where we're going

01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:54,340
like like okay if you are including

01:13:51,190 --> 01:14:01,179
armed adult would like to dwell in the

01:13:54,340 --> 01:14:04,019
car on to it if you're doing something

01:14:01,179 --> 01:14:08,519
really really like corner cases

01:14:04,019 --> 01:14:12,239
interesting I'm not arguing with that

01:14:08,519 --> 01:14:12,239
should necessarily go

01:14:14,370 --> 01:14:18,850
you

01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:21,790
they don't have a time sort of thing I

01:14:18,850 --> 01:14:25,030
want stuff that's still worst but I

01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:28,030
guess what does Connie body but yes but

01:14:25,030 --> 01:14:30,880
you said like eight the guy he's like my

01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:34,150

01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:36,250
be of interest to users as well well I

01:14:34,150 --> 01:14:38,080
never get so well so that's a

01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:41,130
certificate still searching financially

01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:44,860
there's a specific stuff what about this

01:14:41,130 --> 01:14:49,000
boy printing companies would you ain't

01:14:44,860 --> 01:14:51,360

01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:53,380
you AR

01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:56,469
very

01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:58,090
it's people like to hear about the next

01:14:56,469 --> 01:15:01,000
thing but you excited about your next

01:14:58,090 --> 01:15:06,550
name but they got nominated detailed

01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:09,830
really but I don't know if we might for

01:15:06,550 --> 01:15:12,330
instance is a we got this may walk

01:15:09,830 --> 01:15:13,770
not necessarily invite everyone to the

01:15:12,330 --> 01:15:17,420
blog

01:15:13,770 --> 01:15:19,850
when they would see you can just do

01:15:17,420 --> 01:15:22,969
I think here's kind of that's what you

01:15:19,850 --> 01:15:25,960
do you tell me here's how many pieces

01:15:22,969 --> 01:15:25,960
together here's how we

01:15:26,199 --> 01:15:31,639
very hidden room for pitch it should be

01:15:29,420 --> 01:15:35,449
reviewed the continues chanting about

01:15:31,639 --> 01:15:41,330
the different unit yeah see that's what

01:15:35,449 --> 01:15:43,790
I'm almost at all these pictures

01:15:41,330 --> 01:15:48,410
new pepsi but if you can spin it serve

01:15:43,790 --> 01:15:51,329
it's like telling the user how how this

01:15:48,410 --> 01:15:53,639
and not going into too much me down

01:15:51,329 --> 01:15:57,829
that kind of stuff he was just care

01:15:53,639 --> 01:15:57,829
about that as well it's not sharing

01:16:11,230 --> 01:16:17,040
through

01:16:13,510 --> 01:16:17,040
they have been really

01:16:18,970 --> 01:16:22,240
as you

01:16:31,219 --> 01:16:35,570
the reason

01:16:35,750 --> 01:16:40,040
like bunches of stats

01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:57,390
even noticing bonus stuff on the hubs

01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:57,390
but that's not something

01:16:58,140 --> 01:17:02,200
does

01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:05,240
Muse's yet like it will like but that's

01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:12,220
the kind of like oh yeah

01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:14,080
if I told e to it yeah it doesn't story

01:17:12,220 --> 01:17:18,420
it's but it's likely an interesting

01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:18,420
story for me about any life

01:17:21,719 --> 01:17:25,950
in the specifics is time

01:17:29,449 --> 01:17:34,219
that atomic are you Oh awesome

01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:40,409
that are talking about mechanisms

01:17:36,730 --> 01:17:43,099
processes inside the project

01:17:40,409 --> 01:17:43,099
contacts for

01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:47,770
unless maybe the context

01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:55,000
here's what I do what the fluorescent

01:17:51,230 --> 01:17:59,720
example and in order to show somebody

01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:03,550
what invaluable and that's that possible

01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:03,550
again this thing it's in before

01:18:03,829 --> 01:18:10,669
right that's how a person being miss

01:18:06,929 --> 01:18:10,669
hazel do not talk

01:18:11,610 --> 01:18:20,890
here's how so I read something about

01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:23,040
like oh here's where you download here's

01:18:20,890 --> 01:18:23,040
what

01:18:23,179 --> 01:18:32,739
the word sentences server goes by way

01:18:29,269 --> 01:18:32,739
what it appears

01:18:33,650 --> 01:18:37,090
and that's my

01:18:37,740 --> 01:18:42,080
pose the reason why villains

01:18:48,510 --> 01:18:53,800
useful

01:18:50,659 --> 01:18:53,800
takes a lot of work

01:18:54,040 --> 01:19:00,990
and the community but was that someone

01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,990
wants to

01:19:01,890 --> 01:19:08,280
it's less heroes of QA yeah that there's

01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:10,650
not allowed out reasonable yes so far I

01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:14,210
think it's like sure that's going to be

01:19:10,650 --> 01:19:14,210
curation or making sure

01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:20,100
it's not what you can say are you

01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:25,110
right that's the

01:19:27,070 --> 01:19:30,880
someone goes like this

01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:42,440
so unreasonable

01:19:37,980 --> 01:19:42,440
guys like as I try to explain that

01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:49,380
we have a something that's that warning

01:19:47,570 --> 01:19:50,969
system

01:19:49,380 --> 01:19:53,550
and

01:19:50,969 --> 01:19:58,020
like the assumption

01:19:53,550 --> 01:19:58,020
if you know

01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:20,789
I think you're saying

01:20:17,739 --> 01:20:20,789
and then

01:20:22,530 --> 01:20:30,869
but and fascinating orgasm while

01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:30,869
attending that we separated

01:20:31,170 --> 01:20:36,290
just learning that's like it's the

01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:36,290
necessary I've already working

01:20:43,019 --> 01:20:46,640
I got against items like that I don't

01:20:45,119 --> 01:20:49,180
sign that

01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:51,670
it was being silly

01:20:49,180 --> 01:20:57,360
many of us still occasionally pick up a

01:20:51,670 --> 01:20:57,360
newspaper and I feel you know

01:21:06,110 --> 01:21:10,360
in all the jargon Angela section

01:21:15,870 --> 01:21:23,980
right where I think it helped I think

01:21:21,430 --> 01:21:28,050
that they relish so you're like all over

01:21:23,980 --> 01:21:28,050
that is not i'm not asking

01:21:29,390 --> 01:21:34,650
however you may be

01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:38,570
or at all

01:21:34,650 --> 01:21:39,970
you know I guess it might lead to this

01:21:38,570 --> 01:21:42,730
for sure

01:21:39,970 --> 01:21:45,630
that works

01:21:42,730 --> 01:21:45,630
I'm not sure

01:21:51,430 --> 01:21:57,700
so what we did at 32 degrees of any

01:21:54,250 --> 01:22:02,670
horse track when English rap well my
