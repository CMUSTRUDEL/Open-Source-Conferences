Title: Flock 2015 - Remote desktop & Fedora - Mike DePaulo
Publication date: 2015-08-26
Playlist: Flock 2015
Description: 
	Fedora can now be a remote desktop server via 3 different solutions: X2Go, VNC and SPICE. This talk will cover: 1. Their different features. 2. Running them in containers & cloud instances ("cloudtop"). 3. Why remote desktop is the only way for the Linux desktop to gain adoption in many companies. 4. How these solutions integrate with the X.org codebase and other parts of the Linux OS (Polkit, logind, etc) 5. Wayland

alright so I'm like de pollo my day job

00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,179
is I'm a system administrator on my free

00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,559
time consuming text to go in English

00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:13,549
related and upstream open source

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:16,590
projects like like live SSH and

00:00:13,549 --> 00:00:18,240
pulseaudio etc I'm usually don't work

00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,160
out better how to better integrate X ago

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,350
tiger B and C and held remote desktop

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,010
substance into the you know for desktop

00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,890
experience but before I begin I talked

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,840
about this press case is not about it

00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:31,949
BBI which as you know virtual desktop

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,840
infrastructure I mean the assumption of

00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:35,880
EDI is you know you have to have a

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,829
hypervisor and you have all the special

00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,149
codes make the desktops possible well it

00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,829
offers features that are really nice

00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:43,140
thing to like you know here's this

00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:44,820
desktop image that easy to get those it

00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,710
gets if we vent you from you know

00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,840
remoting into you on you know desktop or

00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,160
laptop in the office or from you know

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,070
we're going to a physical server in your

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,719
lab said oh I orange cloud instances we

00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,789
don't have we can't do nested

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,289
virtualization if people have questions

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:00,140
about these I can talk about them but

00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:02,670
they're not part of this presentation

00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:05,700
what is the position is about is you

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,170
know remote desktop so I mean most

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,909
people think I said we move desktop

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,310
think Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol

00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:14,040
specifically and their clients is called

00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:16,950
RDC remote desktop connection whereas as

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,810
people act on PR talk to you leave the

00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,220
best for you know who the best generic

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,320
term as we move desktop some people

00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,180
called like terminal server but that can

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,680
be put other things too it's also really

00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,860
like antiquated term to get to explain

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,960
you know to less single people so that's

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,299
why I think the best term for multiple

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,369
growth protocol the solution is remote

00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:38,260
desktop and that generally includes

00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:41,110
remote applications to

00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:42,670
and three solutions that I mean the two

00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:44,050
solutions i consider you know stable and

00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,780
ready to be used right now in fedora or

00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:49,930
Tiger Beat you see next to go note that

00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:52,000
Tiger there's numerous BMC servers and

00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:55,660
clients and rotations out there but

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,240
Tiger VNC is the best you know and works

00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:01,240
well rounded up VNC server and client

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,820
for linux and the clients for mac OS x

00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,980
and windows are pretty good also so that

00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:07,000
Tiger VNC is actually included well but

00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:10,200
you know Fedora has a newer version

00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,230
available for features and ekta calm and

00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:16,870
x2 goes in on isn't the EPL and Fedora

00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:20,560
spice amounts for CPL by notion fedora

00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:23,350
and again I hope so x11 itself you know

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,450
it's x 11 x that work is a display

00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:28,990
server this place survived handles you

00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:31,690
know keyboard you know inputs keyboard

00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:34,300
mouse much newer devices on graphics

00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:36,160
display and some other stuff like

00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,830
clipboard sharing and like window

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,120
manager properties I mean there's really

00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:42,400
good presentations by the way they

00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,290
develop great about limitations of 11

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,870
but it does it does not flex lemon salt

00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:48,820
it's not concerned things like audio or

00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:50,230
what applications gets tore up

00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,280
automatically when i login to test on

00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:53,290
environment those are all separate

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:58,709
standards that are related to excellent

00:02:53,290 --> 00:03:01,209
but not quite veksler themself so um

00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:03,459
I'll put these quick start guides

00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:05,530
available somewhere like on the wiki but

00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:08,590
it's really simple to get to the next to

00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:10,360
go server started on it's just install

00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:12,250
those two packages installed compatible

00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,750
desktop environment I'll explain

00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,860
clucking what pro this much later and

00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,860
they need evil those two services

00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:23,730
and Tiger VNC it's one server cracka to

00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:26,730
install you can basically use any detest

00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:28,050
of environment although the logic for

00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,370
launching which desktop justin is

00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:31,920
currently in that script right there on

00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:33,720
the fedora systems and while you can

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,900
often get rid of the simpler you know

00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,830
command line command i recommend this is

00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,290
the one that I've always been using

00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:42,690
successfully it starts a VNC server on

00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:44,520
the next available ports and you can

00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:46,470
connect to it with the only using a

00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,990
pasture because it's using Pam for

00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:50,490
dedication and probably you will need to

00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:53,130
open up the firewall ports so if it says

00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:56,010
if it says I'm running on display colon

00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:58,080
2 that's x11 poor coins you in being see

00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:02,940
porn series or the five nanotubes for

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:05,310
being CEO computer firewall so that's

00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:07,920
the joint I will talk about the depth of

00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:10,280
other than features of the road test top

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,400
solution so

00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:17,810
so dimensioned tiger bean chn gallatin

00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:19,010
fedora and xtogo is you know it's it's

00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:20,630
relatively new to photo we're talking

00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:22,760
about two years including through about

00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:28,100
a year and a half ago by Orion who's an

00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:30,070
excellent packager and so the main

00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,600
difference between spice is also

00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:35,120
available to I mean the main purpose of

00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,830
spice is that it's a portal call that's

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,380
the cake you know kvm hypervisor

00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:42,169
implements as a better alternative enc

00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:44,240
it has long more features but there is

00:04:42,169 --> 00:04:46,160
that you can't run a spice for like

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,470
remote desktop is at spice which is

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,620
basically you know x.org configure to

00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:54,590
use spices like a driver um however if

00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:56,660
the this period is really like poor

00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:59,120
integration like right now there's a bug

00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:00,950
where you have to like tell to use user

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,570
live exact like actual javelins that

00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:04,640
usually looks like X work or something I

00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:06,890
intend to fix this bug soon but for now

00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:09,650
that like I'm only recommend people try

00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:11,060
Tiger me and see you next to go on so

00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:12,380
you can see right here to the bank we

00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:15,200
have some integrity insects to go as you

00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:16,340
know Tiger VNC does support the badly

00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,710
needed feature i mentioned earlier the

00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:20,150
smoothest resume sessions so that you

00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:21,440
know if you're if you lose your

00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,900
connection to your desktop serve your

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,060
apps don't just like stopped running

00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,560
right there um you don't reveal you can

00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:30,110
be connecting using your state's with

00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,700
unreliable Wi-Fi like this the ability

00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:36,470
resume assassin is especially important

00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:39,950
arm people talking to the hyatt hotel

00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:41,510
kissed is unreliable Wi-Fi arm so mean

00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:43,310
target being self it's basically you

00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:45,050
know it's a little bit more than just an

00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:46,310
alert display server they there has been

00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:49,400
significant you know development in

00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:50,419
terms of improving performance plus in

00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,000
terms of you know better Jacob

00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:54,380
compression and adapting the algorithm

00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,750
jpeg compression to the type of data

00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:58,010
that's on the screen but it does not

00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,479
support the other features that he was

00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,590
associated with the Linux desktop like

00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:03,080
audio

00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:07,640
does not support the file transfers from

00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:09,200
client to server or printer sharing the

00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,910
rep you know there are other Tiger VNC

00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,170
clients I'm sure there are other VNC

00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,940
clients out there that you can use with

00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:15,680
it and those are available from mobile

00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,330
operating systems but there's no

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,780
official type of VNC client for mobile

00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:23,630
operating systems on and I think that

00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:25,760
that's actually going there is like it

00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:27,590
doesn't have those desktop features that

00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,350
you would expect from some of the

00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:31,340
Microsoft Remote Desktop for example in

00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:33,500
I'll talk a little bit more about when

00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:35,120
performance later but the really nice

00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,590
thing that actually going spice how that

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,100
type of each he lacks in order to cash

00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:42,340
like image data so say you view a photo

00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:45,170
or you open up your Start menu once and

00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:46,550
then you close it and reopen it with

00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:49,130
Tyga beans it has to be seen the data

00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:50,720
all over again where the heck's going to

00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:53,900
spice the type of in memory or on disk

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,450
and it can just show it and with the

00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:58,400
extremely another example that caching

00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:00,770
is moving windows around so please

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,900
dragging and dropping dragging yogurt

00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:05,030
window with a window manager the taiga

00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,680
bean see that the image dstv sense where

00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:09,700
the exocrine spices just like moving

00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,700
window out you know its contents

00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:15,990
and and these are more like the first

00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:17,280
page like that you know the high-level

00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:20,189
PG season will like the more technical

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,509
nature is so said opinions and

00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,590
integrated shesh and handling so it's

00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:25,199
hager of you can see it's like you know

00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:27,960
i used typically connection my tiger VNC

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:32,189
server but ss8 start the VNC server

00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:33,840
process and then then i can connect it

00:07:32,189 --> 00:07:35,189
with VNC although I can you can

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,139
technically can force it up the Sun

00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:39,780
local hevesy can force SSH for integra

00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:42,960
B&C whereas with X to go it always uses

00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:45,150
ssh is X go client uses the live SSH

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,650
library and manager and polish some

00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:49,860
commands on the server like next to go

00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:52,680
run command and then turn launches next

00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:54,509
to go is no display server called in X

00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,569
agents part of the next Americans know

00:07:54,509 --> 00:07:59,969
but they're not to tell the novice users

00:07:57,569 --> 00:08:01,919
to run my main command so they can start

00:07:59,969 --> 00:08:03,509
character desktop session I just you

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,810
must tell you they believes was never

00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:08,930
connected this hostname default port 22

00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:11,969
inch let the desktop environment on

00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:13,740
another example abuela to feature is no

00:08:11,969 --> 00:08:18,000
do you select assessing a lot like gnome

00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:22,469
or KDE or xfce or things like no no vs

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,219
gnome fall back gnome classic those are

00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:25,219
several texts essence

00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,430
whereas if you login locally with gdm or

00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:33,580
another display manager you can select

00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:35,979
those X sessions on session broker is he

00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:37,780
knows it's not as easy to set up as

00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:39,190
simply as long with my next ago sir but

00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:41,620
essentially broke of X to do you can

00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:43,720
have your clients capture the one

00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,220
session broker from that i'll refer them

00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,720
to you know which server can't you like

00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:48,610
and by doing that it can do load

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,070
balancing and kept centralized

00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:52,000
configuration so like a lot of things

00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,170
that you would normally set next to a

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,880
client can we use to what I'm next to go

00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:59,380
over like which desktop and finally

00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:02,050
survival in which servers sharing our

00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:03,910
physical desktops that's you know that

00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:07,000
is a useful feature for remote desktop

00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:08,770
session to have but the basic it's it's

00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,390
not like the way I recommend use either

00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:12,220
type of KX to do because the performance

00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:14,050
is always terrible it basically works

00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,970
like pixel if dating like rendered the

00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:19,090
local monitor and then try to send the

00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:21,940
watch render to the DNC and mini play

00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:24,400
for work station right now and known has

00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:26,680
the screen sharing feature built-in i

00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:29,800
forgot the packaging but it's using BMC

00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:31,540
and you know it's it's good for remote

00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,460
app support but it's you never get the

00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:35,440
good performance or other features like

00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:37,870
you can get with the wheel you know a

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:42,400
virtual B&C server like a fun click like

00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:43,950
and i showed you and

00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,510
and similar to the fact that there's no

00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:47,770
internet Mexico and spice have caching

00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:49,960
well that's because basically they using

00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:51,880
applying site when a mean X to go with

00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:55,390
rather than completely discreet 1x11

00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:57,010
protocol using next lips the sin x 11 /

00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:59,890
like that states Tomlin like impressed

00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:01,270
and very different formats so in one end

00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:03,010
of the tunnel is standard actual event

00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:05,290
appliance on the ranges next server so

00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:08,170
with exco client for windows and mac you

00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:09,760
literally use an X error but it that

00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:10,990
approach that you know working with

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,820
excellent protocol to make it more

00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:15,340
efficient rather than just recording it

00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,800
is y XC are not really good your

00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:18,940
performance in terms of you know

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,490
respondents users in low bandwidth um

00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:24,760
the one limitation there with xt 0 and X

00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:26,410
lives is that it's you know is in X look

00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:31,030
was developed by no machine for no

00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:32,260
machine one in X 1 33 they need to open

00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:35,170
source but they didn't work which worst

00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:36,850
wrestler code sorry and then with no

00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:38,680
machine in export said what's going to

00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:41,050
go proprietary and go with a completely

00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,610
different architecture so this points

00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:45,820
are actually going other projects are

00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:47,350
maintaining a necklace but until we were

00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:49,390
working on trying to pour relates to the

00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:51,280
desktop environments like decimals I

00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:53,980
require the composite extension or glx

00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:56,380
one point forward instead of 1.2 but

00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:57,640
that's going to be those will be added

00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:02,080
applying month so they're worse like a

00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:04,410
year or so okay now for the actual

00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,410
diamonds

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,040
i'm going to start

00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:23,800
I'm connected to this machine book on

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:25,960
amazon ec2 instance right now our family

00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:30,430
c virus it's an amazon ec2 it's in the

00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:32,820
original in virginia so i have that that

00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:35,230
come in a script to my home directory

00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,880
this is actually a easy to infants from

00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,780
a fedora cloud image no official photo

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,410
of cloudy means that i installed

00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:46,000
packages on top of an able to services

00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:51,700
so just are the tiger BNC services is

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:53,260
listening on 4.1 so well there's you

00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:55,720
probably use the same remote desktop via

00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:57,520
i'm using the official tiger VNC client

00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,100
and note that in Beansie terminology the

00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,210
viewer is the point its i prefer the

00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:05,370
term applied to this what every other

00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:05,370
protocol uses to describe the point

00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:11,930
I think with Amazon ec2 have an internal

00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,930
19 external IP that's the correct one

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,910
so it's wanting to have known autostart

00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,610
applications own there's some different

00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:30,600
logic for the policy kid in terms of

00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:30,600
sample cases we'll talk about later but

00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:38,350
call them instantly but here you go here

00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:40,779
is the Fedora workstation milk desktop

00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:44,529
and all its beauty access remotely for

00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:49,320
Northern Virginia and Amazon foreign pro

00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:52,420
cloud there's the unclass server servers

00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:55,330
and then the 3d rendering is done via

00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:56,890
lov n pi thought that the software

00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:59,800
that's much faster than the old soft

00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:02,410
pipe so even though gnome shell is utg

00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:05,660
locks in deposits on it there's enough

00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:07,550
CP power to keep up for its own

00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:10,810
but you'll see for example that dragging

00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:12,920
Windows is not smooth because feeds t is

00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:17,030
estimation entire winter contents other

00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:19,490
least white white shield the white area

00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:22,900
press is extremely well david encoding

00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:22,900
which is probably but the following two

00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:30,210
so if even once we show them anything

00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:31,740
specific you look great there's also the

00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:35,450
tiger beach always stretch this by

00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:39,030
default so in Figure settings target

00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:44,790
what right our video play

00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:46,260
I tried I work for caca I later in this

00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:48,270
presentation I will talk about video and

00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:50,820
how there's a really cool approach that

00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:53,820
the article project has the archos basic

00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:56,160
spin-off Mexico but analysis somebody

00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:58,550
give me a glass of water per month it's

00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,550
right up there

00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:12,410
i guess youtube doesn't see me people

00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:17,470
accident selves from amazon ec2 is you

00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:17,470
know IP address space w robots

00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,740
the bacon looks nice but I've not the

00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:24,740
comic pancakes

00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:34,149
that's my most fav capsules I've seen

00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,800
so let's try to make it easy on yourself

00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:43,519
would you like the standard size window

00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:47,259
I note the dobie no audio because that's

00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,259
not part of the B&C cortical itself

00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:52,030
so there's you know small window size

00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:56,130
and

00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:56,130
from school window his home

00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:06,810
Thank You youtube for using you no html5

00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:08,730
and having a video formats

00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:10,250
Oh close that we fight the deans you

00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:13,250
find an example i can show you that

00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,250
concession

00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:27,910
what a limitation that means he has is

00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:30,880
you know I'm like rip mode x 11 x to go

00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:32,590
you cannot know do remote applications

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,180
you cannot have a couple ms can you

00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:36,640
bring me leave with a local integration

00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:38,260
everything it's just the entire no

00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,600
desktop window but there are some

00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:42,400
features that they've added that Simpson

00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,550
says don't have like I just resize the

00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:48,870
desktop session I changing the window

00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:48,870
size with my window manager here

00:15:53,059 --> 00:15:55,929
season

00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,459
these resize books

00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:08,889
point is that oh that because I pass it

00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:11,410
on to the beatsie cervical gosh I will

00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:13,690
kill once thought the gnome session no

00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:15,579
command quits the VNC server quits and

00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:17,759
if we have a note they said clean lot

00:16:15,579 --> 00:16:17,759
off

00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:22,690
next I'll show extra to go

00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:30,579
so for those of you who don't know

00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:30,579
mattei is the continuous of known to

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,020
I mean it is intentionally a fork of the

00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:40,220
gnome desktop environments but starting

00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:42,410
with gnome truth out 32 on end so yeah

00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:45,470
that's very show you first how I can't

00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:48,440
do it next to go isn't this an after

00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:50,450
running commands so first of all this is

00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,520
the standard xtogo client there are two

00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:55,910
other ex to go clients one that shared

00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:57,530
code called one is called 500 GUI it's a

00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,940
GUI also but it's focuses on having like

00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:00,680
a task bar tray icon and connecting

00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:02,600
about what is your server that once it's

00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:05,000
polka see a line which is now interface

00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:07,069
but xcode points it's you know it's a

00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,740
most polished of the three halves ago

00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:11,839
clients and it's optimized for like you

00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:14,620
know like clink line you know usage

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:19,069
where you look and single user usage in

00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:20,540
so long so you know accession name can

00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:25,089
name where be launched can change the

00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:25,089
icon unless i coming

00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:41,170
it's a random my homeland

00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:43,630
login nights put our cloud image our

00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:46,210
waters exploring and i'm using my ssh

00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:47,920
key because experiences ssa as an

00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:49,860
English you know ss8 spent occasional

00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:52,410
chains on

00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:54,120
and that's just not even a festivus

00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:57,170
desktop algorithm category with old

00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:59,490
version being discussed and sometimes

00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:02,840
because each other

00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:02,840
you know type of sense into your two

00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:09,330
and then there's compression options I

00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:13,140
always leave it the default high quality

00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:14,880
same guy you can change in said to be

00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:16,610
like use the whole display but if you

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,360
make it at Wendy college be cited later

00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:23,930
keyboard it's optional sound printing

00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,930
example uses pulseaudio

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,519
connect using my ssh key

00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:47,940
so huge dump another mot a desktop and

00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:49,920
one first thing to notice is the beauty

00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,810
of you know clients i greatly just like

00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,460
that i'm moving the window around no

00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:56,750
actually slowly drawing you that has two

00:18:53,460 --> 00:19:00,260
recent entire image desktop resizing

00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:00,260
like work very well

00:19:03,389 --> 00:19:09,280
those a lot

00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:10,810
system owner that's known system longer

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,570
but you know Angelica I know after their

00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:16,510
motto anybody home there's no matta is

00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:20,380
using the for government of the Matassa

00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:23,650
tea called Marco so it's not using the

00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:24,940
glx or composite and that's why it's

00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:26,110
called Lexi oh but also makes things

00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:28,300
like my pastor too because it you know

00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:29,710
having regular excellent and windows at

00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:32,530
the Alexa consider it moves around is

00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:36,460
you know is we don't very efficiently

00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:38,140
with protocol like again that's anybody

00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:40,590
wants anything like my see you to this

00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,590
time again

00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:06,370
I think the wife Isis

00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:15,450
so it's got some other means

00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:17,660
invincible but they're a little bigger

00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,660
but

00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,440
reaction when you actually

00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:34,470
so the audio is aren't compressed that's

00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:37,650
limitation of pulseaudio so it has

00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:39,390
having trouble keeping up on what kind

00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:42,080
of man you could you know the audio work

00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:42,080
permits moving

00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:51,910
okay home let me show you what prophetic

00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:54,510
am hoping so I'm just going to like you

00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:54,510
very shared

00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:59,280
and

00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:07,170
so is really you know that is minimized

00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:09,420
and we store the window it opens like

00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:10,650
that because against gets cashing the

00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:17,400
you know the image contents of the

00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:18,570
window on okay anything else the one

00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:22,020
thing I would show is that one thing we

00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:23,700
fixed recently with is a policy kid

00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:27,000
integration with X to go for desktop

00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:29,130
memory sessions so I opened up Kirk

00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,100
manager all the county man Geum does

00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:34,230
he's too insensitive concept in group

00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:37,680
manager as tribbing a policy could

00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:39,150
window it's used like a year ago the

00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,890
policy kit window would like fell to

00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:42,690
open and rip managers say hair cannot

00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:46,770
authenticate but now in case

00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:48,510
successfully it's a medium is running

00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:51,420
but leadership proving that you know the

00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:54,360
policy continuation is working much

00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:55,800
better now policy kit does however say

00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,420
that this is a remote session so I'm

00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,130
going to apply different policies hence

00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:00,840
why we want to know Mitt prompted us for

00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:02,130
like the passwords like manage color

00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,140
devices but if you logged and hopefully

00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:05,370
policy would say oh your local and under

00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,580
font if your password to manage color

00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,580
choices

00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:18,240
so single applications let's do browser

00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:34,400
so there you go I money approx on

00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:37,180
you can avoid remove it for school

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,180
if I gotta

00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:40,160
doap

00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,380
IRC identifying his Delaware

00:23:04,409 --> 00:23:09,850
but there you go it thinks I'm an Amazon

00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:11,490
data center but it's cool do is actually

00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:14,080
coming over you know how to go it's a

00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:15,340
single app and you know this thing I'm

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,130
skip no more openers the same

00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:20,500
application the x11 protocol supports

00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:22,650
internet slips supports that beach or

00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,650
two

00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:26,070
of course some feed some things like

00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,050
grip manager would not work currently

00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:30,660
I'll discuss that later how we caught up

00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:32,040
we got next to go on and hooked it up

00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:35,179
like free desktop rogues answer that

00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,179
those applications can work

00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:45,769
XTO sports folders here yeah

00:23:43,309 --> 00:23:47,960
yeah I mean it mounts the mounts like a

00:23:45,769 --> 00:23:50,960
folder windows like sliced ham / docs to

00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,759
your like I think chested I will fit on

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,019
you actually adds Terry Falls after you

00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:57,649
connected i still haven't tested

00:23:54,019 --> 00:24:00,039
mixtures working again so i'll share my

00:23:57,649 --> 00:24:02,250
desktop folder

00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:05,360
so later

00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:05,360
in part amount yet

00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:18,720
actually go this have our desktop

00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:20,100
bindings also so you can see like a nice

00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,480
icon and desktop for the shared folder

00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:23,480
but i think i forgot to install them

00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:30,690
like an assistant

00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:41,320
next to go this but while you have that

00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:43,360
skill to open and this is like for the

00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:45,750
next Republicans for the next party

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,750
there's also

00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:08,380
not sure why I should oh it's a hidden

00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:08,380
forward that's why

00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,960
you sure

00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:26,230
so if i had some to my desktop

00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:33,900
this is good for example on the desktop

00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,559
there it is okay it means basically

00:26:00,399 --> 00:26:04,779
using the ssh daemon on the next

00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:06,100
applying to share the files an inch

00:26:04,779 --> 00:26:08,669
meeting SSD a professional and server

00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,669
taxes on

00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:14,220
entreno do right also

00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,900
the Falls they were pierced through that

00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:23,640
part is created so yeah I've got

00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:27,240
installed the you know that the Monta

00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:28,650
binding package but a fortune if i

00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,520
install it you can see an icon right

00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:31,520
here for the show for it

00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:35,730
and one of the extra developers on Mike

00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:40,500
Daniels and Debbie developer Annie Mott

00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:43,730
a developer so he's yet you make sure

00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,730
that my favorite a role thanks to go

00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:54,410
and one last thing i want to show is a

00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:57,200
challenge when it's fine

00:26:54,410 --> 00:27:02,060
15 minutes okay I'm sure about all so

00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:03,560
you know know when no was originally

00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:06,170
division of the valve they had known

00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:08,180
fallback mode which was like continual

00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:10,780
actively maintained Matassa t window

00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:13,070
manager a known panel for the show on

00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:14,860
after with no me without a to know

00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:18,590
classic motors introduced squares using

00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:20,180
gnome shell and butter and and it

00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:23,060
provides a similar look and feel to be

00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:25,810
owned you know known fallback mode slots

00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:28,130
known to sauce Mattei but it's using the

00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:30,340
newer frameworks now however there's no

00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:32,450
you stole limit the stilt issue with

00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:36,770
modern window manager and no shell that

00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:38,450
you're using the geobox karthik source

00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:41,300
software 3d rendering all the time and

00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:43,190
you're using impalas extension yakov

00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:46,370
sulka wits is a red adder who works on a

00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:48,800
farm for a important bird think

00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:51,410
well or fit or both and he's also cygwin

00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:53,540
maintainer and he saw few noises were

00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:55,460
both interested in getting known

00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:57,020
flashback intensive known fallback mode

00:27:55,460 --> 00:28:00,110
a package for fedora we currently have

00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:02,300
an echo primito there's the obstacle of

00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:04,460
getting it entirely packets in for the

00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:05,520
work is like five have to select not say

00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:08,160
no no

00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:11,640
no flash back as his own get me voted

00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:13,770
cetera is that all the Anaconda install

00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,780
OS installer uses Matassa tea and

00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:17,070
they're probably only tested with Eggman

00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:19,260
tassia dad for always we need more

00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:23,550
tasking tweet out 1600 psi seaman cetera

00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:24,750
so there's you know there's some we will

00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:26,070
continue try to work on that we just got

00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:32,270
to make sure you don't step on anacondas

00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:32,270
toes or no flash back on the new store

00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:39,970
which find children

00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:39,970
also at the end on

00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:44,460
so I'm instant earlier that there's no

00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:46,440
better than the graciousness be known

00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:47,880
French desktop one of the issue intesa

00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:50,520
with Tiger Beat see right now is that

00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,900
you know you have to me I'm relying on

00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,880
that script in the system or you won't

00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,530
overridden like home for exploring

00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:57,360
script achievers chashni morons like you

00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:59,580
have to specify the dome session

00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,570
commander the motto says in command and

00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:02,310
you have to set some environment

00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:04,470
variables that only define next session

00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:08,310
files the files from a user's share

00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:10,530
sauce next session and I do have a

00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:12,840
proof-of-concept app where you can lock

00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:14,520
type health agency funding that the help

00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:17,160
and then the app lets you pick the next

00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:20,040
session along so let's go to a computer

00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:24,210
and then share access angeles tim

00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:25,680
talking about something and right now

00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:28,410
there is a commercial you know who just

00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:30,150
oxygen called a thin link that's using

00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:31,710
tiger ii and see what they learn SS 8

00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:34,460
Slyke session handling and they have a

00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:39,050
similar approach of energy sessions so

00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:39,050
these are doc desktop files actually

00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:47,490
seriously

00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:12,250
you guys see the text secure desktop

00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:14,920
file that says you know

00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:17,970
launched this this command for this X

00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:20,410
session poem about known flashback and

00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:22,660
make sure this particular install and

00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:26,590
set the environment variable of on bills

00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:27,970
based on this value but this isn't you

00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:29,020
know clearly complicated by the problem

00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:31,600
is right now we're relying on those

00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:32,830
scripts now under setc when users home

00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,360
directories and those often get out of

00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:41,260
sync with the necessary you know

00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:42,760
confinement variables for example policy

00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:45,340
kid I think there's still some emitting

00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:47,170
issues like young X seems talk geldof

00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:50,050
finicky i'm not sure why so i'm going to

00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:51,280
see me to look into but personally at

00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:53,230
home amuse you have managed all the time

00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:55,630
and I'm by the best those false key

00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:57,220
locations work in another if she was

00:30:55,630 --> 00:31:00,160
dead so actually or sports a single

00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:02,620
upload and on the lens desktops you go

00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:05,320
to desist in DC so 60 g / auto starts

00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:08,850
you'll see all these I'm at the start a

00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,850
nap so for example

00:31:08,889 --> 00:31:15,470
whenever I try to one you know fire if I

00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:16,609
Thunderbird on over X ago I need a the

00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:19,279
known queuing game and running so they

00:31:16,609 --> 00:31:20,929
can unlock my gpg key but if I do it a

00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:22,729
small habit they don't you and anyone

00:31:20,929 --> 00:31:26,840
starts we won't nearly keeping dating

00:31:22,729 --> 00:31:28,940
start so i would like to work with

00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:30,499
freedesktop.org kk XD developer

00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:31,879
Stander's like these apps should be

00:31:30,499 --> 00:31:36,039
stored automatically leaving a song on

00:31:31,879 --> 00:31:36,039
loop is if I just do like right now

00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,840
one

00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:46,450
we'll see right now it's saying that

00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:49,390
don't only start the milling Damon no

00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:52,480
unity and latte it will never attempt i

00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:54,660
started in a single app session like XTO

00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,660
has

00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:01,340
and some

00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:03,200
the next part of my talk is rather so

00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:05,030
you know I started using excellent work

00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,200
because you know I had security farms to

00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:08,570
meet in Mexico was easier solution

00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:11,630
between access servers in our lab from

00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:14,540
our windows desktops and none of this

00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:16,670
here is specific to but my job at

00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:18,380
locking boring but it's seen some issues

00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:20,030
with commonly see I literally met a

00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:23,059
developer web developer to look at the

00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:24,559
local tech meetup he defected the

00:32:23,059 --> 00:32:26,540
application he develops his on well

00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:28,550
server and so we're application for

00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:30,800
financial companies but he literally

00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:33,770
told me that he said that IT security

00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:37,000
students understand Linux therefore they

00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:40,280
won't let me run linux on my laptop and

00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,570
in another company's year into a lot of

00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:43,940
other issues just find my legs on your

00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:45,260
laptop and desktop like crocotta i won't

00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:46,790
support you with like failing hardware

00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:49,850
if you have linux on your laptop or

00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:53,480
desktop also their standard wins in HD

00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:55,429
and propriety by the hardware but i'm

00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:58,640
going to maintain it if you're running

00:32:55,429 --> 00:33:00,080
going district OS and in this into

00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,120
having issues with people would find one

00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,980
you know native windows out innovative

00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,390
apps like crack windows even mean web

00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:07,610
apps development only by companies make

00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:10,250
right and explore it's like we rely on

00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:11,660
brand new modern web frameworks that we

00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:12,740
wanted two bulbs with firefox and

00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:14,600
they'll purpose you never fix them

00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:19,900
because i want to minimize cost but only

00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:21,820
supporting IE so I this

00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:23,860
I know lots of people are hardened souls

00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:27,940
and so for the world work station but

00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:29,380
it's i know there's like I've seen you

00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:31,300
know a lot there's lots of cool

00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:32,620
technical technology comes out that are

00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:36,700
running for workstations I'm sure but

00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:38,170
many large enterprises it's it's a mind

00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:39,340
there's a minefield of followers trying

00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:41,380
to run linux on your laptop or desktop

00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:45,220
it's me for this remote into a server or

00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:47,690
cloud instance and access your little

00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:51,710
inch desktop that way

00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:53,690
so with future of New Testament forth so

00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:56,049
I already mentioned no flashback that

00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:59,960
Yakov chakras are working on porting I

00:33:56,049 --> 00:34:03,649
mentioned in Grayson books and it's

00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:05,080
about the accession launcher and I do

00:34:03,649 --> 00:34:07,750
also want to point out that you know

00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:10,970
well it's what's hugger B and C and

00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:12,290
other VNC solutions and xtogo can show

00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:15,200
an existing like you know physical

00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:17,389
exerted performances always much worse

00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:20,030
like many people vote us like you know

00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:26,649
info workstation I know they're good at

00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:26,649
sharing screen sharing and turn it on

00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:33,220
but you know well well this works and

00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:34,629
commedia to stop you will never get the

00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:38,970
same performance a few manual and tiger

00:34:34,629 --> 00:34:38,970
easy you know process severally

00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:47,579
in the future well so the Arctic apology

00:34:46,349 --> 00:34:50,960
is basically a spin-off of edge to go

00:34:47,579 --> 00:34:53,099
that's um they develop external features

00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:58,650
this is probably the thing that shocked

00:34:53,099 --> 00:35:01,999
people the most 4k video playback and

00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:04,829
when I've seen my screens have 4k events

00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:06,359
via the like the telekinesis for

00:35:04,829 --> 00:35:08,779
framework for X to get although it's not

00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:11,249
actually really interesting part instead

00:35:08,779 --> 00:35:12,989
where that idea grant telekinesis is you

00:35:11,249 --> 00:35:15,089
know typically with move desks all

00:35:12,989 --> 00:35:17,369
features like microsoft OTP in order the

00:35:15,089 --> 00:35:19,950
comment video you know the server will

00:35:17,369 --> 00:35:21,930
decode it's in CPU or GPU like you know

00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:24,839
the visual flash player or player

00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:27,619
whatever then v encoded for TP and then

00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:30,269
the RDP client has to be decoded and

00:35:27,619 --> 00:35:32,670
then show it on the screen with

00:35:30,269 --> 00:35:34,799
telekinesis you're just letting the it's

00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:37,440
like forwarding the video without being

00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:39,809
coding it from server to client and it's

00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,160
fairly easy to do that because s sa it's

00:35:39,809 --> 00:35:44,279
opened up lots of options they can use

00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:46,019
unix sockets to do you know secure like

00:35:44,279 --> 00:35:47,460
Curtis about persons based communication

00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:49,130
between certain clients and only the

00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:51,690
proper use of conscience urban clients

00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:53,460
so it's you know challenge balances he

00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:54,839
probably price however much the 4k video

00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:57,710
was encoded with plus it'll tiny bit

00:35:54,839 --> 00:35:57,710
more vesa feet overhead

00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:02,400
and you know and you can do things like

00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:04,650
buffering too because it's like with the

00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:07,550
YouTube video business 40 video go to

00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:07,550
see sockets

00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:16,250
and another this is my final slide out

00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:17,480
so you have weight legs over a lot of

00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:19,490
possibilities i'm very excited by the

00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,570
building architecture is part of the

00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:24,740
brilliant architectures that you know

00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:27,620
the the wayland itself is lik Wayland

00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:29,090
the compositor / new manager makes it

00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:31,520
into the railing to become displacers

00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:33,860
own and that same process is also the

00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,120
screen lock so what make possible to do

00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:37,550
things like what Microsoft already p

00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:40,010
does where you you log into your laptop

00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:43,340
or desktop locally you lock the screen

00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:45,200
you reconnect the you know via like you

00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:47,420
know your desktop client from another

00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,760
computer and make sure the screen is

00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:51,320
locked locally and then here but you're

00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,480
still easier set the same testing sort

00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:54,850
of locally by locking the screen image

00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,930
you can have the same perform you know

00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:58,880
it's performed to print it not doing the

00:36:56,930 --> 00:37:03,800
pixel scraping like ii share the local

00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:05,630
screen on I mean that unfortunately X

00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:08,210
here would not be part of great land

00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:10,130
because you know XD go you know in

00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:11,630
excellence works it compresses and

00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:13,700
caches and lazed around scripts

00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:16,150
excellent protocol and paste inspection

00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:19,760
protocol both ends it's

00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:21,560
but I was hoping that in terms of

00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,690
toolkits and possibly display servers

00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,740
themselves themselves you can influence

00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:27,020
some sort of clients I would be

00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:31,130
exclusion there was already some work on

00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:34,090
like IEP is open but like the guy who's

00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:37,520
working ODP hasn't open sourced it yet

00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:40,310
it's called up his rear is improving

00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:45,110
free RDP client in the 40s server based

00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:48,760
on the few key client code that's just

00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:48,760
my talk any questions

00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,320
before

00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:05,920
five

00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:07,390
Yeah right I mean that's a like all the

00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:11,079
browser's down support web sockets so

00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:13,349
it's not far i mean okay gotcha um I

00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:17,140
mean so the lappy Blastoise is a

00:38:13,349 --> 00:38:19,990
suppliant happen html5 version well axes

00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:21,880
go flying you know it it's expecting

00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:24,069
have an extra round you know the next

00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,240
serve ramen client and that's what makes

00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:27,910
it to a fish scent is it's you know

00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:31,480
doing singing x11 communions rather than

00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:32,770
during prep or smaller tree protocol so

00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:35,010
if you actually apartment if I need to

00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:37,660
go for life flying but this it's

00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:38,650
sufficient for that reason and also

00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:41,829
there have been some attempts to develop

00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:43,599
an HTML 5 x server it's like you know

00:38:41,829 --> 00:38:45,430
help the state's actually run you too

00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:47,049
but even then you know on github but

00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:48,520
even then you'd be like you know we'd be

00:38:47,049 --> 00:38:50,529
saying excellent commands the browser

00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:53,020
and then browser has to talk to that

00:38:50,529 --> 00:38:55,349
server so it would never be the same

00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:55,349
efficiency

00:38:56,860 --> 00:39:01,600
the other questions comments

00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:08,560
so is anybody here my god like a like a

00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:12,200
softer golfer I know more4 workstation I

00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:16,460
mean I can tell you that you know I've

00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:18,440
know there's this one and one guy and a

00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:20,060
couple of people contributed to a known

00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,410
flashback the archive softwoods I are

00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:24,950
working on catching it for you know

00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:26,420
fedora and with rel 7.2 which will have

00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:28,760
known feet are 14 you go to have any

00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:31,940
kale for that but you know there's lots

00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:33,950
of like lots of people and then in the

00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:35,870
known project think that we're trying to

00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:37,130
like for film desktop or enough because

00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:38,600
we want to maintain this alternative

00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:41,290
shells that we can have better

00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:44,090
performance on things like you know low

00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:46,070
low power or on hardware hand you know

00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:48,770
roads us all solutions like being see an

00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:50,270
edge to go on like for like we like

00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:51,680
recently a couple of patches to know i'm

00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:53,300
setting stain personally two patches

00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,650
that they rejected them saying you

00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:57,020
should for Chrome settings Damon we

00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:59,990
don't want it to dance I know you need

00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:01,910
not a chronicle of we had 61 catches of

00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:04,100
realness to know something setting

00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:05,300
basically a for Chrome settings a means

00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:07,430
to uni settings

00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:08,780
that's not what you're trying to do we

00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:11,890
do want to work with up team projects

00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:11,890
like rest of melanin

00:40:14,789 --> 00:40:19,199
I'm sorry that's only the right way to

00:40:16,829 --> 00:40:20,759
vote right by me original comic will

00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:23,880
said unity is an alternate shelf or

00:40:20,759 --> 00:40:25,109
known and now they've backtrack America

00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:28,679
is making any tips on the desktop

00:40:25,109 --> 00:40:32,789
environment we don't have that you know

00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:34,939
the the resources or the arrogance to do

00:40:32,789 --> 00:40:34,939
that

00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:42,360
the other questions comments

00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,280
ok

00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:51,810
you'll see me on IRC all the time I've

00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,000
also been heavy on fedora cloud recently

00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:56,010
going working on running X to go with

00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,560
other the MOT a desktop or middle no

00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:59,880
single option on docker container I'm

00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,890
still trying to fix on the box but the

00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:04,670
actually the word docker file stretch

00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:07,380
LaMontagne XTO minimal should be

00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:10,410
included in the federal right dr. files

00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:12,750
seem something I forgot to mention of

00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:14,430
areas but texting officials ago and

00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:16,740
other solutions to can on computers it

00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:19,170
to use new system G to start ssh server

00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:20,780
for example make hecht ssh server then

00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:24,590
I'm like no poor kitty battle-ax most

00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:24,590
coordinated for example

00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:30,090
I've never the point is how intense like

00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:32,250
remote desktop it's like it belong the

00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:34,530
clouds save the desktop the workstations

00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:36,599
say Gore the servers say because all

00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:41,190
three are valid use cases for X to go

00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:42,330
needs together with esta solutions but

00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:43,440
in terms of integration mostly

00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:46,790
immigration bugs have to fix are in

00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,790
terms of you know the desktop sake

00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:53,740
thank you

00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:05,190
a few soft time I could show off a known

00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:05,190
flashback Wahlberg

00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:13,880
