Title: Flock 2015 - Two factor authentication with GPG - Nick Bebout
Publication date: 2015-08-26
Playlist: Flock 2015
Description: 
	This presentation will discuss the uses of Two Factor Authentication in GPG, including the GPG shell tokens with the GPG smart cards, and Yubikey NEO which comes with an OpenPGP applet. I will also discuss how to use a GPG token (either type) to authenticate yourself with SSH to a remote server, which I believe is helpful for increased security, especially given all of the hacking going on lately.
