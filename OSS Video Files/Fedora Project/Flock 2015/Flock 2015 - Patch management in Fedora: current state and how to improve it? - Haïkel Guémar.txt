hey I doing nothing okay let's start

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,470
what we're small committee what's good

00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:22,880
yeah the problem is that my laptop

00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:25,580
crashed I got spare latter but haven't

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:31,519
had the time to set it up it has

00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:33,800
password what I don't get at well so I

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:37,100
don't really need slides i have units so

00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:39,050
just to keep track of my talk but it was

00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:42,140
supposed to kick started a discussion

00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:44,719
about our packaging tuning to include

00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:50,690
patch management because it's a

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:56,390
recurring issue and well with SIBO well

00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:59,770
so my name is icon uh so I'm part of the

00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:02,359
FISC oh and also cloud working group and

00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:06,430
in my day job i wish i'd try that on

00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:08,560
OpenStack so I'm the idea guy basically

00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:11,250
what we move

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,250
ND

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:19,170
yes it's just note so i can show i can

00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:21,780
share it later because it's kind of my

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:25,560
laptop broke on Sunday and couldn't

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:31,979
finished then it's just that I don't get

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:35,009
lost so so I've been back there for 10

00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:39,170
years so I seen all the different

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:42,030
practices and also the bad practices and

00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:44,970
we are currently in a source state for

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,819
patch management in packages so first

00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:50,759
federal policy is about upstream first

00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:53,490
so we're not supposed to ship patches in

00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:57,990
our packaging at least that's the

00:01:53,490 --> 00:02:01,080
default no matches but some patches are

00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:04,619
not optimal like some specific federal

00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:07,910
integration or there are also patches

00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:10,319
that are refused approval but otherwise

00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:12,090
varaku it couldn't have the package

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,220
couldn't work on further so we have to

00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:17,730
click to bring these patches in our

00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:20,400
packaging we can't avoid patches in the

00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:24,090
Sun package because there are security

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:27,000
issues or back boards that are missing

00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:30,150
really required because we can't wait

00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,790
upstream to release a new towel to do a

00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:35,130
new package so we have to bat for the

00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:38,459
patch and keep it in the package until

00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:41,760
we update to the latest to the latest

00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:43,980
release but so we don't have a choice we

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,280
have to deal with patches and let's

00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:51,390
include many critical patches like GDC

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:54,050
colonel firefox many critical path

00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:57,760
packaging packaging Federer have

00:02:54,050 --> 00:03:00,800
and we have to manage em sanely and

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:03,170
mostly it's interesting to see that this

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,450
these are the packages who started

00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:08,240
experimenting things but in how we

00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:10,490
manage patch if you see how the colonel

00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:13,220
manage their patches that's quite

00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:15,470
interesting because they finally have a

00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:17,810
working wardrobe but the problem is that

00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:21,590
the workflow which is pretty much chain

00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:24,230
is not is not adapted you know is not

00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:27,260
implemented in our tooling and is not

00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:31,390
also documented by it so other packaging

00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:35,750
could reuse it so I think at as part of

00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:38,180
the packaging as part of the technical

00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:40,460
community we should think that and arrow

00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:43,700
and say to the packager okay you have to

00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:47,270
manage patch here are the tools here are

00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:49,310
the good practices well we're not going

00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:51,530
to tell you how to do it but if you do

00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:53,780
it that way that's the best way in the

00:03:51,530 --> 00:04:01,600
most same way and that encourage

00:03:53,780 --> 00:04:05,090
contribution so I will come to that

00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:08,270
support so currently the patches are

00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:12,560
veteran in this gate so they are version

00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:16,040
as sources so you can track the changes

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,530
in your the other batches in the spec

00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:22,010
you declare them with a patch with

00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:23,930
followed by number line so you have to

00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:27,320
insert a line each time you had attached

00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:30,500
and you apply them with a special macro

00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:34,130
which person patch number pitch and then

00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:38,060
apply it it's kind of very rough because

00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:40,190
you have to do it manually every time if

00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:44,410
you are managing packages with a lot of

00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:46,460
patch it could be very cumbersome are

00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:48,500
currently and maintaining I'm

00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:51,920
commentating most of the OpenStack

00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:55,430
packaging and we have a lot of patches

00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:58,130
in some cases and every time we have to

00:04:55,430 --> 00:05:01,130
roll out a new release we have to rebate

00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:03,800
the patches sometimes we have to do a

00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:06,440
new patches remove patches and we have

00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:10,090
to do it we had to do it manually it is

00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:13,450
really annoying so we decided a

00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:17,470
OpenStack patches are managed by get and

00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:23,030
that's how I do the transition oh sorry

00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:25,130
I'm going to miss up sorry ah yeah but

00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:30,650
the projector is not used so you're not

00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:34,610
so yeah so how where is also prominent

00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:39,620
how we generate patches the very old way

00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:42,169
was to use death so we even had a few

00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:47,120
option where that where recommends and a

00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:51,830
you are for generating patches but most

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:54,610
people ignore that so you get you get to

00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:57,410
apply patches on top most directory or

00:05:54,610 --> 00:06:00,710
inside a directory that was the total

00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:03,200
mess the newer practice is to be

00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:05,720
leveraged get okay if your project is

00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:09,080
not management it just unpack the

00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:11,450
trouble create the temporary posterior

00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,760
chain things and generate the patch and

00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:15,169
next time you have to do it you just

00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:19,999
import the patch and

00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:23,779
fix it so that's the way how we are what

00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:26,629
is recommended now to do patches some

00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:28,969
projects like docker maintain their own

00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:31,669
kin git repository and manage red

00:06:28,969 --> 00:06:34,520
patches on their git repository so vets

00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:38,180
ilable available publicly but the

00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:40,159
problem is that we can that we're

00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:43,460
managing that in their own repository

00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:45,469
and nobody may not everyone knows where

00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:49,909
it is and it could change from one

00:06:45,469 --> 00:06:52,759
package to another so so we we need to

00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:55,159
find a consistent guidelines to say ok

00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:57,349
you want to manage your sources at sign

00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:59,060
will have the infrastructure we are

00:06:57,349 --> 00:07:02,120
currently building it to all called

00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:05,629
pegar which is kind of get up like clone

00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:10,819
for both for fedora but which would be

00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:15,169
reusable by anyone fugger original spell

00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:17,900
will take yeah exactly

00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:23,779
you re not I oh I think yeah where our

00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:25,669
canonical exactly what's fine we're a

00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:29,060
small community we're here to speak

00:07:25,669 --> 00:07:31,159
together that's not me speaking to you

00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:36,710
and you listening if you want to

00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:42,469
interpret feel five yeah now we're here

00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:45,080
to disease and exams you are so we have

00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:47,150
the tool we have we are having the basic

00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,909
infrastructure to host get your

00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:52,550
repository so we just need to tell

00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:55,729
people that they should move to where

00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:58,849
this pace but should be a Gatling saying

00:07:55,729 --> 00:08:00,680
you want miniature so people could say

00:07:58,849 --> 00:08:03,499
that we have even a pull request

00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:06,460
mechanism so what would be awesome

00:08:03,499 --> 00:08:09,020
because we'd be able to encourage people

00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:10,639
managing their patches to collaborate

00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:14,330
together in similar personality and

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:17,089
maybe one day on this backfire you have

00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:23,029
the whole thing yeah exactly what would

00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:27,710
be really awesome ending of all this yes

00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:30,500
always all of these various but so we

00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:33,320
have the touring the only part what is

00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:35,690
missing is the packaging cooling like

00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:39,339
fed package but doesn't allow you to

00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:44,480
manage probably the patches are and

00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:47,300
that's here I but here I will be saying

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,339
that the problem with all that the

00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:53,079
current approaches is that it's fragile

00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:55,339
because you have to sing spec manually

00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:57,949
the collaboration is not smooth because

00:08:55,339 --> 00:09:00,649
you have to search where patches or if

00:08:57,949 --> 00:09:04,040
there is actually a repository to manage

00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:06,019
patches there is no way to track Duchess

00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,480
because for instance you cherry-pick a

00:09:06,019 --> 00:09:11,360
pattern web stream but

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:15,079
you don't know if when you release a new

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,480
in your tower new package you don't know

00:09:15,079 --> 00:09:19,820
if your pet the patches you using I've

00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:22,100
been taken because maybe you had to

00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:24,980
change things and so the checks

00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:28,279
unchanged and you have nowhere to check

00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:32,540
that you are already shipping that patch

00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:35,660
so which is stupid because get has way

00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:39,440
to to tell to track patches if you do

00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:42,680
tell fix da dash X it will include the

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,899
original Jackson so you the tooling

00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:47,899
would be able okay the original section

00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:49,839
is it oh this is already in here so i

00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:56,269
will drop this patch automatically and

00:09:49,839 --> 00:10:03,260
you don't have to care yeah exactly but

00:09:56,269 --> 00:10:07,430
it's still iphone so now to make things

00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:09,110
more snoozer so we can already drop the

00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:12,050
clutter in this bag because we have this

00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:14,290
cool macro called % auto setup Mars

00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:17,630
which will be applying patches

00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:20,389
automatically for you so you don't have

00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:23,839
to worry in adding and removing the

00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:27,319
person pagelines that's not in use

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:29,690
anymore by default in hughes pay the

00:10:27,319 --> 00:10:32,510
batch utility to apply patches but there

00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:35,930
is a switch which is dash be an

00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:39,740
uppercase ace get which will allow to

00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:42,950
use get directly to apply patches so

00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:45,680
if all we had some kind of tooling in

00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:49,610
that package that allow you to insert

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:52,130
patch lines for you you just any if

00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:54,830
you're using auto setup you don't you

00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:56,830
don't have to carry you don't have to do

00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:59,870
a lot of parsing to nowadays because

00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:02,000
patches are and source lines are pretty

00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:05,960
much commonly in the beginning of the

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:09,590
spec and don't move much so what would

00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:14,600
be all right we come from crime yeah

00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:17,120
yeah and and the most awesome is

00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:21,260
wretched supported in air p.m. for dot11

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:25,190
so all supported federal already had it

00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:27,770
and you know seven here exactly people

00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:30,320
said it wasn't working but I i tried the

00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:32,840
custodian it was pretty much fun

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,060
beautiful yeah the only thing is what

00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:37,250
you see have two had been requires get

00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:41,150
because it's not in the bell road for

00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:44,840
ESL but it was pretty much shine and

00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:47,240
it's and I think that if the only

00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:50,630
blocker for people is that oh I must

00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:52,550
have the boot requires get well we can

00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:54,590
manage you had it in the birthday for

00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:58,730
builder because it is pretty much my

00:11:54,590 --> 00:12:00,980
fans about nowadays so so by leveraging

00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:06,050
already RPM figure will reduce the

00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:07,700
clutter now we have to use guitars we

00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:10,250
already suggested because a lot of

00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:13,070
upstream projects already used it so why

00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:16,600
using something else and this is also

00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:21,050
the default s here after the world

00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:24,920
actually so if it doesn't you can if it

00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:28,010
use another itm you can sync it you can

00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:31,960
sync svn and mercury positive to get

00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:34,780
very easily it works fine so

00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:37,840
we could had some kind of sinking repo

00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:42,760
between peril and the option repo to

00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:46,720
keep a that in sync ah if you don't well

00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:49,330
we could I know that debian has a way to

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,850
version sources it takes star ball and

00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:54,130
you would heal other than to this to get

00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:56,590
mad you get repository and you can

00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:59,640
manage your patch on top of that so we

00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:03,040
could reuse that at the same approach so

00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:06,220
nothing is actually preventing us to do

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,350
it we can already implement it in local

00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:11,530
while but if we want to implement it at

00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:14,920
federal level we already have the bay

00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:18,460
strolling doing so you just have to do

00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:20,410
the glue and make it happen so life

00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:24,070
would be much easier if we do that

00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:27,430
because we automatically rebase patches

00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:30,460
we do if we change it arabic donor and

00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:33,130
dash X it will be we will drop patches

00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:38,230
automatically as know as soon as they

00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:42,220
are included upstream so why we will not

00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:43,870
doing be it and already the good thing

00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:47,860
is that I've been experimenting but

00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:50,830
workflow for one year II do already does

00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:53,050
what we add some specific tooling but is

00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,820
called you packaging which could be used

00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:58,990
for federal packages actually because

00:13:54,820 --> 00:14:08,410
it's a tool built upon fed package and

00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:10,510
Cody are do package rd or oh yeah so we

00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:12,460
are already experimenting in on other

00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:16,660
projects that people are already using

00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:19,600
it to manage our packaging and so this

00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:21,910
approach works we have tried it in it's

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,640
pretty much reliable the problem is that

00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:27,340
are you is very specific tool and I

00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:30,160
prefer that we include

00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:32,560
management part in that package because

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:38,100
it would be much more useful to more

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:41,530
people so the IG is what we need to

00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:43,330
agree that this is how we want to

00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:45,880
encourage people how to manage patch

00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:48,940
that's why I'm here speaking because I

00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:51,700
could just send a ship a package and do

00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:54,720
it but the problem is that well but

00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:57,220
you're forcing something on us and

00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,380
there's a lot you better cultural

00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:02,470
problem so you have to convince people

00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:05,170
that how do we agree with that's the

00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:07,090
preferred way to manage pages okay so if

00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,980
we agree let's implement it in your

00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:11,680
tooling in either or efrain switcher and

00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:14,740
then advertise it yes don't make it

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,690
mandatory if my ego exactly I don't want

00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:20,620
to force because if people have working

00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:23,320
with okay I'm has a lot of happy they

00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:25,480
wanted you but yeah but for instance

00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:28,150
unproven package and I don't want to

00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,950
spend a lot of time checking how people

00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:32,230
manage a package if I have a very

00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:34,450
standard way that would make much more

00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:37,030
much more useful to fix packaging and

00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:38,950
help people because that's why we are

00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:41,320
here problem vector we're here to help

00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:43,300
people please invite package okay you

00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:46,390
don't have time to fix that or you can

00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:48,520
visit I will fix it for you but I'm not

00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:52,060
doing the maintenance are just here to

00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:55,510
help so if we want people to help make

00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:57,010
it easy don't don't have them reading a

00:15:55,510 --> 00:16:00,730
lot of documentation on spending time

00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:03,400
searching things make it so oh you're

00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:05,500
managing the center way okay I know how

00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:07,930
to do it i know we like when I will find

00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:10,090
things oh maybe that package will help

00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:13,360
you to grow your own Petra Brazilian

00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:16,150
will be able to update it myself without

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,970
breaking anything because the product of

00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:25,270
the process is already documented and

00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:29,300
stretching forward so what does it go so

00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:34,400
okay the miners are handing hair so at

00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:36,590
this point now I would be I would have

00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:40,850
wanted to have some of the air package

00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:43,520
people here but apparently nobody from

00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:45,680
the tooling group is here but that's not

00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:48,020
a problem i will do the interface so i

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,300
think we shouldn't doubt we we should

00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:54,470
see if we have to change anything in

00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:57,080
that policy about i'm suggesting because

00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:59,570
i plan to suggest to see to propose it

00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:01,280
to the fesco at some point and have it

00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:04,160
implemented so i wanted to have feedback

00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:07,490
what do you think need to be changed or

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:10,089
added so i don't know what it is you say

00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:14,079
that we should have

00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:17,529
apparel and watches on top and why not

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:19,720
speak get rid of the terrible but could

00:17:17,529 --> 00:17:24,600
be worth with the gift of the source

00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:24,600
project is ninety percent of projects

00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:34,429
well please step back cartoons about

00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:37,460
religions yeah okay okay so so so okay

00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:40,759
so let's say a large master okay okay

00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:44,710
yes I really lucky there any solution is

00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:47,090
not going to be able to all kinds of

00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:49,639
just a ferment for since we are

00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:52,399
recording are we just outline the

00:17:49,639 --> 00:17:55,940
discussion a lot of absolute project are

00:17:52,399 --> 00:17:59,450
using it so why not directly using kit

00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:02,929
and just all the checksum to you to

00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:05,840
generate the package from that instead

00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:09,409
of using stumbles right now can I save

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:11,899
you a little bit of time because this is

00:18:09,409 --> 00:18:16,249
a discussion this is the third or fourth

00:18:11,899 --> 00:18:22,129
time one in part of the session and in

00:18:16,249 --> 00:18:24,919
case yet I'm on FB CEO yes so we've been

00:18:22,129 --> 00:18:28,460
through this but we've not been through

00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:32,750
this in the new get dominated or

00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:35,150
we seem to be in the main issue that we

00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:38,660
have always had is reproducible builds

00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:40,820
that are managed from that's that can be

00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:44,630
completely done without external access

00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:46,460
to anybody else's repository now with it

00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:48,860
we can obviously now clone the

00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:53,870
repository from whatever upstream ads

00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:56,810
and use that and have you know yeah the

00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:58,520
checksum so that we can ensure that

00:18:56,810 --> 00:19:01,040
we've got it right so now may be the

00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:03,170
time to consider that again but yeah I'm

00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,640
talking about a big cultural issue and

00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:06,380
you're talking about a pretty big

00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,780
overhaul on the way our infrastructure

00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:10,940
works yeah because opportunity the

00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:13,400
packaging our dicks checking troubles

00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:16,160
from the leucocyte Kenny doesn't manage

00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:19,490
get at all yes that's the tar balls just

00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:21,620
come from a separate and easy to you

00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:24,380
know storage repository with in fedora

00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:26,270
there's nothing technically preventing

00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:28,670
us for hitting the source some other way

00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:32,630
besides some needs to write the tool in

00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:35,900
it and you're right now and in this

00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:38,390
universe right now we it's a good idea

00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:41,030
but the last few times has been brought

00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:42,860
up it was not necessarily a good idea

00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:47,880
because

00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:49,950
I think that I agree that's a great idea

00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,530
but I think if you want to maximize your

00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:54,540
success it should be separate proposal

00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:57,030
because yes it doesn't because if

00:19:54,540 --> 00:20:00,090
something in the if you bundle a lot of

00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:02,310
proposal it's messy only if there is a

00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:04,230
small thing that is preventing the word

00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:07,560
proposal to move forward yours will be

00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:11,160
stuck so propose it separately and I oh

00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:13,890
and if it happens in phase cohan believe

00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:15,990
me I would be approve it because this is

00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:17,910
the right time to consider this we have

00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:20,430
the tooling to crown repository and saw

00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:23,220
them in Burnley because the problem is

00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:24,990
that where people were using saw Georgia

00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:27,950
now so far she's closing a lot of

00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:31,140
repository yeah well so damn happy and

00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:34,800
Venice is horrible because now we lost a

00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:36,690
lot of history year and by using the

00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:39,690
leukocyte catch with turbos we are

00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:41,970
preventing some concern such issues to

00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:44,940
come but now we have concluded git

00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:48,450
repository and sorry Sam that's a good

00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:50,550
time and as if you want to push that you

00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:52,740
i'm pretty sure that now people will

00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:55,500
consider it and where people including

00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:58,340
me which will be pushing this forward

00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,340
really well

00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:07,480
grating and that's also is everything

00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:10,149
that's nice GCT yep I've sorted

00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:12,909
something loosely related to that have

00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:16,840
been project atomic power steering RPM

00:21:12,909 --> 00:21:20,559
or do you have been on continuous yeah

00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:22,570
right so they basically for a subset of

00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,830
the packages they do what you're talking

00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:24,659
about

00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:26,100
they don't build them into packages at

00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:29,070
all they've built directly from source

00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:31,710
but anything that doesn't your advocate

00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:34,019
it makes it easier to constantly keep up

00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:36,299
with those common source also makes lien

00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:38,460
testing and QA that much better removes

00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:40,140
a huge roadblock which is another thing

00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:42,980
to add you know if you are looking for

00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:46,740
ammunition to add

00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:48,330
and Debian essentially already is why

00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:50,420
not an evolution this is my

00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:50,420
understanding

00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:55,230
their packages have always been the spec

00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:57,059
files just to make file you can have

00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:59,520
been a variety of competing mechanisms

00:21:57,059 --> 00:22:01,350
for optimizing that McConnell and the

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,059
one that is currently most popular now

00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:06,270
or something like the percent of

00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:08,340
packages it's spec file in a file just a

00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:09,900
few macros and that's it you know

00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:11,429
there's a few heuristics recording

00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:14,820
session from source and interest build

00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:17,280
and that's what we want for the majority

00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:19,919
of packaging because the problem is that

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:22,140
it's a lot of error prone and we want to

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,390
minimize errors because a lot of

00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:28,290
contributors don't have many times and

00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:30,120
as a package for a package or sponsor I

00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:32,400
spent a lot of time explaining things

00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:35,520
and it's always the same thing so yes I

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:38,130
want really to make it straightforward I

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,559
want eighty percent of the things we do

00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:43,380
should be straightforward and people

00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:46,169
don't mean even to ass because oh I need

00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:49,110
to use this macro and we spend the time

00:22:46,169 --> 00:22:52,799
on where is the heart of the paging the

00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:56,220
solving ish integration issues or very

00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:57,990
tricky ones because we don't have we

00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:01,169
don't we are very small core of

00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:03,750
contributors if you see Federer as a lot

00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:06,990
as thousands of people register on task

00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:09,570
but the charm of paging we should have

00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:11,880
1000 something like that and if you

00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:14,309
dance eyes to the people who are doing

00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:17,910
that regularly it's let's its lesser

00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:21,570
than one one or two hundred and one or

00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:24,870
two hundred is quite optimistic so we

00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:27,120
want we want we want that the one the

00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:31,230
occasional picture spent the less time

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:34,890
doing is packages right the right way so

00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:37,650
I think that at this point also we have

00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:39,780
to see what are the task to implement

00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:44,090
that I think that we have to implement

00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:47,370
the this visa thing in our packaging I'm

00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:50,190
maybe a package level but I want it to

00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:52,600
be reusable by other tools depending on

00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:56,020
our package like

00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:58,810
10 huge or also Santos Santos package

00:23:56,020 --> 00:24:02,380
see because it's pretty much it would be

00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:04,870
pretty much the same yeah but I don't

00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:07,540
see it's very specific to Federer but no

00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:09,820
no well yeah five and six are always

00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:13,240
going to be difficult but salia yeah I i

00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:18,130
I'm speaking on future to me Santa sex

00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:20,350
is Hardy tool is well but but I don't

00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:22,930
want to make it mandatory so if people

00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:26,470
don't use it it won't bother them so

00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:29,710
anyway but we have this we also have to

00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:32,610
see with peril how it's going we need to

00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:36,640
have some nine spaces for packaging and

00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:38,830
managing patches actually the web and

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:42,370
your packages work is that it reduces

00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:46,750
our three remotes the origin which is

00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:50,620
diskette the patch the batch repository

00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:53,770
and the original upstream repository so

00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:56,890
it fetches all these origins and then it

00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:59,250
will it will update the patches against

00:24:56,890 --> 00:25:01,960
the upstream repository and then it will

00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:05,560
generate the patches in parameters get

00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:07,780
in one comment so it will generate a

00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:10,390
separate commit and then you and then

00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:13,210
you do your work of patching oh there is

00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:16,630
a very standardized changelog you may

00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:19,210
want to customize it or maybe you want

00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:21,580
to change some option but let's back at

00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:23,890
your work that's not the tool work the

00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:26,740
tool will be stream online what could be

00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:27,260
automated naughty readers also don't

00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:30,980
forget

00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:34,130
new hotness thing we have but yeah the

00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:36,080
Anita and the new hi careful man new

00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:38,090
hotness work that's the thing that

00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,710
automatically files bugs that there's

00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:43,160
going to do upstream lilies yeah and

00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:46,940
does builds for you of course all it

00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:50,410
knows how to do is run yeah said like

00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:53,810
Phil doesn't it doesn't know how to

00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:56,770
rebase patches and stuff yeah good yeah

00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:59,840
make it very interested in exactly

00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:02,000
theoretically it could commit the stuff

00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:05,630
on a branch and your package is ready

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,720
you know it merged branching and bush

00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:10,880
and if we had reliable see I can even

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:15,170
imagine in some cases it goes directly

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:20,830
to repository overuse or say worse yeah

00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:20,830
but it's to me well I'm kind of

00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:27,680
continuously generation pedantic person

00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:31,820
so if the CIA is not comprehensive I

00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:34,280
prefer to have some more testing so but

00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:36,920
if we had them if you had that we could

00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:39,920
generate package that installs deployed

00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:42,170
and then it could be tested at against

00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:44,630
States cases and it worse why not going

00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:49,150
to the repository anyway that's what

00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:49,150
testing he is for testing things

00:26:51,570 --> 00:27:00,040
yeah let's say I have baggage a part

00:26:57,270 --> 00:27:03,880
we'll save that for the dip recession so

00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:06,610
I have tarball and patched what what

00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:10,390
would be European the proper steps I

00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:13,330
think that if we would need some kind of

00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:16,860
convention to tell in this kit that yup

00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:19,630
your package will be managed through the

00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:22,570
Gateway so for instance we could have a

00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:25,540
file which which said set the flag and

00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:29,440
when you do fed package new sources

00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:31,810
uploading source to look as I catch you

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,730
you would be telling okay this package

00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:37,180
is managed bring it so i will upload the

00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:40,240
trouble and then automatically untag the

00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:44,590
trouble and version it into the source

00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:46,990
repository that's how debian works

00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:49,390
actually well not all group of severe

00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:51,490
but I've been contributed to Debbie on

00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:54,430
science and most of the packages manage

00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:57,910
get and by get a most of scientific

00:27:54,430 --> 00:28:00,280
package have no option git repository so

00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:03,060
basically all it yeah you're all you're

00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:05,230
checking is extracting the trouble

00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:08,200
initially so you will be creating a

00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:12,070
repository the next time you'll be extra

00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:14,620
nice the comet created by the extraction

00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:17,920
of turbo and recognize the patches and

00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:20,620
then it will it will extract the new

00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:24,570
travel crate and you commit and rebate

00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:27,419
the patches on top of that so

00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:29,730
if you fail you have to fix it yourself

00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:32,909
you always have to resolve conflicts so

00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:35,029
yeah well but well when it goes up there

00:28:32,909 --> 00:28:38,580
it will tell you these packages vero

00:28:35,029 --> 00:28:42,210
yeah i think that in first time it will

00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:44,669
try it locally and then upload it and if

00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:49,080
you are conflicts you have to solve it

00:28:44,669 --> 00:28:52,070
by hand I'm not yeah yeah you're worth

00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:55,799
roll again I understand we got this step

00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:58,289
yeah yeah I I understand that this kind

00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:59,940
of for food being not usual to everyone

00:28:58,289 --> 00:29:02,399
we need to discuss it explained because

00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:04,980
even for myself it was bit confusing the

00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:07,230
first time I tried it okay what was

00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:12,269
right way okay but it makes sense after

00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:14,310
I tried it so what's ya so keep sailing

00:29:12,269 --> 00:29:17,830
to waste

00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:21,430
yeah and say well this branch the file

00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:23,380
may change so much too good for people

00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:29,500
here and if you try to do the same with

00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:32,220
that are welcome here here you know yeah

00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:34,330
but you'd lose the functionality of

00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:37,360
testing if a patch has been already

00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:39,850
applied to observe sources but that is

00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:42,820
nothing but at least you do you'd won

00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:45,400
the way the easy rebasing and also you'd

00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:48,370
be able to track the changes of sources

00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:51,160
you could say oh I could generate a diff

00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:54,190
of the new and old sources we could add

00:29:51,160 --> 00:30:00,790
new features if we had get to manage our

00:29:54,190 --> 00:30:02,500
sources upstream and a patches and well

00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:04,390
the problem is that we could do a lot of

00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:08,560
thing but the tooling actually is not

00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:11,440
here but that's that's how are you here

00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:13,420
we are here to think about ahead of what

00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:17,920
would be doing and then implement the

00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:20,260
Tauri to do things for instance one of

00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:26,320
the interesting thing is that we are

00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:33,400
having the vasila project code review

00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:37,000
server and until last year it was just

00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:41,230
a project on few slides there was no

00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:44,110
code nothing just people saying okay the

00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:45,880
current review process is bit cumbersome

00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:49,420
because we use bugzilla which is not

00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:53,440
usable for that we built a process where

00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:56,080
trees which is in my own sense workflow

00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:58,690
wise pretty sane but the implementation

00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:01,150
songs so basically people say okay we

00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:05,890
will be implementing or the same

00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:08,590
workflow but in an adequate tool which

00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:10,900
is federal review server and then we

00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:16,900
will ship it but it didn't exist last

00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:21,910
year and pier and the only remember is

00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:27,220
nic teaming my sorry boss yeah saucony

00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:29,110
study / yeah last night yeah the problem

00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:35,470
is that I when I remember his nickname

00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:36,950
oh yes studies class yeah yeah yeahs it

00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:43,960
so cocky yes

00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:46,639
lastly if you see us Steyn that hmm but

00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:48,710
it didn't exist last year but

00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:50,720
represented the project and I to

00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:54,049
actually makes a maintenance so people

00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,970
started working on it and we even have a

00:31:54,049 --> 00:31:59,210
google Summer of Code working on the

00:31:55,970 --> 00:32:02,690
review server well it's not quite ready

00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:05,360
but it's moving forward and I hope by

00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:07,789
next Lok we would be able with never

00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:11,330
habit in production or at least in

00:32:07,789 --> 00:32:13,760
staging step so people could be able to

00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:15,889
test it and see if it works and it would

00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:19,010
solve so many problems but we didn't

00:32:15,889 --> 00:32:22,070
predict it when we have where last year

00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:24,860
not flop for instance Oh checking if

00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:26,630
they are duplicate reviews nobody spoke

00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:29,570
about that ever but now there is a

00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:31,880
future in forgive yourself but when you

00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:34,970
submit your review will check if there

00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:36,679
is a ver isn't a review civil already

00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:40,620
suggested proposed for miss penguin

00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:45,370
using bugs all for that for everybody

00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:47,350
yeah too slow and I mean even if it was

00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:49,510
fast it still would make any babies just

00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:51,940
the wrong format for that yeah everybody

00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:54,400
needs to pile on comments there needs to

00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:57,010
be a git repository of something where

00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:59,080
people can see I asked without me gone

00:32:57,010 --> 00:33:02,530
through and writing the review writing

00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:04,540
the package for the guys exactly and the

00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:06,880
more exciting thing is that would be

00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:10,390
able to collaborate on reviews actually

00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:12,370
it's kind of the mentor and the review

00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:14,680
EEE relation which is not good because

00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:16,840
okay it's fine for new packager because

00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:19,450
that's the way I learned that when you

00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:21,430
have an experienced painter we're not

00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:23,770
helping him in getting his review ready

00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:25,210
because we do so much faster and we

00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:27,790
decrease the queue and we could focus

00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:30,730
more time on the reviews that need more

00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:33,400
more eyeballs or helping new packages

00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:35,320
getting in because I don't want to do

00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:37,060
the bed the word for new picture for a

00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:39,820
single reason I want them to learn the

00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:41,860
hard way but you the current i'm here

00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:43,630
already i assume that they already know

00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:46,240
that stuff so I should be helping them

00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:49,420
and then get the package ready and

00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:51,790
that's all we should will sometimes I

00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:55,630
have a review and I had just a nitpick

00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:57,580
to channel right but since why can't i

00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:59,500
fix it directly i prove it because the

00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:01,720
guy would be waiting for month okay

00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:04,090
nobody's answer me and it would be

00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:06,400
solved it just because nobody answered

00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:10,030
it and if someone could just come in and

00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:13,120
fix it o.o prove the thing is i often

00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:14,620
have time to do some dry you know i'll

00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,570
go through and it's like oh I package

00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:17,179
people I need to fix this thing so but

00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:19,730
I'm

00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:21,919
spend the time to type up the entire

00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:24,770
thing and go through all of this when

00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:26,690
there's really no point in me doing yep

00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:28,659
whereas I could just get it that much

00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:32,059
closer to being done and at least

00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:33,859
something worth having yeah and the

00:34:32,059 --> 00:34:35,629
problem is that when it's nitpick

00:34:33,859 --> 00:34:38,270
sometimes when i tried the packager I

00:34:35,629 --> 00:34:41,210
just tell him fix it that important but

00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:43,790
I don't like it because I would prefer

00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:46,339
it to be fixed because I'm if I trust

00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:48,889
the person i'm not in in even in my case

00:34:46,339 --> 00:34:51,050
and not sure he will do it but I don't

00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:53,750
maybe not have the time to check

00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:57,260
everyone but when I told the person okay

00:34:53,750 --> 00:35:00,230
I trust you but sometimes I don't know

00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:02,660
the person so I prefer him to fix it and

00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:04,940
well if he's impacted a group I would

00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:10,640
assume that if I fix it it would apply

00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:13,819
it so some other parents only has a bit

00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:16,250
here yeah i like what i said only fixes

00:35:13,819 --> 00:35:18,740
and i approve the police

00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:21,170
yeah they have a bit paper sterling I

00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:23,720
was telling areas of bloody saying okay

00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:26,000
night you submitted in my thing like a

00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:29,810
day and then a month goes by and I'm

00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:32,570
like yeah I mean you got an able but

00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:35,330
nobody be is and the end and I can do it

00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:38,480
then I've had a couple of months goes by

00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:41,750
tonight who will not put in the new

00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:44,600
version of God knows you I'm sorry me

00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:46,880
because honestly I I'm responsible for a

00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:48,590
lot of two yeah sometimes I'll just go

00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,990
through and the others a thousand

00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:53,510
packages in there right now I don't you

00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:56,030
know i'll ping at all of them Leland

00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:59,900
sand and the probe is that some people

00:35:56,030 --> 00:36:02,420
peer you 24 reviews ok ok i will tell

00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:04,550
pew but what did you make some informal

00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:07,730
reviews ok start like that anyway

00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:10,520
because the problem is that okay people

00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:13,220
don't do it do it that's another topic

00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:16,250
on yeah restoration better let's keep on

00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:18,650
we are between package or so but the

00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:21,380
problem is that if you want the cue to

00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:23,900
decrease help I say even informal review

00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:25,490
how because when you explain someone

00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:28,220
that is some doing something wrong it

00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:30,470
will fix it and when thanks someone want

00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:34,490
to do the formal review let's work said

00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:36,950
later so just to inform or reviews yeah

00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:37,619
as long as the package is closer to

00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:39,509
being

00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:41,339
you don't exactly look at the session

00:36:39,509 --> 00:36:44,809
key now if people are just jump in the

00:36:41,339 --> 00:36:47,789
copper you're not even bother and that

00:36:44,809 --> 00:36:49,829
that's resident dress because that's a

00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:51,180
problem we're going on so you're right

00:36:49,829 --> 00:36:53,069
you're going to do this video review

00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:55,079
server if we're going to make it easier

00:36:53,069 --> 00:36:58,230
to maintain these things in a proper way

00:36:55,079 --> 00:37:00,210
yeah I think that for instance we have

00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:02,880
this tag Confederate veteran need

00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:04,799
sponsor which would have just a check

00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,440
box okay this guy is not see the package

00:37:04,799 --> 00:37:10,890
group you should go the full way yes and

00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:14,609
the other guy ok I'll go any package or

00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:16,759
proven vector to submit TXS or at least

00:37:14,609 --> 00:37:21,059
submit pull requests and work together

00:37:16,759 --> 00:37:23,789
but we need actually to simplify the

00:37:21,059 --> 00:37:26,220
process not by lowering the quality but

00:37:23,789 --> 00:37:31,710
allowing more collaborations that's the

00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:35,220
way yes yeah it one else to say yeah I

00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:39,310
love it sorry country like

00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:43,119
check this no well the other the other

00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:45,430
important thing about all of this is we

00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:49,150
still have this emphasis on in your

00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:52,210
package because your submitted it and

00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:56,020
you're going to maintain because all of

00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:58,660
the work for the review to getting the

00:37:56,020 --> 00:38:01,300
package in shape is on one person which

00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:02,680
is a submitter yeah when but all of a

00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:05,339
sudden it's supposed to become the

00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:08,859
community's business as soon as it's in

00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:10,810
even though that rarely happens it was

00:38:08,859 --> 00:38:13,930
the community's business as soon as it

00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:15,849
was submitted you don't have to change

00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:17,800
the culture as soon as somebody clicks

00:38:15,849 --> 00:38:20,320
the button and says okay now it's a

00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:22,089
community package exactly that says even

00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:25,650
one of the problem bugzilla you can

00:38:22,089 --> 00:38:27,849
change the reporter and or SEM script

00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:30,099
sometimes check with the reporter

00:38:27,849 --> 00:38:32,380
because if you do the CSC Marcus but you

00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:34,720
are not a reporter this creepy fight so

00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:37,990
you have to redo to have a new ticket

00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:39,849
you don't have to face but yeah we can

00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:42,790
fix it but actually that's not the

00:38:39,849 --> 00:38:45,700
priority so that's annoying I just had

00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:48,220
the cast last night oh I hey I submitted

00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:51,970
it owes its review start what we is ok I

00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:55,270
think the bank okay the process actually

00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:57,520
is that you close the ticket or because

00:38:55,270 --> 00:39:00,369
a ticket to be closed as tall and start

00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:02,859
a new one oh I'm losing time well then i

00:39:00,369 --> 00:39:04,430
can do otherwise because well especially

00:39:02,859 --> 00:39:06,080
when you have to wait a minute

00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:08,330
zillow to answer and I will apologize

00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:10,940
because I actually wrote that code that

00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:13,580
you're complaining about but there was

00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:16,610
no I mean you can ignore it but there's

00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:18,650
no real easy way to ya bugzilla doesn't

00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:21,170
let you change that just really the

00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:23,270
wrong tool for the job but actually

00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:25,580
understand it as a sanity check because

00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:29,180
you want to be sure that nobody else is

00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:31,130
doing this you know sm request but but

00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:33,230
since we can tell the reporter that's

00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:37,340
how bugzilla is made and it makes sense

00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:38,840
for that tracker yeah but furnace if

00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:41,810
your tracker it's completely different

00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:45,860
we want to be able to swap the review

00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:48,260
because okay you you know you not you

00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:50,120
don't have time to otay to do the

00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:52,640
process okay let someone else do it in

00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:55,550
any way we could add you later as an

00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:58,000
owner or chrome antenna so we don't care

00:39:55,550 --> 00:40:02,270
who is leading the process rightfully

00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:05,030
but that's the problem we need to fizzle

00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:08,300
tuning and find the things that people

00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:10,070
when we advise recurring devil or every

00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:12,350
time we speak about improving the

00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:14,330
process we're just saying we should draw

00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:16,400
guidelines we should although battling

00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:19,760
riders and that's not the right to

00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:21,350
expand that that's for an fec

00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:25,640
perspective everybody says well you

00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:27,800
should tell people how to do it but we

00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:29,330
can't I mean the document be a thousand

00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,250
pages long and you still have questions

00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:33,350
that come up there and you have to allow

00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:35,290
for common sense of their play out and

00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:38,300
you have to allow for people to disagree

00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:42,620
we have to make a choice it do want our

00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:45,530
quality or not so I think that we should

00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:48,200
improve collaboration and in the few

00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:51,680
cases where we can do it for like chrome

00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:54,860
maybe we should have it on the site as

00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:57,170
actually an improve integration from

00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:58,820
third-party project for instance copper

00:40:57,170 --> 00:41:01,290
is very lightweight maybe we could you

00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:04,500
prove copper to be something that is

00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:07,710
as good as Koji and venerable system and

00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:09,390
make and say to people ok we recommend

00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:13,380
such repository because we know that

00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:15,060
people maintaining them are our trusted

00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:16,770
for instance that the big data siga is

00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:18,840
having issues because they had a lot of

00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:21,420
burning libraries and if he had to agree

00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:25,170
through to the world process it would be

00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:27,360
impossible but even then agreed that we

00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:30,270
shouldn't be pushing such package into

00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:34,940
further but they have no way to do it on

00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:34,940
the side and say okay we are the federal

00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:49,440
it was I was proposing them to until the

00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:51,420
until we fix the situation to our to

00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,300
maintain a copper repository on the side

00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:56,610
because we that's awful I've been

00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:59,070
helping the people maintaining a do and

00:41:56,610 --> 00:42:01,860
very very doing an awesome job in

00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:04,530
unbanning libraries but it changed every

00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:08,910
minor releases yes it's impossible and

00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:10,980
at some point either we say okay we want

00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:14,820
you a white card for a limited set of

00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:16,530
package but the problem is but if we

00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:20,880
start doing that many people will be

00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:22,830
asking so i don't know maybe we I think

00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,900
that if we are doing that it should be

00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:27,450
only on strategic thing for instance

00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:29,520
let's say the cons sa ok we consider big

00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:31,710
data strategic so we will let the

00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:33,660
technical committee to define the

00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:38,730
limited set of package which are allowed

00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:41,810
or not or the other way would be ok go

00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:44,610
on copper we will advertise or repo as a

00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:47,480
semi-official ripple but that's not in

00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:50,970
federal ads on the site beside the wrong

00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:53,750
because that's the only way or oh if we

00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:56,600
allowed to push back and

00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:59,390
package with hazmat vanillin library

00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:01,910
would be encouraging people to do it and

00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:04,190
many people are sneaking already packed

00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:06,050
with Bernie libraries without checking

00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:09,850
the current exception it's hard to find

00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:13,100
yeah so a motorcycle produces and

00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:15,980
usually what what site rice or incest is

00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:19,700
to see okay without the library but are

00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:22,190
already allowed because like JavaScript

00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:25,160
which is hellish for the moment the

00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:27,170
mayor the popular libraries are have an

00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:29,240
exception most people don't know it so

00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:31,040
they don't bother packing up so it's all

00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:33,560
that okay if you are using such

00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:37,250
libraries you can do it but mention it

00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:38,960
right but when it is he live event let's

00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:42,380
see library it's very easy to buy the

00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:44,660
later do it okay new you might require

00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:48,140
some orbit and still easy compared to

00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:49,520
jada and I know that with Ruby you

00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:56,290
should have our time with the new

00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:56,290
libraries it's what I do

00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:04,600
my team that's working on over 15 years

00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:06,790
and I'll put this into our stuff and

00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:09,640
fedora and I put the entire stuff in an

00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:12,940
hour oh yeah here's this home is a big

00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:15,310
puzzle gender I think that they have a

00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:18,690
economy they put it under vendor and

00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:22,440
kidnapping do you know that assignment

00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:25,740
yeah oh and the problem we need to have

00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:27,780
consistent Garland and no and the

00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:30,450
program is that people are going it is

00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:34,079
often not understand that we people are

00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:36,569
not closing the discussion people you

00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:38,400
just have to find another path to reach

00:44:36,569 --> 00:44:41,369
your goal because most of the time the

00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:45,780
goal is agreed by me everyone okay we

00:44:41,369 --> 00:44:48,599
need to do to simplify reviews but yeah

00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:50,970
you know how that's the family work and

00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:53,280
people when you say no this way they

00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:57,359
don't understand low at all which is not

00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:59,579
the case and I know for instance people

00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:02,099
are frightened how the FPC because they

00:44:59,579 --> 00:45:04,140
say no but well have you spend time

00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:06,960
reading logs and understanding the point

00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:09,619
of view because what are saying is that

00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:11,849
they need more input for you from you or

00:45:09,619 --> 00:45:14,130
that you fix something you're talking

00:45:11,849 --> 00:45:15,420
about the reason yeah I would like it

00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:18,089
where code ones and I've forgotten

00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:20,010
already but yeah it's like somebody says

00:45:18,089 --> 00:45:24,119
we want to bundle this they didn't say

00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:26,270
why the little juice box okay but you

00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:26,270
