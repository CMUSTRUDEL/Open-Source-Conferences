	00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:14,309
okay so welcome to my presentation

00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:18,390
everyone and supposed to be about thumbs

00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:24,240
co and it's possible transition to fosco

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:29,310
or some similar thing our my name is ugh

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:34,140
man i'm still the chair of farms co even

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:37,649
though like yeah I'm really proud of

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:43,170
that I do I left you and that will go to

00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:46,440
someone else literally sooner so and why

00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:51,989
the fact is that the from school from

00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:54,750
skoo is dead nowadays like I still feel

00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:59,460
some expense ability so I am trying to

00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:02,039
maintain some level of activity so if we

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:05,640
have behaved any requests on anything

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:08,310
else to solve I'm dying to like die

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,700
spawn and stuff like that buddy the

00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:14,630
Funko itself is not active has not been

00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:18,330
active for several months already like

00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:21,780
all the people in France co have been

00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:25,049
saving in the body for like at least me

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:29,220
for the last day and half years we hear

00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:33,860
the guys it's quite similar and I i feel

00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:41,970
that most of us are kind of banged out

00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:44,729
from that so even if we decide to do

00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:47,310
keep tumko we will definitely need a lot

00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:48,899
of flood of new blood I don't think

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:53,329
there will be a lot of people from the

00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:53,329
current from scope that we're down for

00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:02,280
for for it again if we have any

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:04,969
elections like no drink at the beginning

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:08,970
of the dog I'd like to start with the

00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:12,270
task of Tom Scott what pops go is doing

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:15,600
now nowadays so if we have any any new

00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:24,810
body would re the task that the tasks

00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:33,000
the new body would have to take over so

00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:37,200
it's in in legal fees should be

00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,910
capitalized but whatever so far schoo is

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,590
for the federer bacilli sustained

00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:44,030
committee so which it's the idea

00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:49,890
merciless projects there to look at it

00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:56,959
big picture so fly directly the subject

00:02:49,890 --> 00:03:00,209
and so on it didn't le worked that way

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:02,220
before when I joined from school I'm

00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:05,160
going to talk about it a bit later on

00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:07,080
the slide what I'm going to talk about

00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,740
what has changed in the last two or

00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,740
three years

00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:21,079
yeah the thing is that when i joined

00:03:18,409 --> 00:03:23,480
commscope it was pretty much like we did

00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:27,099
mostly day-to-day business like we had

00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:30,379
we had to I pretty much every single

00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:34,099
expense ambassador States if someone

00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:36,859
wanted to buy our producers like for

00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:40,099
fifty dollars from ska had to vote about

00:03:36,859 --> 00:03:43,099
it and out of it so that's something we

00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:45,889
have changed but yeah it should be the

00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:49,909
the leadership of the at the front of

00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:52,639
ambassadors photo well it in the last

00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:55,099
couple of years it has also taken care

00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:57,829
of the original support budget so they

00:03:55,099 --> 00:04:02,810
every year we get we get money from I

00:03:57,829 --> 00:04:07,069
had found ourselves and we many we are

00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:10,730
trying to spell it in India Jensen's and

00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:13,250
spend it wisely so even though we have

00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:15,019
moved most of these two regions from

00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:17,150
skoo is the old boots though the body

00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:20,690
responsible for that and all those is

00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:23,079
that and we also responsible for Magda

00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:23,079
yep

00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:40,340
yes yeah we we wanted to keep like a

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:42,980
portion of that budget for some kind of

00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:46,820
like global initiatives or something

00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:49,640
like that and it didn't I really worked

00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:52,550
out or we didn't really have any like

00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:55,190
global initiatives it was always if we

00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:58,070
wanted to do something like the agents

00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:59,930
just took it and they allocated some of

00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:05,090
their budgets due to make it happen in

00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:07,310
the occasions here we also take care of

00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:09,110
the the membership an administration

00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:11,660
that also involves the mentorship

00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:14,210
program that the we have a gig of

00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:19,190
mentors that make sure that the people

00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:21,200
that become ambassadors are capable of

00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:27,170
doing that and know enough about the

00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:34,600
project and so on so we we still approve

00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:34,600
like new men tears we also are trying to

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:42,200
set the rules or at least Qaeda mentors

00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:45,560
how I what the new ambassador should

00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:50,300
should know and would you be he saw her

00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:54,440
profile we also saw soft escalations if

00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:57,860
we have if there are any problems in in

00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:01,520
agents and some conflicts it can always

00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:03,700
be raised to 2 from school fortunately

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:08,720
we have we haven't had such an issue for

00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:12,110
for a long time we also review events so

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:15,260
well if one of the agents want to

00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:18,650
organize federal activity day or for

00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:24,320
example fat a peg or like them they

00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:28,550
always go first to France CO and if if

00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:30,830
amsco likes delete like the choice of

00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:33,380
the Asian and I oppose it then they go

00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:36,190
to I suppose it it's you might be right

00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:36,190
about for now

00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:56,940
so like who gives the final i play will

00:06:47,790 --> 00:07:00,210
forfeit cons so yeah ok so now it's it's

00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:03,570
the control but there historically

00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:06,780
transco always Peggy pepper of that so

00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:12,419
they vary feel the debate and if it was

00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:16,110
okayed and we just formatted into a flp

00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:18,810
or now the console and poster also

00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:23,280
served as a coordination between between

00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:25,530
asians stead so there it was a place

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,320
where we discussed all kinds of

00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:32,340
activities and so that we can avoid in

00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:35,940
any things globally I did to work

00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:39,030
tightly well even actually when for

00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:41,430
example one region didn't have the

00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:44,250
representative in France co they was

00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:47,160
also always be no disconnection between

00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:50,010
the other l.i other regions and that

00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:54,750
asian so it definitely this is

00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:57,810
definitely an important function of farm

00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:59,610
scope to people from all allegiance can

00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:04,169
talk to each other or at least the air

00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:06,960
present bodies and it's also you are

00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:08,729
also trying to enable the the

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,460
collaboration with the rest of the

00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:15,120
project sometimes it was rather

00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:19,320
sometimes a bit rice so what has changed

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:23,690
him in France go in the last three years

00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:28,500
pretty much since I joined from scope in

00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:34,760
2012 so we we created a new system for

00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:39,419
for budgeting as I said before that of

00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:42,969
every single expense had to be approved

00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:45,790
by Falco

00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:51,459
we were busy just hyper by justifying

00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:56,949
the the tickets we didn't have enough

00:08:51,459 --> 00:09:01,779
time for like the more important debates

00:08:56,949 --> 00:09:03,519
and like steering the the sub-project so

00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:06,879
we moved take much all this to the

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:09,610
region's closer to contributors and I

00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:14,259
must say it has worked by Tavella like

00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:17,410
OD audience have picked up that task

00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:19,569
like pretty well at the beginning we set

00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:22,060
up some some general I was some

00:09:19,569 --> 00:09:24,939
boundaries like for example image like

00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:27,600
if the if there is an expense over two

00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:31,209
thousand dollars it still needs to go to

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:35,439
some school but otherwise it's all

00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:40,000
enhance of Ephesians and we just make

00:09:35,439 --> 00:09:46,689
sure that the money are that they also

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:50,829
said white so it and work so now

00:09:46,689 --> 00:09:54,269
nowadays the each stations that plan

00:09:50,829 --> 00:09:58,000
events and activities at least in in

00:09:54,269 --> 00:10:01,389
anemia and a peck we organized federal

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:05,800
activity day said like in December when

00:10:01,389 --> 00:10:08,430
we plan activities and events for the

00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:11,680
next year and it's always the base for

00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:14,889
the budget so then the region case the

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:19,360
budget and US census to from school and

00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:23,079
then from school puts it together as one

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:25,750
budget proposal and something to well

00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:29,709
historically it was always also if it's

00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:36,029
going to go through the council from now

00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:36,029
on then is canceled

00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:46,830
and we also gated a clear criteria to

00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:49,750
remove inactive ambassadors so I put

00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:53,140
it's not only remove it whatever it was

00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:55,660
all like alarmed and heated discussion

00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:59,610
over that and it depends laser very

00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:02,830
sensitive topic for for many people like

00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:06,070
Amber selects complained for years that

00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:09,040
we don't really have any any process how

00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:10,510
to remove in FDI ambassadors and then

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,020
there are countries that have for

00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:18,790
example 10 or 15 ambassadors and maybe

00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:21,670
two out of them are active and it then

00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:24,640
it confusing for for users or contact

00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:26,410
with Testament they want to contact an

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:30,910
ambassador from that camp they and they

00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:33,880
then 35 ambassadors and none of them

00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:37,870
nice forms because he didn't pick one of

00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:41,590
those two so we wanted to find a way how

00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:44,550
to clear the list of ambassadors on the

00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:48,690
other hand there was a big push back on

00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:53,070
removing ambassadors completely from

00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:56,800
from the Gulf of ambassadors so then we

00:11:53,070 --> 00:12:00,130
came to a consensus that we don't Nelly

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,900
remove ambassadors completely thing from

00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:06,340
a group through there was also like a

00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:09,010
specific question if the the status of

00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:11,080
federal bossa degrees for a lifetime so

00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:15,100
once you get a do you have it for other

00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:17,650
hoy it's if it has some conditions and

00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:22,600
you need to be active and do something

00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:25,360
to have the status of ambassador in d in

00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:28,090
the end we decided that it's the

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,850
consensus that it's for its for lifetime

00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:35,770
on the other hand to create the list of

00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:40,180
ambassadors we silicate area and if the

00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:42,760
Ambassador doesn't meet them then we fly

00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:44,620
him as inactive and he's a mobster on

00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,500
the list on the other hand is still in

00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:51,940
the goop and

00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:55,210
he or she feels that he wants to

00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:58,390
contribute again then they just need to

00:12:55,210 --> 00:13:03,220
go to first account and switch the flag

00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:07,050
back to to active it actually we managed

00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:10,120
to clear the list quite a bit I think

00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:15,190
you're saying their account to inactive

00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:21,340
for you I think that the fuss account is

00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:23,250
like the selector fight yeah maybe it

00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:25,930
sounds like you saw has already low

00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:28,420
Apache gets around us by having an

00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:31,330
emeritus thing rather than saying

00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:33,190
enacted basically just say like if you

00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,860
have reached a point we just i left i

00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:37,690
have to contribute you know we want to

00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:39,870
recognize that you have a premiere you

00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,870
have

00:13:40,109 --> 00:13:59,049
do they what they was there was a big

00:13:44,199 --> 00:14:02,849
push back you really only have to say

00:13:59,049 --> 00:14:02,849
hey my day job

00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:16,340
yeah the lot of people argue that it's

00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:19,000
slightly difficult to measure the

00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:21,890
activity or federal masada someone

00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,140
doesn't have to be active on mailing

00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:26,840
list so if you for example fear from a

00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:29,060
different country you know nothing about

00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:32,720
his activity but he still could be

00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:35,750
active locally like organizing local

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:39,620
events just not deporting about them and

00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:41,990
stuff so the consensus will state that

00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:46,040
it's really hard to measure the activity

00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:50,390
of federal Masada so we we can tell a

00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:52,880
judge that so we don't really want to

00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:55,400
remove them like really completely dead

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:58,400
the main issue work with which we call

00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:01,760
it just disappear without saying a word

00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:05,870
you just needed to get out of them but

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:07,520
yeah people argue that it's it's not

00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:09,680
factor you move them like completely

00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:11,930
from the go so the consensus is that we

00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,510
they are stealing the go but they are

00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:16,400
not publicly visible for so it pretty

00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:22,070
much solves the original the original

00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:25,180
issue and it's still like it's okay for

00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:29,480
people that were not fine with a moving

00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:32,810
then completely and we also we also

00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:37,490
wanted to have the deck idea being

00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:40,610
independent on someone's decisions

00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:44,360
because historically for example d the

00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:47,270
Indian community just made a list of

00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:50,090
inactive ambassadors and those were like

00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:54,110
I moved I know kousha was not extremely

00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:57,170
happy about our solution but yeah it was

00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:59,150
also one of the objectives people had

00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:01,370
that they didn't really want to have

00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:04,220
this process be dependent on someone's

00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:06,620
decision you know which days for example

00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:08,930
you know fighter with different guru

00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:11,570
Sunday with like per post each other you

00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:13,139
know to be a move that whatever so this

00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:17,069
is this is like very much

00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:20,389
and then no no langar do know exactly

00:16:17,069 --> 00:16:23,249
what adida criteria are I think it's the

00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:32,569
the adversary needs to be inactive for

00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:32,569
18 the online activity it's like

00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:51,280
it's so it's it's a latest to move

00:16:48,430 --> 00:17:00,070
people that are like not interested in

00:16:51,280 --> 00:17:02,650
federal at all anymore but let's get two

00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:06,040
for school which is supposed to be

00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:09,760
federal outage steering committee which

00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:14,500
was proposed by Matthew like 10 months

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:17,800
ago so he proposed it in in from Scott

00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:20,860
egg that we could actually like think

00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:26,199
about this and to have this new body and

00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:29,650
may potentially a place farms go with it

00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:32,950
and I actually found it a good idea

00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:35,380
because the song school has a gender

00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:39,300
that definitely goes beyond boundaries

00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:43,630
of ambassadors for example ii that we

00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:45,970
manage the original support budget that

00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:50,280
this budget is not meant just for

00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:54,070
ambassadors but for historic reasons

00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:56,380
because it's mostly ambassadors who

00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:58,960
managed the budget and organize events

00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:02,020
like activities that actually have some

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,690
the Sun budgets and need some some

00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:06,400
funding so it was always mostly related

00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:10,500
to ambassadors and add a goose didn't

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:12,790
have that much time to do all this on

00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:15,790
the other hand we don't really want to

00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:19,510
exclude anyone else so we like to like

00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:22,480
be inclusive in these and invite other

00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:25,270
groups in federal actually participate

00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,630
in this as well so for me it was a good

00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:31,680
idea that this we could get a body that

00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:33,410
can can include other groups in and

00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:37,160
involve them in

00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:39,530
the process is ambassadors have been

00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:44,030
doing almost exclusively in the last

00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:46,460
couple of years and frankly after the

00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:49,340
changes we have made I don't think

00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:52,730
ambassadors need their own steering

00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:56,480
committee and we have moved so much

00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:59,540
agent the agent and it clearly it has

00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:02,030
really worked pretty well that I think

00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:06,470
the leaf guard or the valley would have

00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:10,010
capacity to oversee other sub projects

00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:13,580
as well and she'll committee will

00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:18,710
definitely support collaboration as we

00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:23,900
could see even in France CO 11 body and

00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:27,590
like type like regular meetings early

00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:29,870
help coordinating stuff at least it

00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:33,040
worked for for dejan so I'm pretty sure

00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:35,750
it could also work for example for

00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:38,840
coordination between ambassadors

00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:46,760
marketing design and so on so we only

00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:51,130
like this idea on the other hand we

00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:54,710
haven't moved that far from from Dan and

00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:59,260
this when I like to start the discussion

00:19:54,710 --> 00:20:02,540
because I got a couple of open questions

00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:06,230
so shoot for school be an additional

00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:10,580
body like should we keep from schoo and

00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:13,160
then just get another body above there

00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:15,500
that would oversee ambassadors and from

00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:19,070
school and other groups like my my

00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:25,670
opinion is we shouldn't like we should

00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:28,610
have as a few bodies as possible in my

00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:32,450
opinion and just the like solving

00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:33,480
problems like gating newman new bodies

00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:37,590
is

00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:41,190
communities is not a good way to go for

00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:45,150
me at least so easy if we decide for

00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:47,100
something like Fosco would add I think

00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:55,080
it should definitely replace from school

00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:57,929
like what should be its agenda it should

00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:00,780
be community operations that's what from

00:20:57,929 --> 00:21:05,040
school mostly did or should it be outage

00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:09,210
activities and daily like gating methods

00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:13,350
for those activities daily focusing on

00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:15,600
the outside one thing i had my word

00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:18,919
outrage here originally i was thinking

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,919
you in a very general broad

00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:27,960
after that I agree that we often have

00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:31,650
the connotation of specific diversity

00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:37,800
outreach so there's good reasons to the

00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:39,330
point that name here for using but when

00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:43,080
I talk about outreach originally this I

00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:44,580
really just meant something all the

00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,140
activities like the ambassadors in

00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:58,470
marketing and things that could go

00:21:46,140 --> 00:22:01,380
outside there was because we we have had

00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:04,230
like two or three IRC me things about

00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:07,440
this and I could see that they were

00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:13,140
definitely different views on days that

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:15,180
some people understood it as yeah the

00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:18,990
outage thing that we should really

00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:21,930
focused on the like engaging people from

00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:24,930
the outside and so on and some some

00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:28,740
people at least understood it as like a

00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:31,680
placement for Tomsk Oh mostly and a body

00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:36,900
would that would take over the ADA at

00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:38,970
the kind agent of tomsk oh yeah so

00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:42,390
that's definitely a good topic for

00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:44,670
discussion and also what's up project

00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:46,500
should it over fee because like

00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:50,310
originally I think we meant the

00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:54,450
ambassador's marketing design but then

00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:58,050
there may also Purple's like other by a

00:22:54,450 --> 00:23:02,330
sub projects like documentation I think

00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:02,330
there was pretty long list the names

00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:09,170
here is that we end up with everything

00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:11,810
that's not under fresco under this so

00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:14,529
that everything has a nice orderly place

00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:17,389
to connect up to

00:23:14,529 --> 00:23:19,249
nautica media control five but just a

00:23:17,389 --> 00:23:23,980
place where it plugs into a tree rather

00:23:19,249 --> 00:23:23,980
rather than having a disparate nationals

00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:35,250
really out really great documentation

00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:40,620
that thats out like too many of the

00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:46,130
outreach e styles yeah magazine every

00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:48,390
key i will just greer that marketing

00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:52,640
medicines the first thing much more

00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:55,980
successful to getting some to the door

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:58,169
yeah but why a CSS are they don't

00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:00,659
writing system it's the first thing well

00:23:58,169 --> 00:24:03,809
now i see it like today it's probably

00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:06,620
over so goes when I talk to people on

00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:09,779
whitey you saw this notion of it Vidura

00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:13,380
one of the most common answer is I have

00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:21,419
to do something I did a google search we

00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:23,190
would do dimension so I that's why we

00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:25,380
give you good for me it's a cloud

00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:29,600
apartment it's a lot of a product no

00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:29,600
yeah outreach is getting someone

00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:38,039
luteal is this definite like firm is

00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:42,090
also a guy zone that it's definitely out

00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:44,789
tied to the product Oh load on the other

00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:58,169
hand it's slowly connected to the outer

00:24:44,789 --> 00:25:01,139
chart like ambassador this together yeah

00:24:58,169 --> 00:25:07,470
it's part of the product not the message

00:25:01,139 --> 00:25:11,039
like it's like having to have leaked

00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:15,740
magnavox more in the best sense that

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:15,740
dogs fits with marketing

00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:24,490
group in internal collaboration users

00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:27,490
very contact you talk about the

00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:29,910
ambassador and marketing how they

00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:32,980
featured the main of the distribution

00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:35,680
come on coordinate that having good user

00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:37,720
experience and we have your ambassadors

00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,919
saying here the awesome new things for

00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:41,440
the door

00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:44,859
party people pushing those features and

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:49,090
they have docs so that was fights on

00:25:44,859 --> 00:25:51,359
that book being a high ground so that's

00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:51,359
where that

00:25:52,220 --> 00:26:00,120
like governance group my my concern that

00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:02,330
this has been made that kind of

00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,330
collaboration

00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:09,470
and it makes more sense to have

00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:11,340
individuals driving for that time with

00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:16,230
collaboration between different groups

00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:19,220
and then it can build up organizational

00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:19,220
structure to support

00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:30,530
so I might contradict that design team a

00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:32,640
lot of times we get 40 wouldn't it be

00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:35,460
awesome if we have this

00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:38,340
this gets dumped on our lap there's no

00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:42,270
direction there's no copy there's no

00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:45,360
like higher-level plan to it it's just

00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:48,690
like oh I gotta be cool the precal a

00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:52,110
thousand for granted stocks and there's

00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:54,030
nobody like at a position to say it's

00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:57,030
your brain and socks something to help

00:26:54,030 --> 00:27:01,080
us that's something that people want is

00:26:57,030 --> 00:27:05,370
that like no there's no like red for

00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:07,590
life there's no like thesis to like this

00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:09,930
is this larger effort of trying to put

00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:11,880
forth because there are socks supports

00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:14,700
it because it plugs into that system

00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:18,030
it's not it's just like you said organic

00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:19,620
it's very ad hoc and the problem that we

00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:21,810
have when the design team is we get

00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:24,210
receive them all coming in and we're

00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:27,570
just like let's ski I can make up adoro

00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:29,850
sock where I can work on your website or

00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:32,670
i can work on the product it's more

00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:38,760
important you don't have any guidance to

00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:39,440
paradise things at that point why we get

00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:43,290
the

00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:46,530
socks and we're like well and discursive

00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:50,400
at all and I tried it on that it is

00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:54,900
because sometimes door shut design and

00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:57,180
you look like great and a lot of times

00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:59,220
it's just someone thinks it's a good or

00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:01,590
show and they're not involved in that

00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:04,170
mess and it's not a way to sort of add a

00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:05,760
pass account at its hotmail this is why

00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:09,270
i have a question the division between

00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:12,120
design marketing part because I don't

00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:15,090
generally enjoy in your garage anybody

00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:16,590
in design and there's not a lot of cross

00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:18,420
communication that you would think those

00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:21,150
two groups would actually be talking a

00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:23,680
lot and that doesn't happen and the same

00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:27,070
thing with

00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:30,330
yeah five years there's not a lot so

00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:33,460
like I believe life isn't like design

00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:35,820
yeah it's because we do a lot of other

00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:39,420
stuff other than rocketing collateral

00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:43,960
okay go back one second point the things

00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:45,520
about that idea individuals that that

00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,070
organic thing and individuals for

00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,990
cooperating

00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:50,940
good work really well when we have

00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:54,000
strong people in those positions where

00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:56,580
the things I worry about is if you have

00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,980
some sort of structures there and that

00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:02,009
person goes on other things are busy for

00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:06,480
that release the structures make the

00:29:02,009 --> 00:29:08,580
vacuum obvious it's just people based we

00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,610
noticed the vacuum three months later

00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:14,130
were like oh great nobody did that who

00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:19,740
is doing that oh my goodness you're a

00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:22,679
slob is doing so much work for them and

00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:26,730
so having those things a little more

00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:28,350
formalized and I hope that you and I

00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:30,419
really see the appeal what you're saying

00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:36,470
about meta you know what we don't want

00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:36,470
to have bureaucracy firm things

00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:44,650
the other side that concern was after he

00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:44,650
posted

00:29:48,490 --> 00:30:07,260
work

00:29:50,490 --> 00:30:10,950
I mean you know if like people get very

00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:13,140
enthusiast leg hops step in this place

00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:15,420
on the ego hippies so it kind of hurts

00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:45,660
me eternally because it's like what

00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:49,170
happened so for for me following this

00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:50,820
conversation for a while I've been here

00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:53,580
for a minute but I still feel pretty new

00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:55,350
I'm still start a new pieces of treasure

00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:58,350
troves info

00:30:55,350 --> 00:31:01,230
every week and the thing I think here

00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:03,030
it's important is that everybody assumes

00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:04,980
that because we're faust community

00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:08,100
community is everyone's responsibility

00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:10,890
and it's not responsible just like the

00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:12,690
wiki is there's no dedicated team that

00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:15,150
finds that common thing that everyone

00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:18,539
needs to do which is messaging or

00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:20,549
outreach and that's just that set of

00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:22,559
people's priorities it's up to the docs

00:31:20,549 --> 00:31:24,240
to talk to the people in their teams and

00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:27,690
it's up to the design people talk to

00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:29,610
their team to that because community is

00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:33,240
everyone's responsibility its enormous

00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:36,059
responsibility so codifying it into

00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,770
something that is a manifestation where

00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:39,480
people can point back to is important

00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:41,700
and something that we haven't tried to

00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,830
do ambassadors has been carrying that

00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:45,510
torch we're really long time with it's

00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:47,280
like all the stuff falls under

00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:48,690
ambassadors and everything that is words

00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,159
that gets printed out stuff falls in the

00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:53,130
marketing and everything that's visual

00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:55,840
falls onto design but like there isn't a

00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:58,570
coordinating body between all because

00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,340
what he thinks each one of those sidles

00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:02,340
does is one thing and then we have is

00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:05,740
just salt they come back doesn't our

00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:09,130
overarching plan like this is correct my

00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:12,549
stuff it's it's the opposite analysis in

00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:15,400
prospect I think it lacks the home

00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:18,820
because it's not her as no this is what

00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:23,740
what we're going to try to push but this

00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:26,200
is where we this is the plan for like in

00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:29,440
a container we just sort of write

00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:32,230
articles if we had some sort of plan

00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,600
about day this is like and it ties into

00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:36,700
the project plan entirely but it sort of

00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:40,090
tad over that for the average and then

00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:44,679
we use that as a guide or like but then

00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:47,700
it's like it comes to actual a committee

00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:51,399
or it could just be a brutal effective

00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:55,080
and that way when something comes up old

00:32:51,399 --> 00:32:55,080
habits apply and

00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:04,450
then there I would completely okay with

00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:11,320
that it was supposed to be about

00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:16,180
discussion foundation for outreach yeah

00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:23,110
maybe the whole tuple one is a messaging

00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:24,490
body it becomes much clearer and the

00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:25,870
second pieces that gives it better

00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:28,150
definition one of the things I was

00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:31,690
hearing in your definition was it's kind

00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:33,820
of a jumble is everything there's not in

00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:36,490
this other group it's not a defined

00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:38,290
collection of things and so you're going

00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:40,960
to line up the screw driver sitting next

00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:43,060
to the knives and forks and this works

00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:49,090
like on board here all right you're

00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:51,280
right dad yep few more slides ya got one

00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:55,360
more and well the digital last question

00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:57,640
is it wasn't meant to be 44 I me but

00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:59,500
let's let's do it at the beginning at

00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:02,410
the end for example because I got one

00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:04,600
more slide it was pretty much a proposal

00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:08,070
for how woody the body should be

00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:11,440
structured from from from school

00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:15,429
actually came we would have witness with

00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:20,380
that first and then case though we had

00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:23,850
spoken so it was almost identical so how

00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:27,910
we see it from the point of view bansko

00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:30,250
the fosco block whatever it's going to

00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:35,770
be should take over the agent of from

00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:39,760
school is probably now and then build on

00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:42,540
that like when you really need to like

00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:45,540
we can't have any vacuum after like

00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:50,410
discontinuing from school because really

00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:53,140
the the budget we oversee nowadays is

00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:56,230
like I know almost a hundred thousand

00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:59,500
dollars and we only have the destructors

00:34:56,230 --> 00:35:01,420
very well designed and working so we

00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:05,140
can't just leave it in

00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:09,220
q so the new body would definitely have

00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:11,319
to take over this and then well we can

00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:14,559
figure out you know what to do what to

00:35:11,319 --> 00:35:17,619
include in the Indigo like my my

00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:19,660
proposal in my opinion is that visa we

00:35:17,619 --> 00:35:22,540
should start with ambassadors marketing

00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:25,839
and design because those fake herbs I

00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:32,349
think are the obvious target for this

00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:34,869
and then again as it grows we can well

00:35:32,349 --> 00:35:38,380
if it makes sense you too for example

00:35:34,869 --> 00:35:42,839
include another sub project because we

00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:47,530
feel that some coordination with them is

00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:51,190
necessary then we can again of work on

00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:53,890
that but I like styling with something

00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:57,670
like let's include everything that is

00:35:53,890 --> 00:36:02,109
not on the fresco I think it's a bit too

00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:03,609
vague plan for for for the beginning so

00:36:02,109 --> 00:36:06,130
which is really better to start with

00:36:03,609 --> 00:36:11,920
with something smaller and then add and

00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:14,380
the structure pretty much we get like at

00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:17,230
least I and paste of the gate on that we

00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:21,690
should move from like completely elected

00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:25,089
body to more like a pointed mind s

00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:29,200
something similar to the council because

00:36:25,089 --> 00:36:31,329
firstly i really like democracy but i

00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:35,619
don't think is that the best model like

00:36:31,329 --> 00:36:38,770
in the elections like people people vote

00:36:35,619 --> 00:36:42,099
and they and most of them know very

00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:46,079
little about the candidate this way

00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:46,079
democracy in voting

00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:57,060
yeah so they like the idea with with

00:36:54,090 --> 00:37:02,640
concealed it moved from like elections

00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:05,700
to had appointed members that are like

00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:10,380
the directive in that area of expertise

00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:13,250
is definitely something I like so our

00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:16,920
our proposal was to have four

00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:19,710
representatives from the agents because

00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:21,810
we feel we feel that it's really

00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:26,010
necessary to keep the coordination

00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:28,770
between divisions because agents have

00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:32,910
their own own budgets but we still need

00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:35,520
to make sure that they are doing the

00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:38,460
same thing from the strategic point of

00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:41,520
view they are not by reducing completely

00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:45,030
different swag that is like completely

00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:50,100
out of our strategy like Pedroia talked

00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:52,080
so whatever and also we we saw it in in

00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:53,850
France code that if one of the agents

00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:56,370
was missing them then there was

00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:58,920
immediately a disconnection between like

00:37:56,370 --> 00:38:02,030
farm scored some overall strategy and

00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:05,300
what dead agent was doing so having

00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:08,700
representatives from the agencies I

00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:09,930
think pretty important and I didn't

00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:13,110
really want to put their like

00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:16,290
representatives of federal ambassadors

00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:19,590
like a general community superb a

00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:22,140
solaris because I think we we should

00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:26,700
early shift from the Ambassador donating

00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:28,500
to more inclusive like let's say give of

00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:32,040
computer so I think it should be I

00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:35,510
resent that if of contributors in that

00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:38,220
agent and even if we if we switch from

00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:40,920
farms go to something else I think even

00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:44,550
the processes should be changed the way

00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:47,910
that other other contributors can

00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:50,580
participate in the decisions expensive

00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:53,280
the rules and so on because I know it's

00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:55,530
mostly all agents set up that just

00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,470
ambassador vote and just ambassador said

00:38:55,530 --> 00:39:00,970
and the regional meetings and stuff

00:38:57,470 --> 00:39:04,280
good and then we should also have

00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:06,170
representatives from other groups like

00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:09,859
design marketing so that we can ensure

00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:14,750
some coordination with those groups and

00:39:09,859 --> 00:39:19,880
then yet we could have also like one or

00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:23,420
two seats elected their thing a body or

00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:26,150
with like seven members that died sighs

00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:29,270
I don't know we want to have a gap that

00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:32,660
has for example 50 people or something

00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:35,510
like that I still would like to keep it

00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:38,540
that a small go but it's it's really

00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:41,090
hard to discussion if we ink for example

00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:46,240
include more more groups like Thailand

00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:46,240
it would possibly a clan or more members

00:39:50,140 --> 00:40:01,150
so I thinking like magazine is part of

00:39:53,540 --> 00:40:01,150
these if it isn't is not legs

00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:56,000
yeah ambassadors are typically much a

00:40:54,020 --> 00:41:00,650
tool for for marketing years are the

00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:04,060
people that go to well it's it is maybe

00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:04,060
wrote that book nicely

00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:14,680
you know we're my materials at and

00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:17,490
that's pretty much their interaction

00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:21,640
with marketing has satellite that's

00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:23,470
great you know you know like AI don't

00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:25,809
know exactly what you're looking for me

00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:29,170
it's great that you have thing Tuesday

00:41:25,809 --> 00:41:32,319
it's Monday and left now you know so I

00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:37,920
mean you're definitely soon we have a

00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:41,559
lot of work and I concern I know

00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:46,119
transitioning from hospital but having

00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:51,609
four reps from ambassadors marketing

00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:56,690
room the one random and nothing

00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:59,750
specifically from dots translators

00:41:56,690 --> 00:42:01,430
I think it's the way what I want to

00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:03,920
emphasize this that I really want to

00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:07,069
move from the ambassador's only thing to

00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:09,349
earlier now multiple a lot of those

00:42:07,069 --> 00:42:12,380
activities are done there in the agents

00:42:09,349 --> 00:42:14,420
and what I want and I mostly done by

00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:17,960
ambassadors whatever I'd like to change

00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:20,750
he says it really include other

00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:23,089
contributors as well and then it doesn't

00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:24,380
have to be very pleasant that people

00:42:23,089 --> 00:42:26,329
today Geum doesn't have to be an

00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:30,740
ambassador it could be a person who is

00:42:26,329 --> 00:42:36,109
mostly active in design or marketing and

00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:38,510
so on but it's yeah it's a purpose of

00:42:36,109 --> 00:42:42,619
home from school we we see the problem

00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:44,750
mostly you know to to solve what pumps

00:42:42,619 --> 00:42:46,730
go take over what home schools doing I

00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:57,560
Betty sure that they're definitely more

00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:58,790
stakeholders they're trying to increase

00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:02,010
it

00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:05,310
collaboration between these groups that

00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:08,700
sports whatever we come up into that

00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:12,390
that's the goal look like so even if the

00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:14,940
Brutes say a movement of hot weather now

00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:20,250
whether I one of people from each group

00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:24,589
and do that is to learn how come gold

00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:27,930
the overall branding strategy and common

00:43:24,589 --> 00:43:32,430
actual exam eager things it would have

00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:35,609
to be talking about yes hussey's tuple I

00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:38,599
want one once every budget because

00:43:35,609 --> 00:43:41,400
that's what wiii happen one that is

00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:44,300
unless you have a member of two teams

00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:47,130
like mocking and designs and maybe then

00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:50,160
is how collaboration

00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:52,620
we'll get to both members of the groups

00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:57,180
that sort of get together and soul

00:43:52,620 --> 00:44:01,290
together about the yep putting that's

00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:06,780
the problem way that's the way to come

00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:11,490
up with so I had a lot of thoughts rigs

00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:13,830
out is cool but that I don't hear some

00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:20,160
popular but i'm happy to say and then

00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:21,930
our country should drop this the cops

00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:25,830
question I'm giving the letting talk

00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:28,560
tomorrow before 30 me about cops so

00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:31,980
should our boss home so that's what

00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:33,870
we're going to talk about I have this

00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:36,200
right right well that's that's the deal

00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:39,330
right is like we're we're still there's

00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:42,530
three different contracts either way one

00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:45,960
is that governance bodies that are

00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:49,890
elected versus appointed and doing you

00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:52,530
know how do you do the how do you

00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:53,730
transfer the responsibility when people

00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:55,740
move in and out of a volunteer project

00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:57,270
and how do you make decisions we have a

00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:59,730
massive base of people too

00:44:57,270 --> 00:45:01,410
decide things the second one is that

00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:02,640
outreach is a little turned it means a

00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:06,720
lot of different they surviving for

00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:08,760
people and the third one is that the

00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:11,450
work that needs to be done is the kind

00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:14,340
of work that is a heterogeneous

00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:15,810
contribution right this is mostly there

00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:17,430
are a lot of developers in the community

00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:19,110
and when they share their contributions

00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:21,780
a bunch of each other it's a homogenous

00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:24,600
experience it's the tools the traffic's

00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:26,790
it it's all the dev tools that we're as

00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:28,980
a contribution in design it's very

00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:30,870
different than the contra marketing is

00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:33,420
you can differ so figuring out how to

00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:36,030
coordinate para Regina's contributions

00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:37,830
is going to require a bigger tent and a

00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:40,080
different kind of strategy and new kinds

00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:42,480
of contributors that are hybrids and

00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:44,700
that is going to take a new focus and

00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,890
there's a lot of stuff that has been

00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:49,140
piled from this discussion and other

00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:51,540
discussions of marketing that it Thomas

00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:54,690
is going to attempt to solving is going

00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:55,940
to need a lot of so i will drop as much

00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:58,580
as i can in a luggin

00:45:55,940 --> 00:46:00,110
if you check the link in IRC there's a

00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:02,150
wiki page where we start to lay out

00:46:00,110 --> 00:46:03,980
everybody's priorities week on and

00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:05,540
started talking about the stuff and the

00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:10,070
issue areas you want to tackle things

00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:12,830
you already have a separate group this

00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:14,150
the idea is the the fundamental thing is

00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:16,570
you don't want people to choose between

00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:19,960
building things and building communities

00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:21,980
so the same way that DevOps is

00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:23,780
instrumenting and automating and

00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:26,180
integrating you want to do that in your

00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:27,680
community to so you don't want someone

00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:30,020
who is developing a project to have to

00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:32,390
choose between developing it or writing

00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:34,400
the blog post agree more people talk so

00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:36,680
integrating into the existing fedora

00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,810
structured as best as you can creating

00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:40,970
is frictionless of a system as possible

00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:43,280
leveraging stuff like fed message which

00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:44,960
is an amazing piece of infrastructure it

00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:47,210
creates this huge layer across the

00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,800
entire project of all the activity we're

00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:51,710
just starting to analyze and figure it

00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:54,530
out but from that we can also publish it

00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:56,390
great if two key concepts is heat and

00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:57,980
light you want to repeat to the parts of

00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:59,270
the project we need development they are

00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:00,930
bring light to the stuff that's already

00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:05,300
happening so that you can bring

00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:07,589
so I'm very interested in these things

00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:09,809
I'm looking forward to doing more with

00:47:07,589 --> 00:47:12,390
it's still very new who is still

00:47:09,809 --> 00:47:15,650
figuring it out and looking forward to

00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:15,650
getting more important

00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:47,780
I think we can stir something like is

00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:56,420
the last day for there we can we can

00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:59,980
definitely yeah meet again may be the

00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:59,980
