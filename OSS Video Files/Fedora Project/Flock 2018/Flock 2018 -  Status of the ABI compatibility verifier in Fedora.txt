Talk: Status of the ABI compatibility verifier in Fedora
Presenters: Dodji Seketeli, Sinny Kumari

Description: The Fedora package update process promotes ABI compatibility
of many critical path packages which contain C and C++ ELF shared
libraries. This compatibility is enforced by statically analysing
each package update in its binary form. At the moment, the result of
that analysis has an informative value for each package maintainer.

In this talk we present the current status of the Libabigail static
analysis framework used to enforce ABI compatibility in Fedora. Some
of the most recent developments are highlighted and their possible use
to improve the Fedora ABI verification process are considered.

The talk also intends to foster some needed discussions about how we,
as a community, want to use ABI compatibility analysis in the gating
process of Fedora package updates.
