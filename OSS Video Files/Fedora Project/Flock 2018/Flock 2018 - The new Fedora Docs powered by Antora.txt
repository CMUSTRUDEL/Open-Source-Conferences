Presenters: Adam Samalik

Description:  Tweet Share
I’m pleased to introduce the new documentation site in Fedora powered by a new build engine, Antora. Simplifying contributions, building, publishing, and even enabling local preview on multiple platforms. Come and learn about all the happy things we have in Fedora Docs, including:
* The core Antora concepts
* Contributing to Fedora Docs using PR-based workflows and CI
* Moving your team/WG/SIG’s documentation to Fedora Docs for better discoverability
* The future, roadmap, ideas
