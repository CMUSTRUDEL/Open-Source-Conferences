Talk: The new Fedora Docs powered by Antora
Presenters: Adam Samalik

Description:  Tweet Share
I’m pleased to introduce the new documentation site in Fedora powered by a new build engine, Antora. Simplifying contributions, building, publishing, and even enabling local preview on multiple platforms. Come and learn about all the happy things we have in Fedora Docs, including:
* The core Antora concepts
* Contributing to Fedora Docs using PR-based workflows and CI
* Moving your team/WG/SIG’s documentation to Fedora Docs for better discoverability
* The future, roadmap, ideas

hello everyone I guess we can start Oh

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:15,960
thanks Brian so my name is Adam Shah

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,560
Malik and I work on the federal docs

00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,420
which we get out last week and many

00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,130
thanks to Brian Xavier who was who

00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,050
basically did half of the work with me

00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:27,960
so that was great

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,099
so what I'm going to talk about today is

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,650
four things

00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:35,309
I'll give you an introduction of the new

00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:37,350
site what it is how it looks like then

00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:40,829
I'll talk about antara which is our

00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:43,770
built engine we use some core concepts

00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:46,050
and how we can use it and then something

00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,780
about contributing and the source

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,850
structure so everyone knows how to make

00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,649
contributions and maybe if you're a

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,390
working group or a team or someone you

00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:56,699
can even move your documentation in

00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:00,000
there and then some plans for the future

00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:02,039
that we want to do so let me start with

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,189
the introduction and I'll have some few

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:07,439
slides and I'll just show you the site

00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:09,689
so about the sources and building um we

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,900
have converted sources to asciidoc which

00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:18,509
is a very simple marked markup language

00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:21,540
and before we basically did this the

00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:23,400
documentation was written in doc book I

00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,220
think that was XML which was really

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:30,630
nasty to write and we didn't get much

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:32,960
contribution for some reason and so we

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:35,670
are basically the people before I join

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,100
we're figuring out like what to use and

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,840
asciidoc was the best option I think

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:43,710
they even consider markdown and other

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:46,880
things but asciidoc was one of the

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:51,270
things that was basically the best and

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,920
in the end we used an Torah which is a

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,079
new build engine with an active

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,110
community that basically takes the

00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:59,119
sources and builds a static website and

00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:02,549
you'll see that in a minute

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,049
so I apologize for this slide I think I

00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:07,920
have never written so many words on this

00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:09,989
slide but it was late so about the

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,740
navigation we've built a clear

00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:14,650
navigation structure

00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:16,120
that kind of scales well so I say that

00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:19,540
the information architecture has been

00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:21,160
designed in a way it scales extensively

00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:23,770
and this is important because we want to

00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,930
accommodate many different things on the

00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:27,700
site so for example we have the user

00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:29,830
dogs but we also have talks about the

00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:32,920
Fedora project and we can also find

00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:35,830
working groups and teams in fedora in

00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:38,830
there I'll show you in a minute how that

00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:40,390
looks and yes we work on translations

00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:42,760
because this is important because we

00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:45,160
have community around the world this is

00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:47,770
in progress but we already already have

00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:50,190
the language code in the URL and I'll

00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:53,860
talk about the end in the future section

00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:56,920
and there is one new thing that's called

00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:58,690
quick talks and these are basically yeah

00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:02,320
and these are basically talks with a

00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:05,050
specific purpose describing how to get

00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:08,140
into a specific goal instead of

00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:10,210
describing features so if you for

00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,310
example see a documentation of I don't

00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:14,320
know httpd and you can see all the

00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:16,620
configuration issue all the

00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:19,720
configuration options like this does

00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,910
this but it's kind of hard to start with

00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,830
so this will tell you for example how to

00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:26,770
use the web server in this particular

00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:29,680
way and how to get with it how to get to

00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:32,590
it and there is already an effort

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:35,040
putting various wiki pages and other

00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:38,860
resources into these quick talks and

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,140
you'll see in a minute that we need a

00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:43,810
better UI but that's also one of the

00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:49,990
future things all right so let's see the

00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:53,580
let's see the documentation I'll try to

00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:58,030
speak here all right

00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:59,920
so we can see that right so this is the

00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:02,710
new website it looks like this the home

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,260
page is quite simple simple looking but

00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:07,870
I think it has everything we want so

00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:10,450
there is the users user documentation in

00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:12,760
the top and then the community section

00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:15,100
and for example if I want to see

00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:18,459
documentation about federal 28 I just

00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:20,680
click on it and I see all those basicly

00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:24,510
those three guys we already always had

00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:27,520
so that the release notes I can click on

00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:29,530
and just Wi-Fi is failing me but it'll

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,140
get there eventually I get the

00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:35,350
installation guide and the system

00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:36,130
administration guide and now my Wi-Fi

00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:39,420
just died

00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:39,420
alright there we go

00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:47,770
I can also also share the quick docs

00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,540
which are kind of messy so these are

00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:51,880
like all the ones we have and now you

00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:53,560
can see why we need a new UI but they

00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,410
basically describe like end to end

00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:59,050
things so viewing wheeling logs in

00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:01,540
fedora for example or how to create disk

00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:05,050
partitions and stuff like this or

00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:07,870
installing Java so these have the user

00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:09,970
documentation and we have the two octave

00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:11,800
races here the quick docs filter arrow

00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:14,140
height and this will be the link to the

00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:20,020
all documentation back - I don't know

00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:22,810
federal whatever I guess one and here is

00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:25,750
the project documentation so Fedora

00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:28,000
project to the council and these two

00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:30,310
sections about engineering and mind

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,390
share which are basically the two major

00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:35,380
groups in Fedora

00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:38,230
and if I open mine share apart from some

00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:39,940
information from what that is I can see

00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:42,760
mine share team that's not much is just

00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:44,380
one third of a community operations but

00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:47,890
basically this is the space where we can

00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:50,080
list multiple working groups or teams we

00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:53,470
have in Fedora that are doing mine share

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:57,420
and they can have their own space here

00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:57,420
with their own menu and everything

00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:04,980
and basically the same structure in

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,080
engineering and then there are some

00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:09,720
other links like google Summer of Code

00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:12,570
and outreach II dogs which are actually

00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,540
externally so that's how the website

00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:18,480
looks like

00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:20,490
and now let's have a look at the in

00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,800
torah so that's the build engine that

00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:25,350
we're using to build the site so

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,160
conceptually it's very simple we have

00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:31,020
the whole site and it's made out of

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,790
components they call it components and a

00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,920
component is basically a space in the

00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:37,800
docks with its own menu and a set of

00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:40,440
pages so we saw for example the comics

00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,780
page that was a component or we saw the

00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:45,570
federal 20 a documentation that was a

00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:49,290
component even the quick talks are

00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:51,690
component now and this is basically all

00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:54,390
you need to know but there is one more

00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:56,160
level of complexity and this is more

00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:58,860
these days like everyone likes to call

00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,510
things modules so this is completely

00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,980
different than modules we have in fedora

00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:04,110
this is completely different than the

00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:06,360
modular way of writing documentation

00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:08,820
this is just an internal terminology and

00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,770
basically it's a section of the

00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:14,550
component that can be split into a

00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:16,170
surprise repo example in the fedora 28

00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:19,260
user guides for example there were three

00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:20,910
books and each of these is a separate

00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:23,370
git repo it can be owned by different

00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:25,290
group for example but they get composed

00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:30,090
into the single space with the with the

00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:33,080
single menu and when we build the site

00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:37,130
and this is quite interesting it builds

00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:40,220
because virtual catalog all pages and

00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:44,550
that's this thing which is version

00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:46,290
component module and the page oh by the

00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:49,860
way I haven't mentioned that components

00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:50,960
can be versioned so let me show you I

00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:54,210
forgot about that

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:57,120
so if I have be filled about 28 Docs for

00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:58,530
example this is one version and here in

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:03,240
the upper corner I can switch it to

00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:04,920
another version right of 27 so that's

00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,710
basically what the version is component

00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:11,580
module and you can use this to either

00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:12,630
build the menu or to use internal links

00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:16,380
across the whole web

00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:19,350
and this will get still the same even

00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:21,090
though if you for example move the pages

00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:28,320
in the component a little bit this will

00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:29,610
always work and the belt is from Google

00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,669
looks like this we have many different

00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:35,010
git repos with the source again owned by

00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:37,020
different groups for example kebobs

00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:40,789
modularity quick talks and they have the

00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:43,380
three guides we build it into a single

00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:45,420
documentation website and in case you're

00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:47,400
curious this is the link that gets you

00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,810
to the list and also to the build

00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:53,520
scripts it's very easy to build I'll

00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:55,850
show you that later as well maybe and by

00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:59,310
the way I'll share the slides with you

00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:01,530
when I'm finished alright so that was

00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:04,230
about antara and now let's have a look

00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:08,760
about contributing and how the source is

00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:10,350
actually organized so we are using get

00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,060
to store the sources to store the

00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:14,460
sources and we want to use similar

00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,960
workflows to software development so if

00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:17,970
you want to make change you basically

00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,980
make your own copy make the change in

00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:23,100
and send a pull request and this is you

00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:25,260
so because someone else can make a

00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,940
review make comments and it makes

00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:29,010
basically a little bit less pressure on

00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,330
the contributor because they are not

00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:33,060
actually pushing the content themselves

00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:39,270
but they have someone else reviewing it

00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:41,910
so that's always good and this is the

00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:44,970
source structure in the in the content

00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:47,450
repo and I have built a template but

00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:50,190
it's on this URL you can see and

00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:52,110
basically the most two interesting parts

00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:55,200
are these pages and this is the

00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:59,160
navigation this is the menu definition

00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:01,470
but you also have images there and some

00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:04,860
metadata and things that support the

00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:08,520
build scripts and this is the root is

00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:10,890
one of the modules most pages have just

00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,930
one module because they're in one repo

00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:16,230
and the default is called routes but you

00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:19,020
can have multiple ones even like in one

00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:21,240
repo or spread to another repos so let's

00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:25,649
have a look at the template

00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:29,069
mostly show you the menu definition how

00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:31,290
it looks like so so this is the repo

00:10:29,069 --> 00:10:34,429
it's on peg er its fedora dog slash

00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:36,720
template and all the documents all the

00:10:34,429 --> 00:10:40,639
information is in the readme so there's

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:43,679
the structure it describes what it is I

00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:45,269
even have a recap what fourth component

00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:47,730
and module is because that might be

00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:49,470
confusing from the beginning and one of

00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:51,720
the nice things about this is that you

00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:55,829
can build it very easily all you need to

00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:57,869
have is a is a container runtime so for

00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:59,699
example we are using docker and we have

00:10:57,869 --> 00:11:01,740
two scripts one for build and one for

00:10:59,699 --> 00:11:03,029
preview and if you run it it will just

00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,279
run the container in the background

00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:06,839
built the website and starts a local

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,269
observer and it will just see the site

00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:11,639
and you can do this with the individual

00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:13,619
repos and you can also do the same thing

00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:17,160
with the whole website if you want to

00:11:13,619 --> 00:11:20,730
have a preview so I think this is one of

00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:24,029
the good steps here and I promise you to

00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:30,089
see the navigation structure so if I go

00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:32,519
to files and I open modules this is the

00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:36,269
default module and I have this nav a

00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:38,249
dock and these are the page IDs and you

00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:40,529
might notice they're a little bit easier

00:11:38,249 --> 00:11:41,220
here they don't have all the components

00:11:40,529 --> 00:11:43,410
in there

00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:45,540
because I'm referring to the same module

00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:48,689
to the same component but I could use

00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:52,350
the full version if I liked and it's

00:11:48,689 --> 00:11:56,189
basically just a list it's as xref the

00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:57,929
name I want to see in the menu and this

00:11:56,189 --> 00:11:59,549
is just basically a list that defines

00:11:57,929 --> 00:12:04,499
the structure of the website so if I

00:11:59,549 --> 00:12:07,199
build it it looks like this and these

00:12:04,499 --> 00:12:11,850
are the five pages so I have the index

00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:14,459
page this is the nested thing which is

00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:16,649
defined here and that's how you

00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:18,899
basically can define the structure you

00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:21,299
want without moving the sources or

00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:24,389
changing the page ID so even if you if

00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:26,490
you want to reshuffle the menu

00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:29,119
completely all the internal links will

00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:29,119
keep working

00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:39,660
all right so right now if you want to

00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,590
make a contribution and I'll talk about

00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:44,160
that in a minute

00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:47,160
also you need to go to this URL which is

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,590
our paper built repo and there is a list

00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,870
of all the sources and then you just go

00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:53,550
to the repo and make a contribution but

00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:55,890
what we plan to do is an edit button

00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:58,050
it'll be on the right corner and just

00:12:55,890 --> 00:13:00,570
like like that it'll get you to the git

00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:03,480
repo and you can make an edit and just

00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:07,440
click a button and we'll submit a PR for

00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:11,100
you this is this needs to be done in an

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,710
taurah it supported for github and two

00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,690
other gets I have I don't think I

00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:17,670
remember but if you host your source on

00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:21,530
github it'll work already we need to

00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:24,590
make the change for bagger upstream

00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:27,570
alright so let's talk about the future

00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:29,790
and there are few things you want to

00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:32,250
work on automation is the big one we

00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:34,290
want to have capability of building PRS

00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:38,010
for previews so if you submit a PR you

00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:40,260
will see in the PR the hole size with

00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:42,900
your change this is almost done I think

00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:45,660
we have the pipeline setup I still need

00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:48,810
to finish the image but this should be

00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:51,780
weeks we also want to build the whole

00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:54,090
side which is run right now manual

00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:56,820
process but again if we do any change

00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:59,040
the CI will rebuild it and deploy and

00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:02,550
we've already want some tests still need

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:05,010
to think about this translations I've

00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:08,940
mentioned translations already so the

00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:10,770
URL is final no changes in there and we

00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:15,360
have some testing project Ensenada which

00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:16,740
is the translation thing and yes we are

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,390
making progress in there and it's

00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:20,340
definitely something we wanna you want

00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:24,390
to do very soon so I have the highest

00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:26,580
priorities and quick talks

00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:30,540
so this is the thing we might need some

00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:32,550
help so as you could see quick dogs the

00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:34,200
menu on the left is all the pages listed

00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:36,060
and that was kind of crazy to navigate

00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:39,480
right so we might want to do something

00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:40,529
with I don't know tags search so if

00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,149
you're kind of

00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:46,709
person who can help us that would be

00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:49,199
great probably we want to build

00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:51,120
something like stack overflow or use

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:57,720
something that exists that can provide

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:59,879
this kind of experience and search so

00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,819
good news is that the aunt Ora

00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:04,829
documentation already has a search so we

00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:06,120
know it's possible we just in to somehow

00:15:04,829 --> 00:15:08,879
integrate it with the federal website

00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,589
and they will have search and this

00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:14,389
should be even useful for the quick

00:15:10,589 --> 00:15:18,120
Doc's I guess as a as the first step and

00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:20,220
we want more contribute to Docs

00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,769
so if you're a working group or part of

00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,990
the working group or a team in Fedora or

00:15:22,769 --> 00:15:26,970
cig you're very welcome to move your

00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:29,189
documentation in there so for example I

00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:31,259
know for infrastructure of a range have

00:15:29,189 --> 00:15:33,089
their own documentation can be very

00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:35,519
easily moved there and you get your own

00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:37,470
space on the page you can have it in

00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,899
your own repo in your own place in the

00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:41,490
repo here of rules for contributions

00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:43,110
making changes I will just build it for

00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:46,800
you and publish which I think would be

00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:49,139
useful we did that for example with the

00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:53,309
modularity project I also contribute to

00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:56,309
you and with this I think that's all

00:15:53,309 --> 00:16:02,670
from my side are there any questions or

00:15:56,309 --> 00:16:04,860
concerns yeah would you like a mic first

00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:06,899
of all of all thank you for all your

00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:10,740
work with enter I know it was a hard

00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:13,559
work I was trying to test myself and my

00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:19,649
first question will be saying we are

00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:21,689
moving from ASCII binder to Ventura how

00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:25,079
it affect the way we were working before

00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:26,939
for writing documents because the test

00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:28,829
is different but I don't know if we need

00:16:26,939 --> 00:16:32,759
to before we have to define the topic

00:16:28,829 --> 00:16:35,220
map Jamal and then to add the document

00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:38,069
inside the Jamal in in the German

00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:41,730
structure and then to write a proper a

00:16:38,069 --> 00:16:44,550
docx file so how is this new way

00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:46,439
different from that way yeah that's a

00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:48,240
very good question things so that's

00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:50,879
something I haven't mentioned so before

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,319
the doc book between the doc book and

00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:53,870
the antara we had something in the

00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:56,000
middle that was called

00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:58,960
a ski binder and this basically Brian

00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,570
exhibits work so that was also great and

00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:04,819
it was also using a ski dog for the

00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:06,949
documentation but to build it from

00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:11,600
multiple repos it was kind of tricky and

00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:13,520
also when you define the page you have

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:16,160
to do one extra file to basically

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,020
describe all the files in there and then

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:21,800
define the menu so right now it's all

00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:24,110
you need to have is the page files and

00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:26,209
the nav I doc which is the a doc file

00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:27,800
with the list of links and those things

00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:30,140
define all the structure and that's all

00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:32,600
you need basically and all the

00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:35,170
information is in the template repo I

00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:38,450
showed so that should be very clear

00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:41,000
otherwise I'm very happy to help on IRC

00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:44,480
thank you I have just another question

00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:49,850
sorry the other question is because I

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:53,150
want to port several six websites to the

00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:56,740
documentation side so how this will work

00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:59,809
I mean I shall host it in the SiC

00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:02,210
popular and how I reference it in the

00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:05,059
documentation popular very good question

00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:07,970
so you basically can host it in any get

00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:10,790
repo you want it can be Packer it can be

00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:13,820
whatever and you can put it anywhere in

00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:18,309
the repo you want again you just need to

00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:21,470
have a structure with the structure off

00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:24,410
of the template sorry and if you go to

00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:26,480
this URL so this is the fedora docks and

00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:28,700
yeah it's messy but it's just as click

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,980
here and it's easy URL it gets you where

00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:33,650
you need to go so this is the main belt

00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:36,710
scrape that lists all the repos with the

00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:40,010
sources and in the Files section and I

00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:44,710
might even make it bigger for the

00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:47,840
projector is this file called site llamo

00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:51,260
and if I open it it lists all the git

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,400
repos we use as resources with all the

00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:54,500
branches in them

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,330
so that's how you basically that's how

00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,670
we reference the repo so basically you

00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:00,770
just let us know that you want this

00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:03,890
include it or even send a PR if you like

00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:07,040
I think opening an issue is is fine and

00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:07,309
all we need to have is like clone you

00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,919
are

00:19:07,309 --> 00:19:13,100
that's publicly available the name of

00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:16,490
your branch and if you have that in a

00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:19,399
separate path so for example the coops

00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:21,889
have directory slash dogs you can do

00:19:19,399 --> 00:19:23,990
anything you want we can also specify it

00:19:21,889 --> 00:19:33,230
here so that way it's not just

00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:35,120
interfering with your other code yeah so

00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:37,370
let's say I'm playing around with this

00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:40,159
and I wanted to do a preview build on my

00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:41,840
own laptop is Santora already available

00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:43,999
in fedora or how do i how to actually

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:47,210
build on my own laptop very good

00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:50,029
question so we don't have the entire

00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:53,090
package in fedora right now but there is

00:19:50,029 --> 00:19:56,480
a upstream container image that has all

00:19:53,090 --> 00:20:00,649
the things you need and we made it in a

00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:02,240
way that we have two scripts in the repo

00:20:00,649 --> 00:20:05,330
one is called built and one is called

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,950
preview and what it does is just like

00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:09,860
runs the container with the built the

00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:11,299
site for you first time it puts the

00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:13,820
container from the upstream and then it

00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:15,169
just like keeps working and this is just

00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:17,659
the container with the webserver that

00:20:15,169 --> 00:20:19,009
makes you the preview so that's

00:20:17,659 --> 00:20:20,960
basically all you need should be very

00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:23,809
easy and it works on Linux I just did it

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,399
on Mac so that way we can attract

00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:28,580
contributors like using different should

00:20:25,399 --> 00:20:30,799
basically work anywhere where either the

00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:33,019
container run time is or I think you can

00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:41,779
even install onto on any system but yeah

00:20:33,019 --> 00:20:45,129
so it's very flexible in this river okay

00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:49,159
I have one question if I'm not mistaken

00:20:45,129 --> 00:20:54,549
the documentation is no locked in sonata

00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:57,169
for translating so when this change I

00:20:54,549 --> 00:21:01,210
think that would be best answered by

00:20:57,169 --> 00:21:01,210
Brian let me give him a mic

00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:07,620
everything I'm about to say is extremely

00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:10,920
ignorant so correct me when I'm wrong we

00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:12,780
locked the dock book versions of the

00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:14,250
documentation at the request of the

00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:19,050
internationalization and localization

00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:23,430
folks we have tests pushed projects into

00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:25,530
the nada of the asciidoc and quite

00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:28,500
honestly I just need somebody who uses

00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:30,720
anata to sit down with me and tell me if

00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,370
this looks right so that we can send an

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,370
email out to the localization list

00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:37,560
saying go for it because after that I'd

00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:39,960
like to work with Adam to do a test

00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:42,420
publish on a language but I'm

00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:45,690
monolingual so I can't actually do it

00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:47,520
myself well I have successfully

00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:49,770
translated British English to American

00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,360
English but beyond that I am monolingual

00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:53,280
and I have a credit I can show you the

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,110
web credit but um like in all

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,240
seriousness we need someone from the

00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:59,220
localization team who can look at what

00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:02,570
I've pushed into Sanada and say this is

00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:05,310
sane because I've never had to use Inara

00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:07,500
and I've what I would like us to avoid

00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:10,560
if possible is giving the localization

00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:12,510
teams a bad set of pushes and projects

00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:14,190
to work with and then we're like oh well

00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:15,600
yeah those were all terrible so we're

00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:18,000
gonna throw all of your work away and

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,580
ask you to do it again and that's kind

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,350
of where we are with this I would be

00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:24,210
really happy to sit down with you like

00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:27,450
immediately after this or during flock

00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:29,610
to get this worked out I didn't do much

00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:35,040
much to isolation work so I'm not sure

00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:38,820
if I'm right person but I could look who

00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:43,050
is in your translation group and see

00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:46,070
will who is in I don't know who is the

00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:46,070
admin of the group and

00:22:47,769 --> 00:22:50,769
okay

00:22:52,910 --> 00:23:00,860
yeah okay well one thing one more thing

00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:03,650
just one enhancement for the page it

00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:07,790
will be good if the page has something

00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:09,860
to contribute or skyed mm-hmm that's

00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:12,290
something we are working on and I think

00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:21,770
it should be coming in a few days right

00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:24,530
I think there is a talk in flog about

00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:30,170
the user guy or the contributor guy

00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:33,260
later yeah there was it underhanded but

00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:35,630
I did a yeah it's different sorry I just

00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:38,390
used a both but two things that should

00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:41,120
make you happy I did a figure classroom

00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:42,800
this Monday and it's recorded and it

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,210
should land on YouTube on the federal

00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,400
channel and I just walk through the

00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:48,350
whole workflow of contributing so that's

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,530
one option and the other one is we are

00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:53,930
building a contribution guidelines or

00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:56,240
something like with all the steps and

00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:59,330
it'll land on the documentation page so

00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:04,280
it'll be just like self explanatory but

00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:11,900
it's not very right and it's coming any

00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:14,810
other questions yeah we have wonder so

00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:18,590
is the format actually xq doctor or us

00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:21,740
escape so the format is asciidoc it's

00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:25,040
built by us kid doctor because we just

00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:26,780
somehow extension above ask a doctor is

00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:30,010
actually it should be like ask a doctor

00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:34,220
to point also and that's why I'm asking

00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:37,010
doctor right all right so there's ask

00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:40,310
you doctor thank you I just want to make

00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:42,860
this clear that probably you should make

00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:45,170
it clear in the documentation and the

00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:48,610
second question is probably on Bryan is

00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:48,610
s Cuba in their debt or not

00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:57,960
would you like an white for those of you

00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:59,400
don't know ASCII binder is a project

00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:02,330
that was written by our good friends an

00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:04,980
open shift and it is used to build

00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:07,320
static sites for documentation as well

00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:09,780
from an ASCII doctor formatted set of

00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:12,150
repositories they designed it to solve

00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:14,850
some very specific problems around a

00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:17,070
single documentation set trying to build

00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:20,670
it for three different flavors of a

00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:21,900
software project it is not dead I do not

00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:23,490
know that it has much active

00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,930
contribution because it's currently

00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:27,990
solving all of the OpenShift

00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:29,760
requirements that it did not meet our

00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:32,220
requirement set and that is one of the

00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:35,190
reasons that we looked at an taurah but

00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:38,400
that upstream as far as I know is in the

00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:40,230
same I'll say maintenance phase tail-end

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:45,270
as it was before

00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:47,130
and inside of fedora there inside of

00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:48,540
fedora we still are using it right now

00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:50,100
with the budget website because I

00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:53,340
haven't had a chance to convert that and

00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:55,410
we're still using it with no that's it

00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:57,480
just the budget website I'm asking

00:25:55,410 --> 00:26:00,000
because I pick a binder for Federer so

00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:03,510
I'm asking what is the future of the

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,290
package and if we have some future and

00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:10,110
if we need maintenance or not or I

00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:11,640
direct you to Harrison on that one in

00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:13,110
terms of its future and whether only

00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,300
maintenance I know that they're supposed

00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:16,500
to be looking at an taurah for openshift

00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:18,930
but i don't know that they've had the

00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,280
resources to do it i don't expect you

00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:24,240
will be doing a lot of work in this

00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:28,290
package okay thanks okay thanks for all

00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:31,530
the questions if we have some more yeah

00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:35,220
so one additional so when interrupt will

00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:37,050
be packaged in Federer and because

00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:39,600
looking at the dockerfile it's based on

00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:41,460
debian and so on we want to use it in

00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,090
Federer so yeah that's a very good

00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:44,370
question

00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:47,070
as long as we have someone who would

00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:49,050
like to package it for us so this is no

00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:52,730
js' so we need someone with no js' and I

00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:55,260
see Jared maybe is volunteering now so

00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:57,210
so I've started the process of trying to

00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:59,190
get all the dependencies for ant or

00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:00,770
packaged up in in fedora it's a

00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:03,890
non-trivial thing I think I've

00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:05,810
package 60 or 70 nodejs packages so far

00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:08,470
just to get the dependencies in so far

00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:10,220
and I don't seem to be making you know

00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:12,170
significant progress and getting

00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:13,670
anywhere close to the an to our package

00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:15,770
itself it's something I do in my spare

00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:16,970
time when I you know I'm sitting on an

00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:18,950
airplane and have nothing better to do

00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:20,720
that sort of thing but but it is going

00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:21,860
to be a long hard slog to get there

00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,910
unless we just bundle all the

00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:28,190
dependencies them and that sort of thing

00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:30,200
but at least about the container as part

00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:32,060
of the CI I'm building a fedora based

00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,920
container that will use the fedora and

00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:37,430
nodejs package and we will just like

00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:39,350
install the intera from NPM but

00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:42,290
otherwise it'll get just like through

00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:43,660
our stuff so that's that's that's the

00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:48,950
first step

00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:50,690
alright so any other questions if no

00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:53,630
thanks everyone for coming and enjoy

00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:56,800
your half an hour early lunch this is
