Talk: How to become a Fedora Badges Sysadmin Superstar
Presenters: Nick Bebout, Miroslav Hroncok, Justin W. Flory, Sayan Chowdhury

Description: This workshop is an interactive session to teach Fedora contributors how to get involved with Fedora Badges as a sysadmin. The goal is to sponsor new sysadmins during the workshop and have participants push new badges live during the workshop.

The workshop is split into two parts:

Verbal introduction to Fedora Badges, the stack, and tools needed, and the processes to push badges
Interactive session for attendees to try and push new badges
The verbal introduction is a quick overview of the Fedora Badges stack. It gives background on how the pieces are composed, how the Infrastructure works, and what is going on under the hood. Then, it will walk through the procedure to push new badges by walking through our documentation.

The interactive session is a chance for participants to put their new knowledge to action. Participants will set up a development environment for pushing new badges. For their first contribution, they will work with a mentor (i.e. a sponsored Fedora Badges sysadmin) to respond to a Badges ticket that is in the "ready to be pushed" status. After following the steps, the goal is to sponsor attendees into the FAS group for access to push badges on their own after the workshop.

The overall goal is to grow the number of system administrators helping with Fedora Badges to increase response time to badge tickets ready to be pushed, and possibly generate development interest in the underlying components.
