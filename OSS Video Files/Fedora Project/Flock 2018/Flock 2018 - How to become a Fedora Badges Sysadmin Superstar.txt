Talk: How to become a Fedora Badges Sysadmin Superstar
Presenters: Nick Bebout, Miroslav Hroncok, Justin W. Flory, Sayan Chowdhury

Description: This workshop is an interactive session to teach Fedora contributors how to get involved with Fedora Badges as a sysadmin. The goal is to sponsor new sysadmins during the workshop and have participants push new badges live during the workshop.

The workshop is split into two parts:

Verbal introduction to Fedora Badges, the stack, and tools needed, and the processes to push badges
Interactive session for attendees to try and push new badges
The verbal introduction is a quick overview of the Fedora Badges stack. It gives background on how the pieces are composed, how the Infrastructure works, and what is going on under the hood. Then, it will walk through the procedure to push new badges by walking through our documentation.

The interactive session is a chance for participants to put their new knowledge to action. Participants will set up a development environment for pushing new badges. For their first contribution, they will work with a mentor (i.e. a sponsored Fedora Badges sysadmin) to respond to a Badges ticket that is in the "ready to be pushed" status. After following the steps, the goal is to sponsor attendees into the FAS group for access to push badges on their own after the workshop.

The overall goal is to grow the number of system administrators helping with Fedora Badges to increase response time to badge tickets ready to be pushed, and possibly generate development interest in the underlying components.

	00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:06,620
so this is going to be a quick

00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,970
introduction to the Fedora badges

00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:11,070
sysadmin point of view so there's been

00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,509
the design workshops for the last

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:16,049
several years this is the first time

00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:17,490
we've done a sysadmin overview for the

00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:20,430
fedora badges side so we're gonna try to

00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,380
do a quick overview of what that bilji

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:25,050
behind the fedora badges infrastructure

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,840
is give an overview about some of the

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:30,179
automatic badges and then explain the

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,450
workflow and then our goal is to at the

00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:36,600
end of this is to try to actually try to

00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,890
have everyone push badges based off of

00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,379
the tickets that we have in the

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:44,520
pejorative that are ready to push status

00:00:42,379 --> 00:00:47,100
this is the quick agenda is basically

00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,800
what I just explained and sighin was

00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,050
going to oh and this is an anti agenda

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,059
but since I guess you're in the room

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,129
anyone ever wants to design the badges

00:00:54,059 --> 00:01:00,660
there is the Fedora badge design

00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:03,989
workshop tomorrow 9:00 a.m. to 10:50 so

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:08,210
I will hand it over to Cheyenne for the

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:13,260
technical overview do the wiggle

00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:16,950
hi I'm Sam and I'll go through the

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,360
technical overview of it so so before

00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,280
starting off with creating the badge

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,990
isn't better to know like which projects

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:27,360
make up the federal badges project in

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:29,430
whole so we have fed message we have

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,950
data Norma f we have fed badges the

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:34,560
Hariri and api and sometimes for

00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,180
debugging we use data gripper so that's

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,290
the last friend as a maybe data gripper

00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:42,240
and so let's go quickly through Fred

00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,549
message and data normal so this is a

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,049
simple diagram so within the federal

00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:49,110
infrastructure we have a virtual bus

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:52,439
which we call as federer fed message

00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:54,689
which is the federated message bus if

00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:56,520
you can see this is like a virtual

00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:59,759
message was that we have and then

00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:07,429
various applications push messages to

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:11,099
the fed message bus beard like Koji or

00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:12,190
both II beg your cameras both he all

00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:14,380
push

00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:16,600
messages to this particular message bus

00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:18,370
and this walks on a publish/subscribe

00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,320
model so different application again can

00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:22,570
connect why the SUBSCRIBE model to this

00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,600
bus and can start receiving those

00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:29,170
messages and each message has a

00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:31,360
particular topic to it so using that

00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:34,030
topic as a filter they can start using

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,630
our subscribe to a particular topic and

00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:40,840
start receiving those messages so so

00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:44,620
badges also lies on this front so we

00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:48,250
have badges rules which listen to a

00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:50,920
particular topic and based on that they

00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:52,660
filter out like which person should get

00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,270
which badge and we have different rule

00:02:52,660 --> 00:03:00,190
set of which mirror would be explaining

00:02:55,270 --> 00:03:02,590
ahead anyway so we have so here you can

00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:05,130
see like fed based badges is one of the

00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:08,650
component as a subscriber switch pose

00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:10,690
the data into the first case so now

00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:13,290
moving ahead we have a data nama

00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:17,680
so what's data Hammad's data nama is a

00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:20,290
database where fed missus stores all its

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,230
messages so when data number is also

00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:26,190
offered message hub which listens to a

00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:28,510
particular message so it's actually

00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:34,180
listens to all the messages and stores

00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:36,160
it into a database next and yeah so next

00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:39,970
part is the major part is the fed

00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:42,580
batches so fed batches is Project which

00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:44,980
is like the rule generator so it

00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:47,860
converts the rules file the rules CML

00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:51,010
file that we create into a proper sequel

00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:56,680
query and then avoids the badges as it

00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:58,239
goes forward so this is a simple rules

00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,930
file that we have I picked up from the

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:05,050
documentation so you have the topic so

00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:07,750
for any friend message message which has

00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:11,110
this particular topic so this rule file

00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:13,780
will pick up that particular message and

00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:15,940
then we have the criteria on how to

00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:18,640
filter those messages from the data nama

00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:21,160
so you have like filter the topic and

00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:23,169
then from the message it tries to pull

00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,430
the message dot commit dot username

00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:27,400
which is a

00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:29,350
person who actually gets that particular

00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,660
badge and then you can do various

00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:33,400
operations based on that like suppose

00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,949
you need a badge like where the commits

00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,570
are greater than 50 sorry greater than

00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:43,870
90 so you can put all those conditions

00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:46,350
in the Hamill file yep okay do you want

00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,350
to show this

00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,470
right

00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:15,050
so this is a data grip data gripper UI

00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:17,419
so data gripper is primarily a API J a

00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:19,339
REST API kind of a layered on top of a

00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:21,169
date enormous if you need to pull data

00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:24,529
from the data normal database you have

00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:27,409
to query them via the data gripper so

00:05:24,529 --> 00:05:30,979
okay Jason can you click one of the JSON

00:05:27,409 --> 00:05:34,369
messages so right now we are filtering

00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:36,169
based on the get receive messages so you

00:05:34,369 --> 00:05:38,089
can see this is the message structure to

00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:40,699
that particular message and if you can

00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:43,999
see there is a message commit and

00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:46,399
username or like a dictionary so we try

00:05:43,999 --> 00:05:52,969
to filter out that particular username

00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:55,189
so here we from data and also when fed

00:05:52,969 --> 00:05:57,229
by just does a Rudy part so it would

00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:59,270
filter out the username and I want the

00:05:57,229 --> 00:06:02,259
batch to this particular user if all the

00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:02,259
conditions are met

00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:12,969
yes that message dot commenter to

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:12,969
username okay go on to the splash page

00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:19,220
the next that thing comes in place is

00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:22,080
Atari API so tari API is primarily the

00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:23,490
so the badges front-end that you see is

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,800
primarily divided into two parts which

00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:28,500
is the third project which is the front

00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,990
end to it and the target API so that API

00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:35,909
have all the models in place which

00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:39,240
defines the database structure so the so

00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:40,590
it also provides with a API layer over

00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:44,550
the database so if you need to create

00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:46,919
user or award a badge or create a CDs in

00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:49,860
the badges so you can actually use that

00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:51,840
particular API from 30-day peer to do

00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:55,259
all the operations so primarily the

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:58,190
tardy project actually uses that API to

00:06:55,259 --> 00:07:03,180
create all the operations on the

00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:05,610
database the re database so so primarily

00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:09,780
it's a database it uses sequel alchemy

00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:12,539
and it's written in Python and as I told

00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:18,360
like it's provides the API over the

00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:20,569
30-day PA database next and finally we

00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,880
have the project sorry is a pyramid

00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:27,360
Python pyramid based project which is a

00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:29,520
Python web framework and it's basically

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,919
the front end to badges or filter

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,659
project or tour so whatever is see the

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,520
admin page or the explore page or any

00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:37,199
other page that you see so it's

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:41,159
basically that all the course lies in

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:43,560
the Tauri repository and if you want to

00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:46,500
like contributor and new features or

00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,900
probably update the templates on in the

00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:53,240
badges project so sorry is the place

00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:53,240
where the code would be okay

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:08,620
sure so probably we can show cold if he

00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:10,660
can so da so Justin asked the question

00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:15,370
like if I can get forgive an example for

00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:18,400
started API so tar is API like as in

00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:26,910
like you if you open the go to get up da

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:26,910
read API yeah

00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:38,080
so anyway so you have a file called the

00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:41,200
db-api within 30-day PA so which

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,810
contains an extraction of like all the

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:48,550
database operations that we need to

00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:50,860
expose out so like as I told it can be

00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:53,620
create a simple user or create about

00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:58,500
someone a badge so all is done via this

00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:58,500
particular API

00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,910
okay

00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:22,480
yeah go to Tahrir API

00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:27,839
yes and DB APA yes just increase the

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,839
font yeah

00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:35,760
skål now yes sir

00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:38,579
so if you see their their various

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:45,660
methods utility methods like team exist

00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:48,480
get team down like create team so all

00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:50,910
these are like the API endpoints or the

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,660
methods that can you use so basically

00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:56,430
the basically the tawheed actually uses

00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,199
these methods to interact with the

00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:00,269
database it does not do it directly

00:09:58,199 --> 00:10:02,310
where the secret I'll give me and even

00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:05,160
though I guess the Edit badge all the

00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:09,089
badges scripts that we have those also

00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:11,399
uses this all API methods because this

00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:14,220
is like it you need to create as ddv

00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:16,639
session and then start accessing using

00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,639
these methods

00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:26,330
yeah

00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:29,770
so next meter would be taking over to

00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:29,770
explain the automatic badges

00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:38,370
[Music]

00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:47,750
hello

00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:51,560
so we already seen an example before so

00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:54,110
just a little repetition we have some

00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:58,100
trigger which is something that will

00:10:54,110 --> 00:11:00,200
basically it's cheap it doesn't take

00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:02,540
much time and every time there is a fun

00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:06,130
message this the rest of the file will

00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:08,720
only be applied if the trigger matches

00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:11,450
but it's not very powerful

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,930
you can basically filter by topics maybe

00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:19,160
some lambdas like here

00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:21,290
but you can't see history you only in

00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:25,060
the trigger you can only filter the

00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:28,430
particle of that message day sorry I

00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:32,480
don't know how real-time or not this

00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:35,630
works but so basically the fed batches

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:38,720
thing is hooked up on the message bus

00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:41,000
and every time it receives a message it

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,970
goes through all the rules and apply

00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,830
solder all the triggers so it's almost

00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:47,270
real-time it might take some time

00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,920
because we have a lot of rules and

00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:50,750
rather a lot of messages and I don't

00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:53,030
know how fast is the machine so

00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:54,350
sometimes you do an action and it takes

00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:56,620
a couple of minutes before you receive

00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,620
the badge

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:07,760
yes you're right so but but we need we

00:12:05,149 --> 00:12:10,490
have badges that say something like you

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:13,250
did something five times already or or

00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:16,160
something else so we first do the

00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:17,959
trigger part and then the criteria can

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,330
look to the data number which is

00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:23,350
basically like a recorded history of all

00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:26,660
our things that happen in the Fed

00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:29,420
message bus including a short period

00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:33,680
before message bus was actually created

00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:37,070
so when this was when this started in

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:39,500
2013 I guess they kind of looked at the

00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:40,940
database and they reconstructed partial

00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,920
history for data numbers so there are

00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:45,620
even more historical data but not all of

00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:48,140
them and then you can look to data

00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:50,510
number and find another messages with

00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:53,029
the same topic and with the same user

00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:55,580
and then you can do some operations like

00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:58,130
count or there are more I don't remember

00:12:55,580 --> 00:13:03,649
them all there is no real documentation

00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:06,440
for this as long as I know bit of it

00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:08,930
yeah so the the workflow usually is you

00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,200
find the badges which is similar to this

00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:11,930
one

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,880
you copy/paste the rule file and you try

00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:16,640
to make it work which sometimes is

00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:18,920
possible and sometimes it is not but

00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:21,920
that's a little problematic thing so

00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:24,560
what you could do is search the topics

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:28,010
on the data number try to find something

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:30,709
which is related to the stuff you try to

00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:34,550
create and then see the Chasen of the

00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:36,440
felt message and figure out what's in

00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:39,589
there so for example we have have been

00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:42,399
having troubles with the pass or comets

00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:45,770
badges so there is a lot of batches for

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:48,500
committing in to pass your i/o project

00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:50,180
like one commit 5 comma 20 comma 100

00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,339
comments but they have never been

00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,810
averted because they'll file it doesn't

00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:57,380
work and nobody knows how to write it

00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:59,750
properly because the badge says commit

00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:01,339
but you can't have a Fed message on

00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:03,860
comment because you commit on your

00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:06,079
machine you can only push to get and

00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:08,600
then the third message contains all the

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,819
comments in that's very push

00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:16,759
it's almost impossible or nobody knows

00:14:10,819 --> 00:14:20,000
how to write it properly so the issue

00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:21,769
with the beggar batch is you have you do

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,290
the Khmers and then you care to PR or

00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:25,310
like if there's a big issue that you're

00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:28,240
working on there will be multiple

00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:31,610
authors to that particular comment so

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:34,310
but Fred misses message only contains

00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:36,860
the name of the order fast idea of the

00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:38,509
person who actually was the PR and the

00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:41,180
total number of comments is never lists

00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:42,709
all the authors in the PR or know how

00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:45,589
many numbers of commits they did in that

00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:49,190
particular peer so that's a shoot the

00:14:45,589 --> 00:14:51,170
earlier API had the functionality to do

00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:55,579
that and the write the current batch

00:14:51,170 --> 00:15:00,230
rule is written only using that earlier

00:14:55,579 --> 00:15:01,670
API so after the API migrated which we

00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:04,600
started getting all those errors and we

00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:04,600
don't know how to fix this

00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:15,260
so I'm going to spend a little bit of

00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:16,670
time covering the workflow so we can

00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:20,450
actually get started trying to push a

00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:23,570
badges so if on your personal machines

00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:25,579
or anywhere else you can load these up

00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:28,610
this is what I would call the like

00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:31,000
sysadmin fedora badges toolbox the

00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:33,740
things that you need like minimum viable

00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,930
items you need in your toolbox like we

00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:39,529
were talking about before all of the

00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:43,850
design assets and rule files for fedora

00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:46,700
badges lives in this pejorative so this

00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:48,649
is where all the design work happens but

00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:50,709
this is also where all the design assets

00:15:48,649 --> 00:16:00,290
live that eventually are synchronized

00:15:50,709 --> 00:16:02,300
over to the badges back-end server yeah

00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:03,920
oh and if you can get on it on the

00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:07,070
conference Wi-Fi will figure something

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:10,160
out if not but the other one this is uh

00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:12,890
what I would say is like the death the

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:17,829
definitive guide or standard operating

00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:20,029
procedure for actually pushing and

00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:23,089
managing the infrastructure side of the

00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:25,790
badges this is I would say if you're

00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:27,440
ever confused about a step or if you're

00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:28,699
hearing this workshop and later you want

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,279
to try to remember some of the things we

00:16:28,699 --> 00:16:34,160
covered this is the the best place to

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:36,829
look and understand the process the last

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,589
part is the badges website front-end

00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:41,449
which if you haven't used it already

00:16:39,589 --> 00:16:43,490
will explain a little bit from the admin

00:16:41,449 --> 00:16:46,670
point of view for using that towards the

00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:49,579
end so I'm just going to go ahead and

00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:54,050
just do a quick run-through of the of

00:16:49,579 --> 00:16:57,220
the SOP up here really quick just to run

00:16:54,050 --> 00:17:00,890
through what that process looks like

00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:02,390
anyone is welcome to stop me at any time

00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:03,589
so I'm not going to talk about the

00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:06,530
description because that's kind of the

00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:08,689
technical overview that Sian and Miro

00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:12,199
gave earlier I'm going to cut straight

00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:14,419
to the chase on pushing new badges so I

00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:18,199
can zoom in on this so it's not is not

00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:20,559
hurting your eyes as much either wears

00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:20,559
memos

00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:29,780
so pushing a badge always consists of

00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:31,820
two operations when you're doing this

00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:35,150
you are going to be pushing the badge

00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:37,610
assets which are the the PNG files the

00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:42,230
SVG's created by the fedora design team

00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:44,210
in the issues in that pejorative and

00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:47,360
then it's actually adding the badge to

00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:50,750
the badges website front end and there

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,970
is an intermediary step for how you get

00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:56,690
the design assets from the fedora badges

00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:58,910
to the badges front end but I'll explain

00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:00,410
that in a little so the way it works is

00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:02,540
that anyone with write permissions can

00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:04,760
push to the pejorative Tory but because

00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,740
everything is now in a pejorative Ori

00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,930
this can actually just be done with pull

00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:11,030
requests workflows so even if you all

00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:14,870
don't have direct commit access to the

00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:17,180
project or you don't have sis admin

00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:19,070
rights to just you can actually jump in

00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,810
and get involved and even do the work

00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:23,810
like if there's if you see a ticket that

00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:26,150
has ready to push status in the fedora

00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:29,110
badges repository anyone can actually

00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:31,760
just jump in and make a pull request to

00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:35,510
start closing that ticket and pushing

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:38,480
out the design assets so when you're

00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:39,920
getting ready to create a badge from the

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,650
sysadmin point of view there's always a

00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:44,390
few things that we want to check for one

00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:48,830
thing that's not covered here that I do

00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:50,720
want to add in is from this admin side

00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:53,180
whenever a new badge is being reposed

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,970
and if it has an automatic badge rule

00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:57,740
it's always a good step to make sure

00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:00,170
that whatever is being proposed ever is

00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:01,940
being suggested is actually technically

00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:04,280
feasible in the same way that Miro

00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:06,800
mentioned earlier that it's there's a

00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:11,630
fair set of limitations on what kind of

00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:13,640
automatic badge rules we can push we

00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:16,010
need to be mindful of what we can

00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:20,060
actually push out and have as an

00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:23,270
automatic badge rule I would like to see

00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:26,530
also which I think I talked to I think I

00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:30,930
mentioned it to you or someone yesterday

00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:33,600
is that there's a step before

00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:35,870
we should we should add a step kind of

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:39,500
going along with what you're saying now

00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:43,559
before the design team designs the badge

00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:45,960
the a badges admin says yeah we're gonna

00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:48,150
do this or not

00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:52,980
both because some badges are not

00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:55,620
currently technically possible or things

00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:58,530
like we've had come up with event badges

00:19:55,620 --> 00:20:01,020
where we're not going to make generally

00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:04,380
not making multiple badges for the same

00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:05,880
event except for flock right and the

00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:07,679
design people are nice people we don't

00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:10,350
like to waste their time yeah because I

00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,480
that's why I always train I hate I hate

00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:15,450
closing tickets that they've already

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:18,750
made art and saying sorry we're not

00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:22,080
going to use it I I would rather say

00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:30,840
we're not gonna make that badge so don't

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:32,760
spend your time designing it so when a

00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:35,640
new badge issue is made we should put

00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:39,420
review on it or like developer review or

00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:41,790
a tag that's means that it needs to be

00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:44,429
reviewed by you guys and then like I'll

00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:47,040
keep artwork needed off of it until that

00:20:44,429 --> 00:20:51,450
time comes I I think that I think that

00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:53,580
would be good no well for manual ones

00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:55,890
too because there's some like event

00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:58,380
badges where someone will put in a

00:20:55,890 --> 00:21:02,400
ticket like we had the ticket for fleece

00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:05,340
all organizer but and it already got art

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,679
made and then we're like no we're not

00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:10,980
we're not making that badge because

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:13,950
there's because of our general not

00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:15,750
making multiple badges because most of

00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:18,090
the people getting the organizer badge

00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:20,820
or well most of the people with the

00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:24,570
attendee badger also getting we're also

00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:25,820
proposed for the organizer badge so I'd

00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:31,980
like to have that conversation

00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:34,350
separately okay so looking back at the

00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:35,670
steps so that was just money I wanted to

00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:37,050
add in because that's not currently

00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:39,120
mentioned in this document so I just

00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:41,760
wanted to put that in the beginning for

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:44,039
the rest of this the work begins once

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,259
the artwork actually reaches is

00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:49,320
given the final sign-off approval by a

00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:50,789
design team member from that point from

00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,590
the sysadmin view we're wanting to make

00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:54,629
sure that then what we're going to be

00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:56,639
pushing up is clear so the name and

00:21:54,629 --> 00:21:58,739
description of the badge that are being

00:21:56,639 --> 00:22:00,090
pushed and if you're not feeling at the

00:21:58,739 --> 00:22:01,769
badge of site this will be you know the

00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:04,529
badge title and the little description

00:22:01,769 --> 00:22:08,580
hover text that goes along with it after

00:22:04,529 --> 00:22:10,679
it's pushed and after that ensure that

00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:13,320
one of the requirements are met that for

00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:15,720
a manually awarded badge like an event

00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:18,509
badge you know what fast accounts are

00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:20,759
going to receive the privileges to award

00:22:18,509 --> 00:22:23,849
it and to make the QR codes and design

00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:26,460
or to award the badge or if it's an

00:22:23,849 --> 00:22:31,349
automatic one that it has a llamo file

00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:34,019
with the rule already created so once

00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:35,309
you've kind of done that the checks to

00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:38,429
make sure everything is all set and

00:22:35,309 --> 00:22:40,559
ready to go and if it's not just comment

00:22:38,429 --> 00:22:43,109
on the issue and remove data push tag

00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:46,229
we're going to actually add the badge

00:22:43,109 --> 00:22:49,229
asset stupid or so the way this works

00:22:46,229 --> 00:22:51,200
and like Nick mentioned earlier if you

00:22:49,229 --> 00:22:54,509
have your laptop open you can try to

00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:57,989
navigate to the fedora badges repository

00:22:54,509 --> 00:22:59,460
on peshawar and clone that down because

00:22:57,989 --> 00:23:01,349
it is there's a lot of design assets in

00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:06,389
there as well and we'll we're using a

00:23:01,349 --> 00:23:08,279
little bit to push the badges so you'll

00:23:06,389 --> 00:23:10,169
take in the issue the way the workflow

00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:12,599
is right now the design team will create

00:23:10,169 --> 00:23:15,450
the design assets and upload them as an

00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:17,879
attachment into the issue - or into the

00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:20,159
ticket for a badge so what we do is

00:23:17,879 --> 00:23:23,570
we'll take the artwork the SVG and the

00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:26,099
PNG and the Amal if if there is one

00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:28,619
we'll make sure that whatever artwork we

00:23:26,099 --> 00:23:31,139
do that we grab is actually valid and

00:23:28,619 --> 00:23:33,629
correct and looks and looks right P is

00:23:31,139 --> 00:23:35,489
example sometimes we've grabbed a PNG

00:23:33,629 --> 00:23:37,619
and the file is corrupt because of

00:23:35,489 --> 00:23:39,619
something on our end and sometimes it's

00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:42,779
been that the SVG was rendered correctly

00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:45,389
but the PNG is like slightly off-center

00:23:42,779 --> 00:23:47,009
there was some minor trivial exporting

00:23:45,389 --> 00:23:48,570
issue so it's just it's just good to

00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:52,349
take a look at it before you go and

00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:54,389
start pushing this up so the other thing

00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:56,549
is once you have them downloaded you'll

00:23:54,389 --> 00:23:56,960
put them into the git repository you'll

00:23:56,549 --> 00:23:58,760
see

00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:02,240
in the repository there's the PNG SVG

00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:04,429
and rules directories just a good rule

00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:07,399
of thumb is make sure that all the files

00:24:04,429 --> 00:24:10,760
you're putting in for both Gamal PNG SVG

00:24:07,399 --> 00:24:14,720
are all the same root file name just to

00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:16,669
keep things sane and we use there is

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:20,120
some functionality that exists to create

00:24:16,669 --> 00:24:22,220
STL files for fedora badges so you can

00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:24,440
like chuck it into a 3d printer and get

00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:26,090
a pretty cool Fedora badge out of it

00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:30,770
it's not perfect they're not really

00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:33,049
clean if you're a 3d printer hobbyist

00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:35,000
they're not really amazing quality but

00:24:33,049 --> 00:24:36,860
it's still pretty decent for just having

00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,590
a script that creates them on the fly

00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:41,990
but because they're pretty big files we

00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:44,299
create them only on request if someone

00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:46,909
is actually asking for them and there's

00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:48,799
more information in the actual in the

00:24:46,909 --> 00:24:50,960
bin directory on how to do this there's

00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:53,110
a nice bash grip that we'll run through

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,110
this

00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:12,740
so how to make the 3d badges nicer or

00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:15,350
easier so currently the the script is

00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:19,100
really dirty because you don't have any

00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:22,040
actual data except colors and 3d

00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:25,280
printing usually is without colors so we

00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:28,190
turn it into grayscale and then we do a

00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:30,800
height map of the colors which doesn't

00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:33,230
really good look good so what you could

00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:37,280
do is to create another version of the

00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:39,650
SVG where only three shades of colors

00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,390
will be use or four and that would make

00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:44,870
it easier to print either color badges

00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:47,210
or because it's easy to print like 4

00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:50,450
colors but buddy you don't print in true

00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:52,970
color or something or already use the

00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:55,220
color information for a 4 height so you

00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:58,100
see like there is a badger so let make

00:25:55,220 --> 00:26:00,110
him plastic a little bit make it I don't

00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:02,870
know darker on the nose and lighter on

00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:04,580
the edge of the face or something like

00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:07,100
that we don't do that so if the batter

00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:08,990
is white it will be flat and then there

00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:11,810
will be like eyes and the black eyes

00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:14,390
will either be holes or Peaks I don't

00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:16,190
remember so it's ugly but if you use the

00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:19,100
color or not to represent color but to

00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:20,990
represent height and has another SVG

00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:23,830
file it can be easily turned into

00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:23,830
freedom patch

00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:31,910
so which denotes which so if it's

00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:34,490
lighter than its flatter and if it's

00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:37,090
darker then it's going to be like a

00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:37,090
taller right

00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:44,139
okay well if we ever want to do that

00:26:42,129 --> 00:26:45,190
again we should figure it out but we but

00:26:44,139 --> 00:26:47,710
that's something we could totally do

00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:49,720
like put in a separate ticket or reopen

00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:58,809
the ticket and say hey we want this 3d

00:26:49,720 --> 00:27:01,059
printed so I'm going back into the

00:26:58,809 --> 00:27:03,639
workflow just keep that in mind for the

00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:05,169
3d printing for at least how things are

00:27:03,639 --> 00:27:07,269
right now script that does have some of

00:27:05,169 --> 00:27:09,250
the caveats we mentioned here once you

00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:12,159
have all the files in the right place in

00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:15,190
the directories the PNG SVG yam rule

00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:17,620
file you will commit the files and push

00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:20,399
them to the Fedora badges repository or

00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:22,809
just make a pull request for these files

00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:25,090
just rule of thumb on these is just make

00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:27,370
sure that they have same names there's

00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:29,470
not really a documented like you need to

00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:31,659
name your files this way but you'll see

00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:33,220
like if you look into the repository all

00:27:31,659 --> 00:27:35,500
the bat there's some badges that are

00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:37,990
awarded when you are added to a Fedora

00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:39,279
account system group and all of those

00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:42,700
are named like fast

00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:44,860
- group name so just try to follow best

00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:46,960
precedent when you see it try not to

00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:48,460
read it just makes things easier to find

00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,669
if we're looking for different kinds of

00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:54,399
badges so just use your use your best

00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:56,080
judgment for what to name the file so

00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:57,789
this is the intermediary step I

00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,259
mentioned earlier so you've pushed the

00:27:57,789 --> 00:28:02,289
badges into peshawar

00:27:59,259 --> 00:28:05,379
you can merge the files in now what

00:28:02,289 --> 00:28:07,809
happens so once everything is in the

00:28:05,379 --> 00:28:09,490
master branch of the repo you're going

00:28:07,809 --> 00:28:11,889
to need to move them from the Fedora

00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:14,529
repository to the badges back-end server

00:28:11,889 --> 00:28:17,289
and this is done via an ansible playbook

00:28:14,529 --> 00:28:18,340
that will take the pressure or clone the

00:28:17,289 --> 00:28:20,559
page or posit Ori

00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:23,049
and put them into the badges back-end

00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:26,110
and then restart the server so the files

00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:28,659
are present on the machine so this is

00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:31,750
currently to do this you have to be a

00:28:28,659 --> 00:28:34,500
member of the sysadmin badges fast group

00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:38,289
which has a prereq of the sysadmin

00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:39,909
fast group as well so for this one you

00:28:38,289 --> 00:28:42,490
can generally just paying a member of

00:28:39,909 --> 00:28:45,309
the current member of the sysadmin

00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:48,360
badges group or ask an infrastructure

00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:52,470
member to run this playbook the

00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:54,270
push badges playbook so this one doesn't

00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:55,710
really apply for not or isn't really

00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:57,480
that helpful if you're not in the fast

00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:58,670
group but it's helpful to understand

00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,929
that this is the this is the

00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:03,870
intermediary step this is the

00:29:00,929 --> 00:29:05,850
infrastructure portion of actually

00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:08,010
taking those design assets and moving

00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:09,570
them to the badges back-end so then you

00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:14,070
can actually interact or so that they're

00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:16,620
present on the on the badges dot Fedora

00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:18,420
project Ward website so I'm just kind of

00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:23,160
gonna skip through this one really quick

00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:24,690
but so there's like we mentioned earlier

00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,970
there's the two kinds of badges that are

00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:28,980
generated there's the automatic badges

00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:31,200
and there's the manually awarded badges

00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:33,510
and they have two different ways of

00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,730
being created the automatic badges are

00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:38,250
actually I think easier because you can

00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:40,380
just do it in the page or positive and

00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:43,080
when the ansible playbook runs it will

00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:45,240
create the badge when the badges back in

00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:47,370
is restarted the reason why this happens

00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:50,580
is because like you saw earlier the

00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:52,590
automatic badges have a rule file but

00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:54,600
you didn't see in the screenshots and

00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:56,669
the examples earlier is there's actually

00:29:54,600 --> 00:30:00,240
an entire section that has like the name

00:29:56,669 --> 00:30:03,000
the description the original discussion

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:05,130
the original issue for the badge and you

00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,950
can specify those in the Hamill rule

00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:10,260
file so when you're making a pull

00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:12,900
request or a commit to the page or to

00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:15,240
the fedora badges repository you also

00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:17,010
have all that info in the yamo file so

00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:19,049
when you you know push it into the repo

00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:23,130
run the ansible playbook the server

00:30:19,049 --> 00:30:25,650
restarts the tahrir front-end creates

00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:27,960
the badge on that restart so you don't

00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:29,700
have to do anything except go to the

00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:32,010
badge on the front end and add tags

00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:34,770
that's the only manual step you have to

00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:36,840
do if it's an automatic badge if it's

00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:39,900
not an automatic badge you have to do a

00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:42,059
few more steps I think I can just show

00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:45,020
this kind of really quick what that

00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:48,679
front-end looks like for the badges site

00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:48,679
if I'm signed in

00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:53,919
yeah so this is what the admin portion

00:30:51,819 --> 00:30:57,159
of it looks like it's not super

00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:58,929
intuitive and but one 1k so one caveat

00:30:57,159 --> 00:31:02,589
is like if you enter bad information in

00:30:58,929 --> 00:31:05,289
this front-end it's very hard to correct

00:31:02,589 --> 00:31:07,419
it which is why generally I prefer the

00:31:05,289 --> 00:31:10,149
way of the automatic badges of doing it

00:31:07,419 --> 00:31:12,579
in the yamo rule file so let's say the

00:31:10,149 --> 00:31:14,709
badges I pushed it to the master branch

00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:17,139
of the page or repository the ansible

00:31:14,709 --> 00:31:21,429
playbook is run what do I do now so

00:31:17,139 --> 00:31:24,699
there's a section down below for adding

00:31:21,429 --> 00:31:27,189
a new badge to be awarded so just like

00:31:24,699 --> 00:31:30,519
in the amal rule file you'll give it the

00:31:27,189 --> 00:31:33,399
name image so this is actually going to

00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:45,369
be i think i give an example of the URL

00:31:33,399 --> 00:31:46,839
string and that dock but I was just

00:31:45,369 --> 00:31:50,139
gonna explain I'll make sure to explain

00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:53,319
that one because of the categories yeah

00:31:50,139 --> 00:31:55,419
so for the front for the artwork that

00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:58,359
actually is pushed to the front end that

00:31:55,419 --> 00:32:02,259
is generated based on the name of the

00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:03,759
file of the of the artwork so that's why

00:32:02,259 --> 00:32:05,169
again like the file names I think are

00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:07,989
pretty important because it just makes

00:32:05,169 --> 00:32:11,439
it easier to locate the artwork so in

00:32:07,989 --> 00:32:13,689
this case there's a badge that if you

00:32:11,439 --> 00:32:17,399
were to go look in the repository right

00:32:13,689 --> 00:32:20,259
now you'll find the kama superstar badge

00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:22,479
and so after that ansible playbook runs

00:32:20,259 --> 00:32:25,809
if you're going to push a manual badge

00:32:22,479 --> 00:32:28,559
you'll find that the artwork for that

00:32:25,809 --> 00:32:28,559
badge is

00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:36,250
yes so you'll see that the example of

00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:39,430
this will be you know the badges website

00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:41,140
slash P and G's and then the name of

00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:43,330
your badge that you push to the page or

00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:45,700
apposite or e so after that ansible

00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:47,290
playbook runs you can actually take that

00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:49,060
artwork and you'll have to go and double

00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:50,530
check you know go to that URL make sure

00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:53,710
that it's there it looks right

00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:56,530
you know you'll copy that and you'll put

00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:58,270
it into the tahrir front end in this

00:32:56,530 --> 00:33:02,290
slot so you're actually putting like a

00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:04,150
full fully valid URL into that field the

00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:07,660
description is just the hover text that

00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:09,880
pops up on the badge criteria so there

00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:12,420
is the little subtext there but like the

00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:15,130
issue where the badge was discussed or

00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:17,350
created by the design team the issue

00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:19,330
link is what goes in that field which

00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:20,860
gives us a point of reference if we need

00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:23,620
to look back on the history of when a

00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:25,390
badge was created or we need to you know

00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:27,340
maybe a rule is broke and we need to

00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:29,260
update it we can look back and see where

00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:33,670
the original discussion was and make

00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:35,200
adjustments if needed issuer that one

00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:36,670
just leave as the default I think if

00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,950
that is the only option so you don't

00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:40,690
have to worry about it and tags and this

00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:44,530
is exactly what Nick was talking about

00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:47,950
earlier so tags are a little bit tricky

00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:50,950
so the way tahrir works is there in the

00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:54,390
tahrir application you can specify a set

00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:57,010
of tags that will display on the main

00:33:54,390 --> 00:34:01,420
application pay or the main page of the

00:33:57,010 --> 00:34:03,910
badges website so I'll show you on if we

00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:11,140
go to look at some of the badges here go

00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:13,440
let's go explore explore and pull this

00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:13,440
up

00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:22,859
you'll see we go to the badge index

00:34:18,919 --> 00:34:25,619
there are the content badges there are

00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:29,129
the development badges the community

00:34:25,619 --> 00:34:31,919
badges and the quality badges and then

00:34:29,129 --> 00:34:33,659
event badges and miscellaneous after

00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:35,940
that so I'm just going to open one of

00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:37,849
these ones up look at the flock 2018

00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:42,240
badge just to see how that one was done

00:34:37,849 --> 00:34:45,869
so with these five categories these five

00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:49,829
tags those are special tags so the way

00:34:45,869 --> 00:34:51,659
the we do things now every badge you

00:34:49,829 --> 00:34:52,950
might have noticed actually with all of

00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:55,409
those each group but each of those

00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:57,599
special tags had like a frame like had

00:34:55,409 --> 00:35:00,150
different colored borders on the badges

00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:05,099
had different color backgrounds that's

00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:07,650
actually part of the design yeah the

00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:11,069
design scheme for the badges so a badge

00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:13,319
will only ever have one of those tags

00:35:11,069 --> 00:35:15,119
and it's important it only has one of

00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:17,190
those tags so you don't have a content

00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:19,770
and community badge because then it will

00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:22,200
show up in both of those parts of the of

00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:23,940
the web application but if you look a

00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:26,849
little closer and let me zoom in on this

00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:29,700
so you can actually see it so for the

00:35:26,849 --> 00:35:35,069
flock 2018 badge you have three tags

00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:37,440
here oh should be should be two this is

00:35:35,069 --> 00:35:40,079
this is again why it's not the cleanest

00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,180
thing it's actually the events tag that

00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,460
is the correct tag that will make it

00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:46,500
show up in that front-end web

00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:49,020
application under the badges or the

00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:50,849
events category but you'll also see it

00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:53,160
has other tags that are helpful just for

00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:55,230
sorting purposes like pack and I could

00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:57,210
find another badge that has some like

00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:58,440
for example for an event badge if it's

00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:01,380
like a lap tam event

00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:03,210
I'll give it like event maybe the name

00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:05,339
of the event fleece all and then I'll

00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:07,859
give it a lot ham tag so then you can go

00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:10,650
and look at all the badges for latam

00:36:07,859 --> 00:36:14,069
events or for all past flee Sol's or so

00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:16,710
on and so forth but because of the fact

00:36:14,069 --> 00:36:19,470
that all those groups on the front are

00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:24,599
just special tags you have to be careful

00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:26,780
about what you fill in in that tags

00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:28,820
field on the badges site

00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:30,710
so once you've done all that you've put

00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:33,470
all that information in there you hit

00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:36,260
the Add badge button magic voodoo

00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:38,770
happens and the badge will actually end

00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:41,990
up in that badge index on the front page

00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:44,840
and so at that point congratulations you

00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:46,790
have pushed a new badge and for the

00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:50,510
people who are just coming in now

00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:52,130
if you want to take a look at some of

00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:53,660
these links

00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:55,910
I would definitely we're kind of going

00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:57,290
through this second link right here so

00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:59,210
you can pull this up and follow along

00:36:57,290 --> 00:37:01,790
with the SOP as we're going through it

00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:03,620
all of the action for fedora badges is

00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:05,390
happening here so I want to give you a

00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:12,770
chance to pull that up if you're just

00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:15,620
getting in here yeah so there is a

00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:19,160
little bug which I probably I guess I

00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:23,990
need to file an issue about if you add

00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:29,780
the category tag when you create a

00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:34,520
manual badge it doesn't work like if you

00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:39,440
look try pull up the one that I was

00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:43,430
working on for the advocates it shows up

00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:48,560
as uncatted or eyes at go back later and

00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:51,140
add the tags don't add the tags when you

00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:54,650
push the badge or when you create the

00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:57,320
badge I guess yeah so what saying

00:37:54,650 --> 00:38:00,620
so if you forget to add the tags no no

00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:03,710
no no no no do not add the tags when you

00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:06,980
create the badge in the web interface it

00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:10,040
there is a bug and tahrir does not see

00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:13,790
the category though so go back and add

00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:17,330
the tags later okay you can go to the

00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:19,700
you can go to the badge page and if

00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:24,220
you're an admin you have an option for

00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:28,820
adding tags and because for some reason

00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:33,490
tahrir does not see it if you add the

00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:38,440
category whenever you create the badge

00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:38,440
there's some sort of bug so

00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:45,220
yes yeah so I'll be an action item for

00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,510
us so just to clarify there's a feel

00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:48,070
from the app when you're logged in as an

00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:50,200
administrator where you can go in and

00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:52,810
add tags to a badge retro and retro

00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:54,490
store retrospectively so the best

00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:56,620
practice for this is actually to do this

00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:58,480
after the badge is created I did not

00:38:56,620 --> 00:39:03,070
know that so thanks for thanks for

00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:04,390
specifying that this I mentioned I think

00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:05,890
we've kind of ran through this when I

00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:07,980
was in the tahrir front-end but this is

00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:10,060
just a reference for the badge metadata

00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:12,970
again like what all those different

00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:14,740
fields mean I didn't explain all these

00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:16,270
so I'm not going to spend too much time

00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:17,500
other than making sure that if you are

00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:20,590
in the front-end make sure there's no

00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:25,330
hanging whitespace in the description

00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:26,620
field and again like for the tags make

00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:28,990
sure that your when you're entering a

00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:32,260
tag you're following previous precedent

00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:33,970
you're following trying to avoid

00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:37,150
creating new tags because it's easy to

00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:40,000
add new tags but removing tags is much

00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:43,780
more difficult and involves sequel query

00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:46,510
writing magic so now once you've done

00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:49,990
all these things you have taken the

00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:51,880
issue of the artwork from the design

00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:55,060
assets from the designer of the preserve

00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:56,320
fedora badges issue you have committed

00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:58,150
them into the master branch at the

00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,430
repository the ansible

00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:02,530
run and whether it's an automatic or

00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:06,460
manual badge it has been added to the

00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:09,610
front end of the badges application the

00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:11,800
final steps is just to start you know

00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:13,450
close out the issue so you'll go to the

00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:16,330
original ticket where the badge was

00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:17,950
discussed oh and before you do this

00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:19,690
megha actually looks right make sure you

00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:21,550
go find your badge make sure it's tagged

00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:23,530
correctly make sure it's look it appears

00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:26,290
in the categories you're expecting it to

00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:27,700
appear in the artworks not wrong just do

00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:30,370
a quick look to make sure everything

00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:34,720
looks right if it does go back to the

00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:37,780
ticket in the fedora badges pidor and

00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:39,190
you can close it or if you're making a

00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:40,750
pull request as a new contributor you

00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:43,060
can say are you point to your pull

00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:45,340
request if you did but what we do is

00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:48,340
we'll go to the issue we'll close it out

00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:50,500
as complete and just best practice is

00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:51,220
post a link to where you can find that

00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,020
badge

00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:54,790
after you publish it so give it the link

00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:57,339
to the badges dot Fedora project at org

00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:59,800
and if it was a manual badge please list

00:40:57,339 --> 00:41:02,619
the fast user names of any users that

00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:06,849
have authorization credentials for that

00:41:02,619 --> 00:41:09,880
badge and so that's the last step of

00:41:06,849 --> 00:41:11,290
like the workflow process I don't think

00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:13,839
we have to cover the rest of this this

00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:15,250
is more the sysadmin scripts you're

00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:17,670
welcome to go through this on your on

00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:19,990
your own later but that's kind of the

00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:24,010
the quick overview of the actual

00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:26,800
workflow of how we push badges so from

00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:28,869
there now we actually wanted to give

00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:32,859
everyone a chance to get hands on a

00:41:28,869 --> 00:41:35,410
quick question so I have to leave in a

00:41:32,859 --> 00:41:38,619
minute to go to the outreach e showcase

00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:41,380
but something I wanted to ask this part

00:41:38,619 --> 00:41:46,420
of badges is is there any interest in

00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:50,440
like redoing the website may be making

00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:53,349
badges a dashboard thing in Fedora is

00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:54,730
there any way to like I mean or is there

00:41:53,349 --> 00:41:56,890
any interest there I know there's ways

00:41:54,730 --> 00:42:01,150
but is there any interest in kind of

00:41:56,890 --> 00:42:04,030
updating or improving the UI for it

00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:07,810
because I just I think it's a little

00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:11,170
tired I think it's a little old and I

00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:14,290
think maybe we could gain a little more

00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:17,650
usage and excitement out of it if it

00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:19,750
didn't look the way that it does so I

00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:23,349
just wanted to bring that up and I'd be

00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:25,540
willing to help from the design side of

00:42:23,349 --> 00:42:27,310
it I don't have a ton of experience but

00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:30,160
this won't give me a chance to get that

00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:32,109
experience in building something new

00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:35,079
there so you know I'd like to hear

00:42:32,109 --> 00:42:37,300
people's thoughts on that yes so one

00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:39,720
other thing is we probably wanted to

00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:43,089
move this is a federal bootstrap layout

00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:46,000
to unified it with the projects that we

00:42:43,089 --> 00:42:48,280
have in Federer but as you see another

00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,730
thing is yes we have a couple of pages

00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:54,369
we really don't use but then a few

00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:56,730
things are like if you can first thing

00:42:54,369 --> 00:42:59,790
is if we can like make it similar

00:42:56,730 --> 00:43:03,250
compliant with the federal bus trap and

00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:04,040
have a better admin page that would be a

00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:06,950
very good

00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:11,090
and then in general if we can have the

00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:14,270
profile page um a bit better with a few

00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:16,190
more data in there so yes there was so

00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:18,620
right now I talked about a couple of

00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:20,600
people in this said that if we can

00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:23,500
there's like if we can improve the

00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:26,360
federal budgets UI and like right now it

00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:29,230
feels very dull and blah keys

00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:33,170
so is there any way to integrate it into

00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:33,680
fedora like you know just what you open

00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:38,270
up

00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:40,010
I don't know dashboard kind of a maybe a

00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:41,570
mobile app but like like opening it up

00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:43,220
on your computer or maybe you see it

00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:45,620
it's like a notification like it comes

00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:46,850
up pops up and says I don't know like I

00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:49,610
get like an higher see a notification

00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:53,060
like this person messaged me can you do

00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:59,240
that like you got this badge can we get

00:43:53,060 --> 00:44:00,830
it like more integrated with and like

00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:03,080
maybe like you could pull it up somehow

00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:07,640
and and see like all the badges you've

00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:09,920
earned or I'm just kind of yeah I'm

00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:12,770
trying to I just wish that it was a

00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:21,440
little bit more integrated with like you

00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:22,760
know actually using fedora a quick idea

00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,260
since you mentioned the outreach session

00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:27,470
and I know the call for mentors is

00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:29,600
opening up or has opened and is in the

00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:30,620
process of happening thinking it could

00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:34,910
actually be a really nice

00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:36,860
outreach II project to have a fedora

00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:39,020
like to work on the tahrir front end and

00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:40,100
try to revamp the UI UX because I know a

00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:42,740
lot of we've had a lot of like really

00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:45,260
great success stories in fedora with UI

00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:48,740
UX like with fedora hubs and with

00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:50,420
there's another prime I think was again

00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:51,650
is the fedora Android application but

00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:53,390
there's been some other ones that I know

00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:55,400
this has been a very great like kind of

00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:58,490
niche for us and outreach e so this

00:44:55,400 --> 00:45:00,740
could be like a sidebar we could have

00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:02,300
maybe after this session about trying to

00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:04,070
combine is I think it'd be helpful have

00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:06,260
the design point of view and the

00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:08,870
development point of view for like a

00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:13,310
project to work on so who would be like

00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:16,940
the mentor for a you know UI side

00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:19,490
this I can't personally like commit the

00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:20,000
time to do that yeah this point in my

00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:23,240
life

00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,830
yeah so we would have to find someone

00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:27,830
willing and maybe like it would have to

00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:30,290
be a design person and a development

00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:32,390
person together helping that that

00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:34,430
individual yeah I think if we can try to

00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:38,750
query around on the or do you want to

00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:42,140
add so uh Ryan was interested in

00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:44,150
building the changing the UI and working

00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:45,860
on that but probably did not get time so

00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:48,080
probably we can talk to Ryan on this

00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:49,880
like if he is able to mentor someone on

00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:53,930
this because he knows the development

00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:57,340
side and the design side so I think you

00:45:53,930 --> 00:45:57,340
would be a great a great choice for that

00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:08,240
okay so for all of you that are here now

00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:11,450
we're going to try to do some actual

00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:14,540
pushing pushing some badges live right

00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:16,790
now in the remainder of this workshop so

00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:21,200
if you still have the the tool box that

00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:23,450
I mentioned earlier these links here

00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:27,020
we're going to look at the page or

00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:30,800
repository really quick so if you go to

00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:33,740
the the issues tab on page or and you

00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:36,850
find the ready to push tag and I'll zoom

00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:39,230
in here so it's not as painful to see

00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:40,700
but if you go to the ready to push tag

00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:44,680
you'll see there's actually a series of

00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:48,410
badges that are ready to be pushed live

00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:50,840
to the front end so now we're gonna make

00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:52,240
this less you know less talking and

00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:54,290
talking

00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:56,390
speaker audience and we're gonna make

00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:58,520
this more like a hands-on workshop so

00:46:56,390 --> 00:47:00,380
anyone that wants to jump in how this

00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:02,180
will work is we can kind of divide up

00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:04,450
some of these tickets they are ready to

00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:04,450
push

00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,760
[Music]

00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,880
sorry

00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:26,920
you'll rise to find out that you'll see

00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:29,549
the secret secret extra block right

00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:29,549
yes

00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:33,259
so

00:48:38,359 --> 00:48:47,340
is automatic the lock pictures one it's

00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:51,500
a weird Google+ you should I think

00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:51,500
broke Flickr or Google+

00:48:53,079 --> 00:49:00,410
yeah so before we all right well I just

00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:04,070
wanted to give a chance for people to

00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:07,369
look at some badges that we can try to

00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:08,900
push out and someone just that Matt well

00:49:07,369 --> 00:49:10,130
we're gonna kind of do a ticket triage

00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:11,990
or some of these other ones so we can

00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:14,329
maybe do that while we're going through

00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:16,630
I don't have a chance to look at this

00:49:14,329 --> 00:49:16,630
one

00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:24,210
I don't think there is

00:49:25,369 --> 00:49:29,690
so we have some that need we're fighting

00:49:28,039 --> 00:49:32,269
to have rules files created and we have

00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:34,729
some that just need to take the artwork

00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:38,960
and can be made into a full request but

00:49:34,729 --> 00:49:40,640
they're all on to the page or side I'm

00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,660
just trying to find some that the way

00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,789
this will work is that some wants to

00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:46,009
take one on will assign a ticket to you

00:49:43,789 --> 00:49:48,499
to work on during this workshop you can

00:49:46,009 --> 00:49:51,289
try to run through this workflow on your

00:49:48,499 --> 00:49:53,630
own do it and then we'll run the ansible

00:49:51,289 --> 00:49:56,420
playbook and you'll have a chance to

00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:58,160
actually see your badge if you made a

00:49:56,420 --> 00:50:04,219
pull request for make it onto the front

00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:07,059
end I think one of these is a good

00:50:04,219 --> 00:50:07,059
candidate here

00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:12,520
or of this one

00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:23,130
what I did recently is when I see a

00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:26,340
issue for a badge that says ready to

00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:29,400
push and there is a missing ya know file

00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:31,230
I removed the ready to push tag because

00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:40,350
it's not ready to push because it

00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:44,840
doesn't have a gamma file so what do you

00:50:40,350 --> 00:50:48,690
actually what is possible to do now as

00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:53,130
federal Woman's Day 2018 attendee

00:50:48,690 --> 00:50:55,140
because that's manual flock 2018 and 17

00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:58,230
contributor batches that's also manual

00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:59,400
could be done here and for the automatic

00:50:58,230 --> 00:51:01,740
ones you would need to check the RULES

00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:11,790
files which i think is maybe too much

00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:13,620
for a beginner right now yeah first

00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:14,760
group should be easy because there are

00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:17,660
other fast groups

00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:17,660
Yama's

00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:38,270
so I say these three are probably some

00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:41,270
of the best ones to start with the

00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:43,280
easier ones would be better just artwork

00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:44,480
like design assets would be the Fedora

00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,400
Women's Day attendee and their

00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:48,770
contributor badge if you want to try

00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:50,930
your hand at writing a llamo file like a

00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:53,810
yeah no rule file this is would be also

00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:56,750
a good one to look at the Fedora atomic

00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:58,490
bag request this one is just when

00:51:56,750 --> 00:52:00,350
someone joins a fast group they're

00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:02,120
awarded the badge once there they are

00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:04,250
enjoying their sponsor into the fast

00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:07,940
group there's some good examples that

00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:09,700
are already in the visual repository in

00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:12,230
the rules file you can

00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:15,290
so anyone want to try working on these

00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:17,950
during the workshop or assignment get up

00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:17,950
and sign the ticket

00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:25,349
try your hand just doing a forward flip

00:52:22,719 --> 00:52:25,349
zone

00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:30,789
have you been able to pull down the

00:52:27,539 --> 00:52:34,710
github or the page or repository that's

00:52:30,789 --> 00:52:34,710
kind of a big

00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,380
one two three yeah we have free tickets

00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:51,960
but four batches because the flock one

00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:54,240
is two years 2018 and 2017 and we have

00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:55,740
four people in here who'd never pushed a

00:52:54,240 --> 00:53:01,080
badge if you had never pushed a bench

00:52:55,740 --> 00:53:02,880
okay so it's got to be mandatory because

00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:07,080
you don't see very enthusiastic about

00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:08,940
picking a badge so whoever feels for

00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:12,930
writing samyamaa that will be

00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:22,170
voluntarily and if nobody wanted copy

00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:25,710
pasting it yeah so who wants to yeah we

00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:28,619
actually have one person for one person

00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:35,280
so it's gonna be a pair pushing of

00:53:28,619 --> 00:53:38,160
badges are you in no okay then a one

00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:42,560
person is already running away so we can

00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:45,240
do the flock patches s1 what about you

00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:48,080
not really okay so let's just scratch it

00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:48,080
and go for lunch

00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:04,880
like take some time to sit down and just

00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:15,020
profile some issues or make some

00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:16,940
milestone we have no volunteers for

00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:27,350
actually hands on maybe you couldn't

00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:29,600
life push something on the yet so there

00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:32,300
were live push um let's see

00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:36,340
I mean do I guess this one is probably

00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:38,300
more immediate right the flock 2018 oh

00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:39,500
I'll do it I'll do one that's just a

00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:43,550
single batch I'll do the one with the

00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:47,240
rule file for a fedora atomic so I'm

00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:51,740
coming in on this one so I see that it's

00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:55,840
been ready to push I just want to get

00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:55,840
some historical context on this one

00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:03,850
so someone will probably need to be

00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:05,740
awarded manual privileges to award

00:55:03,850 --> 00:55:08,910
because they have some people who are

00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:14,910
already in the group oh and there is the

00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:14,910
the mapping could just do that

00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:20,920
little badges I think I have direct

00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:23,920
commented that now I think I have to

00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:27,269
submit a patch to the mailing list now

00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:27,269
so that's helpful

00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:32,690
okay now this scene is pretty

00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:36,170
straightforward so they don't have the

00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:37,490
rule file written but they have the

00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:42,040
design assets done

00:55:37,490 --> 00:55:42,040
where are the last design assets

00:55:47,990 --> 00:55:53,169
hmm

00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:55,150
I did this looks like a confused ticket

00:55:53,169 --> 00:55:57,249
because they want to make it manually

00:55:55,150 --> 00:56:02,349
averted which is something I wouldn't

00:55:57,249 --> 00:56:04,359
rather do anyways yeah why don't you see

00:56:02,349 --> 00:56:05,349
the floor woman day ticket then yeah you

00:56:04,359 --> 00:56:16,439
gotta be that should be straightforward

00:56:05,349 --> 00:56:16,439
yeah okay so this one have the view past

00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:24,759
or artwork approved by marina here so

00:56:22,239 --> 00:56:27,519
this one is ready to go so in this case

00:56:24,759 --> 00:56:32,640
I'm just going to grab the this is the

00:56:27,519 --> 00:56:32,640
PNG and the SVG

00:56:49,289 --> 00:56:53,079
nothing I don't like about the gnome

00:56:51,339 --> 00:56:55,179
terminal is I can I can zoom in with my

00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:58,509
keyboard but I can't actually zoom out

00:56:55,179 --> 00:57:02,199
with the shortcut the shortcut hasn't

00:56:58,509 --> 00:57:07,869
worked me I do control ya control - and

00:57:02,199 --> 00:57:11,079
oh never it's been broken for me for a

00:57:07,869 --> 00:57:17,019
long time little room

00:57:11,079 --> 00:57:21,219
I've got badges so I always do a git

00:57:17,019 --> 00:57:25,539
pull before I push a new badge because

00:57:21,219 --> 00:57:27,479
the odds are I've missed some new badges

00:57:25,539 --> 00:57:30,189
that have been pushed since I last did a

00:57:27,479 --> 00:57:32,619
because I last pushed a badge so I

00:57:30,189 --> 00:57:35,259
always pull down any any last changes

00:57:32,619 --> 00:57:36,489
since mine or since I've last finish

00:57:35,259 --> 00:57:37,569
though you'll probably see there's a

00:57:36,489 --> 00:57:39,519
bunch of stuff that's gonna get pulled

00:57:37,569 --> 00:57:41,849
in here I don't know how long this will

00:57:39,519 --> 00:57:44,410
take with the conference well just a few

00:57:41,849 --> 00:57:46,299
so that's done I'm now on the amount on

00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:56,429
the latest commit for master branch so

00:57:46,299 --> 00:57:56,429
I'm going to just grab the justly long

00:57:56,819 --> 00:58:01,229
titles I was going to put them here for

00:57:58,839 --> 00:58:01,229
a sec

00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:13,500
so I think the precedent for these is

00:58:10,330 --> 00:58:16,090
actually is going to be the event name

00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:19,830
so I can just by do as it was a referred

00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:25,000
or a woman day bad last year yeah it's a

00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:30,880
FWD - attendee and then there is WT -

00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:36,420
attendee - 2017 so this one so I'm just

00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:46,500
going to put the PNG in here FWD 10 D

00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:54,760
2018 and the SVG to do the same FWD

00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:55,990
attendee 2018 excellent so now that I

00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:57,190
have them in the right place oh and

00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:58,750
actually let's make sure that the

00:58:57,190 --> 00:59:01,900
artwork is actually good because I've

00:58:58,750 --> 00:59:06,760
done that before where I've grabbed the

00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:09,400
PNG yep looks like it should so I have

00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:11,770
both of the files and get oh and I have

00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:17,320
one that shouldn't be there I have a

00:59:11,770 --> 00:59:19,390
dirty working tree it really is that I'm

00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:22,480
just gonna move that one away

00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:26,310
okay so you'll see I have the two badges

00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:36,960
I'm just going to go ahead and do ad

00:59:26,310 --> 00:59:36,960
fedora Women's Day 2018 attendee artwork

00:59:40,089 --> 00:59:46,029
and since and now if your don't have

00:59:43,089 --> 00:59:48,249
access at this point you would just do a

00:59:46,029 --> 00:59:51,969
pull request you'd have forked the

00:59:48,249 --> 00:59:53,619
repository you the best practice would

00:59:51,969 --> 00:59:55,569
be to create a new branch on your forked

00:59:53,619 --> 00:59:58,569
repository and then push your changes to

00:59:55,569 --> 01:00:00,759
that branch and then you could go to

00:59:58,569 --> 01:00:03,910
peshawar and make the pull request to

01:00:00,759 --> 01:00:05,349
the Fedora - badges repository in this

01:00:03,910 --> 01:00:07,509
case I'm just going to push directly

01:00:05,349 --> 01:00:11,289
since I have access and just so we can

01:00:07,509 --> 01:00:14,069
kind of move things along so it's going

01:00:11,289 --> 01:00:14,069
to take a second

01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:21,660
don't ya

01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:31,869
let's try that one more time so there

01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:34,750
was a stay for the recording context

01:00:31,869 --> 01:00:37,030
there was a a new commit at it upstream

01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:38,380
while I was I was working on it so now

01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:45,010
we have it pushed it's on the master

01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:46,270
branch if we go to the shore repository

01:00:45,010 --> 01:00:50,880
I'm gonna close these since we don't

01:00:46,270 --> 01:00:50,880
need them let's see if they're here

01:00:51,600 --> 01:01:01,780
so you'll see P and G's FW or Fedora FWD

01:00:57,780 --> 01:01:03,970
make my life easier hey and there it is

01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:07,990
the 2018 edition of this badge so now

01:01:03,970 --> 01:01:09,760
that that's done the one of you do the

01:01:07,990 --> 01:01:12,750
ansible playbook run yes I do not have

01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:12,750
my two FA with me

01:01:15,099 --> 01:01:20,359
okay so this would be the point where if

01:01:18,859 --> 01:01:24,619
you're not in the system and badges

01:01:20,359 --> 01:01:26,329
group you'd want to drop a ping to one

01:01:24,619 --> 01:01:35,000
of like one any of the four of us in

01:01:26,329 --> 01:01:36,380
this room or two okay oh okay sure so at

01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,339
this point either asked one of like the

01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:40,220
four of us that you see here in this

01:01:37,339 --> 01:01:42,410
room you can just ping us an IRC or you

01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:46,460
could go to the Fedora - admin channel

01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:47,809
on freenode and just ask the on-call or

01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:57,770
another member of the infrastructure

01:01:47,809 --> 01:01:58,790
team why would you run the PlayBook but

01:01:57,770 --> 01:02:00,410
if you don't know who to ask you can

01:01:58,790 --> 01:02:02,420
just put you can just ask the question

01:02:00,410 --> 01:02:05,710
and fedora - yeah or and one of us

01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:09,440
should see it there - do dot members

01:02:05,710 --> 01:02:13,450
sysadmin - Badgers and that will tell

01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:13,450
you with Zod bot yeah

01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:27,830
cool okay so my run I just ran the push

01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:30,200
badges because I was pushing I just ran

01:02:27,830 --> 01:02:38,960
the push badges because I was pushing

01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:41,840
the flock contributor one so our back

01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:45,320
PlayBook is a script that's basically a

01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:49,220
wrapper around ansible playbook to allow

01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:53,570
people that are not in sysadmin main to

01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:57,170
run specified ansible play books which

01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:59,690
is defined by what fast groups you're in

01:02:57,170 --> 01:03:02,570
our back playbook will either allow you

01:02:59,690 --> 01:03:08,810
to run about a playbook or not allow you

01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:14,180
to run a playbook and normally you have

01:03:08,810 --> 01:03:18,880
to it'll say what is it password plus

01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:22,670
token or something password plus token

01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:25,580
and you type in your fast password and

01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:29,200
then either a you baqi that you've

01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:36,080
configured with fedora burn you Becky or

01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:38,870
a totp token that you can set up using

01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:43,910
Google Authenticator free OTP or

01:03:38,870 --> 01:03:47,120
whatever program you prefer but since

01:03:43,910 --> 01:03:52,580
I've just done sudo a few minutes ago it

01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:57,760
did not prompt for credentials and you

01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:57,760
can see what all it says it's doing

01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:05,770
that would be our badge images with the

01:04:03,350 --> 01:04:05,770
yellow text

01:04:11,740 --> 01:04:16,859
and there's actually a badge for running

01:04:14,290 --> 01:04:16,859
a playbook

01:04:18,819 --> 01:04:31,829
yes yes it's based off a Fed message and

01:04:26,739 --> 01:04:31,829
our back playbook publishes Fed message

01:04:37,170 --> 01:04:40,720
so all this one is doing in the

01:04:39,010 --> 01:04:44,440
background is just taking the git

01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:47,530
repository cloning it onto the badges

01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:52,120
back-end server and once it does that

01:04:47,530 --> 01:04:55,360
moves I think in the right place it will

01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:57,100
restart the badges back-end server and

01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:59,170
that's what will make the arm work

01:04:57,100 --> 01:05:03,190
available to you when you go hit the URL

01:04:59,170 --> 01:05:07,840
I think it I think it only restarts the

01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:09,850
backend server if there are rules or no

01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:12,370
I guess it doesn't know if there's rules

01:05:09,850 --> 01:05:14,620
or not I think I'm okay I guess it's for

01:05:12,370 --> 01:05:19,390
any get it doesn't really have to

01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:23,650
restart that if it's just a SVG or PNG

01:05:19,390 --> 01:05:28,210
because those just get shoved there okay

01:05:23,650 --> 01:05:30,460
so now so now it shows that everything

01:05:28,210 --> 01:05:33,970
finished it even tells you how long it

01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:38,670
took to do everything everything is

01:05:33,970 --> 01:05:40,620
either okay or changed which is good

01:05:38,670 --> 01:05:43,299
awesome

01:05:40,620 --> 01:05:46,959
Thank You Nick

01:05:43,299 --> 01:05:49,149
all right so now now that's all been

01:05:46,959 --> 01:05:52,809
done if you go and take a look at the

01:05:49,149 --> 01:05:58,359
badges site it's there so now I just hit

01:05:52,809 --> 01:06:00,489
this URL this is the FWD attendee 2018

01:05:58,359 --> 01:06:03,729
URL that we just pushed so that is now

01:06:00,489 --> 01:06:06,369
there on the public web that we just

01:06:03,729 --> 01:06:08,319
push live from the page or positive so

01:06:06,369 --> 01:06:10,779
that is that that was what this happened

01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:12,880
here so since it's a manual badge like

01:06:10,779 --> 01:06:18,099
ice we were talking about earlier with

01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:19,269
the manual awarding I'm going to I send

01:06:18,099 --> 01:06:20,979
them at my life a little easier I'm just

01:06:19,269 --> 01:06:24,179
gonna mirror these displays I'm not like

01:06:20,979 --> 01:06:24,179
craning my neck around

01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:33,180
that's a little ugly maybe not

01:06:35,209 --> 01:06:38,930
so we'll go ahead and

01:06:42,390 --> 01:06:46,980
get things back up here okay so now I'm

01:06:45,420 --> 01:06:49,950
going to go ahead I don't think I need

01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:51,990
to do anything more with the git

01:06:49,950 --> 01:06:53,850
repository so that's been done I'm gonna

01:06:51,990 --> 01:06:57,990
close this out so now I'm going to go to

01:06:53,850 --> 01:07:01,290
the Badgers front-end with the admin

01:06:57,990 --> 01:07:03,570
interface so now from my point of view

01:07:01,290 --> 01:07:06,330
I'm going to go and look at this ticket

01:07:03,570 --> 01:07:10,230
and so it's Fedora Women's Day 2018

01:07:06,330 --> 01:07:14,480
attendee for the badge title so I'm

01:07:10,230 --> 01:07:21,300
going to take that and use that for the

01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:24,780
badge name make sure that I don't have

01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:27,420
any extra whitespace I'm going to take

01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:31,860
the URL that we just pushed put that

01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:33,810
into the image field description that

01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:36,530
was also in the badge you attended a

01:07:33,810 --> 01:07:41,580
local foot or a Women's Day 2018 event

01:07:36,530 --> 01:07:45,290
I'm gonna take that string and put that

01:07:41,580 --> 01:07:47,910
in there as well no hanging whitespace

01:07:45,290 --> 01:07:48,840
criteria that's just going to be the

01:07:47,910 --> 01:07:51,450
peshawar

01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:54,510
nor badges repository I'm gonna put that

01:07:51,450 --> 01:07:58,110
there and I'll add the tags after we add

01:07:54,510 --> 01:07:59,880
the badge so now I'm gonna push this to

01:07:58,110 --> 01:08:01,200
the front end and we see you added a

01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:03,060
badge with named fedora Woman's Day

01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:05,870
attendee so let's go find it let's go

01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:05,870
take a look at this

01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:17,290
helpful there plus-one

01:08:14,730 --> 01:08:19,060
alright so the easiest way I think would

01:08:17,290 --> 01:08:21,339
just be to look or when I add a badge I

01:08:19,060 --> 01:08:23,859
just go and look at the side here that

01:08:21,339 --> 01:08:26,589
shows all the recent badges so you will

01:08:23,859 --> 01:08:28,600
see that here it is this says a nun

01:08:26,589 --> 01:08:31,870
categorized badge so I'm going to go and

01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:33,880
open that one up and I want to make sure

01:08:31,870 --> 01:08:35,859
I get I want to make sure that I get the

01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:39,960
tag right it's either event or events

01:08:35,859 --> 01:08:47,290
and I want to be I want to be positive

01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:52,690
what's the badge I know is right I think

01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:54,100
that was mine so so before I'm actually

01:08:52,690 --> 01:08:56,799
I want to look actually I want to look

01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:59,080
at last year's federal Women's Day event

01:08:56,799 --> 01:09:00,580
I want to see what tags it has so I'll

01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:03,190
make sure I'm following past precedent

01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:06,390
for tags so that way you know if you go

01:09:03,190 --> 01:09:08,949
to find the Fedora women Day tag for

01:09:06,390 --> 01:09:10,870
badges you'll be able to see all of them

01:09:08,949 --> 01:09:17,469
listed together I just have to figure

01:09:10,870 --> 01:09:20,279
out where that uh 2017 badges so it was

01:09:17,469 --> 01:09:20,279
tagged with

01:09:23,290 --> 01:09:33,290
that's 2018 mmm that one also has both

01:09:28,370 --> 01:09:35,870
that's not a good example so diversity

01:09:33,290 --> 01:09:39,100
an event where the tags used for last

01:09:35,870 --> 01:09:45,080
year's badge so I am just going to do

01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:47,659
diversity and event I typed those right

01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:50,719
right yes so I'm going to add those tags

01:09:47,659 --> 01:09:52,880
to the badge and give it a second and

01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:54,530
you see uh there they are diversity and

01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:57,620
event if I look at the diversity tag

01:09:54,530 --> 01:10:00,640
you're going to find both Fodor Women's

01:09:57,620 --> 01:10:03,170
Day badges and now if I go back to the

01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:05,989
Explorer or if I go back to the badge

01:10:03,170 --> 01:10:10,969
index and take a look around

01:10:05,989 --> 01:10:12,409
I'll see that now oh those are the ones

01:10:10,969 --> 01:10:14,719
Nick just added you'll see that now the

01:10:12,409 --> 01:10:18,050
for a woman's a badge is listed as an

01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:20,840
event badge it's ready to go and is now

01:10:18,050 --> 01:10:23,090
pushed but since it isn't am it since it

01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:24,770
is a manually awarded badge the next

01:10:23,090 --> 01:10:26,929
step for me would be to go back to the

01:10:24,770 --> 01:10:30,590
admin interface and give someone the

01:10:26,929 --> 01:10:33,350
rights to push this badge so in this

01:10:30,590 --> 01:10:35,540
case I know the three fast user names of

01:10:33,350 --> 01:10:37,969
the people who are going to need this

01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:41,630
badge so I'm going where you do this is

01:10:37,969 --> 01:10:44,960
you do create authorization oh why can't

01:10:41,630 --> 01:10:47,840
i zoom down so I you create an

01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:51,409
authorization so the badge aiight is

01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:55,760
that and this is mentioned in the and

01:10:51,409 --> 01:10:59,929
the documentation oh I closed it so it's

01:10:55,760 --> 01:11:06,260
that string in the URL that's the badge

01:10:59,929 --> 01:11:10,570
ID that tahrir recognizes as the Bell

01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:10,570
it's Women's Day I'm glad I checked

01:11:11,409 --> 01:11:19,060
yeah so it's that strain that I'm going

01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:22,030
to take and go to the Fedora badges

01:11:19,060 --> 01:11:25,120
front end put that in as the badge ID

01:11:22,030 --> 01:11:27,100
and for the person email the way that

01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:30,639
the fedora or badges dot Fedora project

01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:33,820
org works you have to specify the fast

01:11:30,639 --> 01:11:36,429
username of the person and then at

01:11:33,820 --> 01:11:39,070
Fedora project org so I know in this

01:11:36,429 --> 01:11:42,790
case the three or four usernames of the

01:11:39,070 --> 01:11:44,230
people who will have authorization for

01:11:42,790 --> 01:11:47,469
this so I just authorized the fast

01:11:44,230 --> 01:11:48,850
username be two five zero two and I know

01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:53,980
there's a few others that need it as

01:11:48,850 --> 01:11:55,810
well so I'm gonna add them as the I'm

01:11:53,980 --> 01:12:02,110
gonna grant them authorization rights as

01:11:55,810 --> 01:12:07,480
well and I'll give it to myself so I can

01:12:02,110 --> 01:12:08,770
actually show folks wrong field yeah so

01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:10,480
I can actually show what it looks like

01:12:08,770 --> 01:12:13,380
what does it what is it what is yeah I

01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:13,380
got that typo yeah

01:12:16,190 --> 01:12:24,350
Oh with the scripts yeah so now I'm I

01:12:22,310 --> 01:12:25,610
also awarded this one to me so I can

01:12:24,350 --> 01:12:27,290
actually show you like what does it mean

01:12:25,610 --> 01:12:29,600
when you're granting authorization or

01:12:27,290 --> 01:12:31,010
someone like you're giving them the

01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:32,300
right to push the badge what does that

01:12:31,010 --> 01:12:33,920
mean they have access to the admin

01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:35,900
interface like what is that doing for

01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:38,890
them so they don't have the admin

01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:41,780
interface but what it does for them is

01:12:38,890 --> 01:12:58,550
I'm gonna go find the fedora woman day

01:12:41,780 --> 01:13:01,810
badge Explorer yeah yeah yeah I was just

01:12:58,550 --> 01:13:04,699
clicking through it so you'll see that

01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:08,449
this field I now have available to me so

01:13:04,699 --> 01:13:11,210
when I go to the actual badge page I see

01:13:08,449 --> 01:13:13,820
that I have the option to directly award

01:13:11,210 --> 01:13:17,449
the badge of someone and I have the

01:13:13,820 --> 01:13:20,360
ability to create an invitation so for

01:13:17,449 --> 01:13:23,719
that one so I think this one is pretty

01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:25,370
self-explanatory for this one and you

01:13:23,719 --> 01:13:27,350
actually enter the username of the

01:13:25,370 --> 01:13:30,380
person on this you don't enter the email

01:13:27,350 --> 01:13:31,670
which is kind of not intuitive but in

01:13:30,380 --> 01:13:34,340
this case you would get enter the fast

01:13:31,670 --> 01:13:36,110
username so I would say oh you know j-47

01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:38,239
gets this badge if I wanted to give it

01:13:36,110 --> 01:13:41,330
to me and then I would just click the

01:13:38,239 --> 01:13:44,030
award directly button an invitation is

01:13:41,330 --> 01:13:45,380
pretty neat so this is the one that

01:13:44,030 --> 01:13:48,080
maybe you've seen like you seen here at

01:13:45,380 --> 01:13:50,480
flock you saw the QR codes that were

01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:54,820
being used for the attendee badge so

01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:59,360
creating an invitation will create a

01:13:54,820 --> 01:14:01,820
badge with a time period that expires so

01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:04,310
let's say I wanted to make this badge

01:14:01,820 --> 01:14:06,560
have a QR code or have a special link

01:14:04,310 --> 01:14:08,989
you could claim that was only valid for

01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:13,010
the next 24 hours so I would give it a

01:14:08,989 --> 01:14:16,100
time stamp like 2018

01:14:13,010 --> 01:14:18,530
the 11th and the time stamp you have to

01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:21,680
give it a time stamp as well that's in

01:14:18,530 --> 01:14:24,440
UTC timezone just for reference so this

01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:27,739
one would be quick

01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:31,639
we actually meet tonight actually

01:14:27,739 --> 01:14:35,090
so that would be August 11th at midnight

01:14:31,639 --> 01:14:37,040
UTC this imitation would expire if I

01:14:35,090 --> 01:14:40,610
were to create the imitation it would

01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:42,920
give me on my badges profile my personal

01:14:40,610 --> 01:14:45,980
profile it would give me the option to

01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:47,869
grab a claim URL like a special magic

01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:50,389
URL that if anyone goes to they'll get

01:14:47,869 --> 01:14:52,699
the badge and it gives me a QR code that

01:14:50,389 --> 01:14:54,949
I can just like grab and put into a

01:14:52,699 --> 01:14:58,869
document or a poster if I wanted to

01:14:54,949 --> 01:15:03,400
print it out and I think that's just I

01:14:58,869 --> 01:15:08,690
thing I want to do is just go back to

01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:12,070
this page and say we push this live in

01:15:08,690 --> 01:15:19,040
the badges it's a Seidman workshop flog

01:15:12,070 --> 01:15:27,260
the badge is found here so I'll take the

01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:34,219
URL of the badge and then I'll say b250

01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:37,119
- Yonah tony and j floor e7 have

01:15:34,219 --> 01:15:40,440
authorization rights

01:15:37,119 --> 01:15:40,440
clothing as complete

01:15:48,690 --> 01:15:56,480
and closed pushed ready to push

01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:07,510
yeah so and that's that's the process of

01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:10,989
pushing a badge so and now Nick is going

01:16:07,510 --> 01:16:12,699
to show you in the case this is only an

01:16:10,989 --> 01:16:15,520
option for those actually in the

01:16:12,699 --> 01:16:17,380
sysadmin badges fast group if you need

01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:20,889
to make edits or changes to a badge

01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:23,949
I'll let Nick yeah earlier today I was

01:16:20,889 --> 01:16:27,489
looking back at some past event badges

01:16:23,949 --> 01:16:31,239
and I noticed that the flea saw 2015

01:16:27,489 --> 01:16:37,330
badges were oh I guess I should make

01:16:31,239 --> 01:16:39,520
that larger the case did not match most

01:16:37,330 --> 01:16:42,760
of them were in the naiton the event

01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:47,050
name was all in uppercase but then the

01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:50,800
other badge but the 2015 were not so I

01:16:47,050 --> 01:16:54,659
decided I would standardize that so I

01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:57,400
actually was using the edit badge script

01:16:54,659 --> 01:17:01,840
during the beginning of the of this

01:16:57,400 --> 01:17:04,780
workshop so and then I also whenever I

01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:06,909
was which kind of goes along with what

01:17:04,780 --> 01:17:09,969
Justin was saying if you are making a

01:17:06,909 --> 01:17:13,210
badge be careful what you are lu put in

01:17:09,969 --> 01:17:15,760
because it's not very hard to fix it but

01:17:13,210 --> 01:17:19,690
it's easier to do it right the first

01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:22,960
time it was a lot harder before we got

01:17:19,690 --> 01:17:24,870
this these nice scripts then you had to

01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:28,600
get someone to edit it in the database

01:17:24,870 --> 01:17:33,840
now we have edit badge script so

01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:35,409
whenever I was creating the flock 2018

01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:39,370
contributor badge

01:17:35,409 --> 01:17:42,580
I put criteria which is a link to the

01:17:39,370 --> 01:17:48,090
badges ticket I put that in criteria and

01:17:42,580 --> 01:17:53,520
also in image instead of putting the

01:17:48,090 --> 01:17:57,159
instead of putting the link to the art

01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:58,570
so I can just go to user local be in

01:17:57,159 --> 01:18:01,440
edit badge

01:17:58,570 --> 01:18:04,690
I already did I already became route

01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:08,860
because this admin badges has full

01:18:04,690 --> 01:18:17,290
pseudo access on the badges servers

01:18:08,860 --> 01:18:20,080
- - badge flock 2018 contributor and up

01:18:17,290 --> 01:18:22,660
here you can see where I did - - help

01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:25,780
because I can never remember exactly

01:18:22,660 --> 01:18:30,300
what the command is because I don't use

01:18:25,780 --> 01:18:33,610
it too often but it does have help and

01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:41,260
instead of changing name I will change

01:18:33,610 --> 01:18:45,490
image and it always gives you an error

01:18:41,260 --> 01:18:47,560
or a warning you can ignore that but it

01:18:45,490 --> 01:18:52,080
does say setting image on flock

01:18:47,560 --> 01:19:04,630
contributor to that so now if I go back

01:18:52,080 --> 01:19:08,110
to Oh wrong here this is the that was

01:19:04,630 --> 01:19:12,070
the first one I did and it was right so

01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:17,550
now the art works with that script you

01:19:12,070 --> 01:19:24,970
can change the name description criteria

01:19:17,550 --> 01:19:28,480
image weight they added tags oh that

01:19:24,970 --> 01:19:31,900
must have been recently yeah oh okay

01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:33,960
then we can't edit tags now I did not I

01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:36,460
did not realize that you added that

01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:38,590
because beef the last time I take it

01:19:36,460 --> 01:19:41,070
about tags someone fixed it in the

01:19:38,590 --> 01:19:41,070
database

01:19:44,710 --> 01:19:51,409
okay so yes you can change tags now

01:19:49,219 --> 01:19:57,349
so does that replace the whole list of

01:19:51,409 --> 01:20:01,730
tags oh okay so you just do comma

01:19:57,349 --> 01:20:06,349
separated list of tags oh okay well

01:20:01,730 --> 01:20:09,650
great so we can fix up the ones that say

01:20:06,349 --> 01:20:12,579
event and events even okay

01:20:09,650 --> 01:20:15,409
I saw those before but I didn't want to

01:20:12,579 --> 01:20:17,869
mess I didn't met well yeah I did not

01:20:15,409 --> 01:20:21,889
want to mess with changing those because

01:20:17,869 --> 01:20:24,349
it was not an easy process but if it's

01:20:21,889 --> 01:20:28,719
just a script oh I may go through and

01:20:24,349 --> 01:20:34,849
change them and we also have a few other

01:20:28,719 --> 01:20:37,460
scripts award badge which can be done

01:20:34,849 --> 01:20:40,820
through a script although usually I do

01:20:37,460 --> 01:20:44,239
it through the front end the what reason

01:20:40,820 --> 01:20:46,730
it the way a situation where it comes in

01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:49,130
handy to use the script is if there's a

01:20:46,730 --> 01:20:52,310
big long list of people to manually

01:20:49,130 --> 01:20:54,920
award a badge you could script that just

01:20:52,310 --> 01:20:58,460
have a list and make a script that takes

01:20:54,920 --> 01:21:01,639
a file of user names or something and

01:20:58,460 --> 01:21:03,849
just iterates over it and awards the

01:21:01,639 --> 01:21:03,849
badge

01:21:09,559 --> 01:21:14,869
about this birthday all the manually

01:21:12,739 --> 01:21:19,219
awarded event back

01:21:14,869 --> 01:21:24,229
there is a delete badge I already showed

01:21:19,219 --> 01:21:26,179
edit badge grant authorization you can

01:21:24,229 --> 01:21:28,280
do that from the command line but

01:21:26,179 --> 01:21:31,869
usually we do it through the web

01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:34,729
interface and there is a revoke

01:21:31,869 --> 01:21:37,749
authorization and revoke badge if a

01:21:34,729 --> 01:21:41,030
badge is mistakenly awarded to someone

01:21:37,749 --> 01:21:42,889
you can remove it but if you remove it

01:21:41,030 --> 01:21:46,309
there is a badge called consolation

01:21:42,889 --> 01:21:49,219
prize that you award them you award them

01:21:46,309 --> 01:21:53,780
a badge as an apology for removing their

01:21:49,219 --> 01:21:56,479
badge and you can revoke authorization

01:21:53,780 --> 01:22:00,199
if you accidentally award the wrong

01:21:56,479 --> 01:22:04,579
username or maybe say some group the

01:22:00,199 --> 01:22:07,579
leadership of some team changes and they

01:22:04,579 --> 01:22:10,070
don't want Justin to be able to award

01:22:07,579 --> 01:22:12,559
the badge anymore they want Miro to

01:22:10,070 --> 01:22:14,989
award the badge you can remove the

01:22:12,559 --> 01:22:22,159
authorization from the old person and

01:22:14,989 --> 01:22:25,540
give it to the new person I think that's

01:22:22,159 --> 01:22:28,569
about it with the with the scripts I

01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:28,569
[Music]

01:22:29,349 --> 01:22:33,320
think that's all we had planned to cover

01:22:31,820 --> 01:22:37,219
for today so I know if either of you two

01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:42,289
have any any questions or any any

01:22:37,219 --> 01:22:45,019
feedback but if not then I think we are

01:22:42,289 --> 01:22:47,110
all wrapped up here so thanks for coming

01:22:45,019 --> 01:22:47,110

01:22:48,030 --> 01:22:50,090
