Talk: At Long Last, Rings: Split Lifecycles
Presenters: Josh Boyer, Paul Frields

Description: Fedora was conceived at a time where Linux was still seen as a “do anything and everything at once” OS. The way we handle the package universe -- core platform, software stacks, high level applications -- still reflects that view. System owners, on the other hand, now expect apps and OS to rev differently. Come listen to some ideas on how Fedora can better meet their expectations. We’ll also cover how will this benefit the community and open up new possibilities for Fedora to entice contributors.
