Talk: Fedora on the Raspberry PI
Presenters: Tom Callaway, Peter Robinson

Description: Fedora has come a long way from the days of Pidora, and so has the Raspberry Pi. The little $35 microcomputer still has a huge userbase, and a lot of work has been done to get Fedora to run on the hardware. In this talk, I will talk about where we are today, what works (and doesn't work) and where we hope to go tomorrow.
