00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,110
sort of MC and do all of the fun

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,750

00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,289
here but you will find that your English

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,760
works really really well so we encourage

00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:52,680
you to use that if you have any

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,449
challenges don't hesitate to talk to the

00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,829

registration desk right out here in

00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:59,730
front of the elevators next to the

00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,129
hotel's registration desk who is also a

00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,409
great resource and then people like me

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:06,659

you have any challenges questions or

00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:23,640
other issues the sessions are going to

00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:26,670
be recorded we hope a better quality

00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,680
than in previous years but we'll see but

00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,960
yes they are all being recorded we have

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,939
two requests the first request is don't

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,380
touch any of the equipment please it has

00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:37,200
all been set up very carefully

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,119
this is Tripoli true in the rooms that

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,650
have wireless microphones because it

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,750
could take us half an hour to get all

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:45,299
the levels back correct and to pair the

00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,100
microphones right and like it's all

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:49,530
kinds of bad so please don't do that to

00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,079
us instead if there is an audio or video

00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,299
I know if I get lunch you have a badge

00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:07,500
because there was some question about

00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:09,810
that other than dinner on Friday night

00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,400

00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:13,440
you who reserved in this hotel through

00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,540
the conference procedure do have

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,190
breakfast included in your rooms the

00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,870
rest of you will need to look at however

00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,319
you made your room reservations and

00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,319
figure that out

00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:27,329
let's start with a couple of other

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,950
things there are stickers available for

00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:30,720
you to put on your badge to express your

00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:32,280
communications preference I encourage

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,410
you to consider doing that and I

00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,000
encourage you to strongly consider

00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:38,819
respecting the communications

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,310
preferences on badges that you see so

00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:43,230
please take advantage of this there is a

00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:45,120
quiet room that has been set up for your

00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,769
assistance it is quiet

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,930
which means please don't go in there and

00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:50,519
talk you are not to have a meeting in

00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:53,819
there you are not to decide to do

00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,019
Jazzercise on a really loud video you

00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:57,150
are not supposed to go in there and

00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:58,620
engage it is a place for people to get

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:00,660
away from the conference noise and

00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,370
bustle or hustle and to take some time

00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:05,069
out and figure out what's going on check

00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:05,790
their email relax whatever it is in the

00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:08,250
loss NEETs

00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:11,280
room which looks like loud knits because

00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:13,109
it has a giant s set in it and it is

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,000
straight down the hallway this way and

00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:18,109
there are signs that look like the no

00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,970
microphones rule sign all over that room

00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:23,520
and the hotel has accommodated us with

00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:25,169
an all gender bathroom this is actually

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,640
kind of fun having all these signs the

00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:27,340
hotel has accommodated us with an all

00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,990
gender bath

00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:31,450
the all gender bathroom can be found

00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:33,880
directly behind this wall on this

00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:35,889
corridor here the other bathrooms are

00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:40,360
gendered so please respect the signs of

00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:42,340
the bathroom you choose to use and if

00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,080
there are any challenges along the code

00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:46,900
of conduct lines you can find code of

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,970
conduct information on the Flyers that

00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,620
you were handed when you checked in and

00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:53,020
then you can report those kinds of

00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:54,610
issues to either Jennifer or me and our

00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,930
contact information is on the back of

00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:57,639
your badge

00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,139
there is no Wi-Fi information on the

00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:00,970
back of your badge because there's only

00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:03,790
one Wi-Fi network that makes any sense

00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:05,500
and it does not have a password rumor is

00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:07,690
it is also not currently handing out

00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:10,210
addresses via DHCP but we are looking

00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:13,680
into that I don't know maybe we'll

00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:13,680
implement DHCP v2

00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,790
these presentations are working

00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:21,790
everybody else has to turn their to

00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,300
that they did that once at an Apple

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:31,570
Keynote

00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:32,950
okay we are in the largest of the rooms

00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,850
that we have and you'll notice the

00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:36,010
roundtables

00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:38,500
these are not where we send the bad

00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:40,870
children at Thanksgiving these are

00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:43,000
actually set up for use mostly during

00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:46,150
the roundtable sessions for groups to do

00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,530
informal meetings on tomorrow but I

00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:50,500
think it's tomorrow it might actually be

00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:52,300
Wednesday wait today is Wednesday might

00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,850
be Friday I don't check your schedule

00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,530
and you will see the words roundtables

00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:58,390
and that's when we put them there you

00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:59,290
can sit there if you want like knock

00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:01,540
yourself out

00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:03,160
but the audio and video is set up for

00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:04,750
this side of the room so if you can't

00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,570
see or hear you're gonna be asked to

00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:10,360
relocate as opposed to us fixing all of

00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:11,710
the video for your convenience and there

00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,450
really are supposed to be enough chairs

00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:17,350
in here if you guys would defrag and let

00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:19,770
the empty chairs be known a couple of

00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:22,450
other activities tonight there is

00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:24,400
karaoke and game night with and the

00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:26,230
candy swap is going to be held inside of

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,780
the game night area game night will be

00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:30,300
here because we have round tables if we

00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:33,010
need them amazing

00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:35,020
karaoke is I recall is next door in The

00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:36,850
Dresden room there are two access points

00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,320
to Dresden there's a door here in the

00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:40,810
back and then you can keep going

00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,970
straight down the corridor and honestly

00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:44,620
rumor is if you go down this corridor

00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:46,840
long enough you get to the dressing room

00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:48,340
I did just don't know me while I was

00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,620
standing here I've never actually walked

00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:54,070
that far in that corridor so let me know

00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:56,110
if that's not the case but we are super

00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:58,720
happy the folks who have organized that

00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:00,190
for us and both of their names have

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,260
escaped me so I apologize they are

00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:05,680
listed in the program so please pretend

00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:07,720
that I read that this morning at 6:30 in

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,460
the morning there was yoga and my

00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,260
understanding is that we had people show

00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:13,240
up and that is totally awesome and I

00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:15,730
won't ask anyone to do a Sun Salutation

00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,200
right now but I encourage everyone to

00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:19,870
consider joining the yoga tomorrow

00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,730
morning at 6:30 as well it is held in

00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:23,590
this room mostly in this empty space

00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:25,600
right here so you do actually get to see

00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:27,550
like Sun and stuff but you're on carpet

00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,650
and you have air conditioning which is

00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:31,930
about as good as exercise gets as far as

00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:33,789
I'm concerned so I encourage you to take

00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:35,980
advantage of it we're super happy to

00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:38,320
have Susan doing that for

00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:40,300
we have lightning talks scheduled for

00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,220
the last day and we encourage you to

00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,770
sign up for those those sign up for that

00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:47,440
is at the ring registration desk there

00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:49,000
are only plenary sessions today and

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,590
tomorrow so you will only have the

00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,200
privilege of my announcements for those

00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:58,630
two days so I'm sorry and I think oh yes

00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:01,000
two other notes if you are interested in

00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:02,620
helping with audio/video especially if

00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,180
you know you're gonna be in one room a

00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:06,400
whole lot and won't act as a sort of

00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:08,980
room chair please see Ma Tei who has

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,510
left the room or Jennifer up now he's

00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:12,160
over here or Jennifer who is standing

00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:15,250
next to him and will coordinate getting

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,110
your assistance lastly you've all picked

00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:19,300
up t-shirts we have given you the size

00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:21,010
that you said you wanted whether that

00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:23,020
size has any relationship to the size

00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:24,720
you actually want it or not is something

00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:28,060
you have to search your conscience for

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,400
if we have Lex extra shirts which we are

00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:32,950
expecting we will start doing swaps for

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,289
different sizes on Thursday which is

00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:37,060
tomorrow but we want to allow everybody

00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:39,190
a chance to claim the shirt that they

00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:44,950
asked for before we give their shirt

00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:47,350
away and I think that is everything that

00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:48,880
I have to say right now I want to thank

00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:50,290
our two primary sponsors for the

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,610
conference this year and that's Red Hat

00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:53,730
and arm so if I can get a round of

00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:56,710
applause for them

00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:58,880
[Applause]

00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:02,410
and our first speaker is going to be

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,410
Matthew Miller the Fedora project leader

00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:11,070
hi that was Brian exil beard the Fedora

00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:12,959
Community Action and impact coordinator

00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:15,600
or fk-ik I don't think he introduced

00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,230
himself it's with so that that's

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,449
important too

00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:21,209
this is like last releases or two

00:09:18,449 --> 00:09:22,649
releases agos wallpaper but I really

00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:24,360
like it but I really am running the

00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:35,130
updated Fedora just in case anybody was

00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:39,509
wondering okay wait water some logistics

00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:41,430
before we talk so yeah i'm matthew

00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:44,459
Miller the Fedora project leader and

00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:46,170
this is the sixth flock which is kind of

00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:48,930
incredible to me I had to count it like

00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:51,389
three times before I realized what it

00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:53,699
was I like to do lots of graphs and

00:09:51,389 --> 00:09:57,480
things my talks this particular one is a

00:09:53,699 --> 00:10:00,810
personal one about my optimism level

00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:04,199
over the years at flock last year things

00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:06,930
were kind of maybe a little a lot on

00:10:04,199 --> 00:10:08,819
fire feeling there was some carrying

00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:11,060
around of fires and I spent way too much

00:10:08,819 --> 00:10:14,190
time on this particular slide everybody

00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:15,870
so but this year I'm really feeling good

00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:18,810
about things both the project as a whole

00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:22,920
and this flock I'm very excited for I

00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:24,870
think hey there we go

00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,459
things are you know unicorns and

00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,750
rainbows kind of feeling right now so I

00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,980
think this is going to be a really good

00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:32,880
conference and we're having a really

00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:35,339
good year in the project so yeah welcome

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,670
everybody and let's have a great

00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:37,670
conference

00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:47,250
I have a green dot on my badge here I

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,990
hope anybody who doesn't know me comes

00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:51,899
up and introduces themselves I'm happy

00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:55,230
to talk i am matt DM on IRC and twitter

00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:57,029
and email and basically everything I can

00:10:55,230 --> 00:11:00,690
manage except for Instagram or somebody

00:10:57,029 --> 00:11:01,920
had already taken my name please feel

00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:04,410
free to reach out to me at any time

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:08,790
about anything I'm really happy to talk

00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:11,070
and to listen that's basically my job so

00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:12,660
I want to start out with some messaging

00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:14,190
stuff because here we've got everybody

00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:16,649
in a room so I think it's a good time to

00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:18,300
talk about some of these things thank

00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:21,450
you to Langdon for this picture of the

00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:24,990
Fedora Museum at the Red Hat office in

00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:28,950
Boston this is kind of the question here

00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:30,890
is what is Fedora and I think hopefully

00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:33,990
everybody at this conference has an idea

00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:35,730
but messaging is hard there's a lot of

00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:38,220
things that we keep saying despite

00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:42,360
ourselves one of them is for example

00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:44,430
bleeding-edge Fedora is not intended to

00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:47,490
be bleeding edge if there's blood on

00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:50,550
things due to using Fedora in unless it

00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:52,620
was some sort of medical situation we're

00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:54,810
not right Fedora is a leading-edge

00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:59,360
distribution and we really try to not be

00:11:54,810 --> 00:12:02,850
bleeding edge and this is a matter of

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,930
not just like language insisting that

00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:06,000
you know we're better than we are

00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:08,310
something but Fedora like we don't

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,290
really try to be necessarily like arch

00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:11,430
if something comes out we have got it

00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:13,470
there the next day we want to make sure

00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:15,630
software works before we get it to you

00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:18,060
so leading edge and we leave the

00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:19,709
bleeding to other people unless you run

00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,850
rawhide then you're kind of on your own

00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:24,060
that's what it's there for

00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:25,829
but anyways what is Fedora well the

00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,899
point of this here is actually that

00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:30,720
Fedora these are a bunch of Fedora

00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:33,360
operating system DVDs and CDs but that

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,870
is not fedora fedora like solvent green

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:39,180
is made of people this is what Fedora is

00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:41,070
when and so actually the serious point

00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:43,500
is I would really like us when we talk

00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:45,779
about Fedora to mean fedora the project

00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,699
and if we are talking about something

00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:50,310
that Fedora the project makes let's call

00:12:47,699 --> 00:12:52,080
it our operating system or even better

00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:55,890
Fedora workstation Fedora

00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:57,870
KDE but our Python lab and Fedora core

00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:59,910
OS this specific thing that we're making

00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:00,990
let's talk about it that way especially

00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:02,730
if we're you know if we're talking

00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:04,519
amongst ourselves or whatever but when

00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:06,959
we're talking to outside the community

00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:09,089
externally let's try and keep our

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:12,899
communication clear that way because I

00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:14,880
think it helps people understand that we

00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:17,790
are more than just one particular

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,970
operating system thing that we put

00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,970
together

00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:29,360
this is like the were deists lied and my

00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:34,160
whole talk that this is basically a

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:36,290
summary of our mission and this is you

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:41,420
know the fedora foundations here I think

00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:46,670
everybody is familiar with these and I

00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:50,120
think this is this is a thing that makes

00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:54,500
fedora special is the way we have these

00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:56,990
values and this community and it's

00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,460
something that I spent in my job spend a

00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:00,920
lot of time at Red Hat it's sort of

00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:04,190
fighting for fedora and the thing that

00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:06,740
makes Fedora special Fedora is kind of

00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:08,870
unique as an open source project a lot

00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:10,310
of open source projects are have a

00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:11,870
corporate open source thing where

00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:14,540
there's a thing the company makes and

00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:16,880
they put the code out there and you can

00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:18,620
participate in it as a community member

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,720
which means you can chat on the forums

00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:22,310
if you can submit patches they might be

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,470
accepted but you're not necessarily

00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:27,260
really invited to be part of the inner

00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:29,420
decision making in Fedora all of our

00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:32,029
decision making is in the public our

00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:33,890
Fedora Council is open to anybody we've

00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:36,950
got some hired positions that Red Hat

00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:39,830
funds but that we have general elections

00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:41,779
for full council member positions and

00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:45,550
this is really kind of unique and

00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:47,690
special and it's one of the things where

00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,920
Red Hat has a lot of open source

00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:51,260
projects and a lot of open source

00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:53,300
communities and a lot of them end there

00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:55,730
I'm not saying they're not genuine open

00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:57,740
source but I think Fedora is the one

00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:59,839
that's big and successful and really has

00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:03,529
a community that's engaged in a way that

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:06,709
is unique and it's worth protecting and

00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:09,350
celebrating so one of the things that I

00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:11,029
have worked on in in Fedora there's kind

00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:12,500
of a lot of different ways we could go

00:15:11,029 --> 00:15:15,350
with what Fedora means and what the

00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:17,060
Fedora brand is and one way we could

00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:21,410
easily go is Fedora is kind of an

00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:23,510
underlying thing and that our brand is

00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:26,830
sort of a power bi Fedora thing down in

00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:30,620
the corner and that we put you know

00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:33,290
other names up you know KDE power bi

00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:34,610
fedora or whatever or core OS power bi

00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:38,629
fedora

00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:41,839
those or use whatever server those kind

00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:43,249
of things but I really thought for this

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,869
idea that we want to have the Fedora

00:15:43,249 --> 00:15:47,689
brand kind of celebrate a big umbrella

00:15:44,869 --> 00:15:50,600
brand where we allow a lot of things in

00:15:47,689 --> 00:15:52,489
here and rather than saying oh that's

00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:55,160
not the way we've always done things

00:15:52,489 --> 00:15:58,459
that can't be fedora fedora has to fit

00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:00,410
this particular rpm format that has you

00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:01,819
know our packaging guidelines say that

00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:04,639
needs to be this and it needs to be this

00:16:01,819 --> 00:16:07,249
way on and on you know a DVD to make it

00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:10,040
be real fedora I would like to have an

00:16:07,249 --> 00:16:11,660
expanded meaning for real fedora things

00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,009
that fit these values are not going to

00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,509
give up free software we're not gonna

00:16:13,009 --> 00:16:15,889
give up moment source and we definitely

00:16:14,509 --> 00:16:17,179
want to make sure that the community

00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:19,399
thing is there we don't want things to

00:16:17,179 --> 00:16:21,739
be Fedora where there's something that

00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:24,350
you know Red Hat or some other company

00:16:21,739 --> 00:16:26,239
or whoever has exclusive control nothing

00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:30,110
that's based on who you are rather than

00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:31,579
your contributions but things that fit

00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:33,470
into our values I think we should be

00:16:31,579 --> 00:16:35,709
welcoming to calling those fedora and

00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:37,790
putting those under the fedora umbrella

00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:40,429
because that's a lot of what Fedora

00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:42,379
means to me and I think that we have a

00:16:40,429 --> 00:16:44,600
hard time recreating this awesome

00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:46,939
community and things we have here under

00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,139
another name it's often really tempting

00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:49,399
when you've got it something cool you

00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:51,079
want to start up to be like okay I'm

00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:51,410
going to make my own new community for

00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:55,009
this

00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:56,629
it turns out that's really hard and so

00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:58,970
we've got a lot we've got a great

00:16:56,629 --> 00:17:00,319
community here and one of the things

00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:01,999
that's kind of a challenge for this

00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:03,679
community that I won't offer is that we

00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:05,240
want to make sure that we're welcoming

00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:08,409
to new ideas and new ways of doing

00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:10,789
things in this community as the

00:17:08,409 --> 00:17:12,860
operating systems change in the future

00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:14,870
because the things that were important

00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:16,429
for Fedora 15 years ago are not

00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:17,990
necessarily what people in the world

00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:19,699
care about and need in an operating

00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:21,260
system today so we need to make sure

00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:22,809
we're able to adjust to those kind of

00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:25,640
things

00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:27,559
that previous slide was taken from the

00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,150
fedora new fedora docks site so I wanted

00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:30,260
to put in a shout-out here this slide is

00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:32,030
to remind me to say

00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:37,429
check out the new fedora dock site if

00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:39,410
you haven't it's very nice this is also

00:17:37,429 --> 00:17:40,970
from the fedora dock site I don't have a

00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:42,320
good segue to the slide I just wanted to

00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:47,270
put this here

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:48,620
a flock in frog however many years ago

00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:50,690
that was

00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:53,630
I started stood up by a white board and

00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:55,910
tried to draw a map of what fedora looks

00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:58,220
like as a project and how all the groups

00:17:55,910 --> 00:18:02,210
are interconnected and it was kind of a

00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:04,700
crazy web we have over the last couple

00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:06,440
years tried to bring some structure to

00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:08,150
this and this is with especially with

00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,670
the fedora council in the middle and

00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:12,559
this idea of having fest Co is an

00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:14,870
engineering oversight body and then

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,160
there are a mine share committee for the

00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:18,980
things that are not necessarily

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:22,880
technical engineering decisions kind of

00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:24,830
bring some order to things I don't think

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,360
I can't promise this is comprehensive

00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:28,070
and maybe some of these groups aren't

00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,900
active anymore it's a big project and a

00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:31,880
lot of things move around but this kind

00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:36,470
of gives an idea of the scope of you

00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:39,100
know what Fedora is okay now we're

00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:39,100
moving on to charts

00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:46,370
this is I don't know I've shown this

00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:48,320
before at flock and at DEFCON it is a

00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:52,280
little confusing to read but it makes

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:54,520
perfect sense this is a using Fed

00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:57,170
message or message bus basically a

00:18:54,520 --> 00:19:00,020
measurement of fedora count activity

00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:01,940
every week and it measures things that

00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:04,520
are easy to attach to somebody doing an

00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:08,510
actual action like if you do an update

00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:10,640
to an RPM or do bode feedback that gets

00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:13,970
measured some other things like you know

00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,320
having a fedora event doesn't

00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:17,120
necessarily get measured like being here

00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,070
at flock doesn't get to get a little

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,690
ding on the chart right so there's a lot

00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:22,580
of fedora activity which isn't counted

00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:24,680
and even a lot of technical activity so

00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:28,400
caveat is this doesn't represent

00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:30,230
everything but the blue line is the

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,330
number of is basically every week the

00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:34,340
number of people who showed up that week

00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:36,530
and their account did something active

00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:38,330
and again it's things that are triggered

00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:39,980
by somebody doing something manually

00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:41,300
generally think not you know things like

00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,860
if you had a script running

00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,930
automatically wouldn't get count it so

00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:47,270
it's actual activity and that's

00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:50,630
somewhere around 400 or something every

00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:53,480
week the solid bar here the solid colors

00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:56,150
are people who have been active in the

00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:58,130
last year at least 13 weeks so basically

00:19:56,150 --> 00:20:01,880
you've been active a quarter of the year

00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:03,530
give or take makes it solid so the blue

00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,660
line is kind of everybody's involved

00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:08,750
kind of drive-by kind of things whereas

00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:11,810
the the core is that is the solid

00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:14,750
numbers here and the red represents

00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:16,430
people who have been and it's not like

00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,960
danger it's just the colors that happen

00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:20,030
to come out of the graph and they look

00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,860
nice and readable but the red is people

00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:23,510
who have been involved at that week

00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:26,060
they've been involved in fedora for at

00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:27,590
least two years before that the yellow

00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:29,630
is intermediate people who'd been at

00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:31,340
that time but involved or their their

00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:33,950
account their first time it had been

00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:35,780
seen was less than two years ago but

00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:38,660
more than one year and the green is new

00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:42,290
users so I think that the main thing

00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:44,600
here is we're pretty solid maybe a very

00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:47,030
slight upward trend but I'm kind of flat

00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:49,430
I would definitely like to see more

00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:51,650
growth but we're overall fairly healthy

00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:53,690
here it's not like there's a drop-off

00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:55,940
and I would definitely like to see the

00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:57,590
green and yellow be thicker lines I'd

00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:01,400
like to see more people coming into the

00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:03,710
project but it's fairly reasonable we

00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:06,500
are getting new people in every year and

00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:07,880
that's good to see but yeah one of the

00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,440
things I really would like to see over

00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:12,740
the next year the next flock is a lot

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:16,640
more new faces and new people coming in

00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:20,960
and staying around you go this is a new

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:23,930
graph here and this is basically on this

00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:26,060
the Saint from the same data source for

00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:28,550
every release during during the time of

00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:31,250
that release the number of its

00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:33,410
percentage of people who buy which

00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:35,590
release they started in so the dark blue

00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:38,300
at the bottom means they were what is it

00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:40,340
four years four releases that you go or

00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:42,910
older that they started so for Fedora 27

00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:47,180
the blue means they started at Fedora 23

00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:47,510
timeframe or earlier and does that make

00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,700
sense

00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:52,550
it's and so the green ones are people

00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:54,680
who are new in that release and so again

00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:56,450
this is I I did it Brian wanted it not

00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,010
as percentages but it looks like just

00:21:56,450 --> 00:22:00,080
random matchsticks of different heights

00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:03,710
so this is I think easier to read as

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:05,600
percentages here basically again a lot

00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:07,160
of people you know old school staying

00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,170
around which obviously is good if

00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:12,470
everybody was fleeing that would be even

00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:14,150
worse so I'm not I'm not upset about the

00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:16,850
percentage of old school but I

00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:18,470
definitely the the new people coming on

00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:21,470
is kind of thin and it would be nice to

00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:23,390
see that a little a little better at

00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:25,010
onboarding there but overall I think

00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:27,520
this is pretty healthy and we've got

00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:31,430
something like what 20 percent

00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:34,360
relatively new people every release so I

00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:34,360
think that's pretty good

00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:40,679
this is an entire switch from that kind

00:22:38,789 --> 00:22:43,499
of measurement this is just the the

00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:45,539
fedora magazine and I was looking at

00:22:43,499 --> 00:22:47,340
various things across the metrics like

00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:49,590
some race and I think this one is nice

00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:51,269
because this is basically pageviews per

00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:53,580
month in the magazine for the last

00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:57,090
couple years it's taken directly from

00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:59,399
the WordPress stats and I think the

00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:01,529
thing to note is especially the the

00:22:59,399 --> 00:23:02,849
black ones are the square the months

00:23:01,529 --> 00:23:05,369
where there was a fedora release which

00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:07,379
is obviously our most popular and I

00:23:05,369 --> 00:23:09,090
think we're on track for sometime in the

00:23:07,379 --> 00:23:11,159
next couple releases to have you know

00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:13,409
half a million page views a month view

00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:15,960
and the magazine which is pretty amazing

00:23:13,409 --> 00:23:17,489
you could if that were your personal

00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:20,489
blog you could run it as a full-time job

00:23:17,489 --> 00:23:22,440
so that's I mean if you wanted to put

00:23:20,489 --> 00:23:24,330
advertising on it which which we're not

00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,820
that's we're not about that but it's

00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:28,379
getting to be really popular and useful

00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:30,989
resource so thank you for everybody

00:23:28,379 --> 00:23:33,450
whose works on that and has written for

00:23:30,989 --> 00:23:35,549
it it's a really nice and useful thing

00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:37,710
with a lot of information for new and

00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:41,279
current Fedora community members and

00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:43,379
users all right

00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:45,840
next comes the part of these slides

00:23:43,379 --> 00:23:47,700
where I have promised Steven smoochin

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,759
who's not here unfortunately to show

00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:53,639
dinosaurs before I show it because this

00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:55,590
is basically fedora mirror stats that

00:23:53,639 --> 00:23:58,379
kind of shows us how popular each Fedora

00:23:55,590 --> 00:24:00,149
operating system release is and this is

00:23:58,379 --> 00:24:01,950
done kind of observational II we don't

00:24:00,149 --> 00:24:05,849
do any tracking so we're just looking at

00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:08,700
our Fedora mirror stats and unlike what

00:24:05,849 --> 00:24:11,580
Susa does we do not use a UUID which I

00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:14,269
think Zeus is doing it right there

00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:17,039
because this is really susceptible to

00:24:14,269 --> 00:24:19,080
network the way the network is laid out

00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,580
so if you've got NAT so you've got

00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:23,039
basically one IP address for your entire

00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:24,629
organization you get counted once in

00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,369
this on the other hand if you're moving

00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:28,229
your laptop around a lot during the day

00:24:26,369 --> 00:24:30,419
and going to 10 coffee shops you will

00:24:28,229 --> 00:24:33,419
get counted 10 times as least as long as

00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:37,220
you do rpm you know transactions every

00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:37,220
at every coffee shop and who doesn't

00:24:38,029 --> 00:24:43,289
right so so yeah so that's the caveat

00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:44,520
and there's a lot of discrepancies in

00:24:43,289 --> 00:24:46,980
the number but I think they're still

00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:48,720
useful to compare release to release but

00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:50,100
I don't pay too much attention to the

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,520
absolute number because I don't really

00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:55,409
know what it shows I would like in a

00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,690
future version of this to have a UUID

00:24:55,409 --> 00:25:00,419
basically a completely anonymous not

00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:02,520
connected to machine ID random number

00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:04,230
that lets us just count the number of

00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,580
systems of each release out there and

00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:07,230
I'll talk a little bit more about that's

00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:09,059
important there's some graph

00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:11,760
discrepancies which are obvious that

00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:13,770
that would help us with but anyways

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,919
here's the release to release for the

00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:20,100
the most current releases here and you

00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:24,059
can see we put our 28 ascending with the

00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:25,620
bullet here hey I have a graph on my

00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:31,640
speaker notes which not showing up oh

00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:34,350
well the the overall overall is about

00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:39,090
slightly over half are on currently

00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:42,120
supported releases so like 30 percent

00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:45,720
right now of all foot our IP as we see

00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:49,500
are 35 percent I think are on fedora 28

00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:53,850
and then 20 something that makes it add

00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:56,870
up to like 50 for our I put our 27 and

00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:59,880
then everything else is previous to that

00:25:56,870 --> 00:26:03,570
and you can see them yeah the peak their

00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:05,580
fedora what 24 very popular we haven't

00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:07,620
quite hit that with other releases a lot

00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:09,750
of times that's simply because the new

00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:12,330
release has come out very quickly on the

00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:14,370
heels of the previous one so basically

00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:17,159
every release goes up until a new

00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:18,840
release comes out so we haven't explored

00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:20,760
like if we just keep having her like

00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,679
when we had a release that was out for a

00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:25,470
year that just kept going and going

00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:27,149
going up so I don't really know what the

00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:28,830
ceiling for any individual releases

00:26:27,149 --> 00:26:31,140
we've never tried it we keep coming with

00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:32,820
new releases which yeah obviously we

00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:34,799
couldn't just have one release and let

00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:37,910
it coast but just for the data

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:41,300
experiment I'd be curious

00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:43,400
so this is the stacked graph of all of

00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:46,280
the releases and I kind of lumped them

00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:49,850
together mostly arbitrarily into these

00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:54,680
ages here where basically the green is

00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:57,050
the fedora next era and I started the

00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:58,310
orange I decided we change color since

00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:59,990
this is the first release with

00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:02,150
modularity enabled and I thought hey

00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:04,910
that's a kind of a watershed so we'll

00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:07,520
change colors there I might I've picked

00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:09,230
out a couple releases like fedora 20

00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,780
because that was such a popular release

00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:14,150
by itself it's colored by itself if

00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:15,790
Fedora 25 ends up flattening and staying

00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:18,890
high in their releases I might make it

00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:20,450
be its own color anyways that's sorry

00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:21,860
that that's really a digression into

00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:24,860
things I find interesting but are

00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:27,200
probably boring of the actual

00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:29,990
interesting things we obviously have a

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,580
nice upward trend overall but kind of

00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:33,800
some I think there's some disturbing

00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:36,110
flattening at the end here and one thing

00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:39,520
a particular note you see a spike that

00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:43,820
goes down there that is probably because

00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:46,460
when systems upgrade behind NAT for for

00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:49,190
one thing you're usually counted twice

00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:51,890
that day is for 20 you know 7 and Fedora

00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:54,140
28 and then also if you've got like

00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:56,720
three machines behind you know or 20 or

00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:59,750
whatever behind NAT and they were all

00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,400
Fedora 27 before and then one day half

00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:03,770
of them are Fedora 27 and half for

00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:05,780
Fedora 28 suddenly the counting goes up

00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:07,310
and then when they're all upgraded to 28

00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:08,900
it goes back down again so that's why we

00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:11,030
get the spike that goes back down and

00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:13,460
having uou IDs would help us untangle

00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:16,910
what exactly is going on there and get a

00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:19,040
better count of things but yeah I am a

00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:21,320
little bit concerned that it is kind of

00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:24,380
flattening off there at the top so our

00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:27,920
growth is not the big upward thing we

00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:29,750
had been seeing so I think that's room

00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,640
for some more evangelism and trying to

00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:33,770
get you know more fedora into people's

00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:37,130
hands there's definitely a lot of space

00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:39,680
in the market what's that yeah yeah

00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:40,760
Internet of Things so there's two thing

00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,620
I was going to talk about that later

00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:45,140
Peter Robinson reminds me two things

00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:47,330
Internet of Things is for one thing a

00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:49,790
big big opportunity for a lot of growth

00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:51,650
where we could have you know orders of

00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:54,290
magnitude more devices running which

00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:58,400
cool also a lot of internet-of-things

00:28:54,290 --> 00:29:00,110
machines are not updated they are

00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:02,600
installed and then they don't ever check

00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:04,850
for updates so it is very possible that

00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,850
there are 10 million Fedora systems out

00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:09,260
there you know we see them sometimes

00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:11,000
crashed screens running Fedora 10

00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:12,200
there's a lot of those out there that

00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,820
are not connected to the Internet are

00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,070
not updating that are actually there

00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:18,650
that are not counted as well is that

00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:25,400
what you wanted Peter

00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:30,650
so I mentioned modularity this graph has

00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:31,970
a much wow look June 18 every time

00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:33,410
that's awesome that's because I didn't

00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:37,970
put the days on there it's just a month

00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:40,340
so you can see this is great good access

00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:42,170
labeling there so yeah this is over a

00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:44,330
much shorter time frame so the graph is

00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:50,990
flatter this is basically the

00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:52,070
traditional repository and the yes right

00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:55,040
that is another thing

00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:58,250
os tree is not counted in this at all

00:29:55,040 --> 00:30:01,640
currently so that means that our atomic

00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:03,170
host and silver-blue and IOT stuff are

00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,340
not being counted we need to come up

00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:06,710
with a way to count those things

00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:10,070
especially as we go to more mystery

00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:11,750
based operating systems anyways the

00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:13,760
module or release so the thing that's

00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:16,520
particularly interesting here I think is

00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:19,250
that we only enabled the modular

00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:21,410
repository for fedora server so this

00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:24,590
kind of gives us a way to gauge what

00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:26,390
release speaking of the UUID tracking we

00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:28,130
don't actually have a way to see what

00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:30,320
Edition people have installed or are

00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:33,250
running and then the current system so

00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:35,240
that's another a little tiny bit of

00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:37,280
depersonalized data that I would like us

00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,690
to actually track this separately so we

00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:42,800
can kind of see which of our different

00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:44,540
efforts are resonating so this we

00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,880
actually created an experiment by only

00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:47,930
enabling that in fedora server so even

00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,400
if you are installing if you're

00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:51,110
installing a Fedora minimal install

00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:53,270
that's not that our server or Fedora

00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:54,860
Cloud and using the server case that's

00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:56,570
not counted and we know a lot of people

00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:58,550
are but this is like how many people are

00:30:56,570 --> 00:31:01,910
actually running and updating to fedora

00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:05,120
server Edition so to cut to the chase

00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:08,570
it's about seven percent of systems

00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:10,790
seem to be checking into the module

00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:12,830
repository which you know that's

00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:16,550
probably a little disappointing to Steve

00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:18,320
but it's I think it generally fits

00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:20,210
pretty well with our earlier estimate

00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,980
that about 20 percent of Fedora

00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:24,559
installations are using some server

00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:25,820
context because obviously not

00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,860
everybody's running for our server and

00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:30,200
not every Fedora server system is

00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:31,640
updated right away because by nature

00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,040
server users tend to be a little more

00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:36,710
conservative with updates so yeah I

00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:38,330
think it's probably a good guess 20 to

00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:40,490
30 percent of people using Fedora and

00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:42,920
server context which is interesting

00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:45,650
because one of the things if you go and

00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:47,720
look on Reddit people assume that Fedora

00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:50,630
is not an operating system to be used in

00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:52,970
a server context they go to Debian or

00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:55,400
sent to us or you know rel which is

00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:59,809
obviously for many many workloads a

00:31:55,400 --> 00:32:02,000
awesome choice but Fedora is also very

00:31:59,809 --> 00:32:03,500
suitable to a lot of server reuse and

00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,960
it's an area where we've got a lot of

00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:07,550
room for evangelism and growth kind of

00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,050
based on what people are doing with it

00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:11,210
already we could kind of tell that story

00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:15,170
better and I think getting more people

00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:18,200
using Fedora in that way yeah containers

00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:20,530
as well particularly good in containers

00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,530
I think

00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:28,390
this is a breakdown by system

00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:33,760
architecture so we can see x86 64 very

00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:35,530
dominant and 32-bit very flat with some

00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,030
interesting drops I don't know why it

00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:39,550
grew back up there again there's

00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:40,570
dinosaurs in this data so who knows what

00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:43,150
caused that to happen

00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:46,270
but yeah that big drop is particularly

00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:49,090
interesting like some large installation

00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:51,220
to fedora I decided no more 32-bit or no

00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:52,720
more fedora at some point and that is

00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:55,300
interesting because that actually

00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,070
happened a couple months after we had a

00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:59,200
big discussion on the mailing list about

00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:01,180
is 32-bit Fedora viable and it was

00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,890
looking like no and it looks like maybe

00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:04,780
somebody was following our discussion

00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:08,710
and decided that they needed to find a

00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:11,170
different 32-bit solution and you can

00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:13,660
see arm at the bottom here and I didn't

00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:15,370
graph power or s/390 not because they're

00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:17,740
not important but because they would

00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:20,290
just be lines at the very bottom of the

00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:24,070
graph they don't really and this is the

00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:27,040
same thing by percentage here I think

00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:28,390
probably arm is underrepresented because

00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:31,260
of what I was saying about things not

00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:33,310
not necessarily checking in for updates

00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:36,940
but there's a lot of room for growth

00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:40,660
there but arm still hasn't replaced the

00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:43,530
32-bit Intel Architecture either so make

00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:43,530
of that what you will

00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:53,910
okay so I talked about Fedora as a big

00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:55,740
umbrella project and one of the things

00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:58,440
that I think is pretty important to

00:33:55,740 --> 00:34:01,680
Fedora that we don't always give enough

00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:03,060
attention to is Fedora Apple extra

00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:05,640
packages or Enterprise Linux that's

00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:08,179
Fedora packages that are built to run on

00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:10,470
Red Enterprise Linux or Sint OS or

00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:13,200
Amazon Linux or one of the other many

00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:16,139
relative derivatives out there this is

00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,760
incredibly popular probably did these

00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:21,389
slides in the wrong order here this is

00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:24,510
the Fedora operating system release and

00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:29,389
the red line is the Apple usage over

00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:31,860
time and so it looks almost flat on this

00:34:29,389 --> 00:34:33,210
axis here which is kind of depressing I

00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:35,280
mean there's if you look right there

00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:37,590
that's still good Fedora operating

00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:40,409
system growth but compared to the

00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:43,800
popularity explosion of Apple it kind of

00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:46,679
pales so even if you don't care about

00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:49,889
that red line your impact as a Fedora

00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:52,500
project member on the world is probably

00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:54,720
largest in your in what happens in that

00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:56,429
red line so it's worth thinking about

00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,050
and caring about a little bit even if

00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:59,940
it's not sort of the immediate thing

00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:01,950
you're interested in and I think it's

00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:03,060
something we should make sure we're it's

00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:04,620
something we're getting a little bit of

00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:06,030
short shrift in the project right now I

00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:07,560
think it's something we could invest a

00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:10,470
little more in I'll talk about that a

00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:13,500
little more in a little bit yeah back to

00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:15,450
this one this is broken down by by the

00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:18,870
Enterprise Linux release that they run

00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:22,290
on and I think this is interesting for

00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:24,360
kind of two things first of all rel

00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:28,650
sevens been out for like I don't know

00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:31,230
eternity now and it is just now almost

00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:33,630
taking over six so Enterprise Linux

00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:35,520
users very conservative and that's kind

00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:38,760
of why there's lots of room for fedora

00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:41,460
to do what we do because we we move fast

00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:44,160
Enterprise Linux doesn't and there's a

00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:46,080
lot of demand for fedora like content on

00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,730
Enterprise Linux so I think that's a

00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:49,440
really interesting thing and the other

00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:50,910
thing I want to point out is that spike

00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,280
there and this is actually a moving

00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:55,440
average so that spike is actually

00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:58,320
flattened from what it is that is

00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:03,180
Spectre meltdown one day

00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:05,010
all yeah it actually doubles one day for

00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:07,170
some reason all the system ins in the

00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:10,260
world decided today is a day we're going

00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:12,330
to update our systems and it causes very

00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:16,470
visible spike and I think that's just

00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:18,630
amazing oh yeah speaking of spikes the

00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:21,510
other thing that I think is back in this

00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:24,500
graph here there's these dips here

00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:26,490
that's Christmas every year it's the

00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:28,530
holiday shutdown for Red Hat and

00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:31,170
everybody's on vacation some stuff

00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:32,640
happens but not nearly as much and it's

00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:36,120
always fun to see like the real world

00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:47,610
hitting your data because stuff happens

00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:51,960
and yeah all right yeah all right so

00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:53,580
enough with the charts though so the

00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,440
rest of the talk here some things that

00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:56,850
are happening in the project and at

00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,940
flock this year that it kind of caught

00:36:56,850 --> 00:37:01,290
my attention it's not comprehensive

00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:04,020
they're probably a lot of things that I

00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:06,180
care a lot about that I didn't put on

00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:08,370
the slide so if you're not in the slide

00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:10,560
don't be offended in fact everything at

00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:12,420
flock here I'm very excited every single

00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:14,790
talk there's not one that I would not

00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:17,280
want to be at if I could be in multiple

00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:18,630
places so there's a lot of great things

00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,270
going on but here's some things I wanted

00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:23,220
to call out specifically yeah first

00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:25,950
release with modularity enabled this has

00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:27,690
been a big project over the years so

00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:28,090
yeah congratulations everybody working

00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:31,269
on that

00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:31,269
[Applause]

00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:36,880
and Langdon is gonna update us more on

00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:38,890
that I think but the reason I've got a

00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:42,310
slide here is this is something I think

00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:44,980
is important to us over the next year we

00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:47,590
have this technology now we've got

00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:50,350
something like a dozen different modules

00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:52,180
which is not very many this is something

00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:54,040
that enables to us to do a lot of

00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:56,530
interesting things with different

00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:59,560
versions different compile options like

00:37:56,530 --> 00:38:03,070
alternate versions of software in a way

00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:06,430
that we haven't necessarily done before

00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:08,890
so for example if ke e needs a different

00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:11,500
version of a library or a whole

00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:13,660
different like stack then a different

00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:15,670
desktop offering needs there's kind of a

00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:17,700
way to do that and people can say okay

00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:19,810
I'm going to maintain this separately

00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:21,760
obviously it's nice if things can be

00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:23,200
coordinated but software moves so fast

00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:28,000
and there's all these different moving

00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:29,890
pieces and out in the world the basic

00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,910
problem that everybody who has an

00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:37,090
operation isn't fit face it is welcome

00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:39,520
the too slow and too fast problem where

00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:42,280
basically you want some parts of the

00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,930
operating system to move at a speed that

00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:46,510
you care about and for some people

00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:48,970
enterprise users it's I want that to be

00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:50,620
very stable and never change for a lot

00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:53,500
of other people it's I want the latest

00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:55,060
version of that always and you want the

00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:58,810
other part of the operating system to

00:38:55,060 --> 00:39:00,940
either update itself or stay the same

00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:03,640
but you don't care about it but the

00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:05,830
problem is that's different for every

00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:07,510
user everybody's got a thing that they

00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:10,570
care about and a thing that they wish

00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:12,580
would just not bother and it's pretty

00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:16,180
hard to make one operating system that

00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:18,100
appeals to all of those cases yet it's

00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:19,540
basically our Charter to try and make an

00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:22,480
operating system that appeals to

00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:24,160
everybody so how do we do that

00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:28,000
modularity and these kind of things

00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:30,610
enable us to make deliverables that have

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,590
different use cases and follow different

00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:35,020
things and we needed a technology which

00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:37,390
would let us package things up so we

00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:39,760
could solve different problems and not

00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:41,420
necessarily have every package be fit

00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,460
everybody's needs so

00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:45,650
we're going to need a lot more modules

00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:51,920
that's basically what this slide is is

00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:52,490
about so it was five years and two days

00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,940
ago

00:39:52,490 --> 00:40:00,260
when I gave this fedora rings talk at

00:39:55,940 --> 00:40:02,150
flock and we still don't have rings in

00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:05,780
fedora although we're kind of getting

00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:09,410
that getting that way basically the idea

00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:13,400
is again Fedora is a gigantic collection

00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:15,859
of packages and it is hard to treat them

00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:20,270
all equally and there's a big cost to

00:40:15,859 --> 00:40:22,700
trying making everything be one unified

00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:24,890
everything there's some very nice things

00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:28,040
that come from having one gigantic

00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:31,130
repository with every package in it and

00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:33,230
I don't discount that but it also comes

00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:35,210
with a pretty big cost for users and

00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:37,430
makes it hard to deliver things that fit

00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:40,430
exactly into use cases so there's this

00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:44,119
proposal let's split things up by policy

00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:46,760
and have different different rings this

00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:48,829
is an updated version of that same thing

00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:50,540
that from a talk that I never gave I

00:40:48,829 --> 00:40:55,010
think it's even more confusing than the

00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:58,069
first one but Paul fields is giving a

00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:59,900
talk later on kind of how a refined

00:40:58,069 --> 00:41:01,609
version of this and what we can do in

00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:03,020
Fedora and the advantages it'll bring us

00:41:01,609 --> 00:41:07,119
I encourage if this is interesting

00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:10,819
and/or scary to you to attend that talk

00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:13,940
I talked about Apple and its importance

00:41:10,819 --> 00:41:16,549
I think especially again with modularity

00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:20,030
this gives us some interesting abilities

00:41:16,549 --> 00:41:22,069
to make a better Apple one of the things

00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:24,859
that modules have this idea called

00:41:22,069 --> 00:41:27,799
stream expansion and that's a fancy way

00:41:24,859 --> 00:41:29,660
of saying you can make a module and that

00:41:27,799 --> 00:41:31,609
will just automatically build across

00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:32,890
multiple releases this is cool because

00:41:31,609 --> 00:41:36,349
if right now you're maintaining

00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:39,530
basically the same thing on Fedora 27 26

00:41:36,349 --> 00:41:42,049
25 or whatever and then on the Apple

00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:43,670
versions you might have basically one

00:41:42,049 --> 00:41:46,849
package that you're maintaining six

00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:49,160
different ways this can let you say

00:41:46,849 --> 00:41:51,140
maybe I don't want to have six different

00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:52,670
versions that are kind of tied to what

00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:54,319
base they go on but I want to have them

00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:56,150
conceptually I have

00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:58,400
one that is fast moving and one that's

00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:59,959
slow one that you know conservative

00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,119
updates and one that updates to the

00:41:59,959 --> 00:42:04,369
latest version and basically you have to

00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:06,499
module streams like that and then you

00:42:04,369 --> 00:42:09,609
can build that same module stream for

00:42:06,499 --> 00:42:12,190
Fedora releases and for Enterprise Linux

00:42:09,609 --> 00:42:14,449
basically then letting the user choose

00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:16,759
independent of what base OS they want

00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:19,719
whether they want their that package to

00:42:16,759 --> 00:42:22,309
move quickly or more conservatively and

00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:24,979
that again lets us also deliver

00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:30,559
solutions that use those packages in

00:42:24,979 --> 00:42:32,420
that way so the point of that is we can

00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:34,910
have an apple that is basically based on

00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:36,859
modularity at least once modularity tech

00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:40,130
gets into sent OS that's what we've got

00:42:36,859 --> 00:42:42,829
a sent to us thing over here and then

00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:45,499
with that basically it'll be very low

00:42:42,829 --> 00:42:47,299
cost as a fedora package or to also have

00:42:45,499 --> 00:42:49,309
an apple build of your package which

00:42:47,299 --> 00:42:51,109
again back to the red line like there's

00:42:49,309 --> 00:42:52,849
a lot of demand for that and it's very

00:42:51,109 --> 00:42:55,339
high impact so if you're doing this

00:42:52,849 --> 00:42:56,420
because you want to help users and you'd

00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:58,009
like to make sure that the you know

00:42:56,420 --> 00:43:00,619
software you work on gets out there and

00:42:58,009 --> 00:43:03,319
used by people this is a easy way to do

00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:05,799
that so there's that and the other

00:43:03,319 --> 00:43:08,900
reason sent to us is up here is because

00:43:05,799 --> 00:43:10,940
sent OS is an open source project in the

00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:12,739
Red Hat family we've got a lot of people

00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:15,109
who use both we've had a lot of people

00:43:12,739 --> 00:43:16,729
who work on both and we have not done a

00:43:15,109 --> 00:43:19,969
very good job of collaborating between

00:43:16,729 --> 00:43:21,529
the distros it's time to start doing

00:43:19,969 --> 00:43:24,819
more collaboration because we're leaving

00:43:21,529 --> 00:43:27,140
a lot of value on the floor I guess

00:43:24,819 --> 00:43:29,059
we're basically doing a lot of work

00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:30,499
twice for no reason and there are a lot

00:43:29,059 --> 00:43:33,589
of things we could take advantage of

00:43:30,499 --> 00:43:36,140
that we aren't by not collaborating so

00:43:33,589 --> 00:43:38,269
we should work together more and Jim

00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:39,619
Perrin from CentOS and I have a talk

00:43:38,269 --> 00:43:43,369
kind of about some very specific

00:43:39,619 --> 00:43:44,930
collaboration in diskette that is coming

00:43:43,369 --> 00:43:46,309
up and I also encourage you to attend

00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:47,749
that although I think we're running

00:43:46,309 --> 00:43:50,739
against other interesting talks so you

00:43:47,749 --> 00:43:53,569
know if you care about collaboration

00:43:50,739 --> 00:43:54,309
another very exciting thing is Fedora

00:43:53,569 --> 00:43:57,410
core OS

00:43:54,309 --> 00:43:59,239
this is basically an operating system

00:43:57,410 --> 00:44:01,459
that's meant to be kind of an operating

00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:05,749
system as a service a very small

00:44:01,459 --> 00:44:07,609
operating system that will that's sort

00:44:05,749 --> 00:44:08,240
of specifically made for not sort of

00:44:07,609 --> 00:44:09,410
definite

00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,660
specifically made for running your

00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:13,670
workloads in containers and having the

00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:15,170
operating and system itself updated

00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:18,290
underneath that without disturbing

00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:20,990
things automatically updated and it is

00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:23,720
very similar to the ideas we were

00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:28,130
looking at with Fedora atomic host and

00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:30,349
so red had acquired core OS and the core

00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:32,000
OS project is being merged with atomic

00:44:30,349 --> 00:44:34,550
host and we're going to have a Fedora

00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,470
core OS release with a lot of the

00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:38,839
technology from both and a lot of the

00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:41,660
ideas from both into an awesome best of

00:44:38,839 --> 00:44:44,089
the world container operating system

00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:46,550
which I am very excited for and I talked

00:44:44,089 --> 00:44:47,990
earlier about exploring new ideas there

00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:49,790
are a lot of new ideas that come in from

00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:52,790
that project that I want to make sure we

00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:56,060
are welcoming - in Fedora with automated

00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:58,880
QA automated release and also automated

00:44:56,060 --> 00:45:00,140
updates in that system so I think that's

00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:03,820
very exciting and welcome to everybody

00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:03,820
from core OS - Thor

00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:10,190
this is kind of a disturbing icon but

00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:12,980
that's the so this is the mindshare

00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:16,010
hackfest badge that our mindshare is

00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:20,420
like I said yeah right our new Committee

00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:22,339
for basically the non engineering sides

00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:24,200
of the project which are as you can see

00:45:22,339 --> 00:45:26,240
from the earlier graph of you remember a

00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:27,500
pretty significant part like we kind of

00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:30,470
tend to think of this as an engineering

00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:33,950
project but the things around community

00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:37,940
around design around documentation and

00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:40,580
and the ambassador's like are equally

00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:42,349
important to the engineering because if

00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:44,450
we don't have that the engineering

00:45:42,349 --> 00:45:46,130
doesn't go to anybody and isn't used by

00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:48,859
anybody and isn't useful for anybody so

00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:51,380
this is important we had a mindshare

00:45:48,859 --> 00:45:52,849
hackfest earlier this year I think it

00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:55,339
was this year it feels a long time ago

00:45:52,849 --> 00:45:58,160
now and one of the things that came out

00:45:55,339 --> 00:46:00,950
of that is a plan for revitalizing the

00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:05,119
fedora ambassadors basically are on the

00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:07,070
ground talk to people sell fedora group

00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:09,470
and I think that's very exciting there's

00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:11,330
some more mindshare hackfest stuff going

00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:14,210
on here at flock and if you're

00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:16,310
interested in sort of leadership in the

00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:17,810
non-technical aspects of fedora if

00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:19,220
you're interested in you know helping

00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:22,099
spread fedora help

00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:25,520
those numbers go up I really encourage

00:46:22,099 --> 00:46:27,170
you to get involved in that specifically

00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:29,780
I was actually talking to some of the

00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:31,130
product management people at Red Hat and

00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:33,920
one of the things they're very

00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:37,099
interested in is seeing fedora grow into

00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:39,320
the University student space which we

00:46:37,099 --> 00:46:41,690
kind of have been less active in that I

00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:43,880
would have liked to be over the last no

00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:45,710
no no time have been the Thoreau project

00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:47,840
leader I guess I used to work at a

00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:49,460
university but now I'm old so I'm kind

00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:52,910
of out of touch for what's going on at

00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:54,710
that level but this is something this is

00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:56,150
actually a project plan we came up with

00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:59,660
the while ago and didn't really

00:46:56,150 --> 00:47:01,640
implement on if you are a student or if

00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:04,820
you are feel connected to you know

00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:06,560
academic world this is something that

00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:08,930
really is looking for leadership and

00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:10,760
work on come talk to me talk to some of

00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:13,090
the mindshare committee let's see what

00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:17,000
we can do to help fedora grow at

00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:20,090
universities and among students

00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:23,540
the next thing Fedora silver-blue this

00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:25,910
is kind of a we talked earlier bio s

00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:29,330
tree based technologies that's the sort

00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:31,760
of get for your operating system that

00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:33,800
atomic host was based on rather than

00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,390
having your operating system be a

00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:39,680
collection of our pians that you manage

00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:41,869
directly with DNF or yum it's basically

00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:44,330
an image based operating system that you

00:47:41,869 --> 00:47:46,250
can update as a whole to one version and

00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:50,119
also go back to if you if there's a

00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:51,950
problem with the updates for a lot of

00:47:50,119 --> 00:47:55,430
people who are like hackers and

00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:58,220
tinkerers this kind of thing might not

00:47:55,430 --> 00:48:02,420
necessarily be the easiest for us but

00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:05,599
this image based operating system is for

00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:07,339
deploying Fedora in big at big scale or

00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:09,260
deploying it to a lot of people who

00:48:07,339 --> 00:48:10,609
don't necessarily want to manage all the

00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:13,490
ins and outs of their operating system

00:48:10,609 --> 00:48:15,410
an image based operating system makes

00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:18,380
life a lot easier and it makes things a

00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:20,050
lot easier for QA because with rpm as it

00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:22,550
is right now every operating system

00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:24,890
every installation is an individual

00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:26,810
snowflake with the huge come the

00:48:24,890 --> 00:48:28,790
combinatorial possibilities how you can

00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:29,990
put together Fedora as it is now are

00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:32,750
immense

00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:33,170
with this everybody can basically have

00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:36,530
this

00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:40,280
package set on their system and that

00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:42,859
makes it much easier to QA that also

00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:44,660
means that for actually running things

00:48:42,859 --> 00:48:47,180
that you care about like applications

00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:47,960
and so on we need new technologies for

00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:50,200
doing that

00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:52,670
containers are obviously one solution

00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:55,790
then that's one of the ways we want to

00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:57,260
have it's so that when you when you run

00:48:55,790 --> 00:48:58,760
do your actual work you're working in a

00:48:57,260 --> 00:49:00,500
container even though your operating

00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:03,440
system is this kind of image based thing

00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:05,390
and they're also related to this is flat

00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:07,460
packs which is a pack basically a

00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:10,790
container like technology for desktop

00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:12,319
applications snappy is another competing

00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:13,790
one that we're so both of these things

00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:16,339
are things we're working on in fedora

00:49:13,790 --> 00:49:19,970
there's an effort to take flat take

00:49:16,339 --> 00:49:22,670
existing rpms that we've already made we

00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:25,369
do we do in fedora a very good job of

00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:27,799
packaging up basically all of the open

00:49:25,369 --> 00:49:30,290
source applicable applications that are

00:49:27,799 --> 00:49:33,619
of high quality are packaged up and

00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:36,619
maintained in fedora in a pretty good

00:49:33,619 --> 00:49:39,500
state which is good so thank you

00:49:36,619 --> 00:49:41,900
everybody in congratulations so one at

00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:43,280
one of the the arguments for flat pack

00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:46,430
is that'll kind of expand the the

00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:47,420
ecosystem of applications I hope that's

00:49:46,430 --> 00:49:50,450
true

00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:52,670
but also we in fedora do a really good

00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:55,220
job of providing these things to people

00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:58,160
and so I think that Fedora makes a good

00:49:55,220 --> 00:50:00,410
source of quality trusted application so

00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:02,000
oh and Taylor is working on a project

00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:04,880
that automatically converts the RPMs

00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,559
we're already making into flat packs so

00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,990
I think that'll be kind of neat and it's

00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:11,270
a way also to increase fedoras impact

00:50:08,990 --> 00:50:14,270
beyond the base operating system that we

00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:16,549
have so if someone else is working on

00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:18,260
some desktop Linux but they their

00:50:16,549 --> 00:50:20,900
application their project is kind of

00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:22,970
focused on just the desktop Fedora has

00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:25,730
this wider focus and we package up all

00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:27,650
these applications so we become a good

00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:28,970
source of trusted high-quality

00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:31,490
applications for other Linux

00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:33,200
distributions that's a pretty good way

00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:35,569
for fedora to increase our impact and

00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:37,609
also gateway to the thorah community for

00:50:35,569 --> 00:50:39,890
people who might have not start with the

00:50:37,609 --> 00:50:41,659
fedora install CD so I think that's

00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:44,269
exciting

00:50:41,659 --> 00:50:46,759
here's another thing we've got been

00:50:44,269 --> 00:50:49,579
cotton here our new Fedora program

00:50:46,759 --> 00:50:54,979
manager I just wanted to introduce him

00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:56,809
and we had this last release the the the

00:50:54,979 --> 00:50:59,209
first time we've had a Fedora release

00:50:56,809 --> 00:51:00,769
that hit our target schedule which was

00:50:59,209 --> 00:51:06,919
awesome and then we'll be doing that

00:51:00,769 --> 00:51:08,659
forever right Ben will now make sure

00:51:06,919 --> 00:51:15,079
that happens for every release from now

00:51:08,659 --> 00:51:18,919
on so then this I don't this is a

00:51:15,079 --> 00:51:21,769
Penrose triangle it's impossible I guess

00:51:18,919 --> 00:51:26,809
and so there's a talk that Josh and

00:51:21,769 --> 00:51:29,529
Brendan who work on rel and on Fedora as

00:51:26,809 --> 00:51:33,079
well we'll be giving about the fedora

00:51:29,529 --> 00:51:35,739
rel cent OS ecosystem and how it all

00:51:33,079 --> 00:51:39,079
works together this is kind of the

00:51:35,739 --> 00:51:41,809
evolution of the what Red Hat once

00:51:39,079 --> 00:51:43,099
talked that we've had people from Red

00:51:41,809 --> 00:51:46,789
Hat leadership give that flock

00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:49,819
previously this is a little bit less FA

00:51:46,789 --> 00:51:51,919
what Red Hat once and a what Red Hat is

00:51:49,819 --> 00:51:54,349
interested in doing and it's committed

00:51:51,919 --> 00:51:56,299
to doing and will be doing so we've

00:51:54,349 --> 00:51:57,769
scheduled that as a plenary talk because

00:51:56,299 --> 00:52:00,949
I think that will be interesting to

00:51:57,769 --> 00:52:05,479
everybody so that's coming up this

00:52:00,949 --> 00:52:08,179
afternoon and then immediately following

00:52:05,479 --> 00:52:12,349
this we're going to have some talks

00:52:08,179 --> 00:52:15,109
about the Fedora editions and our

00:52:12,349 --> 00:52:17,539
objectives the objectives are a fedora

00:52:15,109 --> 00:52:19,549
council thing where we have something

00:52:17,539 --> 00:52:23,929
that spans like a 12 to 18 month time

00:52:19,549 --> 00:52:25,669
frame with a measurable goal and we have

00:52:23,929 --> 00:52:27,589
a leadership position on the council to

00:52:25,669 --> 00:52:29,419
make sure that goal happens if you have

00:52:27,589 --> 00:52:31,849
something big you want to happen in

00:52:29,419 --> 00:52:33,799
fedora coming to the council with an

00:52:31,849 --> 00:52:35,959
objective proposal is a good way to do

00:52:33,799 --> 00:52:38,179
that so we have some people who have

00:52:35,959 --> 00:52:40,309
done that who will be presenting on the

00:52:38,179 --> 00:52:42,439
state of their objectives and then we'll

00:52:40,309 --> 00:52:44,719
also have overviews from our primary

00:52:42,439 --> 00:52:48,319
Fedora editions and what's going on

00:52:44,719 --> 00:52:50,779
there also tomorrow we'll have an

00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:52,069
awesome keynote about if you see

00:52:50,779 --> 00:52:53,359
something that you don't like how to

00:52:52,069 --> 00:52:54,650
make it better or if you have something

00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:56,900
you want to do how to make it better

00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:59,089
in general and open source and I saw a

00:52:56,900 --> 00:53:00,740
version of this talk at Ted Kaufman I

00:52:59,089 --> 00:53:02,720
thought this is something that we really

00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:05,960
could benefit from in Fedora community

00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:08,450
so wake up early tomorrow come to that

00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:11,450
keynote as well but up next the edition

00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:12,410
talks do how are we doing for time here

00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:17,980
I wasn't paying attention

00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:20,240
yeah we're fine okay all right okay so

00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:25,779
did you have them in order to you want

00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:31,069
to introduce do you wanna Matthias Oh

00:53:25,779 --> 00:53:36,319
bad here your desktop person why doesn't

00:53:31,069 --> 00:53:37,849
this person when I did present it

00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:41,410
doesn't go to the secondary screen I

00:53:37,849 --> 00:53:41,410
just need to drag it over or as ages

00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:51,339
right I'll let you

00:53:52,930 --> 00:54:00,250
all right good morning everybody i'm

00:53:55,810 --> 00:54:02,290
mateus and give a quick update on the

00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:03,370
workstation edition and what's going on

00:54:02,290 --> 00:54:05,590
there what has been happening in the

00:54:03,370 --> 00:54:07,900
last year and what we're looking to do

00:54:05,590 --> 00:54:09,610
in the next year it's hard to go up

00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:11,920
after Matthew because I have no graphs

00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:15,400
at all but I'll try to make it

00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:17,320
interesting anyway so moving to the

00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:20,560
highlights one thing I wanted to mention

00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:21,490
here is battery battery life it's

00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:23,920
something that we have been interested

00:54:21,490 --> 00:54:26,530
in improving for a long time and in the

00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:29,520
last year hunts Dakota has been doing

00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:33,250
some work in this area it's been

00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:35,770
changing a lot of things from hard disk

00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:37,600
power management or USB Auto suspend if

00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:39,850
you want to know all the things he has

00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:42,130
done you can look at the change page

00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:46,150
that I linked up there where it's all

00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:48,580
described in detail and it's a it's a

00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:49,780
very useful product I think not just

00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:52,390
because it lets us all get more work

00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:55,090
done on airplanes but it also gets us

00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:58,330
some quite nice headlines and visibility

00:54:55,090 --> 00:55:00,100
that I've listed to here so these things

00:54:58,330 --> 00:55:04,650
actually get noticed in the in the

00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:04,650
public and help us spread Fedora wider

00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:16,160
yes I'm keeping up with her face and

00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:18,230
it's an ongoing project of course um he

00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:19,340
has one example that we've tackled in

00:55:18,230 --> 00:55:20,780
the last year

00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:23,270
Christian cannon and the desktop team

00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:26,480
has been working on adding support for

00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:28,820
and about devices to fedora and that's a

00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:30,320
good example of a project that shows the

00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:32,360
scale of plumbing work that you often

00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:35,540
have to do just before we can put a new

00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:37,570
new icon on the top panel or like expose

00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:40,130
something in the control center this

00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:42,230
fixing from fixing to counter drivers to

00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:44,090
writing a new user space demon in this

00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:46,330
case it's port there is a user space

00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:49,850
demon it miniatures the Thunder board

00:55:46,330 --> 00:55:52,790
security levels to all these things

00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:54,260
before we can actually put some UI on

00:55:52,790 --> 00:55:57,380
top and make it all look easy and and

00:55:54,260 --> 00:56:01,280
just work but all of this is happening

00:55:57,380 --> 00:56:02,990
and learning in Fedora 29 I believe and

00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:04,460
there's again a change page that you can

00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:10,220
look at if you want to know more about

00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:11,750
this moving on to from the updates

00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:12,860
that's actually one thing I've I was

00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:13,970
going to mention for Thunder board as

00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:16,040
well that's another thing that we had to

00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:18,400
enable for Thunderbolt devices making

00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:22,490
sure that we can update their finger and

00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:24,710
this DFS is the project at which I

00:56:22,490 --> 00:56:26,630
choose and my team's running for making

00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:29,840
sure that firmware updates are solved

00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:32,000
problem on Linux and I think that's also

00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:35,270
a good project in terms of visibility a

00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,650
lot of the big names are presently and

00:56:35,270 --> 00:56:40,040
now if you haven't had a look at the

00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:41,120
vendor list this is this website you

00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:45,290
should go and have a look there there's

00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:48,410
everybody from their HP Intel Wacom play

00:56:45,290 --> 00:56:50,120
all there and all support this and just

00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:51,650
recently I think some people were happy

00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:55,270
to notice that they I think pads

00:56:51,650 --> 00:57:01,359
actually get firmware updates now and

00:56:55,270 --> 00:57:05,170
yes moving on to more hardware support

00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:07,809
what do I have here yes Libyan policy

00:57:05,170 --> 00:57:09,910
low-level component that manages input

00:57:07,809 --> 00:57:12,130
devices it's shared between Weiland and

00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:15,099
X it's a good thing and it has been

00:57:12,130 --> 00:57:16,299
around for for quite a while so it's not

00:57:15,099 --> 00:57:17,529
really something that we started in the

00:57:16,299 --> 00:57:19,989
last year but I wanted to mention it

00:57:17,529 --> 00:57:22,660
here because Peter Herrera who works on

00:57:19,989 --> 00:57:25,269
this that's now made a copper available

00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:28,119
that the very latest get version of live

00:57:25,269 --> 00:57:32,019
input that you can enable and help us

00:57:28,119 --> 00:57:35,109
test and improve live input another

00:57:32,019 --> 00:57:36,849
thing I've half years the VirtualBox

00:57:35,109 --> 00:57:39,640
guest additions that we now installed by

00:57:36,849 --> 00:57:43,200
default I think since Fedor 38 to make

00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:43,200
it all work nicely in VirtualBox and

00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:48,219
over here on the on the left side the

00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:51,099
screenshot shows some of the work we've

00:57:48,219 --> 00:57:52,930
done on improving the handling of

00:57:51,099 --> 00:57:56,319
multiple monitors in monitors in general

00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:59,950
in the desktop you can see like the high

00:57:56,319 --> 00:58:02,289
DPI scaling now supports not just once

00:57:59,950 --> 00:58:09,849
and twice but also intermediate levels

00:58:02,289 --> 00:58:12,880
of scaling things like that right pipe

00:58:09,849 --> 00:58:14,049
fire is the next thing the screenshot

00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,449
here shows women

00:58:14,049 --> 00:58:19,390
question testing pipe fire using a

00:58:16,449 --> 00:58:22,359
webcam I think that was actually testing

00:58:19,390 --> 00:58:25,509
like some effects or something and pipe

00:58:22,359 --> 00:58:28,029
is it's a new project that aims to do

00:58:25,509 --> 00:58:30,069
for video what pods audio did for audio

00:58:28,029 --> 00:58:32,709
I guess you can say it's basically

00:58:30,069 --> 00:58:37,479
managing video streams inside the kernel

00:58:32,709 --> 00:58:39,900
and efficient efficiently and the short

00:58:37,479 --> 00:58:41,920
term goals or for pipe pipe I I include

00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:43,390
replacing post audio because if you can

00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:47,099
manage video streams then audio is not

00:58:43,390 --> 00:58:49,180
that hard and and also supporting

00:58:47,099 --> 00:58:51,279
screencasting and tester promoting under

00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:54,430
Weiland will use pipe fire for that as

00:58:51,279 --> 00:58:57,369
well and the longer-term goals include

00:58:54,430 --> 00:59:00,249
also supporting jack applications and

00:58:57,369 --> 00:59:03,530
professional audio and finally having a

00:59:00,249 --> 00:59:05,840
unified base for media essentially

00:59:03,530 --> 00:59:07,940
and yeah that that's very young we

00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:09,290
started that was the end of last year

00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:11,090
and I think that's a hackfest this fall

00:59:09,290 --> 00:59:13,220
if you're really interested in in

00:59:11,090 --> 00:59:15,140
contributing in this area you could look

00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:16,250
that up and and work on that and if

00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:17,840
you're in general interested in more

00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:20,570
information about pipe fire you can also

00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:25,040
follow that link up there to the blog

00:59:20,570 --> 00:59:27,170
post a question wrote about it yes this

00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:28,730
is a quick run through some of the other

00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:31,940
things that we've done in the past year

00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:33,320
there's a lot of ongoing improvements in

00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:35,060
the desktop they're just like coming

00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:36,650
from upstream some of them we are

00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:38,510
directly involved in some are just like

00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:40,250
stuff that happens in the community and

00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:42,050
I'm not going to read that whole list

00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:44,119
maybe just calling out one thing here

00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:45,560
you can actually run Firefox natively on

00:59:44,119 --> 00:59:47,270
Whalen now there's a separate package

00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:51,320
for that called Firefox tetravalent I

00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:53,240
believe may be worth trying out and the

00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:56,200
screenshot here shows support for emoji

00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:56,200
that's of course everybody's favorite

00:59:57,670 --> 01:00:03,200
right you already saw must under here

01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:04,550
more or less or silver blue is a new

01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,920
initiative that we started this year at

01:00:04,550 --> 01:00:09,440
Def Con it's basically about making

01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:11,089
fedora atomic workstation ready for

01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,630
primetime and expose it to a wider

01:00:11,089 --> 01:00:13,460
audience

01:00:11,630 --> 01:00:14,690
and I should take a step back and say

01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:16,580
that we had an atomic variant of the

01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:19,760
workstation for a few years now things

01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:21,830
since for about 25 it was hosted in

01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:23,599
inside protect product atomic and was a

01:00:21,830 --> 01:00:26,030
little under the radar I guess the

01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:28,130
little now a few people tried it and

01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:30,170
liked it but we didn't really advertise

01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:31,970
it and silver blue is about changing

01:00:30,170 --> 01:00:33,980
their and basically making it ready for

01:00:31,970 --> 01:00:38,030
primetime and using it to spread fedora

01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:39,859
liner and yeah what does it mean to make

01:00:38,030 --> 01:00:40,970
it ready for primetime I've listed a few

01:00:39,859 --> 01:00:43,700
of the things there that we are working

01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:45,950
on we need first-class support for flat

01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:48,170
pack and our chemistry and in gloom

01:00:45,950 --> 01:00:51,080
software we'll have a working solution

01:00:48,170 --> 01:00:52,790
for updating the software on on silver

01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:56,570
blue because other blue is using OS 3 as

01:00:52,790 --> 01:00:59,300
a mess you already said and that also

01:00:56,570 --> 01:01:01,910
means including support for package

01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:03,900
layering and support for automatic

01:01:01,910 --> 01:01:06,720
updates

01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:09,900
and it also means better support for

01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:12,539
containers in the desktop departure my

01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:14,579
team is looking at writing something

01:01:12,539 --> 01:01:16,140
like a toolbox container that basically

01:01:14,579 --> 01:01:19,109
is a fedora in a box that you can just

01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:20,430
use on an atomic system because you

01:01:19,109 --> 01:01:21,539
cannot just install it up yet if you

01:01:20,430 --> 01:01:23,730
miss something so you go into the

01:01:21,539 --> 01:01:25,440
container and you do it there we're

01:01:23,730 --> 01:01:27,900
hoping to land some some preview of that

01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:29,999
in fit over 29 and then we'd also look

01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:31,650
at integrating that nicely with the

01:01:29,999 --> 01:01:32,999
terminal so you can actually get some

01:01:31,650 --> 01:01:34,410
context information about whether you

01:01:32,999 --> 01:01:38,400
are inside the container outside or

01:01:34,410 --> 01:01:41,249
things like that what else do I want to

01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:43,890
say here yes the name certainly has I've

01:01:41,249 --> 01:01:46,410
had variety reactions to the name it's

01:01:43,890 --> 01:01:49,019
um not everybody's favorite but it's a

01:01:46,410 --> 01:01:50,910
new name and we also have a new logo and

01:01:49,019 --> 01:01:52,140
a new website this is just because we

01:01:50,910 --> 01:01:53,970
want to reach a wider audience Ian

01:01:52,140 --> 01:01:55,799
Bedford or OSU as miss you already set

01:01:53,970 --> 01:01:59,009
the graph you're kind of flat at the end

01:01:55,799 --> 01:02:01,579
and so all of these new things are that

01:01:59,009 --> 01:02:01,579
means to that end

01:02:09,470 --> 01:02:15,420
right and yeah another thing that we are

01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:17,039
trying to reach new audiences yes we are

01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:18,989
going away from using a mailing distance

01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:21,299
if you're trying to use discourse like a

01:02:18,989 --> 01:02:23,460
pep forum essentially I think Messi is

01:02:21,299 --> 01:02:26,279
gonna have a discussion about that it's

01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:28,470
today or look tomorrow I don't know okay

01:02:26,279 --> 01:02:30,480
so it's try new things are trying to

01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:32,489
reach new audiences it's sometimes hard

01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:35,299
for old timers like me but I think it's

01:02:32,489 --> 01:02:37,980
a good thing to do every now and then

01:02:35,299 --> 01:02:40,410
this is my last slide a click view of at

01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:42,210
what's coming in the next year of the

01:02:40,410 --> 01:02:46,440
currently working on just things like a

01:02:42,210 --> 01:02:50,609
smooth boot Peter Jones is working on

01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:52,799
that and we're working on better support

01:02:50,609 --> 01:02:56,210
for the Nvidia driver 4x valent and

01:02:52,799 --> 01:02:56,210
4 hyper graphics

01:02:56,999 --> 01:03:00,130
yeah well it's been sharing and

01:02:58,989 --> 01:03:01,390
promoting I already mentioned that we

01:03:00,130 --> 01:03:03,519
are using pipe fire for that that's

01:03:01,390 --> 01:03:11,199
hopefully going to be supported in Fedor

01:03:03,519 --> 01:03:12,849
29 game-mode is about battery life again

01:03:11,199 --> 01:03:14,559
or basically the opposite of saving

01:03:12,849 --> 01:03:18,400
battery life is making it so that you

01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:20,769
can run your games at fault last yeah

01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:22,900
Messi already mentioned that one is

01:03:20,769 --> 01:03:23,949
working on building flat packs inside

01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:26,109
Fedora from rpms

01:03:23,949 --> 01:03:27,549
I think Owens talking about that on

01:03:26,109 --> 01:03:31,150
Friday so you can go there if you want

01:03:27,549 --> 01:03:32,559
to hear more about that yes you we are

01:03:31,150 --> 01:03:34,329
working on bringing automatic updates

01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:37,660
and follow up here I was three support

01:03:34,329 --> 01:03:39,819
and guram software that mostly land in

01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:43,329
Fedora 29 maybe some of it will go into

01:03:39,819 --> 01:03:45,670
Fedora 30 and yeah but I just mentioned

01:03:43,329 --> 01:03:48,939
we work on better support for containers

01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:53,109
and a tool box container mainly for

01:03:48,939 --> 01:03:56,789
server and with that I'll hand the

01:03:53,109 --> 01:03:56,789
microphone to who's next

01:03:59,569 --> 01:04:18,720
well the kiss right well I'll just I

01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:21,619
guess no minutes Steve good I made you a

01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:24,619
slide where did it go

01:04:21,619 --> 01:04:24,619
right

01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:37,340
good morning so for those of you who

01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:41,670
don't know me I'm Steven Gallagher I

01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:44,280
have more or less than I don't like to

01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:46,410
say I lead the server audition I feel

01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:47,670
like I'm or just make sure everybody

01:04:46,410 --> 01:04:49,920
shows up to the meetings because I'd

01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:53,280
really I really prefer that it be a

01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:55,500
community it kind of kind of a

01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:58,680
roundtable situation where everybody

01:04:55,500 --> 01:05:00,870
shows up has an equal voice so I mostly

01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:08,510
do this because I'm the least squeamish

01:05:00,870 --> 01:05:10,740
about public speaking of the members so

01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:14,100
this last year has been a really

01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:16,770
interesting one in the may you live in

01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:20,790
interesting times sort of way for the

01:05:16,770 --> 01:05:25,740
fedora server edition we have had in the

01:05:20,790 --> 01:05:27,930
same 12-month period a fairly some

01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:29,490
fairly large disasters followed by one

01:05:27,930 --> 01:05:32,370
of our I think what is probably server

01:05:29,490 --> 01:05:35,520
additions biggest success to date which

01:05:32,370 --> 01:05:40,740
has then led us into an identity crisis

01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:42,240
so let me see where to start when I

01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:44,790
stood up when I stood up and gave my

01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:47,460
state of the server Union last year at

01:05:44,790 --> 01:05:48,570
flock and I'm gonna try not to cover too

01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:52,980
much of what I'm going to cover in that

01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:55,020
talk later today I'll add tomorrow I was

01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:57,660
pitching that the server Edition was

01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:58,950
going full in on modularity which

01:05:57,660 --> 01:06:03,960
Matthew has talked about a little bit

01:05:58,950 --> 01:06:05,490
and and we did and we we put a Red Hat

01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:08,100
put a lot of resources towards this and

01:06:05,490 --> 01:06:09,810
we were building this really neat idea

01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:12,570
where everything in the system was a

01:06:09,810 --> 01:06:14,160
module you could move whichever piece of

01:06:12,570 --> 01:06:17,550
your system you wanted at any given

01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:20,820
moment and it turned out that that

01:06:17,550 --> 01:06:24,590
really was both not possible and really

01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:24,590
hard to get people to try it to try out

01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:35,950
I'm sorry well yeah okay so the question

01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:42,490
was if it's not possible how could they

01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:43,480
try it you're catching on really there

01:06:42,490 --> 01:06:47,410
were a whole lot of bootstrapping

01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:50,140
problems so we we were faced with a

01:06:47,410 --> 01:06:52,329
decision we got this was October

01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:56,680
November of last year so a few months

01:06:52,329 --> 01:06:58,119
after flock and we either had we were

01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:59,740
either going to toss it and scrap the

01:06:58,119 --> 01:07:03,750
plan or we try it we're going to try

01:06:59,740 --> 01:07:06,369
something new and several several people

01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:08,799
basically had an international hackfest

01:07:06,369 --> 01:07:11,319
FERC for about two weeks and came up

01:07:08,799 --> 01:07:12,819
with a way to reuse as much as possible

01:07:11,319 --> 01:07:16,599
of what we had already done and we came

01:07:12,819 --> 01:07:18,010
up with a new approach and we we pitched

01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:19,359
it to Red Hat and they decided to keep

01:07:18,010 --> 01:07:23,529
moving with it and moving forward with

01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:24,970
it and we got it into Fedora 28 and we

01:07:23,529 --> 01:07:28,720
knew we delivered it as part of the

01:07:24,970 --> 01:07:30,609
default of our 28 server edition and it

01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:34,390
actually worked for the most part we had

01:07:30,609 --> 01:07:37,390
a few bugs with package kit but we

01:07:34,390 --> 01:07:40,680
actually were able to prove that it is

01:07:37,390 --> 01:07:44,109
possible to build a modular system

01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:45,549
we just couldn't start we couldn't start

01:07:44,109 --> 01:07:47,769
from the ground up we had to we had to

01:07:45,549 --> 01:07:50,559
take the existing system and make it and

01:07:47,769 --> 01:07:53,259
start breaking off chunks until it and

01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:54,609
until eventually we hope to get to that

01:07:53,259 --> 01:07:56,880
final place but it was we were

01:07:54,609 --> 01:07:59,859
approaching it from the wrong direction

01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:01,450
and then why are we doing this Matthew

01:07:59,859 --> 01:08:04,240
also talked a little bit about that he

01:08:01,450 --> 01:08:07,420
gave most of my talk so this is a little

01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:10,509
tricky here he it's about solving the

01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:13,269
too fast and too slow problem the

01:08:10,509 --> 01:08:15,279
Matthew alluded to the Venn diagram of

01:08:13,269 --> 01:08:17,409
that I wanted to give you a visual and I

01:08:15,279 --> 01:08:18,909
was I was scrambling a little while ago

01:08:17,409 --> 01:08:20,920
to see if I could find one slide to put

01:08:18,909 --> 01:08:22,650
up here but so I'm gonna have to ask you

01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:25,540
to use your imaginations for this one

01:08:22,650 --> 01:08:28,150
think of any three or four year old

01:08:25,540 --> 01:08:31,120
child you've ever seen playing with an

01:08:28,150 --> 01:08:33,759
ink stamp that is what the Venn diagram

01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:35,199
of people who's a people people's I want

01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:36,690
this to be stable and I want this to be

01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:39,180
fed to be fast

01:08:36,690 --> 01:08:41,130
it looks like just punch a bunch of

01:08:39,180 --> 01:08:41,850
stamps on the page and that's that's

01:08:41,130 --> 01:08:45,270
what it looks like

01:08:41,850 --> 01:08:49,230
there is absolutely no two customers or

01:08:45,270 --> 01:08:51,810
users for whom that for whom those sets

01:08:49,230 --> 01:08:53,810
of packages are going to be the same so

01:08:51,810 --> 01:08:58,469
that's why we is so that is why we did

01:08:53,810 --> 01:09:00,630
we did this modularity thing now where

01:08:58,469 --> 01:09:03,330
did that lead us it led us to a place

01:09:00,630 --> 01:09:06,000
where we realized we've actually we've

01:09:03,330 --> 01:09:07,680
accomplished this there are a few bugs

01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:10,020
are waiting to be worked out but once

01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:12,120
that is finished we don't actually know

01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:13,469
where to go next

01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:17,430
we've built it we've built something

01:09:13,469 --> 01:09:19,920
that once we can get it into into Apple

01:09:17,430 --> 01:09:23,190
once we can get it to work on on an

01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:25,680
Enterprise Linux system we now have to

01:09:23,190 --> 01:09:30,480
figure out what does sort of server

01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:31,770
Edition do because realistically we know

01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:33,569
that what people are going to do is

01:09:31,770 --> 01:09:36,719
they're going to prefer to take an apple

01:09:33,569 --> 01:09:40,469
base and to take an Enterprise Linux

01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:43,140
base and use modules in Apple there's

01:09:40,469 --> 01:09:45,270
still and there's still value to red hat

01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:46,890
at least for the server Edition to make

01:09:45,270 --> 01:09:50,060
sure that that continues to be a

01:09:46,890 --> 01:09:52,140
platform where we do integration testing

01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:53,489
you know to for things that will

01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:57,600
eventually become an enterprise linux

01:09:53,489 --> 01:09:59,610
itself as well but we don't know it

01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:01,590
we're pretty confident that that isn't

01:09:59,610 --> 01:10:02,880
going to gather a huge amount of

01:10:01,590 --> 01:10:04,050
community interest and we're not gonna

01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:05,969
have people coming out of the woodwork

01:10:04,050 --> 01:10:09,690
to say ooh I really want to work on that

01:10:05,969 --> 01:10:12,360
driver or I really really want to want

01:10:09,690 --> 01:10:14,070
to eat one hundredth of a percent of

01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:15,960
performance out of the out of the kernel

01:10:14,070 --> 01:10:18,090
today people are doing that and they're

01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:20,160
doing that outside of us the server

01:10:18,090 --> 01:10:23,070
edition needs a needs a target and a

01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:25,500
goal and it needs to needs to have a new

01:10:23,070 --> 01:10:28,140
purpose and that's what I'm not gonna

01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:29,489
spoil my entire talk for tomorrow but

01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:33,630
that's basically going to be the gist of

01:10:29,489 --> 01:10:37,980
it we need to find our new way forward

01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:39,390
and I encourage I beg in fact any of you

01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:41,280
who have any interest in this whatsoever

01:10:39,390 --> 01:10:42,870
to come to that talk it's not it's going

01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:44,010
to be about ten minutes of talk that'll

01:10:42,870 --> 01:10:46,540
be very similar to what you just heard

01:10:44,010 --> 01:10:48,550
and then a discussion I

01:10:46,540 --> 01:10:51,030
really want to hear from anybody that

01:10:48,550 --> 01:10:51,030
has ideas

01:11:03,710 --> 01:11:07,640
so we are actually going to break a

01:11:06,050 --> 01:11:09,080
little early for the coffee break

01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:10,820
because of the way the speakers are

01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:12,020
organized so that should work out really

01:11:10,820 --> 01:11:14,750
well

01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:17,150
it is currently 1018 so why don't we try

01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:18,890
to resume here at about 10:45 so we'll

01:11:17,150 --> 01:11:21,500
give those speakers some time on the

01:11:18,890 --> 01:11:23,150
other end if we need it before lunch the

01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:24,830
coffee break today is sponsored by arm

01:11:23,150 --> 01:11:26,570
and it is set up in the lobby and I

01:11:24,830 --> 01:11:28,820
encourage you to enjoy it

01:11:26,570 --> 01:11:32,590
there are regrettably no rpm

01:11:28,820 --> 01:11:32,590
