Talk: How we forked Fedora to make a Remix for our university
Presenters: Tim Zabel

Description: This talk covers TigerOS, a Fedora Remix aimed towards Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) university students, faculty, and staff. Using Fedora, we created a specialized Remix aimed towards RIT community members to give them a more streamlined Linux experience as they go through their classes. By creating this Remix, we learned a lot about the Fedora Infrastructure, figured out what worked for us, and furthermore what we had to improvise on our own. This talk explains how we created our Remix, why we chose Fedora to do so, and lessons weâ€™ve learned along the way.

This talk also explains the value of Fedora Remixes for the upstream Fedora Project and community. The Fedora Remix tools and resources allows our project to market and introduce Fedora to an audience that the upstream community would not normally have the resources to focus on. Therefore, we feel Fedora Remixes are an essential part of Fedora. Being able to easily take Fedora and modify it to fit unique needs is a powerful idea. In being a Remix, we are able to have both the Fedora upstream resources, and our personal customizations. This allows our project to work closely with upstream Fedora, contribute changes back upstream (like documentation), and offer a customized Fedora experience to a unique audience. In doing so, we allow our university community to have a better learning experience while also gaining the experience of using Fedora and Linux in general. Through this talk, we hope to demonstrate the unique value of Fedora Remixes to the Fedora community and why Fedora is one of the best platforms to build this experience with.

okay so welcome to Tiger less a for

00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:10,769
remix and so my name is Jim table I'm a

00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:14,280
student at the Rochester to technology

00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:18,570
in New York and I'm the president of RIT

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:22,080
lo University and together we've kind of

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:24,810
put together a remix for our University

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,730
and as a club and so it's gonna give you

00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:32,700
guys some background why we did it and

00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:35,670
all that kind of stuff so about Tiger

00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:38,399
less so first and foremost it's a

00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:41,879
student lab project at the University

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:47,120
and it being for by students for

00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:51,300
students it's a lot of challenges with

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:56,100
working with the like working with

00:00:51,300 --> 00:01:04,019
students while you are student can you

00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:06,150
guys all hear me uneven check okay so so

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,740
being a student is always challenging

00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:13,880
with between your school load and your

00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:16,710
outside activities and so working with a

00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:21,570
remix has been very interesting and

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:23,880
challenging process and so and then I

00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:27,990
thought I'm gonna tell you guys why we

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:30,659
made it so because you haven't not

00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:32,970
familiar with what a floor remix is it

00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:35,369
is a combination of through our software

00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:38,340
that is made by anyone in the community

00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:41,070
as opposed to a spin which is all floor

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,140
software that is a different desktop

00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:46,890
environment and it's also importantly

00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,810
all free software while remix did not

00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:53,220
necessarily have to be all free software

00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:57,350
and remixes specifically have a specific

00:01:53,220 --> 00:02:00,140
purpose for why it was made they tend to

00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:04,430
cater towards a very specific group

00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:06,950
individuals and so Tiger West is aimed

00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:11,540
towards both new students and all

00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:13,790
students and faculty and so this means

00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:16,340
that tigress has RIT specific branding

00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:18,440
and software that is very specific to

00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,840
our University that fedora would not

00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:26,090
have in its own package free business

00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:29,540
and so its main goal is to smooth the

00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:33,050
line with new users of Linux with their

00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:34,880
course lives because at RIT the a lot of

00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:36,950
the introductory courses and as well as

00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:41,600
the advanced courses focused a lot on

00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:47,000
using Linux as with the our class

00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:49,450
activities and then so what are exactly

00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:56,200
our goals why didn't we make Tiger less

00:02:49,450 --> 00:03:00,590
so the goals is to help new students get

00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:02,450
streamlined into using Linux and these

00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:04,610
students typically use Windows they

00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:06,739
typically come from a Windows background

00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:10,040
and when it has a very different feel to

00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:12,739
it so in order to smooth that line we

00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:17,049
want students to not have to use the

00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:20,150
terminal and so with that being said our

00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:22,549
ultimate goal is to aid students in the

00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:24,380
classroom by having all of their

00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:26,420
software that they need readily

00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:28,760
available so if you're a computer

00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:31,640
science student when you first boot up

00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,080
tiger with there was actually a screen

00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,540
that will come up and ask you what your

00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,280
major is and then after that it'll ask

00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:39,290
you what kind of software you want to

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,730
install and then it will install

00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:41,960
everything that you need for your major

00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:44,150
without ever needing

00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:46,730
landline and this can be very useful for

00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:48,230
a new student and they just want to get

00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:52,940
their work done they don't want to have

00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:56,930
to learn the Linux and so it creates a

00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:58,340
very interesting ecosystem with where

00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,870
you can get your work done at the same

00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:03,740
time here using fedora you're using

00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:10,810
Linux so it's a very familiar feel that

00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:12,620
while using an unfamiliar product so

00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:16,790
some of the history some of the

00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:18,950
background of how it was created so back

00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:21,710
in 2011 is when this project was

00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:27,970
initially built but it was built as the

00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:31,160
RIT the RT Linux through a remix re and

00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:34,460
so was created by Luke Mackin and Etan

00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,380
Romanov and however these were people

00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:38,480
were also students and once they

00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:40,370
graduated the project kind of diminished

00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:45,140
kind of got forgotten in a couple years

00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:48,410
and so in late 2016 or so a student

00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:51,200
found the project and we decided to

00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:52,280
bring it to a club vote as to should we

00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,800
pick it up

00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:57,620
should we rebrand it should we change

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,270
anything about it and so a little bit of

00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,680
time went by we weren't really sure if

00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:04,730
this is something we wanted to do or not

00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:07,490
but then in February of the next year we

00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:09,530
decided to pick it back up our project

00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:11,840
Leda sided it would be a great thing to

00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:14,540
do and so we sought to rebrand it as

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:20,810
Tiger West and this time we had a new

00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:23,360
goal in mind and so the current features

00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:26,900
that we have is the gnome desktop

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:30,020
environment which also as you know flora

00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:33,890
has as their default and then we also

00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:36,020
have the better default user interface

00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:38,570
and of course better is very subjective

00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:42,470
but coming from the windows background

00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:43,910
with these students we figured it would

00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:46,610
be a good idea to have a paddle at the

00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,480
bottom to very closely resemble what

00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:50,330
Windows

00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:52,370
their start menu and so we've used - to

00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:55,790
dock and we've rearranged some of the

00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:59,240
icons and made them into a panel and so

00:05:55,790 --> 00:06:00,260
that way they have a good nice feel that

00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:04,820
they're not that they're already

00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:07,160
familiar with and in addition to that it

00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:09,290
uses the Anaconda installer which is

00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:12,170
also actually I think Fedora moved away

00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:15,740
from that in this in through our 28 they

00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:18,800
have known some scholar and anaconda is

00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:21,260
amazing because you don't need to use

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,960
BQE in order to install everything that

00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:25,610
you need it does have a terminal

00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:32,720
installer which is what kicks out files

00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:35,300
use and so we've also include a software

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,780
that is available for the students to

00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:41,510
use Texas that the students need for

00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:44,090
their daily workflow and so not all

00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:46,850
these packages that they use have

00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:49,070
actually been created as RPM packages so

00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:51,770
have for work that we have to do is

00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:53,780
create these RPM packages that these

00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:55,670
students need so that they still get

00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,780
updates and they still get the fixed of

00:06:55,670 --> 00:07:02,890
that they need in order to get their

00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:05,900
work done and so this is what the

00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:08,360
default look of what progress looks like

00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:10,820
so as you can see you have the panel at

00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,730
the bottom the dock is a little bit

00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:17,090
smaller - a bit thinner and then we also

00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:20,630
have the logo which is a TIG one so it's

00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:22,940
a penguin and then it's also the tiger

00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:24,740
this is our mascot kind of merge symbol

00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,540
over together you have a nice little

00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:32,590
penguin there with some nice tiger

00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:32,590
stripes on there and so

00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:39,259
now that we have our initial project up

00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:43,490
and running how did we actually do this

00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:47,689
how did we go from nothing to a working

00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:50,719
project so the main thing was trial and

00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:53,719
error so the current infrastructure that

00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:55,789
we had to use is nothing like what Cody

00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:58,909
uses what Fodor uses for their own

00:07:55,789 --> 00:08:01,340
ecosystem so the coding infrastructure

00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:05,770
if those of you are familiar with it is

00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:08,389
too large for a small project and so

00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:11,180
that way that means that we need to

00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:13,969
create our own infrastructure to support

00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:17,719
the building of packages and a product

00:08:13,969 --> 00:08:19,460
mirror so in order to solve this issue

00:08:17,719 --> 00:08:22,400
we've had to go through a lot of trial

00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:24,919
and error of how do we actually manage

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:28,639
creating these packages how do we manage

00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:32,300
serving them on a mirror without a lot

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:35,000
of overhead so in order to solve this

00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:38,089
issue we first started with a single

00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:42,169
server that hosted both the builder and

00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:44,449
the mirror but we quickly found out that

00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:46,459
this is not a very good idea because if

00:08:44,449 --> 00:08:49,430
the Builder went down it's a mirror went

00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:51,110
down then they both went down so what we

00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:53,269
decided to do was have two separate

00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:56,180
servers one with the Builder and one

00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:58,010
with the mirror that way if one goes

00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:02,839
down the other most stays up and we can

00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:05,750
still get some work done so in order to

00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:08,269
and then after that once we had a lot of

00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:10,880
some of this stuff done we had to ask a

00:09:08,269 --> 00:09:12,500
lot of questions we were coming into a

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,839
new project in a new field that we

00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,970
weren't entirely familiar with and so we

00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:20,480
needed to find out a lot about how to

00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:22,089
actually find them some answers so in

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,620
order to fix our main and

00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:27,639
problem we have to ask a lot of

00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:30,899
questions so going into the floor IRC

00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:34,180
channel was a very very great help and

00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:36,430
so we had to also figure out what Josh

00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:39,370
or do other agreements as follows what

00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:42,279
would work best for a smaller project

00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:46,149
that still mimics what Pharrell is doing

00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:48,579
with her other intercession and also we

00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:51,189
had to answer what if the Builder uses

00:09:48,579 --> 00:09:52,689
too much too many resources or what if

00:09:51,189 --> 00:09:56,740
the mirror gets pulled with too many

00:09:52,689 --> 00:10:00,699
times and so should we just have one

00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:05,319
mirror and one builder or does multiple

00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:07,209
of each make more sense and also with

00:10:05,319 --> 00:10:09,309
that with all that being said there is

00:10:07,209 --> 00:10:12,420
not a lot of documentation that actually

00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:15,309
supports and gives a step-by-step on how

00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:17,170
remixes are actually built so a lot of

00:10:15,309 --> 00:10:19,899
this is actually trial and error with

00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:21,720
everyone who comes with a remix because

00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:24,519
there isn't that much information

00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,139
available for the creation of a remix

00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:28,269
it's available for what they are and

00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:32,889
what they do but not necessarily for the

00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:35,980
creation and so furthermore with all

00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:38,069
that being said why Fedora why not a pun

00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:42,370
- why not Archie why not anything else

00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:45,790
so the main reason is we wanted things

00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:47,470
to be easy and very simple to do for

00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:50,709
someone to come into the project and

00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:55,300
also we wanted a very little overhead

00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:58,509
with the key learning curve so with

00:10:55,300 --> 00:11:02,170
flora the process of making an ISO is so

00:10:58,509 --> 00:11:04,269
easy with a kickstart ISOs are just a

00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:06,399
breeze to make being able to easily

00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:08,850
specify what packages you want you can

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,889
easily take out packages add more and

00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:14,790
allows for terminal installation of

00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:17,520
anaconda which you can really have for

00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:19,470
or than that and no other distribution

00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:22,710
can really offer that level of

00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:26,450
flexibility we've tried between Ubuntu

00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:29,100
and fedora and but dude is just not a

00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:32,610
smooth this is not as a lot more steps

00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:34,950
that you have to work through and when

00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:37,050
you make a lot of custom packages time

00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:38,610
is really of the essence you don't want

00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:41,250
to be spending a lot of time creating

00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:44,670
the packages you just want them to be

00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:47,220
built and work on to the next one and so

00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:49,650
the process of building RPM packages is

00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:52,620
also very simple with a simple respect

00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:54,450
file it's very simple to put down

00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:57,120
exactly what you need to on what files

00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:58,530
you need put there and that's

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,720
essentially it it's essentially just a

00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:04,140
wrapper for the source files that

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:07,170
already exist and that furthermore is

00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:10,380
the ease of use with Thoreau the people

00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:13,380
being known it's very simple user

00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:15,420
interface to use and we wanted to use

00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:17,670
something that was simple and someone

00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:19,470
familiar and it's very easy to learn and

00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:22,260
so we actually started off with

00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:26,010
different desktop environments before we

00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:28,560
decided to settle unknown we actually

00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:30,960
initially started with cinnamon but

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,090
cinnamon had its own set of issues and

00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,910
problems even though it is actually more

00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:42,060
similar to a Windows experience compared

00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:44,100
to Nome and then also with recent

00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:47,460
additions of third-party repositories

00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:49,770
we've actually been able to have our

00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:53,520
repositories we have our own custom

00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:56,760
tigeress repositories we've are now able

00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:59,640
to get them in or put them into the

00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:03,330
known software and this makes it very

00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:08,940
very simple to have students find the

00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:12,530
software that they need and then so

00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:12,530
challenges that we have come

00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:21,230
so the first is that we started with an

00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:23,060
old project and whenever you pick up an

00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:26,420
old project that you have never seen

00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:28,640
before it can be very hard to sift

00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:31,579
through all the information of what has

00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:35,470
been done what needs to be done and how

00:13:31,579 --> 00:13:37,730
to do it so in order to solve this we've

00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:41,060
really had to look through the project

00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:43,160
and decide is there anything that we can

00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:47,779
continue with do we know what the curve

00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:51,800
goals are and if not can we create goals

00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:54,260
using this and so we had to decide that

00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,540
no we didn't actually want to use this

00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:58,910
so we took the ideas that we thought we

00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:03,790
could gather from the old project and

00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:06,829
rebuilt it into what it is now and also

00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:10,220
with the Nora structure being too large

00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:12,829
for the project we had to really figure

00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:15,500
out what we needed to do to scale it

00:14:12,829 --> 00:14:17,089
down if possible and so we spent a while

00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,040
working with cotija trying to figure out

00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:20,930
is there a way that we can make these

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,750
builds work without having to build our

00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:25,790
infrastructure and after a lot of

00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:27,380
discussion we've had to kind of decide

00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:33,860
that at the moment we need to have

00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:36,110
another structure and then also and last

00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:38,360
but not least with the documentation it

00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:41,720
was very hard to find documentation and

00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:45,440
there actually wasn't any other time so

00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:47,120
we've had to spend a lot of time kind of

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,399
figuring out what we needed to do and

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,260
while we're doing that we've also

00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:53,680
written down a lot of what we've had to

00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:55,850
do and there are now exists some

00:14:53,680 --> 00:15:01,279
agreements a foundation on how to build

00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:03,589
them and then so with all that process

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:09,050
what did we learn with building a

00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:11,240
project so projects are a lot bigger

00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:13,610
than you really think they are it's very

00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:16,250
hard to when you set a goal it's very

00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:18,410
hard to adhere to that with a

00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:20,780
schedule and so we have come time to

00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:23,510
learn that first hand very hard we set a

00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:26,150
date a couple months in advance to be

00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:32,090
able to make that goal to make that date

00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:34,490
and so nobody really kind of expected

00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:36,590
that and we've really had to learn and

00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:38,840
now instead of setting goals that are

00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:40,490
that we like really want to hit we have

00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:44,150
to be realistic and kind of understand

00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:50,570
how long it actually takes to build a

00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:52,430
large project and also there is the

00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:54,410
project management you have a lot of

00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:56,270
different varieties and the people who

00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:58,160
work with the project and it can be

00:15:56,270 --> 00:16:01,430
really hard to figure out who is good at

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:04,220
what what people would do best and also

00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:06,560
the different dynamics of people and how

00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:08,720
they work and so it's been a very

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,430
interesting challenge to kind of manage

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,980
a group of people and manage group of

00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:15,350
students around workloads and figure out

00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:20,720
what works best where people fit best

00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:26,360
without having much drama going on and

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:30,320
then so the last part is we also have

00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:33,200
all the design that we've had to do was

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:37,610
also custom-made for us with one of our

00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:40,370
students and they had never really used

00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:43,329
open source design tools before and so

00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:46,209
using tools like credo has been amazed

00:16:43,329 --> 00:16:48,220
tool in order to create some of our

00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:51,910
designs that we've had to do so all of

00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:53,949
our wallpapers and mascots and emblems

00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:56,379
are all custom made and it's been a very

00:16:53,949 --> 00:17:00,059
interesting process figuring out how the

00:16:56,379 --> 00:17:06,549
best way to make make these these things

00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:08,620
and so that being said how did Fedora

00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:11,079
help us how did Florence's help us to

00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:14,140
build what we wanted was essentially a

00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:18,399
tool for students to make their lives a

00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:21,039
little bit easier and so releases really

00:17:18,399 --> 00:17:23,829
helped us because they allowed us to

00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:25,990
reach a target audience a lot quicker

00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:29,860
and easier than we would have if we have

00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:32,200
to create our own distribution and if

00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:34,480
that being said we've also managed to

00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,610
keep all the updates that to our guests

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,200
that there's no more product and this is

00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:40,630
extremely important because why not -

00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:44,679
Dora makes an update we also get an

00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:47,139
update and so that way we don't have to

00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:48,809
focus on our own updates and we don't

00:17:47,139 --> 00:17:54,519
get an old product either

00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:57,370
and so remixes are an integral part of D

00:17:54,519 --> 00:18:00,429
through our community because Fedora

00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:03,100
itself and get into niche markets

00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:05,620
without the help of remixes they really

00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:08,409
are able to get and target a small

00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:10,539
audience and they don't need to work

00:18:08,409 --> 00:18:12,760
with fedora new in order to do that and

00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:15,580
people who use tiger as people who use

00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:19,690
remixes are using fedora and it really

00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:21,809
gets the out really gets everything out

00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:26,669
there and really gets the community

00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:26,669
surrounded in many different aspects and

00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:34,240
so we use everything on github and so if

00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:37,929
anybody wanted to contribute we have our

00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:41,980
github page there and so we also have a

00:18:37,929 --> 00:18:45,789
lot of documentation and package ideas

00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:47,380
and development and so one of our future

00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:48,850
features and goals what do we want to do

00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:55,420
in the near

00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:58,120
future so one thing we really need to

00:18:55,420 --> 00:19:00,610
work on is having a software installer

00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:03,430
and so one of the things that we need to

00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:06,610
do is start getting all of our repos to

00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:09,730
be either available in the software

00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:12,930
center or we need to figure out if we

00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:16,600
need to create our own package installer

00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:19,090
because our goal is to when a student

00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,380
installs this for the first time thank

00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:22,360
you we will show up and kind of walk

00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,890
them through the process and still at

00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:26,230
the moment what we have is just a

00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:28,870
terminal installer so it does everything

00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:30,580
that we wanted to do it ask for your

00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:33,280
major and it'll sell all the packages

00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:35,650
that you need but our goal was to use a

00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:38,050
have to have them not you the terminal

00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:42,940
and so that is one thing that we will

00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:46,240
need to figure out and also one thing

00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:48,520
that we have been doing is everything

00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,950
manually and we really need to figure

00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:55,030
out the best way to have continuous

00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:57,790
integration for building packages and up

00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:59,290
holding up the mirror we don't want to

00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:01,570
have to build packages manually every

00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:05,110
time we make a new version make a new

00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:07,060
update and so figuring out how to get a

00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:09,550
package build and then signed and then

00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:10,810
pushed through the mirror is going to be

00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:13,900
a challenge that we're going to have to

00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:17,260
eventually get through because it would

00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:19,750
be very helpful if we didn't need to

00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:21,460
have to wait for one person to sign a

00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:23,710
packager for one person to move it over

00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:26,050
because currently we have one person

00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:27,880
doing the package development and then

00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:29,590
one person is working with the the

00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:34,330
mirror and the Builder in order to get

00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:35,320
everything working together and also we

00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:38,620
would like to have complete

00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:41,380
documentation on how to use the product

00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:44,260
but also how to build a remix so it's

00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:46,909
very ongoing process and having complete

00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:49,669
documentation would allow other members

00:20:46,909 --> 00:20:51,590
to build remixes much more fluid learn

00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:54,259
from our mistakes and have a lot better

00:20:51,590 --> 00:21:01,070
time developing a remix for their own

00:20:54,259 --> 00:21:03,859
needs and so if that being said that is

00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:06,200
the end in the presentation and so if

00:21:03,859 --> 00:21:09,169
you want to contact at all our website

00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:12,009
is up there and also if we want to talk

00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:21,220
to me you can find me on the IRC and

00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:21,220
thank you there any questions at all

00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:36,979
actually using sure so for the Builder

00:21:31,429 --> 00:21:41,479
we use a flora server and so what we do

00:21:36,979 --> 00:21:44,989
is we use the Cooper rpm build package

00:21:41,479 --> 00:21:46,879
and so it'll pull from the get repo

00:21:44,989 --> 00:21:49,700
wherever it exists where the packages

00:21:46,879 --> 00:21:52,039
exist and then it'll put everything

00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:55,039
together and build a package into an RPM

00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:58,759
package and our PM packages have both a

00:21:55,039 --> 00:22:01,129
source and regular RPM package and then

00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:04,099
they get sent to another directory where

00:22:01,129 --> 00:22:06,979
someone then signs that and then pushed

00:22:04,099 --> 00:22:10,029
that to the other server up to the

00:22:06,979 --> 00:22:10,029
correct location long mirror

00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:18,620
specific like software that's made

00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:20,840
available for the tiger westerns sure so

00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:25,930
some of the software that is available

00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:33,230
for the say for the CS major is PyCharm

00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:35,990
Python and also program J flap and also

00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:39,080
making sure all of the like GCC is

00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:42,020
already on there and so we actually had

00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:44,660
to package Python PyCharm ourselves but

00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:45,920
with the third-party repositories we now

00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:48,020
actually have been able to get rid of

00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:50,810
that and you can just install Python

00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:55,490
from himself or itself so that's that's

00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:59,510
been really helpful for us and so with

00:22:55,490 --> 00:23:01,880
the other the other packages is actually

00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:03,710
it's still an ongoing process this our

00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:08,720
current goal is to have it for all of

00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:10,610
the tech section of our university and I

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,820
suppose even with the the other sessions

00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:19,430
is a like date the math and engineering

00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:22,670
building do have packages as well and so

00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:24,980
we currently have completed the CS vit

00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:31,880
and the software engineering major and

00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:34,100
we still have two more ago do you think

00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:38,060
some other universities could use this

00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:40,750
pipeline this infrastructure do you

00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:45,080
think that they could use it like for

00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:47,660
their own spin Wednesday or in other

00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:51,560
words do plan to contact universities or

00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:54,470
did you think about this oh yes so Kurt

00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:58,430
so our current status of the project is

00:23:54,470 --> 00:24:01,730
we are trying to hit a much cooler than

00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:02,230
actually a beta release in the beginning

00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:05,110
of the

00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:08,520
semester which is in I guess like three

00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:11,770
weeks or so and so once we do that we're

00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:13,870
going to make an announcement to these

00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:15,100
students and to everyone that it's now

00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:17,710
available because there's been people

00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:19,299
fouling it but not like people have been

00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:20,620
using it yeah just because it doesn't

00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:25,330
have all the functionality that we

00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:26,830
really wanted to have and the university

00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:29,559
does actually know of the project

00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:33,010
already and one of our ultimate goals is

00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:36,160
to get it on to the CS machines because

00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:38,230
right now the machines that students use

00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,890
for their classes in the computer

00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:41,590
science department

00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:43,090
are they go on the boat too and we're

00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:45,549
being really nice if we could get Tiger

00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:47,679
West onto those machines because some

00:24:45,549 --> 00:24:49,840
other departments actually use rel on

00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,150
their machines so it would be a

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:55,450
relatively streamlined experience if to

00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:58,330
move from the bun to to Tiger less so

00:24:55,450 --> 00:25:00,700
we've had you contact first the the cs

00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:04,510
department head and then they've had to

00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:06,040
even contact a few other people and that

00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:09,490
they will have to in order to get that

00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:12,340
all set up so once we hit our final

00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:16,450
release which would have everything

00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:18,280
which would have all of the other majors

00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:21,700
that we want all of their packages all

00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:24,760
ready to go and also the the GUI

00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:26,740
installer is the main thing that we

00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:28,960
really need to think how we need to do

00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:31,450
right now once we get that then we

00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:35,320
really will be trying to streamline this

00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:37,630
into the the full university and there

00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:41,679
should be a really interesting if we

00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:45,700
could once we get the whole project like

00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:49,750
completed we really want to try to build

00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:52,480
a tool for any other university to make

00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:53,440
their own repo their own remix these

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,360
never have been actually other

00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:58,720
universities that want to try to use

00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:00,790
this but they don't really want to have

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,650
to go through the whole process again so

00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:05,650
it would be really nice if we could make

00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:07,840
a kind of a tool where they just input

00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:09,570
some simple information and we'll build

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:12,150
a remix that space towards their school

00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:14,580
and so that would be a really great

00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:17,730
to get throughout to university students

00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:19,620
in a very easy to do way and so that

00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:22,170
would be kind of the the ultimate goal

00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:24,810
would be to have to give universities

00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:31,590
the the chance to be able to easily make

00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:32,970
a Linux distro without having to put too

00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:36,270
much of their own effort they don't need

00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:38,550
to do much building on their own and

00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:40,260
that is focused towards their students

00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:42,510
and not just the generic distribution

00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:47,190
that would be really cool and it really

00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:50,100
gives students like an adoption because

00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:52,680
it's their school's distro so that would

00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:56,700
be that's kind of the the ultimate goal

00:26:52,680 --> 00:27:02,250
to kind of bring it down to give Linux

00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:04,860
to the younger students and just being

00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:08,130
able to give it to students who wouldn't

00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:10,770
generically use Linux would be a great

00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:12,900
way to kind of like spread open source

00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:15,260
to lots of the communities that you

00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,260
wouldn't expect

00:27:25,129 --> 00:27:31,580
I think it actually changed with the the

00:27:28,999 --> 00:27:39,200
recent change of the occupation but it

00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:41,600
it lived in the fedora fedora docks /

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:45,379
remix building is where our current

00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:48,619
documentation lives and it is for how to

00:27:45,379 --> 00:27:52,299
build and ISO and how to build RPM

00:27:48,619 --> 00:27:54,970
packages and it also lists how to set up

00:27:52,299 --> 00:27:58,789
two servers that you'll be needing for

00:27:54,970 --> 00:28:01,519
the Builder and a mirror so if you want

00:27:58,789 --> 00:28:03,799
to see how we have our infrastructure

00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:08,740
set up you can also visit that a little

00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:08,740
bit warm yes

00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:32,090
so it's not a lot

00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:50,210
so it would be under the quick talk

00:28:47,969 --> 00:28:50,210
session

00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,890
how do you make it

00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:12,429
exact change

00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,640
they did

00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:23,510
god I'm a figure out when they put it

00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,510
done

00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:33,860
yeah because it used to be that's a very

00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:33,860
the very top that area

00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:49,610
okay so didn't move

00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:56,660
so thank you for everything you know I

00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:59,170
guess I need to figure out where they

00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:59,170
moved it too

00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:25,740
Louis at least hear this word gets made

00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:31,460
underwear on the docks I guess he got

00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:31,460
here too but yeah

00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:48,559
any other final questions alright well

00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:48,559
thank you guys all for coming to talk

00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:54,880
