Talk: Thank the Fedora Community! Launching Fedora Appreciation Week
Presenters: Jona Azizaj, Bee Padalkar, Anna Philips

Description: Inspired by the Ubuntu Community Appreciation Day, Fedora Appreciation Week is an initiative to celebrate the community behind the success of Fedora. Through this week, there will be different events and initiatives through which Fedora community members are encouraged to give their thanks and show their appreciation to people involved in Fedora community.
To organize a Fedora Appreciation Day, outreach and awareness are important ahead of time so the community is aware of the event. Especially for something that has not yet happened before, spending extra time on awareness will be important so contributors remember and are aware of the day. We aim to launch the Fedora Appreciation Week to the community at FLOCK through this talk, followed by outreach through various other communication channels. We will introduce the Fedora Appreciation Week and release the dates for the event. We will also introduce and demonstrate Fedora Happiness Packets, an open source platform which community members can use during Fedora appreciation week 2018 to send thank you messages and positive feedback to other Fedora Community members. We will also talk about contributor stories - what are they, why should you submit one and how can you submit it - and how they are an integral part of Fedora Appreciation Week.

so let's talk a bit about safe there I

00:01:57,109 --> 00:02:03,289
appreciation we let how started how we

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:06,649
had this idea first we were inspired by

00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:09,229
the Ubuntu community they were doing a

00:02:06,649 --> 00:02:11,930
bundle community Appreciation Day and we

00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:13,700
wanted it would be very interesting to

00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:16,910
have something similar for Fedora

00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:18,890
community in this way we can say thank

00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:22,989
you to all our contributors that are

00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:26,000
working really hard in their free time

00:02:22,989 --> 00:02:29,120
in this way they can feel that their

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,860
contributions are very valuable for our

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:36,079
community and in this way we can they

00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:39,110
it's kind of a way to tell them that

00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:41,959
their time is very valuable for all of

00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:45,489
us and for everything that they are

00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:48,560
doing because let's say fedora it is

00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:50,599
very powerful operating system and so on

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,129
but because of the community that is

00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:54,129
working really hard behind it

00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:02,890
and yes it's because of these people

00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:05,349
that are part of us not all the people

00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:08,319
were here this is a group photo that we

00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:10,959
did and block two years before yes in

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:20,950
Krakow and I'm really glad that the

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:23,980
community is growing even more so what

00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:27,310
we will do throughout the week we will

00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:29,500
have different events or initiative that

00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:32,920
will be part of it our appreciation week

00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:35,530
and all the community a community

00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:38,830
members let's say are very encouraged to

00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:41,709
say thank you to another person for

00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:44,350
something specific that that person has

00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:47,380
done has done let's say for example if

00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:49,450
you want to say thank you someone that

00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:53,049
helped you a lot especially when you

00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:55,660
were let's say on your first steps to be

00:03:53,049 --> 00:04:00,670
part of the federal community this is a

00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:02,769
great way to say them thank you and but

00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:04,420
not all only for these but also for

00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:07,690
something else for example someone

00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:14,530
helped you to fix something and you can

00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:16,870
say thank you to that person so yeah you

00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:20,289
will get a lot of thank-yous during the

00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:22,090
day or doing that week you will say

00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:24,970
thank you to someone else and someone

00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:31,810
else we say thank you to you so that's

00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:36,400
what why it's all this about okay so I'm

00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:38,500
just going to discuss in brief about why

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,260
we are doing this about why it is

00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:45,550
important to thank other community

00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:47,320
members who are working on Fedora like

00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:51,070
different parts of the operating system

00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:55,630
or different areas in the community so I

00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:58,419
mean I mean federic ability is mostly

00:04:55,630 --> 00:05:01,810
like a volunteer based community so we

00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:04,979
don't really get paid for efforts unless

00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:08,289
it's your day job to work on Fedora and

00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:09,639
so a lot of people still contribute a

00:05:08,289 --> 00:05:11,949
lot to develop my

00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:17,620
of fedora and also in non-technical

00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:18,789
areas and sometimes like like sometimes

00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,280
some people feel like they are not

00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:25,300
appreciated enough for the contributions

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:29,379
to the operating system or to the

00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:31,689
overall community and that's because

00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:35,319
like when we are working together

00:05:31,689 --> 00:05:37,750
sometimes like we like slowly over time

00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:39,550
we feel like we forget to communicate

00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:41,680
that we appreciate their efforts even

00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:43,300
though like whatever small or big

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,000
efforts they are putting in we forget to

00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:48,219
communicate that we need to thank them

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,800
because all they are doing all of this

00:05:48,219 --> 00:05:56,740
in their volunteer time so we basically

00:05:52,800 --> 00:06:00,490
created the idea of this week to

00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:02,860
practice like gratefulness and say thank

00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:09,759
you so that everybody feels appreciated

00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:12,129
and they feel like good like they feel

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:15,610
appreciate appreciated enough for the

00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:18,789
work in fedora and here are just some

00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:26,169
benefits of like practicing gratefulness

00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:28,810
so we feel that like if everybody feels

00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:30,610
like appreciated for their work in the

00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:34,229
federal community it will have a

00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:37,419
positive impact overall on the

00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:39,639
contributions and on the team and it

00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:42,099
will also boost like confidence of

00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:45,310
community members in fedora

00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:49,750
it will lead to like happier community

00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:53,020
members better relationships better work

00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:57,310
and basically more productivity but it's

00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:59,889
not just like the contribution aspects

00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:02,830
of it but we also want the community you

00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:06,430
know to gel together to interact with

00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:10,150
each other more and to basically put out

00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:12,729
all this positivity in open source out

00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:15,190
in the real world that we are working

00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:18,490
and collaborating and doing this

00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:21,399
together and we want everyone to know

00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:21,759
that we really appreciate whatever they

00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,200
are doing

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,030
even though

00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:28,660
I mean whether it's a small contribution

00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:30,880
or like it's a big thing like every

00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:36,400
everything is appreciated whatever

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:40,000
they're doing in federal community so

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:42,520
yes this is basically you know a meme so

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,830
we want everyone to feel awesome because

00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:48,130
they're a part of Fedora and we are such

00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:51,010
a nice community so we want them to feel

00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:53,890
happy and appreciated so that was our

00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:57,120
whole concept behind why we wanted to do

00:07:53,890 --> 00:08:01,690
this appreciation week and have this

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:04,780
different ideas on how to do it and how

00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:06,370
to say thank you to the community

00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:10,330
members so you and I will now introduce

00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:13,480
a little bit about Fedora Appreciation

00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:16,750
Day I'll be depending on how the

00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:19,390
logistics go and how you can say thank

00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:28,540
you to other community members during

00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:30,910
this period okay so I appreciate your

00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:34,570
appreciation day so this will take place

00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:37,900
around November 6:30 because it's also

00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:41,919
the anniversary of the Fedora project so

00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:44,620
this is what we are we aiming to do the

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:47,680
today Appreciation Week and the way that

00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:51,130
let's see how all of you can be part of

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,990
it is first of all to pick someone to

00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:55,570
pick a contributor that it's part of

00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:59,740
Fedora community and of course not only

00:08:55,570 --> 00:09:03,880
one you are encouraged to say thank you

00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:06,100
to also other people so you can just

00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:08,680
choose someone from the Fedora community

00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:11,410
that you really appreciate a lot and you

00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:13,080
really it would say thank you for

00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:17,020
everything that that person has done

00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:20,200
especially something that it was very

00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:24,630
valuable for you and they helped you a

00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:27,100
lot and in this way though let's say

00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:29,620
explain a bit the contribute the

00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:33,160
contribution that that person did and it

00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:36,490
why it was useful for you let's say for

00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,920
example I for example in my personal

00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:40,900
experience I could say thank you to the

00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:45,400
first person that helped me to get into

00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:47,350
Fedora that it was also my mentor he's

00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:50,830
not part of it all right anymore

00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:53,080
but still he was the person who let's

00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:56,650
say helped me with everything to get in

00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:59,620
touch with the other people and to grow

00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:02,620
more at the community and in this way

00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:06,910
for example you can see why it was very

00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:12,090
helpful for you what the other person

00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:14,740
did and and you can just like let's say

00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:18,040
express your gratitude toward that

00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:20,590
person and in this way you can start

00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:23,530
writing your appreciation for that

00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:26,440
person so how can you do that first of

00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:30,010
all is we do this even now of course

00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:31,870
karma cookies and I think is anyone here

00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:39,390
that doesn't know what karma cookies is

00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:39,390
or someone that wants to explain it yes

00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:52,530
so karma cookie is actually a system

00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:55,990
when you do at the plus plus signs in

00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:59,530
after the fasts ID of one person or

00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:02,380
arsenic if the NIC is married with a

00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:06,840
face ID and after collecting several

00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:09,670
cookies you can get badges in the

00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:12,250
biggest one is like 50 cookies or

00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:15,970
something like that but it's a way to

00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:17,980
say thank you in a simple manner you

00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:21,190
don't need to write anything or do

00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:23,490
anything just fast ID plus plus and the

00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:26,490
people will be regarding with off with a

00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:26,490
badge

00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:34,000
so yes thank you and we can do that on

00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:36,460
layers here so especially let's say when

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,290
we have meetings and the meeting will

00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:39,880
end you can just say thank you for

00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:42,550
example to the person who chaired the

00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:45,280
meeting and so on another way how you

00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:50,080
can write an appreciation is contributor

00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:54,010
stories so contributor stories as I said

00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:56,710
it's a way to write kind of a story and

00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:59,650
we have a template to help you what

00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:03,910
things you can include there for another

00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:05,440
person and I will explain even a bit

00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:08,680
more how with the template and show you

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,840
a screenshot about it another way is the

00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:13,270
happiness package that we mentioned that

00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:17,350
Ana has been working on it and she will

00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:20,320
show us later on even a demo of how it

00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:22,690
looks now and how let's see other things

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:26,080
that we are going to implement until

00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:29,650
November you can tweet about this and

00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:31,810
the tweet that we thought to use for

00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:36,040
Federer appreciation week will be we are

00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:38,110
fedora in this way will be even useful

00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,700
for us to Hank to have some kind of

00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:44,260
metrics to see how many people

00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:48,730
participated and let's see how useful it

00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:50,950
was to have only a week only to say

00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:53,410
thank you to someone else and why to do

00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:56,950
this only for the specific week and not

00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:59,110
do this throughout the year and

00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:00,750
something else that you can do of course

00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:04,930
that you can share it with your friends

00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:07,180
because it's very valuable to spread the

00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:10,890
word and the others can do the same as

00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:14,370
you so as I said they can do one of this

00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:18,010
kind of ways that they can be part of it

00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:21,250
so as I mentioned one of the ways was

00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:22,570
the contributor stories so what is

00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:24,880
contributor story its contributor

00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:27,100
stories are the record of our best

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:30,310
memories that we have with people that

00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:33,340
are part of the Fedora community so it

00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:35,740
can be let's say everyone that it's part

00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:37,750
of us that is contributing it doesn't

00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:39,640
matter what kind of contributions or

00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,450
let's say how much time that person

00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:45,010
spends

00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:46,840
as part of our community but lately the

00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:50,440
things that that person has done if it's

00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:53,020
very valuable for us we can start

00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:56,530
writing a story about that person and we

00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:58,690
can share our stories that we let's say

00:13:56,530 --> 00:14:00,670
we're doing as part of Fedora or

00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:02,170
something I don't know something else

00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:06,310
that it's unique that you think it's

00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:08,410
very special about someone that it's a

00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:10,270
community member and you can share the

00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:12,910
story with the community members you

00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:16,390
have another possibility to keep it

00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:21,270
private and only that the admins that

00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:24,280
are let's see there are admins for the

00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:26,650
pyro repo and this is also the link that

00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,930
you can go there and check it out only

00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:30,700
that person can see the story that you

00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:33,100
will write but for the others will be

00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:35,710
private but if you want to share it also

00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:40,360
with everyone you can just keep that as

00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:43,510
public so yeah this is the screenshot

00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:46,750
how it looks the paschal repo that we

00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:48,520
have so you have even a template because

00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:51,340
we want it to make a bit more use a

00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:56,350
little more easier for you how to write

00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:59,410
something so you can just let us know a

00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:02,560
bit more about your story the person

00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:07,450
that you are writing something about him

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:09,340
or her let's see the kind of history or

00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:11,650
story that you had with that person and

00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:14,200
why you are saying thank you or what

00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:17,890
things that person did for you that it

00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:20,860
was very useful and help you a lot so

00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:23,110
until now actually we have nine

00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:25,750
contributor stories we were trying to

00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:30,990
convince someone during flock to write

00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:34,870
another one but we need to try more so

00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:38,250
you can write an one or you wrote one

00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:38,250
yeah but you can write more

00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:50,389
and for now we have seven that are

00:15:46,939 --> 00:15:52,490
public and two that are private so thank

00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:54,439
you to everyone that wrote a contributor

00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:57,139
story and thank you to all the people

00:15:54,439 --> 00:16:01,610
that will write one in the next days you

00:15:57,139 --> 00:16:04,220
can even do this now and as I mentioned

00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:06,709
to you the link about it you can just

00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:16,100
check it out there and we'd be very

00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:17,839
happy if you can write one okay so this

00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:21,470
is my first time doing this anything of

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:25,430
this side so please go easy on me yeah

00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:27,620
so guten tag my name is Anna and I was

00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:30,319
one of the G sock interns selected to

00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:40,459
you know work on this amazing project

00:16:30,319 --> 00:16:42,199
called happiness packets and so I guess

00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:45,889
I should start on why I picked this

00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:47,750
project first I'm a developer so for me

00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:50,509
stuff like this doesn't make a lot of

00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:52,339
sense you know I just cord I don't care

00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:55,550
what the other person does exactly and I

00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:57,199
don't tend to like the strain ah see a

00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:58,790
thank you is just a given that the other

00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:02,899
person has to do what I tell them to do

00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:04,730
but um I can see the benefits like as we

00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:06,589
mentioned that a lot of benefits to be

00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:09,079
to being nice to saying thank you to

00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:11,089
people every once in a while they'll be

00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:13,339
nicer to you and this is like especially

00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:15,020
important in an open-source community

00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:18,350
where people are not obliged to help you

00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:20,480
so you know sending them a thank-you

00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:22,640
card I'll buy them a beer or something

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,490
like that it just puts you puts you in

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,140
they're good books so civility costs

00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:30,679
nothing but it buys you everything yeah

00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:31,700
so that's a quote for you that and I'm

00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:34,760
not really going to go into the

00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:41,850
technical details but uh

00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:45,090
so I just want yeah yeah so I'm a huge

00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:48,210
new be fast so if you haven't started

00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:50,160
yet today you can start from today we're

00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:52,800
gonna lake launch the website so you

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:57,270
guys can log in and send in your own

00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:59,640
appreciation notes as well and yeah so

00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:02,310
this is the project it's called fedora

00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:04,410
happiness package so this originally was

00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:08,120
a folk of another project called

00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:12,030
happiness packets so thank you for and

00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:16,050
essentially it's a platform to make it

00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:17,250
easier for you to show appreciation show

00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:21,720
your gratitude to your fellow

00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:24,510
contributors and for now and I'm not

00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:27,120
like I'm an introvert for me like going

00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:31,110
up to a person and you know telling them

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:34,800
thank you it just terrifies terrifies me

00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:36,870
I'd not do one on one person one on one

00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,730
is not my thing at all so if you're like

00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:42,330
me this is like the perfect software for

00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:44,100
you you can just send anyone you

00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:46,200
appreciate someone who has touched your

00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:48,360
touch you basically like in a meaningful

00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:51,690
way like for me I would probably send

00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:55,470
maybe after this session some happiness

00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:56,880
package to my mentors I wouldn't do that

00:18:55,470 --> 00:19:02,850
in real life but yeah I'm sending it

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:05,400
anyway but um yeah so that's that's

00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:07,380
essentially what it does like it helps

00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,730
you if you're like me again into what

00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,140
you don't like sending messages to

00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:12,960
people in person you can do it online

00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:15,060
and you can do an anomalous anonymously

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,490
as well so and but we do have other

00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:19,350
options so some of the options are like

00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:21,240
you can choose to have your message

00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:23,340
public you can choose to have your name

00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:25,860
public as well you know if you're that

00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:28,580
kind of person good on you but you can

00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:32,010
also send private messages as well so

00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:33,570
that can work yeah and if you want you

00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:34,950
can just put up your message on the

00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:36,780
website as well but you can hide your

00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:38,900
name so you know there's something for

00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:42,350
everyone yeah

00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:45,260
and so this is like a screen shot I will

00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:48,110
demo it like right now but this is what

00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:50,840
it looks like it looks the design is not

00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:52,370
so modern but we're working on I mean we

00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:55,730
still have time this is going to happen

00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:57,350
sometime in later this month so we'll

00:19:55,730 --> 00:20:01,600
have time to improve we're looking

00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:01,600
forward to your feedback as well yep

00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:08,690
Thanks so just give me a few tips for

00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:12,440
adding happiness package so when we

00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:14,300
initially put this up I were I saw a lot

00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:17,120
of messages that just said you are

00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:19,580
awesome thank you for helping me with

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,850
so-and-so bug yay

00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:24,170
so you won't write a more meaningful

00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:26,170
happiness packet or thank you know what

00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:29,360
I would say personalize it you know

00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:31,910
everyone loves hearing their name so you

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:35,870
know putting your name in as well in the

00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:37,970
happiness packet and don't use a generic

00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:39,770
template of Google so don't Google

00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:43,010
something and just cut copy paste that's

00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:48,650
not really nice and next one is like be

00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:51,230
specific so if I don't know you know a

00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:53,750
contributor who has worked on this pool

00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:56,210

you know yeah and of course obviously

00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:17,570
don't forget to thank the people who

00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:20,840
love you your cord they take the time

00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:23,360
after you sit and lead through your very

00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:25,220
very long code so take time off to thank

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:29,210
them as well and obviously the next one

00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:31,890
is like be prompt it's always best you

00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:36,540
do this the day

00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:38,370
after maybe at least you know we didn't

00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:39,990
a month while is still relevant while

00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:42,750
it's still fresh on the other person's

00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:43,140
mind but um it's always better late than

00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:49,370
never

00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:49,370
you know yeah so now yes the demo

00:21:55,109 --> 00:22:00,240
okay

00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,240
so

00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:05,909

it will redirect you to the login page

00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:34,140
and then you can go ahead and I'm not

00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:36,900
exactly sure why it's not real and the

00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:38,670
message you want to send and like I

00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:42,030
mentioned the privacy options you have

00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:44,070
we have a lot of options here so you can

address with the Zippy and the other

00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:49,530
person doesn't even have to know who

00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:51,870
sent it as well and you can choose to

00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:54,690

display names publicly like both our

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:08,730
names publicly as well so yeah only if

00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:10,500
both of the people agree so the center

00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:16,800
and the the person who will receive it

00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:19,559
we will publish them at the archive so

00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:21,540
if you want to get inspired by some

00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:23,970
other happiness packets you can just

00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:28,129
check them there

00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:28,129
yeah so there's nothing that I know but

00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:39,809
example suggests to and if you just go

00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:44,940
on the web interface to send a happiness

00:24:39,809 --> 00:24:47,340
packet the message yeah so you can also

00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:49,500
see the message inspiration link there

00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:53,759
from where you can directly see like

00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:59,519
some example happiness packets being

00:24:53,759 --> 00:25:02,570
sent and also in the end you you have

00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:06,480
even the share button so you can share

00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:08,759
on Google+ Facebook or Twitter that you

00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,980
wrote to happiness packets in this way

00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:13,889
even your friends probably will be

00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:16,440
encouraged to do the same and if you

00:25:13,889 --> 00:25:19,889
want like to give us some more feedback

00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:24,539
about it we would be very happy you can

00:25:19,889 --> 00:25:35,000
file an issue on our patio repo that

00:25:24,539 --> 00:25:35,000
it's the link at the end oh yeah yes yes

00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:40,780
don't send us an email because we will

00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:48,400
change it but you can it's better to

00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:51,790
file an issue on our right bound yes or

00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:55,020
if you want to help we have some other

00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:58,059
issues that are open if they are

00:25:55,020 --> 00:26:01,000
assigned to Ana she's working on them

00:25:58,059 --> 00:26:04,000
otherwise you can open another one or

00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:09,340
work on one on the others that we have

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:16,780
so yes for the moment Ana is assigned to

00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:19,090
most of them yes

00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:21,490
so I don't know if you have any question

00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:24,130
regarding the demo but we don't have a

00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:26,520
lot of time and we want to mention even

00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:26,520
the

00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:35,619
the usability testing

00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:49,620
yeah so obviously it is like a fuss I

00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,600
tration think V well like you know

00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:53,340
looking for feedback a lot of it I know

00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,040
it's like it's not bad supposed to be

00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:58,440
right now but so with your help we're

00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:00,240
looking for features you know what do

00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:03,120
you think what do you think doesn't work

00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,890
would you use it so you know if you're

00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:08,280
interested we'll be like let's say this

00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:10,920
hallway so whoever wants an app like

00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:12,980
come talk to me yeah we have some sheets

00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:16,980
here so you can just write your name and

00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:19,050
email and we can coordinate like when

00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:23,460
you can do it it's not too long it's

00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:25,830
just 20 minutes at most so it won't take

00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:30,770
too much of your time and it will be

00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:30,770
really helpful for us and the project

00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:38,820
and obviously some of the things we're

00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:44,250
like working on is like audio/video

00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:46,470
messages you know like a text message is

00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:47,880
great but audio/video messages you can

00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:49,770
hear the person they're just like more

00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:52,890
effective as well plus you'll be getting

00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:56,190
cool badges so we don't have a badge yet

00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:59,970
yeah but at least we just had it so our

00:27:56,190 --> 00:28:04,080
logo and we want to thanks the design

00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:05,490
team and this is a nice idea to I don't

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,340
know right a contributor story or

00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:11,640
happiness package design team because

00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:15,980
they did very nice logo for us and we

00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,980
will design the badge soon

00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:25,480
yes because when you log in you will log

00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:28,280
in with your first account and yes sir

00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:30,560
so your question was how can we get the

00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:32,090
badge right so when you log in as we

00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:35,090
said you will log in with your first

00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:38,330
account and it when you're right when

00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:41,720
you write happiness packets and both of

00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:44,300
you you will not be anonymous in this

00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,890
way you will directly get the badge when

00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:51,290
you send the happiness packets to the

00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:53,390
other person yes the sender yeah I mean

00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:58,790
the other person cannot get the badge

00:28:53,390 --> 00:29:03,350
but he can yeah they can write happiness

00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:05,600
packets to get the badge Thanks so do

00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:14,960
you have any questions otherwise we need

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:17,750
to my first question is like I know the

00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,790
happiness back at the software before it

00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:23,090
was a Django application if I'm not

00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:26,540
wrong did you keep record of the issues

00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:29,600
that was in the original packet to this

00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:33,890
one towards just having the bugger to to

00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:36,800
try the issues because the github repo

00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:39,560
front that from that application have

00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:41,780
their own issues so you try to solve it

00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:45,110
or you just port it and work over it

00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:46,850
okay and my other question why if I

00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:48,320
descend the happiness packet that's

00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:53,030
private I don't get the batch that

00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:54,800
doesn't matter for me because if you

00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:57,230
want to be anonymous and you get the

00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,820
badge then where's the point of being

00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:03,920
anonymous people will understand that

00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:08,240
you send yeah but you know the people is

00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:10,790
not going to know to who you send a

00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:13,040
package of it was due to the one who

00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:15,500
sent the package I don't know the

00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:17,030
anonymity is that the only thing you are

00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:20,900
going to know is that you send a package

00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:23,049
but know when or where or to who so

00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:25,119
there is no point in

00:30:23,049 --> 00:30:27,519
in not giving the bash or giving the

00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:31,509
vaishali to public at least that's what

00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:33,759
I think maybe you can file a new issue

00:30:31,509 --> 00:30:36,129
is what I just and we can discuss it

00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:40,749
there and then everyone can put their

00:30:36,129 --> 00:30:44,919
ideas in so we really need to finish if

00:30:40,749 --> 00:30:47,200
the GDP are compliant we are working on

00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:50,289
that but yeah I mean there's everything

00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:54,100
in fedoras if you are compliant we will

00:30:50,289 --> 00:31:03,639
be saying it follows space login so if

00:30:54,100 --> 00:31:07,080
epsilon is here yes we need to finish

00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:07,080
now and thank you for being here

00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:13,369
