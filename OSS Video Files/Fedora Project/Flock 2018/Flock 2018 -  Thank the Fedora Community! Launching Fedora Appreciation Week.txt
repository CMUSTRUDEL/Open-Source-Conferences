Talk: Thank the Fedora Community! Launching Fedora Appreciation Week
Presenters: Jona Azizaj, Bee Padalkar, Anna Philips

Description: Inspired by the Ubuntu Community Appreciation Day, Fedora Appreciation Week is an initiative to celebrate the community behind the success of Fedora. Through this week, there will be different events and initiatives through which Fedora community members are encouraged to give their thanks and show their appreciation to people involved in Fedora community.
To organize a Fedora Appreciation Day, outreach and awareness are important ahead of time so the community is aware of the event. Especially for something that has not yet happened before, spending extra time on awareness will be important so contributors remember and are aware of the day. We aim to launch the Fedora Appreciation Week to the community at FLOCK through this talk, followed by outreach through various other communication channels. We will introduce the Fedora Appreciation Week and release the dates for the event. We will also introduce and demonstrate Fedora Happiness Packets, an open source platform which community members can use during Fedora appreciation week 2018 to send thank you messages and positive feedback to other Fedora Community members. We will also talk about contributor stories - what are they, why should you submit one and how can you submit it - and how they are an integral part of Fedora Appreciation Week.
