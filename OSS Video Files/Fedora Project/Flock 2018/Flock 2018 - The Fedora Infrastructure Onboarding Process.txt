Talk: The Fedora Infrastructure Onboarding Process
Presenters: Rick Elrod

Description: Community and volunteer involvement in Fedora's infrastructure is vital to the continued success of Fedora as a whole. This talk will provide an overview of how the community/onboarding aspect of Fedora's infrastructure has changed over time, places we have gone wrong, and plans in progress to improve the situation. I will discuss ideas on how to revamp our "FI Apprentice" program to maximize community involvement and engagement. This talk is aimed for both newcomers and veterans - anyone with an interest in the critical role that the community has on Fedora Infrastructure and Fedora as a whole.

all right my name is Rick Elrod I am on

00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:11,250
the community platform engineering team

00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:13,019
at Red Hat and I work mainly on fedoras

00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:16,619
infrastructure I do a lot of sysadmin

00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:19,170
tasks kind of also occasionally spread

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:20,960
my time to other teams like the website

00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,060
scheme but I focused primarily on

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,990
infrastructure assist admin work and I

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,119
want to talk about the onboarding

00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,310
process I want to talk about you know

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,500
getting new newcomers to you know be

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:34,260
able to easily volunteer and contribute

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,989
to the infrastructure and kind of how to

00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:40,739
retain them once they show some interest

00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:42,329
in doing that so I'm gonna give a little

00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:44,309
bit of background why we care about this

00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:48,660
problem talk a little bit about the

00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:50,070
history of the infrastructure I'm gonna

00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,160
talk about how we currently handle

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,809
newcomers and an onboarding new people

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,059
and how to retain them and then I have

00:00:54,809 --> 00:01:00,780
some ideas that I'm just gonna kind of

00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:02,969
toss out first things first these are

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,850
all my my opinions these are not

00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:07,049
necessarily the opinions of anybody

00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:09,000
important in the project these are just

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:10,530
my opinions the ideas might be horrible

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,030
but hopefully not these are you know

00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:16,200
just things that I I think might help

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:19,350
that I'll talk about so personally I

00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:22,530
started out as a volunteer in 2010 eight

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:24,900
years ago and in many ways this has been

00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,320
a very life-changing event for me I mean

00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,700
I've made many friends in the project

00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,229
I've gotten a lot of experience it's

00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,600
just been you know a great thing I

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:35,790
wouldn't change anything about it

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,009
and I care about fedora I care about the

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,950
contributors the infrastructure and the

00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:42,479
continued success of the project why

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,430
should you care well the infrastructure

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:48,270
of course plays a very critical role in

00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:50,939
in Fedora without the infrastructure the

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:53,399
project isn't gonna get very far and the

00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:56,369
infrastructure is inherently community

00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:59,579
driven and I'll talk about I'll talk

00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:03,840
about why that is so this is an email

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:07,290
back on the mailing list from 2005 from

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,239
Elliott Lee and this is the first thing

00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:12,380
that I and other people I've I've spoken

00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:14,730
to you can find that talks about

00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:16,590
the Fedora infrastructure being kind of

00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,600
an open community driven thing so this

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:21,330
is saying you know we can get people

00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,430
shell access to the fedora boxes and you

00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,690
know we can kind of start encouraging

00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,160
the community to have access to these

00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:28,770
boxes and actually start you know

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,330
playing a role in in maintaining the

00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:33,210
infrastructure so this is kind of the

00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:35,640
first first call for help that I can

00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:42,209
find from the community and it goes back

00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:43,680
all the way to 2005 since at least this

00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:44,910
point in time fedora infrastructure has

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,480
been what I will call an open

00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:49,760
infrastructure we've encouraged

00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:52,610
contributions from the community and

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,860
that email that I that I referenced was

00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:57,810
sent out right before Fedora core five

00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:01,920
came out so right between for work or

00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:03,900
for for and Fedora core five so this

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,900
this process of the infrastructure being

00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:09,530
open kind of goes back quite a while and

00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,530
I just realized I did not start my timer

00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,530
okay

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:21,040
in 2007 we started using the puppet

00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:23,440
configuration management tool and you

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,420
know this kind of gave a central place a

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,380
central repository for our configuration

00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:34,390
files and other system you know scripts

00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:36,130
and inventory and we gave volunteers

00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:38,230
access to this repository and fairly

00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:41,230
liberally but it wasn't officially

00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:43,270
quote-unquote public because back in the

00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:45,010
early days they had passwords and and

00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:46,240
other information stored in the git

00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:48,910
history that we didn't exactly want

00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:51,790
public but we did we did give access to

00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:54,220
it fairly liberally and in 2011 we

00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:58,480
started the FI apprentice fast group

00:03:54,220 --> 00:04:00,310
which I'll talk about quite a bit and

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,280
that's kind of like that leads us to

00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:07,240
where we are now so the FI apprentice

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:09,130
fast group the idea was that anyone who

00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,750
had an interest in kind of helping out

00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:12,940
and seeing how the infrastructure works

00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,220
getting some experience becoming a part

00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:18,040
of the community could sign up they

00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:21,310
could join the FI apprentice fast group

00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:24,100
and they would get access to most of our

00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:25,360
boxes it would be read-only access so

00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,250
they wouldn't have you know sudo

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,450
privileges but they can go in and

00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,740
explore they could see how things are

00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:32,020
set up they could see our monitoring

00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:34,990
systems they could see you know our

00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:37,750
configuration tooling and how how we use

00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:40,660
it again we add people to the group

00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:42,790
fairly liberally and we have kind of

00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:44,980
semi-automatic removal for people who

00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:47,230
are not using their access and by semi

00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:52,480
automatic Evan kind of goes through and

00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:53,890
sends an email out every month the idea

00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:59,919
at least for was it was for it to be

00:04:53,890 --> 00:05:02,470
more automated from the perspective of a

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:05,080
new contributor you know the processes

00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:06,610
they kind of they send out an email to

00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,620
the infrastructure mailing list they

00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:10,770
express some interest they say hi you

00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,910
know I'm so-and-so I want to help out

00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:14,320
people you know respond to the email

00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,970
they say can you join us at our next

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,290
weekly meeting introduce yourself you

00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:18,660
know talk to people tell us what

00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:21,060
specifically you want to work on and

00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:24,250
we'll help you get started

00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:26,290
then they come to we tell them at the

00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:29,350
meeting you know come come to the Fedora

00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:31,510
admin IRC channel and we will add you to

00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:33,220
this fi apprentice fast group and you

00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:35,980
can you know get access and start seeing

00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:38,080
how things work so they get sponsored

00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:40,180
into fi apprentice we also tell them we

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,950
have infrastructure office hours every

00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:44,050
week so if they have questions they can

00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:46,510
come in and you know this is an hour

00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:49,960
dedicated just to working with newcomers

00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:51,970
and helping them get familiar with you

00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,140
know with the infrastructure with any

00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:55,420
problems they're having they can ask

00:05:53,140 --> 00:06:02,380
questions and you know this time is

00:05:55,420 --> 00:06:04,480
dedicated for them to get help so I want

00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:05,740
to talk about retaining newcomers once

00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,710
they express interest once they get

00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:11,920
sponsored into this fi apprentice group

00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:14,110
a couple of very unofficial and cursory

00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,340
statistics we seem to you yeah every

00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:17,830
week in our meeting we seem to kind of

00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:19,870
average between one and three newcomers

00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:21,280
expressing interest this varies every

00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:23,260
week you know sometimes sometimes we

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,090
don't get any sometimes we get more but

00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:26,410
I would say you know on average between

00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:31,900
one and three people express interest

00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:34,480
that our meetings each week but we kind

00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:36,340
of if you look at the flora admin logs

00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,810
that happen after the meeting we get

00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:39,280
less people than that coming in and

00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:43,330
actually asking to be added once they

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:45,460
express the initial interest there are

00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:46,960
currently 27 people in fi apprentice

00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:49,810
that are not sponsors and not

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,910
administrators so these are like actual

00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:54,910
people who expressed interest and wanted

00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:59,250
to start volunteering we had three

00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:59,250
people added in June two people in July

00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:08,320
so hurdles every step that we asked a

00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:10,210
newcomer to do so is sending out the

00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:13,320
email coming to the meeting going to

00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:17,050
photo our admin you know being sponsored

00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:18,400
every every step here has two effects

00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,830
probably has more than two effects but

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,350
I'm going to talk about two effects it

00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:24,790
has the effect the potential to reduce

00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:27,009
their likelihood to make it through the

00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:29,110
rest of the hoops

00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:30,849
you know that's kind of tough

00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:31,919
explanatory the more the more work

00:07:30,849 --> 00:07:34,029
somebody has to do to start volunteering

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,889
the less likely that they're gonna make

00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:38,800
it all the way to actually being able to

00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:40,029
help if they do make it through the

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,080
hoops though it shows some level of

00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:42,490
commitment it shows you know they're

00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,649
they're really wanting to help they're

00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:46,809
willing to you know learn our processes

00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:53,349
and you know do what they can to help us

00:07:46,809 --> 00:07:54,819
out so again the process is kind of a

00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:58,089
four-step thing they create a fast count

00:07:54,819 --> 00:08:00,699
they they send out a a letter to the

00:07:58,089 --> 00:08:03,819
list they attend the meeting they get

00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:05,379
sponsored into the group and then once

00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:07,120
they do all of that work we kind of run

00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:09,669
into a problem where this group is

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,439
called fi apprentice but the users are

00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:13,029
not actually apprentice so we kind of

00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:15,069
leave them on their own we tell them

00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:16,749
where the documentation is which is

00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:18,969
another thing I'll talk about but we

00:08:16,749 --> 00:08:20,529
don't we have the office hours but we

00:08:18,969 --> 00:08:22,479
don't really kind of do much

00:08:20,529 --> 00:08:25,059
hand-holding we kind of just say here's

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,149
here's what we have like ask questions

00:08:25,059 --> 00:08:30,459
as you go along but you know this is

00:08:27,149 --> 00:08:31,749
this is it sorry I think that there are

00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:34,240
some things that we can do to make that

00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:36,839
a little bit nicer for newcomers and

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,839
I'll talk about those ideas

00:08:41,709 --> 00:08:46,820
so yeah so in an infrastructure with you

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,770
know roughly 600 hosts this includes

00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:51,290
like Bill vm's and our staging instances

00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:52,640
and cloud instances and everything it

00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:54,020
can be it can be kind of hard for people

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,350
to figure out what to do

00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:58,490
you know documentation falls out of date

00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:59,720
you know some people learn differently

00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:01,640
than other people some people are more

00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,290
hands-on some people are visuals and you

00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:06,560
know read things and understand it no

00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:10,180
problem so you know what can we do to

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,180
cater to people who learn differently

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,320
how do we encourage people to stay

00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,600
involved once they actually make it into

00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:19,970
fi Aventis once they you know once they

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,290
express interest and and get access to

00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:25,370
things how do we encourage them to

00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:26,839
contribute to continue contributing you

00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:28,250
know and also what is in it for the

00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:30,080
volunteer why should they want to

00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:34,220
continue contributing and how can we

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:37,970
express that to them so I'll talk about

00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:39,380
some of my ideas again some people learn

00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:41,959
differently right so some people are

00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:46,430
visual learners some people you know are

00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:48,040
hands-on learners so if we want to start

00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:52,070
catering to people who learn differently

00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:53,810
what if we started doing and this is you

00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:55,850
know something that I I've talked to

00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:58,430
several people about and everyone seems

00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:01,430
to like this idea what if we did kind of

00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:03,850
video tutorials video screencast that we

00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:07,070
upload on the YouTube or anything else

00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:09,020
showing the processes that we do assists

00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:12,620
that means you know every day altering

00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:14,480
DNS records deploying new hosts taking

00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:16,160
websites out of you know the the the

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:20,180
proxy configurations all these things

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,980
that we do you know what if we made

00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:24,529
little video tutorials and we could

00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:27,440
actually give them to you know link them

00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:29,690
to people who who learn visually and so

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,040
this is something I've kind of started

00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:32,779
on in my spare time I haven't actually

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,820
uploaded anything yet but I've talked to

00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:37,130
people I've talked to smooth and some

00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:38,870
other people and people seem to

00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:42,860
generally like this idea people think

00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:45,079
this is a good idea so again some

00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:47,600
examples provisioning hosts how to run

00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:50,529
play books how to make play books how to

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,529
update our DNS

00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,940
it also is saved some time answering

00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:56,980
common questions we can point to the

00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:58,930
videos that are already made it does

00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:01,269
have the potential problem same as you

00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:03,220
know with our text documentation it can

00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:04,779
fall out of date very quickly so this is

00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:07,000
another you know potential pain point as

00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:13,990
our processes change the videos will

00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:16,000
also have to change so I said some

00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:17,470
people are also hands-on learners right

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,389
people some people learn visually some

00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:25,029
people learn hands-on so we run a cloud

00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:26,740
infrastructure in in fedora

00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:28,209
infrastructure where we can spin up

00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:31,060
tests INSAS is we can spin up you know

00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:35,170
all sorts of VMs and all sorts of cloudy

00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:38,920
stuff what if we use this as a way to

00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:41,500
give contributors a kind of playground

00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,660
test environment that looks somewhat

00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,519
like a small-scale version of the

00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:48,670
infrastructure to do whatever they want

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,230
and learn how our processes work so and

00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:52,300
you know an idea that kind of goes along

00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:54,519
with this is what if we give newcomers a

00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:56,709
list of tasks that they can go through

00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:58,480
and they can step through the process

00:11:56,709 --> 00:12:00,430
they can ask for help on individual

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,829
processes if they're not sure you know

00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:04,720
if they get stuck at one step they can

00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:06,310
ask you know hey I'm going through this

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,959
particular checklist I'm at this step

00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:11,589
I'm not sure what to do can you help out

00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:13,750
and we can take a look and help out so

00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:15,370
you know the workflow would be you know

00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,690
they would they would get into fi

00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,699
apprentice kind of similar to how they

00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:19,600
do now and then we would launch a couple

00:12:18,699 --> 00:12:21,519
of pre-configured

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,350
cloud instances depending on where their

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,170
interests lies so I have a couple of

00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:29,769
examples one example they say you know

00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:33,639
they want to learn how to deploy a new

00:12:29,769 --> 00:12:35,889
web app right so we run a playbook a

00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:38,050
couple of cloud instances get launched

00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:39,569
all right one of them is like our

00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:42,760
ansible hosts they will learn how our

00:12:39,569 --> 00:12:45,040
ansel templates work one of them is like

00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,980
an app server so like a wiki server or

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,940
fedo Cal or you know any other web app

00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:51,040
one might be like a small database

00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:52,420
server and one would be like a proxy so

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,459
they would learn how all of these

00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:56,019
different kinds of servers servers and

00:12:54,459 --> 00:12:58,209
services that we run kind of interact

00:12:56,019 --> 00:13:00,189
with each other they were there and you

00:12:58,209 --> 00:13:01,250
know how the proxy communicates to the

00:13:00,189 --> 00:13:04,490
app server

00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:06,439
we're ansible fits into all of this it

00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:09,110
would basically be a playground for

00:13:06,439 --> 00:13:11,120
people to learn our processes in a

00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:12,379
small-scale way where they can't

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,240
actually break anything because the

00:13:12,379 --> 00:13:18,290
cloud is separate from our production

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:21,139
networks and you know it would it would

00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:23,750
it would provide a way for people to

00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:27,139
learn how things work without actually

00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:28,699
potentially breaking anything another

00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:30,139
example say somebody comes in and they

00:13:28,699 --> 00:13:33,800
want to learn how our monitoring system

00:13:30,139 --> 00:13:36,410
works so we you know we use ansible for

00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:39,110
our Nagios templates it's all automated

00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:42,769
nowadays so what if we had something

00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:44,329
like that so you know we spin up we run

00:13:42,769 --> 00:13:46,790
a playbook it spins up a couple of cloud

00:13:44,329 --> 00:13:48,920
instances one of them is like our

00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:51,740
ansible host that actually does the

00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:53,060
Nagios template generation one of them

00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,980
is like an audio server and one is a

00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:56,899
host that gets monitored by Nagios so

00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:58,490
they can see you know how does how does

00:13:56,899 --> 00:14:00,470
the monitoring protocol work how do you

00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:04,730
you know how do i add things to Nagios

00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:08,600
how do i add new checks to Nagios so

00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:09,829
that's it's another idea that I have so

00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,509
again you know the workflow they would

00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:13,879
get added to fi apprentice we would

00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:15,529
launch these instances and then we could

00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:18,139
give them a list going back to what I

00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:21,800
said we could give them a list of tasks

00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:23,180
to go down you know if they want to

00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,639
learn about monitoring we tell them this

00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:26,990
is how you get into these instances you

00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:28,579
know here's how you can start playing

00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:32,120
with the configuration system and you

00:14:28,579 --> 00:14:36,649
know exploring and you know they go down

00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:37,879
the list and at the end or you know if

00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:39,949
they have questions of course they can

00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:41,360
ask those questions but at the end we

00:14:39,949 --> 00:14:44,029
could kind of you know look at their

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:47,029
instances see how they did give them

00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:48,769
feedback if they want so this encourages

00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:49,970
feedback you know this encourages

00:14:48,769 --> 00:14:51,769
communication with people who are

00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:53,540
already active in the infrastructure and

00:14:51,769 --> 00:14:55,209
with people who are looking to become

00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:59,120
more active

00:14:55,209 --> 00:15:01,100
it also lets us see kind of us visually

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,620
what they are focusing on what they want

00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:06,889
to learn and it also provides a clear

00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:08,899
promotion for you know when people want

00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:10,759
to get promoted out of the FI apprentice

00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:13,399
group and actually focus on one area of

00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:14,990
the infrastructure you know we can can

00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:17,120
easily say

00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:19,880
you completed the monitoring checklist

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,050
so we'll add you to the sysadmin NOC

00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:24,110
group they're not in the monitoring

00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:27,020
group you know you completed the the web

00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:29,779
app the proxy checklist so we're gonna

00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:32,470
add you to sis admin web so it provides

00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:36,290
kind of these these clear-cut levels of

00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:42,290
how to get added to the the groups

00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:43,430
beyond fi apprentice this idea of course

00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:45,080
does have some problems we have to

00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:46,610
maintain all of that infrastructure we

00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:49,790
have to maintain the playbooks that spin

00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:52,459
up these instances it's never going to

00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:53,870
fully demonstrate how being for the

00:15:52,459 --> 00:15:55,490
pieces of the infrastructure in terms of

00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:57,890
each other right there's always going to

00:15:55,490 --> 00:16:00,140
be other pieces than interact you know

00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:01,700
in the examples I gave maybe some of

00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:03,529
those apps talk to fed message but we

00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,700
don't demonstrate that in our like

00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:08,750
there's always going to be other pieces

00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:11,510
that are not covered you know by by

00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:14,839
giving people a small skill playground

00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:16,130
to work in there's also the question of

00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:17,750
you know if we start doing these task

00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:19,820
lists and have people go through these

00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:23,779
these tasks what should be on those

00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:25,040
lists you know how do we have we bike

00:16:23,779 --> 00:16:32,990
shed and figure out what should be on

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:38,709
the list so motivation keeping newcomers

00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:42,350
motivated so what if we had a way to

00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:43,149
award something like badges for hard

00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:47,630
work

00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:49,160
kids am I going with this oh wait so we

00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:51,620
have we do have this infrastructure to

00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:54,850
this thing called fedora badges and they

00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:56,930
are easy to make they're cheap to make

00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:59,440
they require a tiny little bit of

00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:01,579
graphic design but that's about it

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,170
they're free to award they don't cost

00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:04,400
anything

00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:05,809
they make contributors feel good when

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,130
they you know when they help us out and

00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:09,800
they do something we want to you know

00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:12,559
say thanks it's a virtual token of

00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:14,390
appreciation and I claim that we should

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,800
award them and the infrastructure for

00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:19,339
doing that is already there we have this

00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:22,970
system in place already so some examples

00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:24,949
going back to you know the cloudy idea

00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:26,329
that I had you completed a checklist on

00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:28,069
your cloud instances it looks good

00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:28,940
here's a badge for that you know thank

00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:31,220
you for putting in

00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:32,450
it's work showing us you know that you

00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,400
want to be involved in this area of

00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:35,560
infrastructure here's the badge for that

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,670
thank you

00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:40,190
you submitted a patch to our main

00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:43,610
configuration system our repository of

00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:45,650
our configuration system ansible thank

00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:46,730
you here's a badge you know maybe you

00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:50,480
said five or ten patches

00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:51,590
here's another badge thank you you know

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,150
maybe somebody comes in they run

00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:55,490
interference during an outage so you

00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:57,260
know all the the the people who can do

00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:58,490
something to fix an outage are working

00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,620
but we have a lot of people coming in

00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:02,600
and saying hey this thing is down but

00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:04,370
you know maybe an apprentice you know is

00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,750
kind of running interference and saying

00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:07,580
yeah we already know about this people

00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:09,860
are working on it thanks for thanks for

00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:12,920
letting us know we're on it and we can

00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:14,420
have a badge for that so so my idea is

00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:17,090
like we already have the system in place

00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:22,160
it makes people feel good let's let's

00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:26,900
use more of it yeah that's right just

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:30,950
that so another problem is that being a

00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:32,780
newcomer can kind of be scary right we

00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:34,070
have this Fedora admin channel that kind

00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:36,170
of you know people come in and ask

00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:40,340
questions and and everyone hangs out in

00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:44,540
but we average like 275 to 300 people in

00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:46,040
there at any given time and you know we

00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:48,860
want to encourage community involvement

00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:50,960
and people coming in and and people who

00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,860
don't know how things work we want to

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,990
encourage them to be able to ask

00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:56,180
questions but doing that in front of 300

00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:59,360
people can be quite scary right that's

00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:01,070
that's a big crowd to get up and and and

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:05,720
you know basically say I have no idea

00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:07,760
how things work like help so the idea

00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,290
here is and I haven't talked to many

00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,450
people about this is just an idea that

00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:13,220
I'm throwing out what if there were a

00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,600
smaller Channel a smaller place where

00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:16,370
people can come in and ask questions

00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,410
until they're more comfortable you know

00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:21,350
with how things work and interacting

00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:24,740
with the community at large so I had

00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:25,970
this idea of Fedora for newcomers I have

00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,140
no idea if this will work I haven't

00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:29,840
mentioned this channel to anybody before

00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:31,580
but the idea would be you know limit the

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,740
channel to infrastructure veterans who

00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:35,870
can answer questions and people who are

00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:37,490
new within the last couple of months who

00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:40,130
are still learning how things work and

00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:41,240
want a small place probably under say 50

00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:43,250
people

00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:50,360
to ask questions rather than a place

00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:51,890
that has 300 people so there are you

00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:54,500
know a couple of problems here how do we

00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:56,690
enforce the N month rule how do we say

00:19:54,500 --> 00:20:02,000
you know hey you're not a newcomer

00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:03,770
anymore like get out right and also does

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,390
this isolate newcomers like we this is a

00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:08,030
community focused project we want the

00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:10,250
community interact with each other does

00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:12,110
this kind of isolate and segregate the

00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:16,250
community too much we want to kind of

00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:18,950
avoid that problem so that those are my

00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:20,690
ideas and I'm going to kind of just I

00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:21,860
don't know we I guess we can have a

00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:26,240
discussion I don't know where I am on

00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:28,460
time right now but those are my big

00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,840
ideas that I have I don't know what

00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,010
people think of them again I've talked

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,940
to some people about these ideas and

00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:36,980
people seem to like them overall another

00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:39,010
thing that I didn't mention and I was

00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:42,080
going to add a slide and I forgot is

00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:43,340
Clemen has been doing infrastructure

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:48,170
office hours I guess I did kind of

00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:50,300
mention them in passing every week and I

00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:51,620
don't really know how the turnout has

00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,460
been on them I think we've gotten some

00:20:51,620 --> 00:21:04,250
people coming in and asking questions

00:20:52,460 --> 00:21:07,070
but we got on to Aponte's that been

00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:09,860
coming almost every week since we

00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:11,980
started and working together on tickets

00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:18,020
so I think that's quite nice

00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:20,090
collaborating and yeah that's pretty

00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:24,710
much all we haven't had too many

00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:26,690
over-over people coming so but for me

00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:28,610
doesn't cost too much to just keep it

00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:31,990
running you know I'm there on IRC and

00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:34,580
ev2 wants a question so I just want to I

00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:39,160
think it's it's better to have it there

00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:39,160
and see if if somebody comes home or not

00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:46,839
so I'm happy to take any questions on my

00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:49,349
ideas or but if other people have other

00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:49,349
ideas that they

00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:00,169
you have any I like

00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:11,280
okay so the question is about the I

00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:13,080
guess the the throw away cloud instances

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:16,770
for you know kind of a small scale

00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:23,460
learning environment I do not have a

00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:25,290
proof of concept and I was new cloud so

00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,580
we are currently kind of redoing our

00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:29,430
cloud infrastructure right now and

00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:32,130
that's been my focus lately and I my my

00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:37,710
thought was once that eventually happens

00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:38,610
I can just did here I can you know kind

00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:44,010
of start playing at a proof-of-concept

00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:45,960
once that new cloud is deployed I know

00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:48,780
that my idea I guess would be we already

00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:50,520
have ways through ansible play books to

00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:52,590
create instances that do certain things

00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:54,780
so we just write a bunch of play books

00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:56,910
that you know kind of configure a small

00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:59,600
scale environment for each each area

00:22:56,910 --> 00:23:02,990
that somebody might want to learn

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:05,410
just just limit the limited size and

00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:05,410
scope of

00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:21,300
right together

00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:30,220
configurations would be altered

00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:34,950
there's another thing that I'm thinking

00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:34,950
here which is the open

00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:47,360
so the Sousa community has something

00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:51,620
kind of similar to this in the sense

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:54,080
that they allow their users or their

00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:56,060
participants anyone who wants to learn

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,830
more about the environment they allow

00:23:56,060 --> 00:24:01,250
them a checkout service so they are

00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:04,520
given in like a an access management

00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:06,710
role and that role lasts for up to two

00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:10,820
weeks and then everything that they

00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:15,860
create is then shut down and after that

00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:18,080
after that specific checkout time and

00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:27,500
the tools that they used to do that are

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:29,660
obviously open source it's it's they

00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:33,260
they have I mean the one that I know is

00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:35,660
built on ec2 but it allows for it allows

00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:37,970
for them to allows for their users to

00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:40,370
create an environment do with

00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:42,080
environment what they expect to do they

00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:44,000
identify the resources that are expected

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,430
to be deployed and give them sort of a

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,110
top top budget right in terms of how

00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:52,790
much spend is associated with that and

00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:55,510
then after the specific duration all of

00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:55,510
that is cleaned up

00:24:56,410 --> 00:25:01,310
it does sound something like what we're

00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:03,260
looking for can you can you yeah point

00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:10,460
yeah maybe even just you know something

00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:13,040
on the mailing list even since we're

00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:16,730
talking about his face for newcomers so

00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:18,860
I I have a solution to write likes but

00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:23,000
put a part and discourse where newcomers

00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:25,370
could put their questions and stuff yeah

00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:29,120
like we have a discourse instance in

00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:31,190
Feder yeah so like this admin part like

00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,080
add indicator infrastructure could have

00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:35,060
a section over there where newcomers

00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:38,060
could put their questions effortlessly

00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:40,010
and don't have the Fuhrer anymore of

00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:45,560
actually asking a question in IRC

00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:47,000
channel I personally have not played

00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,680
with discourse much I don't know if

00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,930
anybody on the team has has done much

00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:53,170
with it yet but yeah that's that's an

00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:53,170
option

00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:25,730
any other comments anybody want to throw

00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:28,340
things at me because of my ideas right

00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:32,960
so so the question is can can newcomers

00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:34,370
ask questions anonymously right now I

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,580
don't really think we have a system like

00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:36,580
that

00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:45,630
you can use the need to make sure that

00:26:42,929 --> 00:26:48,740
makes total sense but at a certain point

00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:48,740
we're kind of getting

00:27:02,309 --> 00:27:08,820
so me just by experience I think so we

00:27:06,399 --> 00:27:12,700
see on the building list a lot of people

00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:14,289
sending in like their introduction so I

00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:16,090
would like to get better announcer I

00:27:14,289 --> 00:27:20,919
would like to learn Python or thing like

00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:24,269
that and for me I think what's what's

00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:27,909
very difficult for them to get involved

00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:30,639
in the info I don't really think it's

00:27:27,909 --> 00:27:34,179
the tools but it's not the process and

00:27:30,639 --> 00:27:36,490
our regiments you can be you can be

00:27:34,179 --> 00:27:39,250
interested in non in learning Python and

00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:41,380
say I'll do the guys in fedora in fuzzy

00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:46,860
doing a lot of Python application so I

00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:49,419
just gonna gonna try to join them but

00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:52,840
you have no idea of what is it to

00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:55,870
actually create a distribution and what

00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:58,809
is what is the process involved to

00:27:55,870 --> 00:28:01,860
actually create the D so I think this is

00:27:58,809 --> 00:28:07,510
very very difficult to actually get them

00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:09,789
because if you want to start to help on

00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:12,279
project you have to kind of understand

00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:16,809
what those project are doing so this is

00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:19,380
maybe a bit more on the development side

00:28:16,809 --> 00:28:24,039
of header info but I think it also

00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:26,440
impacts the seaside min and finger so

00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:33,029
maybe we we have few application that

00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:35,710
are not so much tied to actually

00:28:33,029 --> 00:28:37,960
building fedora but more like for the

00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:39,820
community so maybe those we should maybe

00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,950
try to take care of bit more but those

00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:44,580
usually that's the application we spend

00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:48,539
not so much time because they are not

00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:51,730
that critical for like releasing fedora

00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:54,580
but I think they are the good

00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:56,270
application for an app want is to to get

00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:57,850
started like budgies or

00:28:56,270 --> 00:29:00,520
[Music]

00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:03,430
pygar is another good one because based

00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:05,620
on get thing is like maybe a bit more

00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:08,770
generic application might be a good idea

00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:11,110
to try to say oh you want to help us you

00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:13,480
can we can look at those application

00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:17,920
first and then and then slowly learn

00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:22,660
about the process of building fedora but

00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:24,730
just I think we were trying to do that

00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:27,550
with the the easy fix system that we

00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:32,680
created and we've had varying degrees of

00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:34,060
success with that but yeah I I see where

00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:46,030
you're coming from I think that's a good

00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:51,330
point what would you say is the bigger

00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:54,880
problem that people have to get used to

00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:57,640
general concept of administration and

00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:01,390
developing the infrastructure software

00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:03,850
or more that people get involved into it

00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:06,130
like oh they are already so that means

00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:09,190
that companies or whatever and then just

00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:11,290
go in and make something out of it or is

00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:13,420
it really people who are often try to

00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:16,950
learn new tools and say oh I can do this

00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:16,950
in the infrastructure team

00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:24,690
that's kind of a tough question I

00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:26,340
personally I think the there's two kind

00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:31,320
of kind of go hand-in-hand to some

00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:32,220
extent I don't know I again I think

00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,810
there are things we can do to

00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:35,760
specifically help people become more

00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:39,810
familiar with our processes which like

00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:41,310
the things I talked about and you know

00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:43,320
three doing that they'll they'll also

00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:44,940
gain generals who's had an experience as

00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:47,940
they go if they don't have it already

00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:49,710
I you know it's hard to say which the

00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:53,060
quote-unquote bigger problem is I think

00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:53,060
they kind of go hand in hand

00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:13,220
well I'm being an apprentice like

00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:15,950
forever because I used to do CSAT

00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:18,470
meaning the whole fashion weight and now

00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:22,970
right now I'm starting to learn ansible

00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:25,010
and I think the even when you are really

00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:25,640
helpful and you answered everyone

00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:30,530
questions

00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:33,140
there is no no really easy tack task I

00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:35,540
mean there are mock market as easy fix

00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:39,860
but normally you say ok this is easy fix

00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:42,350
but ha so I think the the the

00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:43,970
documentation should improving in that

00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:47,080
manner mean this is the problem is these

00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:50,690
do you should go this way at least to

00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:53,590
start our research by yourself at least

00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:53,590
pointing you in the right direction

00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:06,900
it's a good point also that it might

00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:10,140
look as an easy fix for us because we do

00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:12,420
it every day and but for now point is to

00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:16,290
say oh it's tagged as an easy fix but

00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:16,830
it's actually no clue of what needs to

00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:19,049
be done

00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:23,190
and I think on github day they recommend

00:32:19,049 --> 00:32:26,840
to use like it's like help help wanted

00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:29,429
or a good first issue of something that

00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:32,190
there is no the connotation it should be

00:32:29,429 --> 00:32:35,970
easy for you and if you if you can't do

00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:38,100
it you're just like yeah so maybe

00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:47,280
something we can try to change the tag

00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:48,840
there and make something like that is it

00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,910
better to say that it's an easy fix in

00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:53,070
the sense that no matter what someone

00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:55,169
else can help me walk through this

00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:56,400
without without issue right so someone

00:32:55,169 --> 00:32:59,580
more experienced could help me walk

00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:03,570
through it and and that means guidance

00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:07,280
may be necessary but but it's a fix that

00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:07,280
we we all can do

00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:19,970
so what so one of the thing that we can

00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:23,480
do is why creating the easy fix so

00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:24,980
whenever somebody new comes in problem

00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,929
they face it like where to fix the issue

00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:29,659
and where to find the file so in that

00:33:26,929 --> 00:33:32,480
case this problems comes in like I have

00:33:29,659 --> 00:33:36,409
to go and talk over IRC or over publicly

00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:38,120
over the lake on the github issues right

00:33:36,409 --> 00:33:40,130
so somebody who is very shy or

00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:42,889
introverted so they if I find that issue

00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:45,169
they could even approach someone to ask

00:33:42,889 --> 00:33:49,549
how to go ahead so in that case we can

00:33:45,169 --> 00:33:51,519
like at least for the easy fixes or the

00:33:49,549 --> 00:33:56,389
ghost first issues we can actually write

00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:57,769
the steps on like this is the where you

00:33:56,389 --> 00:34:00,860
need to find the file this is the method

00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:03,049
you need to add it and this is how you

00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:05,840
need to approach the complete steps when

00:34:03,049 --> 00:34:08,179
creating the good first issue and so

00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:11,089
that it's very easy for them to and it

00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:13,190
should be like maybe in like five to ten

00:34:11,089 --> 00:34:15,649
lines of sex that need to do maybe a or

00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:19,869
less even like one two line of so and

00:34:15,649 --> 00:34:19,869
that can be a good start so

00:34:23,579 --> 00:34:31,240
- maybe right maybe with it with some

00:34:28,839 --> 00:34:32,970
people be put in that category you could

00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:45,659
get ready

00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:47,250
if it languages for too long when

00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:49,440
describing the issue you can write that

00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:51,149
this is the issue and because this is a

00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,159
easy fix so these are the if you are

00:34:51,149 --> 00:34:56,760
trying like somebody mu is trying to

00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:58,530
attempt that issue so that person can go

00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:01,920
through this file and there's the issue

00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:03,540
there and this is what we want and this

00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,369
is how you can proceed or these are the

00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:07,980
line of this is the maybe this is the

00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:09,839
module which is used on this is a model

00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:12,089
that needs to be you so you can mention

00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:14,430
all those things in there very clear so

00:35:12,089 --> 00:35:16,109
that he the person who is going to

00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:18,900
attempt that particular problem does not

00:35:16,109 --> 00:35:21,000
need to like ask somebody or directly

00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:24,530
can so it's basically lowering the

00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,530
barrier as much as we can

00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:41,010
they'll get more details on requirements

00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:45,180
what I think in some cases the easy

00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:49,050
fixes or not this one I very well may be

00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:53,370
so if you say I want to do this as easy

00:35:49,050 --> 00:36:16,110
fix but don't describe it enough to know

00:35:53,370 --> 00:36:20,580
where but I scoot you're saying any

00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:23,130
they're coming it's questions all right

00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:24,660
I will give you all 15 minutes back of

00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:28,140
your life

00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:28,140
