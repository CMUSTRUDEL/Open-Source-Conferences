Talk: The Fedora Infrastructure Onboarding Process
Presenters: Rick Elrod

Description: Community and volunteer involvement in Fedora's infrastructure is vital to the continued success of Fedora as a whole. This talk will provide an overview of how the community/onboarding aspect of Fedora's infrastructure has changed over time, places we have gone wrong, and plans in progress to improve the situation. I will discuss ideas on how to revamp our "FI Apprentice" program to maximize community involvement and engagement. This talk is aimed for both newcomers and veterans - anyone with an interest in the critical role that the community has on Fedora Infrastructure and Fedora as a whole.
