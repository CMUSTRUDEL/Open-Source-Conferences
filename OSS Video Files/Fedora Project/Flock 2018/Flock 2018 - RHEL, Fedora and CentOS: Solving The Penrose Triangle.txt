Talk: RHEL, Fedora and CentOS: Solving The Penrose Triangle
Presenters: Josh Boyer, Brendan Conoboy

Description: The relationship between Fedora, RHEL, and CentOS is anything but obvious. Over time the interests of each distro and its patrons have grown and shifted, often filling in gaps and creating opportunities. Join us to hear how Red Hat and RHEL have evolved, why Fedora and CentOS are treasured, and how they fit together. From there we will discuss the road ahead, the problems Red Hat is working on, and the opportunities to work on them together.
