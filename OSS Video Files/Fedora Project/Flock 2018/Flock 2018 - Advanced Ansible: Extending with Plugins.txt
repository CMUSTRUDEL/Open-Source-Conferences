Talk: Advanced Ansible: Extending with Plugins
Presenters: Adam Miller

Description: Ansible is a radically simple IT agentless automation system. It handles configuration-management, application deployment, cloud provisioning, ad-hoc task-execution, and multinode orchestration - including trivializing things like zero-downtime rolling updates with load balancers. Currently, Ansible is used heavily within the Fedora Project by the Infrastructure, CI, QA, and Release Engineering teams. There are use cases within Fedora where Ansible's usage could easily be extended to make Ansible more natively fit into the Fedora Worflow process by way of proper fedmsg integration or otherwise. Ansible Plugins lend themselves to these potential integration points. In this session we will discuss advanced topics in Ansible such as extending core functionality with plugins in hopes to be a catalyst of new ideas and new ways Ansible can solve problems or improve upon solutions in service of the Fedora Project.
