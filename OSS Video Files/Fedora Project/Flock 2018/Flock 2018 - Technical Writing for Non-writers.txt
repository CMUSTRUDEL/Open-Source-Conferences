Talk: Technical Writing for Non-writers
Presenters: Christoph Wickert

Description: You need to write (technical) texts now and then, but are unsure how to structure them, how to phrase your content, or how to best address your readers? This talk shows you how to optimize texts to make them easier to understand (and translate). Get to know universal principles that can be applied to a wide variety of text types - including release notes, bug reports, error messages, or e-mails.

I think there's more people who wanted

00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:14,730
to come or at least according to a shed

00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:17,590
but I think we should just get started

00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,130
thanks everybody for showing up for this

00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:22,180
talk

00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:26,080
my name is Gustav Akkad I used to be

00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:28,660
very active in fedora I used to be a

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,670
package maintainer ambassador fam school

00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:33,640
member feschi member board member

00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:35,110
council member and whatnot that's what

00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:39,370
I'm going to talk about tomorrow about

00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:42,010
my decade in Fedora now I'm going to

00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:45,160
talk about documentation because I

00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:48,129
joined the Sousa documentation team a

00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:50,260
little over two years ago and yeah

00:00:48,129 --> 00:00:51,969
technical writing is my profession now

00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:54,190
I've been writing technical

00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:57,730
documentation at caught up before but

00:00:54,190 --> 00:01:01,329
yeah I'm going to tell you some basic

00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:05,080
rules about technical writing and these

00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:07,540
rules are not only they not only apply

00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,490
to documentation but you can use them

00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:12,280
anywhere you want you can use them for

00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:15,760
example in back reports you can use them

00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:18,430
even in in technically emails so I would

00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,350
argue that technical language is more or

00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:24,340
less the same of course there's there's

00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:28,240
more to documentation but for now we

00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:35,850
just stick to the basic rules I'd

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:40,930
suggest so I've made it six basic rules

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:44,290
after that I can give you we we can have

00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:46,509
a question-and-answer session and at the

00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:48,549
very end I can give you some sources

00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:51,040
unfortunately not all but we have more

00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:55,810
sources on the web for what I'm showing

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:57,670
you now all right for start a little bit

00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:02,900
of fun

00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:06,950
avoid alliteration always that's from so

00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:09,679
these tips are from a website first I

00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:13,370
found them on Facebook when I google for

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:17,000
them I found them on a website called

00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:19,280
plain language gov which is a very

00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,700
valuable resource that I would like to

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,590
recommend to everybody who wants to not

00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:27,440
only for technical documentation but for

00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:30,200
any kind of plain language so plain

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:33,769
language gov holds so it's plain

00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:36,230
language guides for various institutions

00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:39,500
and organizations in the US but also so

00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:40,010
many resources about language and among

00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,350
them

00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:44,780
there's also humor section where these

00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:50,480
rules are from and there's so much truth

00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:56,959
in their prepositions are not words to

00:02:50,480 --> 00:03:00,880
end sentences with avoid cliches like

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,880
the plaque they are old head

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:17,030
comparisons are as bad as cliches be

00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:24,580
more or less specific one should never

00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:24,580
generalize be consistent

00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:33,500
don't be redundant don't use more words

00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:33,500
than necessary it's highly superfluous

00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:38,480
who needs rhetorical questions anyway

00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:47,340
exaggeration is a billion times worse

00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:53,610
than understatement don't use

00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:56,040
contractions so that was just for fun

00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:58,350
there's way more of these on this

00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:01,530
website I can show you some some of them

00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:04,140
later you don't need to fall all follow

00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:06,360
all of them but there's certainly some

00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:09,330
truth in every in every of these rules I

00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:12,390
think it's 70 in total it's it's just

00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:16,620
funny but I'm going to stick for I mean

00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:18,239
you cannot just make these it's not

00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,900
enough to make the opposite of what I

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:24,780
just told you but there are some some

00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:28,890
even more fundamental principles that

00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:33,090
you need to add hire first you need to

00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:36,270
change the perspective who's the best

00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:38,490
person to write so imagine you're a

00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:43,380
developer how many developers do we have

00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:48,150
in the room here okay basically most of

00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:50,550
you who's the best person to document

00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:53,490
the program or the code that you have

00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:57,660
written you are right

00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:59,190
you know everything by heart that's true

00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,380
you're the best person but you're also

00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:04,530
the worst person because you know

00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:06,150
everything by heart you make assumptions

00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:07,470
about your code you know everything

00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:11,340
actually you don't even need

00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:13,020
documentation just read the code but

00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:17,610
that's not how it works you need to

00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:19,560
learn to look at your program from a

00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:22,440
useless perspective and I know this is

00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:25,280
very difficult that's why in an in a

00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,540
perfect world everybody has dedicated

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,960
documentation writers like we have at

00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,450
Sousa

00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:34,120
it's it's similar to Quality Assurance

00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:37,660
you shouldn't quality assure your own

00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:39,610
program you need to have a different

00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,350
point of view you need to know the users

00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:43,090
expectations you need to know your

00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:46,660
audience your target audience or your

00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:49,389
your users it's a big difference if

00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:52,720
you're writing for system administrators

00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:54,610
or if you're writing for other

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,060
developers if you are writing an API

00:05:54,610 --> 00:06:01,449
documentation for example there it's

00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:04,570
probably pretty easy for you to switch

00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:09,490
the point of view but if it's try to

00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:11,260
think as a mere mortal desktop user who

00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:16,510
doesn't have a clue what's under the

00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:17,110
hood so basically don't tell them how it

00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:19,479
works

00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:21,610
tell them how to use it that's all they

00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:24,220
don't care about if you have a car they

00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:27,010
don't care about the engine they want to

00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:30,070
drive and they know to need to know how

00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:31,720
to turn on the the wipers or how to turn

00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:37,120
on the light how to drive when there's

00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:38,770
snow how to change the oil so just stick

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,340
to what's important for your target

00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:44,650
audience try to find out who's your

00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:46,780
target audience maybe you have a clue

00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:50,860
about this for example from discussions

00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:53,410
on mailing this or from buck reports if

00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:57,190
you are I mean sometimes just sometimes

00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:59,229
think you are also a user if you file a

00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:02,590
buck against the program somebody else

00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:04,449
wrote at that point you're a user of

00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:07,120
this program so try to remember these

00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:09,400
situations and try to write from that

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,110
perspective but that's really the

00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:14,380
crucial part and if you don't get your

00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:17,470
target audience right you won't get the

00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:19,570
documentation right there are some hints

00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:22,840
to do that or some tricks a lot of

00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:28,180
people use personas I recall like in

00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:29,889
fedora we did that too we own the fedora

00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,900
our homepage I'm not sure if it's still

00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:33,970
online but at some point on the federal

00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:36,160
homepage we had the different fedora

00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:40,120
users we were actually introducing them

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:42,070
so one is a professional musician the

00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,210
other is a sysadmin the next one is a

00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:48,500
developer but then you have

00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:51,830
a musician again and they all tell their

00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:55,160
user stories how they use fedora so it's

00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:57,590
all about persona and user stories a lot

00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,599
of people are a lot of if you're into

00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:01,639
professional documentation writing you

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,849
try to to really have these different

00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:06,860
personas you write them up and try to

00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:09,740
look at things from their perspective

00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:13,190
actually there's some people who even do

00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:16,669
real-world user testing who don't make

00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:20,419
up these personas these example users

00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:24,860
but really have some some users use

00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:26,840
their program and test it but that's

00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:30,130
really that's why I made it the rule

00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:33,279
number one it's the most underlying

00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:36,349
underlying rules of all at Sousa

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:39,260
meditation we often define the target

00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:41,450
audience at the very beginning of the

00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:44,720
documentation we say this handbook was

00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:48,110
written for and then you would line

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:53,180
outlet layout administrators or users or

00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:55,820
whatnot okay the next thing is giant

00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:59,630
pile of information and you want to

00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:05,390
structure it somehow so split it up into

00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:08,660
chunks first things first what everybody

00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:14,620
needs to know try to make a high-level

00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:18,170
summary like say installation set up

00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:21,290
first time use maintenance whatever

00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:24,310
these are the four that would be the

00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:27,680
four chapters of your documentation and

00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:32,480
then you go further down into this

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:36,500
hierarchy I suggest to not have more

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:38,570
than three levels of more than a three

00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:42,500
level hierarchy but that should usually

00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:46,990
be enough and within this three level

00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:51,230
hierarchy you should usually only have

00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:53,589
seven plus minus two items yes I know

00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:56,959
sometimes this can be can be hard

00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:58,070
actually having more is not not

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,279
necessarily a prob

00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:04,220
if you have a consistent hierarchy for

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:07,279
example I recall a project that I was

00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:12,949
recently working on where we describe a

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:15,290
lot of command command line options yes

00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:17,660
I think we ended up at 11 so that's

00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:20,170
clearly against Miller's law but if your

00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:22,160
hierarchy if your structure is

00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:26,600
consistent then it's not really a

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:28,639
problem if you're having or if you have

00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,750
something that needs to be executed in a

00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:32,540
certain order

00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:34,699
make it a procedure the procedure is

00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:37,519
usually numbered and the procedure

00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:41,240
shouldn't have more than ten steps if

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:43,930
you have more you can think about sub

00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:47,029
steps if well first of all you can

00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:50,240
combine steps is if the next step is

00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:54,680
just click OK then you would just add it

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:57,649
to the previous step if you have

00:10:54,680 --> 00:11:00,079
optional steps that would be sub steps

00:10:57,649 --> 00:11:03,350
that you can skip and you could actually

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:06,199
inside a procedure you could also start

00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:09,949
using a hierarchy but I would recommend

00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:11,449
only using two levels there but again

00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:15,410
it's all about the structure if

00:11:11,449 --> 00:11:18,410
something is is unrelated then you can

00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:22,490
have basically well any structure you

00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:26,180
want you can skip stuff going back to

00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:29,540
the the example installation set up

00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:32,990
first time use maintenance whatever they

00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:34,940
can just jump in on chapter two because

00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:37,610
the program is already installed I just

00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:40,399
need to set it up so here order doesn't

00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:42,079
matter but if order matters then make it

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:47,079
a procedure and make sure you have

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:49,790
numbers when you make this structure

00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:52,910
think about the readers goals the

00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:56,829
readers goals is usually get this stuff

00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:59,660
up and running or get this use it

00:11:56,829 --> 00:12:01,819
however you have a certain certain

00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:05,769
purpose a certain goal that you want to

00:12:01,819 --> 00:12:05,769
achieve with this program so

00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:15,650
yeah try to do everything with the

00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:18,770
structure from the readers goals to it

00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:21,260
clearly achieve every point in the

00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:23,480
structure should help the user to

00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:26,270
achieve another goal when he is he when

00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:29,330
the user is finished reading chapter one

00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:32,480
he should have installed the program

00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:38,260
after chat-up chapter two he should have

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:41,240
set it up and so on when you have

00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:44,390
instructions you usually use the active

00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:48,260
voice you address the user directly I

00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:52,160
know there are programs that handle this

00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:54,260
differently for example gnome usually

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,750
uses the passive voice in all its

00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:59,660
translations it's it's a difference if

00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:03,320
you say to use file or should this file

00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:06,980
be deleted in documentation I would

00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:08,660
suggest to use an active voice because

00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,730
it's you are addressing the user

00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:12,830
directly you need to install this

00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:15,020
program net not somebody else if you say

00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:17,030
the program needs to be installed then

00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:19,670
well it's not my business

00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:21,620
now you're clearly talking to the reader

00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:25,550
and that's why you use the active voice

00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:27,860
as again procedures with steps if you

00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:30,380
have something difficult make sure that

00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:33,440
the warning is before the step and not

00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:37,780
afterwards otherwise people may be very

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:41,540
angry at you if they have screwed I mean

00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:43,550
if things are okay they have just

00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:46,550
screwed up that particular step and you

00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:48,830
need to start over again if things go

00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:53,330
really south they have deleted data and

00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:55,940
they are not happy at all and the same

00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:58,040
goes for background if information for

00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:01,070
example an architectural overview or

00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:04,000
what's an introduction and of course all

00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:06,770
of that has to go before the procedure

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,740
again before the procedure you would say

00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:12,530
you would really outline the goal this

00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:16,670
procedure helps you to install that or

00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:19,790
to do that and if there's any additional

00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:23,060
information needed about the goal if the

00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:31,040
Santee award before it has to go before

00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:33,260
the procedure and now whatever you know

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,500
you actually start writing at least

00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:39,310
that's what I help and keep it simple

00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:44,840
stupid the KISS principle we all know it

00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:49,700
use simple words that's not only simpler

00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:52,040
for you but also for your readers you're

00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:54,130
probably not going to translate your

00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:58,040
documentation into different languages

00:14:54,130 --> 00:15:00,890
so and you're not necessarily a native

00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,990
English speaker I mean I'm not I know a

00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:06,170
lot of people are here are not and

00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:08,780
probably your users won't be native

00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:12,050
speakers either so that's why I use a

00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:14,240
simple language and even if your

00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:16,220
documentation is translated even if it's

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,650
translated by professional translators

00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:20,570
at Sousa we have certain documentation

00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:22,670
that is translated and certain

00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:25,610
documentation is not but even if you

00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:28,700
have professional translators using a

00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:31,160
simple language makes it easier for them

00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:33,230
you can be sure that the translated

00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:37,160
result is what you had actually in mind

00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:42,380
so the KISS principle means you use

00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:46,100
simple words use instead of utilize show

00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:48,290
instead of indicate requirement instead

00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,570
of prerequisite I mean there are lots of

00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:52,610
examples

00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:55,550
it's not about we are not talking about

00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:58,940
winning a Nobel Prize here it's not

00:15:55,550 --> 00:16:02,750
about that it that it sounds nice or

00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:04,610
that yes you should avoid try to avoid

00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:07,580
duplications but on the other hand you

00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:10,510
shouldn't use ten different verbs or ten

00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:13,280
different words for the same thing that

00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:17,990
goes back to the be consistent that we

00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:20,600
had before then grammar click OK the

00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:24,770
printer dialog appears that's that's

00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:29,360
straight forward that's I mean as simple

00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:32,500
as a sentence can be you have the noun

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:36,850
you have the verb

00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:40,480
there's it hardly can be any simpler try

00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:44,860
to only stick one idea into one sentence

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:49,330
don't use complicated sentence

00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:51,820
constructions before yada-yada-yada

00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:52,540
after or something if you used something

00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:57,250
like that

00:16:52,540 --> 00:17:02,230
make sure to indicate it clearly if then

00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:04,690
before after first second not first next

00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:08,350
next next again there you would make a

00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:13,380
procedure first second third finally so

00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:15,820
for example and try to avoid fillers

00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:18,780
there are so many fillers that you can

00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:22,330
avoid that you just shouldn't be using

00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:37,390
if you read it over you will find out

00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:39,550
better again simple is good be

00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:42,220
consistent we just had that in the how

00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:47,560
to write good rules but something that

00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:50,560
is very very very important at Sousa we

00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:53,320
have the Sousa style guide and actually

00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,910
we have a terminology there or in all

00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:59,080
projects that I've been working with

00:17:54,910 --> 00:18:01,180
I've also been working with the xfce and

00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,400
the alex is de translations i was the

00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:06,460
coordinator for the german translation

00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:09,100
team so you usually have a dictionary or

00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:12,130
terminology to make sure you are

00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:14,770
consistent and it's it's really

00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:17,440
surprising how many different words you

00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:20,830
can find for the same thing or how many

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:23,920
different spellings you can find for the

00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:26,850
same thing so really try to be

00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,850
consistent here

00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:34,469
okay

00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:40,950
parallel constructions why whitespace is

00:18:34,469 --> 00:18:42,869
important you see it doesn't work here

00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:46,739
right can you can hardly read the next

00:18:42,869 --> 00:18:49,259
lines and that is not only because of

00:18:46,739 --> 00:18:51,329
the strikethrough but it's also because

00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:55,229
we have totally different stuff here

00:18:51,329 --> 00:18:56,940
that is not really related again if you

00:18:55,229 --> 00:19:02,539
are let's let's go through it one by one

00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:05,940
if you want to emphasize a certain

00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:07,979
sentence make it a paragraph of its own

00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:10,499
even if it's only a single sentence

00:19:07,979 --> 00:19:12,809
there's nothing wrong with that if it's

00:19:10,499 --> 00:19:15,809
if it's a step in a procedure or if it's

00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:18,779
if it's something the user must not miss

00:19:15,809 --> 00:19:22,919
then it's definitely a paragraph of its

00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:25,499
own so white space before and white

00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:29,099
space after helps to to focus the

00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:32,159
attention it separates the different

00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:34,259
sections and again it helps you to to

00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:38,599
break the content into the different

00:19:34,259 --> 00:19:38,599
chunks that I was talking about earlier

00:19:40,099 --> 00:19:51,419
and now I'm coming back to plain

00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:52,859
language avoid interruptions at last

00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:54,479
year I was at a conference that is

00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:57,419
called write the docs in Prague and

00:19:54,479 --> 00:19:59,669
there was a guy who gave a very

00:19:57,419 --> 00:20:03,179
interesting talk about how our mind

00:19:59,669 --> 00:20:06,959
works and as most of you are developers

00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:11,249
think of your of our brain as a compiler

00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:15,149
or think of your your documentation like

00:20:11,249 --> 00:20:17,609
code the code needs to be readable or

00:20:15,149 --> 00:20:20,579
our brain needs to be able to compile it

00:20:17,609 --> 00:20:24,179
and in order to make that simple it's

00:20:20,579 --> 00:20:25,739
it's of course you can understand just

00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:28,469
look at the sentence there are not

00:20:25,739 --> 00:20:30,749
however marked as installed however they

00:20:28,469 --> 00:20:33,599
are not marked as installed it's not a

00:20:30,749 --> 00:20:36,059
big difference everybody here can

00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:38,239
understand both sentences but you will

00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:40,380
surely agree that the second sentence is

00:20:38,239 --> 00:20:43,330
simpler to understand

00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:46,480
because you you're not interrupting the

00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:51,370
the train of thought try to avoid this

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:54,370
wherever possible the next the same goes

00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:57,520
for phrasal verbs shut the server down

00:20:54,370 --> 00:21:00,900
no shut down the server it's as simple

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:03,460
as that even if it only takes a

00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:05,640
microsecond if you only save a

00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:09,400
microsecond even if it only makes this

00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:11,770
single sentence is it tiny bit easier to

00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,770
understand there's there's a lot of

00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:17,320
potential and they actually made tests

00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:19,510
when it comes to understanding or the

00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:21,430
reading speed for a certain paragraph

00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:24,070
there's so much that you can gain with

00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:26,620
it and it's yeah think again like a

00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:33,790
compiler you are optimizing your code

00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:35,620
basically then please use real words of

00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:40,060
verbs that's something that especially

00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:41,890
the developers often do SSH into the

00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:44,110
administration node that's that's a real

00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:49,150
word sentence in a pull request from a

00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:53,800
developer or unchanged it to connect to

00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:56,680
the administration node using SSH this

00:21:53,800 --> 00:22:01,090
also has the the nice little benefit

00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:03,220
that you avoid the Capitol SSH I mean

00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:05,470
the command on the command line is

00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:08,200
called as its H lowercase

00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:09,850
at the beginning of the sentence you're

00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,410
running into a problem if you write a

00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:15,840
lowercase at the beginning it looks

00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:19,450
stupid so yeah again tiny tiny little

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:22,030
difference but don't don't use I mean

00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:25,900
know that if you're familiar with a

00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:31,960
certain piece of technology it's it's

00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:36,160
very common to use program names as

00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:37,690
verbs especially I mean in the mail in

00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:41,140
the English language you can turn

00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:43,840
everything into a verb right we can't do

00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:46,900
this in German but in the in English you

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:49,480
can do this please don't stick to stick

00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:51,170
to simple verbs stick to real verbs that

00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:56,390
everybody knows

00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:59,690
and last but not least autumn matters we

00:22:56,390 --> 00:23:03,080
have two sentences here refer to Sousa

00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:07,700
calm / dog for more information or for

00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:09,770
more information go there's actually the

00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:14,090
capital R that shouldn't be there for

00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:16,730
more information refer to so why is the

00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:19,940
second one better because you start

00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:21,890
reading you at the in the first half of

00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:25,280
the sentence you see what it's about for

00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:29,630
more information and in the second half

00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:31,040
go there I mean it's it's a one again

00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:33,440
it's one of these these tiny little

00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:36,050
different differences that speed up

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:40,340
compiling in your brain by a microsecond

00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:43,400
and I'm almost through

00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:45,580
oh I'm quicker than expected but that

00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:49,760
leaves us more time for Q&A

00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:53,260
last but not least take your time write

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:56,480
a draft sleep over it

00:23:53,260 --> 00:24:01,730
read it or even better have somebody

00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:04,430
else read it and then edit it you know

00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:07,580
Stephen King he's a famous author and he

00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:11,570
once said to write as human to edit is

00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:13,430
divine the longer you stare at a text

00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:16,280
the harder it gets or the longer you

00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:18,250
work on it the harder it gets so take a

00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:22,460
break sleep over it

00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:25,010
usually there's this this 80/20 rule you

00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:28,300
can make a draft that covers 80% of the

00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:30,820
information or that is that is 80% good

00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:36,470
you only need to improve the the last

00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:40,210
20% and this can be very very very hard

00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:42,890
so take your time do something else

00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:44,990
start working on something else write

00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:47,660
the second chapter or even write the

00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:51,680
third chapter whatever you can you can

00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:54,290
even leave the the text aside for a week

00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:56,090
it's actually better to look at the text

00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:59,980
after a week and then you think oh what

00:24:56,090 --> 00:25:03,890
did I write there so take your time and

00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:05,100
yeah that should help you to solve most

00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:10,060
of the problem

00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:11,530
all right that's the six basic rules we

00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:13,120
could make it even more rules but I

00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:21,450
think that's enough and I think that's

00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:21,450
pretty universal are there any questions

00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:35,340
rule number one was oops sorry change

00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,340
the perspective

00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:49,600
are you ready developer okay your former

00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:53,800
family okay the thing is don't if if you

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:56,740
are if you were a developer don't look

00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:59,650
at your program from a developer's

00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:02,440
perspective on the one hand you're the

00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:04,000
person who best knows this program

00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:06,070
therefore you are the best person to

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,720
document it but on the other hand you

00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:09,700
are the worst person to documented

00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:12,340
because you are the best person to know

00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:14,350
how hard you know the inner workings you

00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:16,600
know what's under the hood you're making

00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:18,370
assumptions and you cannot see from the

00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:21,040
user's perspective and then changing the

00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:24,910
perspectives that's why the rule number

00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:28,300
one is the hardest part sometimes and

00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:30,040
it's the most basic part if you don't

00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:32,140
get this right if you don't know your

00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:35,290
target audience know what who you are

00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:38,350
writing for if you don't know that then

00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:40,690
you have no idea if it's if it's easy if

00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:42,100
you're writing an API documentation then

00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:43,870
it's easy you're a developer you are

00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:46,210
writing for other developers so the

00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:48,429
expectations are not that different but

00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:50,440
if you are writing for end-users that

00:26:48,429 --> 00:26:53,530
can often be cumbersome for developers

00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:55,870
and that's why in a perfect work or in

00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:58,780
big organizations at least you don't

00:26:55,870 --> 00:27:01,559
have developers writing the

00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:03,790
documentation but you have dedicated

00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:06,280
documentation writers or technical

00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:09,160
writers just as you have quality

00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:10,780
assurance I mean you're not supposed to

00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:14,170
test your own programs because he will

00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:15,610
always cheat I recall once upon a time

00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:18,670
when I was still working at quota

00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:23,040
systems we actually outsource some

00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:23,040
testing to India and

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:31,000
can I say the word and click monkey I

00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:33,430
know it's not politically correct but

00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,760
these people there were not true I mean

00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:39,030
they were professional testers they were

00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:42,420
by no means familiar with our software

00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:46,060
and it's it's unbelievable how many

00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:47,830
problems or bugs they found just because

00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:50,790
they were not familiar with it just

00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:55,000
because they they stick did a striptease

00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:57,280
stick to our instructions and we had

00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,670
just made certain assumptions we had

00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:02,550
just skipped certain steps or we had

00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:06,580
just assumed that everybody would be

00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:08,890
connecting to the mail server over SSL

00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:12,700
and not over an unencrypted connection

00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:15,370
and yeah suddenly that didn't work I

00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:21,070
mean trying to check to change the

00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:23,800
perspective or if you can't do that yeah

00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:26,080
try to get a real broad user if you have

00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:28,750
already written it give it to a

00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:32,410
real-world user and ask them for

00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:34,270
feedback just batch cover or answer your

00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:37,540
question okay

00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:51,790
any other questions any other questions

00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:53,500
on other frankly speaking so the

00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:56,070
question was how do you make up the

00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:59,650
personas or how you create the personas

00:28:56,070 --> 00:29:02,050
I actually accidentally already gave the

00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:05,500
answers in most situations they will be

00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:07,930
made up I don't think that I think only

00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:12,190
very little projects have had actual

00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:13,870
numbers or user surveys or something so

00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:16,120
on a day job that they can get out of

00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:19,570
this on this one so they will just make

00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:22,870
people up usually you can think of

00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:26,320
certain roles don't think of Kiwanis is

00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:28,720
the first step up think of robots like

00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:33,340
the admin

00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:36,429
the network engineer or whatever and

00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:39,610
from that like personas even find more

00:29:36,429 --> 00:29:42,640
fine range than a row you could the next

00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:44,710
step would be okay we are not thinking

00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:48,669
in terms of the size of men but we have

00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:52,030
the junior sis of men and the senior or

00:29:48,669 --> 00:29:54,580
we have the sis of men who just who used

00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:56,919
to be windows up men and just got its

00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:58,870
first enormous training or so that would

00:29:56,919 --> 00:30:00,700
be another persona but as a first step

00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:04,240
you just think about different roles and

00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:06,730
then you can make it or find range it

00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,460
would be nice if we all had that that

00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:12,940
user data if we all had surveys I know

00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:15,400
that in fedora we did that I know that

00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:16,720
other other organizations I think what's

00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:20,409
it all for example that they do

00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:23,770
real-world testing they may test it with

00:30:20,409 --> 00:30:25,480
with somebody said it's so simply even

00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:28,030
my grandma can install it and they

00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:29,830
tested it not their breath so if you

00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:32,429
have a grandmother who's willing to to

00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:32,429
be your

00:30:41,630 --> 00:31:13,340
oh great question okay I'm going to

00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:15,350
repeat the question for the people who

00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:18,260
are watching the stream so the question

00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:20,270
was about is there a dictionary

00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:22,010
especially when it comes to translation

00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:23,720
I mean first of all is consistency in

00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:26,660
the native language and then it's

00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:28,010
consistency in the translations you said

00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:31,040
your BSD translator

00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:33,800
ideally eight things would be consistent

00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:35,300
throughout programs consistent

00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,460
throughout desktop environments

00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:39,670
consistent throughout operating systems

00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:42,950
unfortunately the world is not perfect

00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:45,170
everybody has their own terminology but

00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:48,260
at least within these projects you

00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:50,390
usually have consistency because they

00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:52,160
have some sub dictionaries I can show

00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:54,170
you some there are for example the

00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:58,040
genome translation guidelines which are

00:31:54,170 --> 00:32:02,480
very solid and then then cover a lot of

00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:04,880
stuff but then there are I think in the

00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,640
xfce we had the same well we had similar

00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:09,670
guidelines but we had difference so we

00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:15,290
started from the norm guidelines but but

00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:18,290
we worked them slightly I think at some

00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:22,190
point who have their own guidelines I

00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:23,810
mean when it comes to German so one who

00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:28,100
always wanted to have this human touch

00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:31,940
and they were doing their users instead

00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:32,490
of Z so that's something very German

00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:34,780
that

00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:36,760
doesn't work in English but it's it's

00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:38,680
just two different forms of addressing a

00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:40,990
user one is more formal and the other is

00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:42,880
more informal and you know - we are all

00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:46,660
friends so they use the informal

00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:50,860
language in probably addressing the use

00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:52,420
either way if you have a particular

00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:55,360
question I could so show you some

00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:59,410
dictionaries but unfortunately there's

00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:03,850
not the the one-size-fits-all dictionary

00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:11,730
that's why we have a recycling bin in -

00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:15,310
trash bin or yeah um but there are some

00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:18,040
resources that are very valuable I think

00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:21,940
the ultimate resource is the IBM style

00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:24,550
guide that's just a giant dictionary

00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:26,650
it's being published for I have no idea

00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:29,020
how many years already and it's yeah

00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:32,710
it's just massive you can look up
