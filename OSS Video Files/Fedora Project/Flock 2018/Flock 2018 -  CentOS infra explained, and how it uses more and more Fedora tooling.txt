Talk: CentOS infra explained, and how it uses more and more Fedora tooling
Presenters: Fabian Arrotin

Description: In this talk, we can have a quick overview of how the CentOS Infra runs, the used technologies, but also how we are slowly getting more and more Fedora applications in our own infra, making it easier for Fedora contributors to also become CentOS contributors, as underlying tools for the platform are common and so well understood.
