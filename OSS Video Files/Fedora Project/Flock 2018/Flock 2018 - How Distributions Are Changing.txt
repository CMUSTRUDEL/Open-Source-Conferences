Talk: How Distributions Are Changing
Presenters: Langdon White

Description: Many people in the Fedora Community have recognized the need to adapt the distribution to meet the changing needs of the user community. We have looked at and implemented a number of things over the years, software collections, EPEL, COPR, and now, Modularity. However, we are not the only distribution and, as a result, it is worthwhile to review what other distributions are doing and compare that to our solutions.

In this talk, we will discuss some of the changing needs that the distributions are facing and what solutions have been put forward. Specifically, we will review Amazon Extras, SUSE Modules, Flatpak, Snaps, Ubuntu PPAs, and Nix. During the review we will compare the solutions to equivalents in Fedora. As much as possible, we will use demonstrations of the technologies to make the comparisons.
