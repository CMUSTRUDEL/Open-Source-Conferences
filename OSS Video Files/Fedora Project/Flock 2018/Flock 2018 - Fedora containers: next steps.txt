Talk: Fedora containers: next steps
Presenters: Tomas Tomecek, Dominika Hodovska, Jiri Popelka, Clement Verna

Description: Complete agenda for this workshop can be found in this etherpad:

https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/flock-2018-containers-workshop

Our team has a focus on automation and streamlining the process of Red Hat container images
delivery. We would love to bring some of our tools and ideas to Fedora!

Outcome: faster delivery process, container images are up to date, less work
for maintainers, containers are validated

Proposal/agenda:

1. Introduction of stakeholders.
2. Introduction of what we did at Red Hat (processes) and introduction to our tools.
3. Design discussion on what can we do at Fedora side:
* Validation.
* Automation (least amount of steps for container maintainers).
* Delivery (can I have the container on my system ASAP?).

okay so I don't want to talk to the mic

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,050
because I want this to be a discussion

00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:14,340
so we prepared some content for you and

00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:16,260
some topics to discuss and India and I

00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,820
would love to this was discussion so I'm

00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:23,220
not sure how useful this will be for the

00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:26,869
recording okay so why we are here so we

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:29,400
have like containers for some time and

00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:31,410
they have they've been integrated into

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,559
federal infrastructure so we have built

00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,930
system we have registry we have package

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,570
review process or like container review

00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,910
process and they are all there and like

00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,890
the reason for this workshop is how to

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,020
improve it what can we do better

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,239
which parts of doing fresh structure we

00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:53,820
can improve or change or swap or

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:56,070
whatever it's one thing but for that we

00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,629
need one person and that is Clement

00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,760
Verna but he's not here right now

00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:02,039
because they are having infrastructure

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,629
planning meeting or some like that but

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,780
he will join later

00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:08,640
so Clement is actually the person who is

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,549
maintaining the federal system for

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:16,409
container images and he's been working

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:19,020
for on it for past six months and he put

00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:22,380
plenty of ideas into the other pot like

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:25,350
what can we discuss today or like what

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:27,210
can we plan for and one of the most

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,000
important things of those is the

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,909
creation of the new container cig within

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,759
Fedora so the way this worked in Federer

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:38,369
is that there was atomic working group

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:42,180
and atomic working group force covering

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:44,990
federal Tomic host and also container

00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:49,170
build system and containers themselves

00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:54,149
but it was working like best efforts so

00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:58,120
so some issues were left open for a long

00:01:54,149 --> 00:02:02,690
time some sorry not

00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:06,500
but recently you heard there is this new

00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:09,140
thing Federer chorus so so the current

00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:11,780
state is that we'll have new seek just

00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:15,020
for containers and we'll talk about

00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:17,330
Federer build system and like how to

00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:22,250
make it better and then there will be

00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:24,320
other seek for Federer Korres so yeah we

00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:26,720
could definitely talk or we will talk

00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:29,300
about it is unsecured men's get hear

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,000
about the sea itself like who wants to

00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,950
be in it what we'll be working on which

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,580
issues from the atomic working room

00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:40,310
we'll move to the container sig okay so

00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:42,740
that's one thing to discuss there other

00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:45,560
thing is that probably one of the

00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:48,830
reasons I started this workshop was that

00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,420
our team was working on automation of

00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:52,910
the container delivery process

00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,920
internally so the thing is that

00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:58,100
internally we are using a lot of

00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:00,400
different tools to build and release

00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:04,070
contain images than they're in Federer

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,560
mainly the last part and our team was

00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:09,380
working on like automating it as much as

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,270
possible it's still not done but we

00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:14,030
already have some results in some tools

00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:16,820
and we would love to also use these

00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:20,989
tools which in Federer so we definitely

00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:23,770
want to discuss that the main issue is

00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:26,330
that not all of them are open-source

00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:28,400
because they are really closely tied to

00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:30,739
the internal infrastructure but it

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,200
shouldn't be such a problem to add

00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:36,620
support for Federer like said message or

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,420
body and others but the core parts are

00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:41,209
open-source so we can definitely show

00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:44,540
those and talk about those this other

00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:46,970
part to discuss and obviously since we

00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:48,950
have much more people right now here we

00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:51,890
can also discuss things you are

00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:54,470
interested in so this was just like this

00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:56,930
ether path it was just our ideas which

00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:59,330
we can talk about that but I'm assuming

00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:02,300
that you guys have much more so we can

00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:06,170
totally discuss those

00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:09,280
so I already did in introduction I'm not

00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:12,020
sure if we want to like introduce Iran

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:17,470
if everyone want to introduce themselves

00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:17,470
since we already have quite a few people

00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:31,040
okay so if you want to look at the text

00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:39,070
maybe sit closer to the okay so it's

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:42,590
ctrl + right okay yeah so so the URL is

00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:52,520
okay I'll copy it if you want to open it

00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:54,950
yourself the role of director pet feel

00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:58,690
free to put anything inside please just

00:04:54,950 --> 00:05:01,970
don't erase it all this is the only

00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:08,600
source of the information in here okay

00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:11,210
oh come on I have Mike in my hands okay

00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,700
so I already introduced the session or

00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:16,850
team I'm not sure if we want to

00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:19,130
introduce the chart each of us probably

00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:21,530
not really or if anyone wants to

00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:25,280
introduce themselves and have any idea

00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:29,010
what can do here right now now's the

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:33,730
time okay

00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:35,920
pardon yeah he will come so they have

00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:37,480
the infrastructure planning and he said

00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:47,230
that he'll be late but he'll definitely

00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:49,150
come okay so we covered that okay so as

00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:51,880
an as soon as comment come we'll talk

00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:54,040
about the container sick so I guess that

00:05:51,880 --> 00:06:00,040
we can start talking about the

00:05:54,040 --> 00:06:01,660
automation we've been working on so so

00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,610
we actually were working for staff

00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:06,070
Walter and I'm assuming that you've

00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:10,140
already seen staff and attended some of

00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:13,990
his talks about automation and bought

00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:16,120
other things so since we are working on

00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:19,300
him we are trying to follow his

00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:22,180
philosophy and the way we approach the

00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:25,630
automation internally is that we created

00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:27,370
BOTS and like real BOTS so they have

00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:30,610
different names they have personalities

00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:38,770
and they have usually like one task to

00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:40,570
do and they try to do it well and yes I

00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:43,210
said right now they are mostly tied to

00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:45,190
the internal infrastructure but we can

00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:47,830
definitely make it work with in fedora

00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:50,200
so our team which is actually in the

00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:53,169
first row of this dominica america so

00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:55,270
they already try to do it but i guess

00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:58,540
that we can introduce the bots

00:06:55,270 --> 00:07:02,050
themselves okay so we already assigned

00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:05,470
tasks like who will be doing what so I

00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:10,030
can start like - first then Dominica

00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:14,530
Erika and and - lost as well okay so

00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:16,750
with internally what we decided like the

00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:18,669
thing is with the automation is that you

00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:21,490
can automate things but you still need

00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:24,340
humans to help you with the automation

00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:26,560
like computers can't do anything they

00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:29,169
are still they're still need for humans

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,540
so it's good for us

00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:34,180
and the thing is like how will both

00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:36,840
interact with humans so usually that's

00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:39,330
email right

00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:42,320
but that's not interactive like usually

00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:45,360
you need to put some input so luckily

00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:48,270
Dominic's team which is osci they've

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,460
been working on deploying begger on top

00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:52,320
of this gate internally as well so it

00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:55,290
works pretty much the same way as in

00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:57,030
fedora and we decided that pool request

00:07:55,290 --> 00:08:02,180
would be the centerpiece of the

00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:05,190
interaction between bots and humans so

00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:08,460
so our bots actually interact with pull

00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:10,979
requests so for example whenever yeah so

00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:13,560
whenever there is a new commit like one

00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:15,330
bot can easily initiate a scratch build

00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,540
of the container image and see like if

00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:20,070
the commit is sane and if you note it

00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:23,880
would report back to the pull request

00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:26,070
that a scratch built doesn't succeed or

00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:29,610
for example the dockerfile has issues or

00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:33,360
whatever else so just to give you an

00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:37,229
example I created a pull request for one

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:41,430
of my containers in fedora and this is

00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:45,440
how it looks so so yeah the idea is the

00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:48,350
dish this could be the centerpiece of

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:52,080
like of the collaboration between the

00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:53,820
automation system and and humans yeah so

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,810
it's very simple I just added one more

00:08:53,820 --> 00:09:00,750
package into the tools container image

00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:03,230
so any ideas here like this good idea is

00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,230
this bad

00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,470
Oh

00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:27,200
pardon III don't fall okay yeah so okay

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:29,750
so dusty agrees we are good yeah so this

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,029
is the premise pretty much that we have

00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:34,610
modern workflow for development of

00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:36,589
software so we have get we can take

00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:38,300
advantage of the multiplayer modes we

00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:41,870
can do Forks and we can do pull requests

00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:44,120
and this is how we can collaborate so

00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:48,950
this is what we actually start building

00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:52,070
from and then we have next boat name is

00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:54,320
Java meal so for those of you who are

00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:56,950
with Slavic ancestors you probably know

00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:00,080
what the name means and for the others

00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:04,690
sexually job meal could be translated is

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:07,220
like person who lost healthiness and

00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:09,890
jeremy'll is a boat which linzstoker

00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:22,790
files and Dominic I do wanna talk some

00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:25,430
more about it let me see okay so I will

00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:30,589
as a STONER set is someone who likes

00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:33,700
health and he looks at all changes in in

00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:36,770
this gate so when talking about federal

00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:41,209
it's not implemented yet in Federer esta

00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:43,970
Merced but in the future it may be a

00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:47,720
matter of weeks I I think that we would

00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:50,150
be able to do it now so it could work in

00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:53,270
Federer only thing we we have to do is

00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:58,010
link it to Fed message and listen for

00:10:53,270 --> 00:11:01,370
new I think new pull requests in paid

00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:04,310
pressure on new commits commit on pager

00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:06,980
so that can be trigger for Dramamine it

00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:15,160
should be really easy to configure then

00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:15,160
drive Emil runs linters using : yes

00:11:21,319 --> 00:11:29,699
okay look at they didn't listen to me

00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:34,350
that it's okay I'm glad no no this is so

00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:37,110
we've we've created as rosettes that it

00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:40,769
is sets of rule that are important for

00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:44,249
images including best practices and and

00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:49,019
also requires labels and stuff from OS

00:11:44,249 --> 00:11:52,019
PS and calling that's actually heart of

00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:53,360
Drago mill that's ramen is just just a

00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:56,790
wrapper above :

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:59,189
cooling looks at the the docker file and

00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:01,049
sees what's wrong and when he sees

00:11:59,189 --> 00:12:05,910
something wrong he actually sends email

00:12:01,049 --> 00:12:12,110
to maintainer or or DD creator of the of

00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:16,230
the pull request so or now this DT

00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:17,850
commits creator but yes indeed in the

00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:21,319
future it will be also possible to

00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:24,299
configure it so you can add another

00:12:21,319 --> 00:12:26,189
person's and emails or our city knows

00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:28,799
where the ramen will can send

00:12:26,189 --> 00:12:32,040
notifications about results and we were

00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:34,290
actually really successful with with

00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:38,879
Duran's we had some thousands of run in

00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:39,809
a month so I think that's quite great ok

00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:42,949
you have it

00:12:39,809 --> 00:12:48,419
can I finish I have it in my in my

00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:50,720
notebook but ok my environment is broken

00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:50,720
sorry

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,380
so some

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:36,149
I have I have here at the core file or

00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:38,250
do I just just an empty file so we can

00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,879
see all the checks and for that for

00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,689
fedora

00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:41,689
I ran :

00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:54,029
yes you can see that all failed because

00:13:51,300 --> 00:14:07,019
we have an empty file so these are all

00:13:54,029 --> 00:14:15,029
the checks show you for Federer just a

00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:18,110
quick demo so that's it from me okay so

00:14:15,029 --> 00:14:18,110
any questions here

00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:31,690
so I couldn't hear the question actually

00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:41,630
for historical reasons when we were

00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:44,530
first we started working on it

00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:47,630
internally we didn't have pager and

00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:52,040
there were no to request so we started

00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:55,490
to react to commits and actually in the

00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:57,820
next week it will be reacting to new law

00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,820
requests

00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:12,710
[Music]

00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:15,170
okay so for the question was about rules

00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:18,050
like where they live and if you can add

00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:22,490
your own that's a really good question

00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:25,520
and Sue dancer like answer could be

00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:28,820
really long so I'll try to make it

00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:32,090
shorter so what Colleen is actually the

00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:36,170
project itself it's like the CLI tool

00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:38,540
plus API and then a bunch of checks like

00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:41,120
for example checks for presence of

00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:43,490
labels presence of files presence of

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,610
whatever else and you can easily add

00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:47,900
your own checks and then whenever you

00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:50,930
run :

00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:54,020
as Dominica showcased she she typed

00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:57,860
colon and then used rule set fedora and

00:15:54,020 --> 00:16:00,260
this is how we decided to like make the

00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:02,030
connection between checks and like what

00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:04,700
you want to run so we call these things

00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:07,100
are all set and all sets contain lists

00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:08,630
of rules and you can easily add your own

00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:11,450
rules so for example you can use

00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:13,790
existing code for checks and just like

00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:16,540
put different parameters to check for

00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:19,070
presence of different files or labels

00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:21,080
yeah so this one thing and the other

00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:24,110
thing is you asked about like how can

00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:25,940
you add your own so you can easily open

00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:30,680
a pull request against calling project

00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:32,930
and add your own checks but the thing is

00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:35,360
that internally this is not good enough

00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:37,100
right now because we definitely want to

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,830
have as much open source checks as

00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:42,080
possible but at the same time we have

00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:43,880
internal infrastructure and we also try

00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:46,580
to check for internal things which are

00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:48,590
like they don't have any value in in the

00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:51,500
open source project so we want to have

00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:53,240
also like internal checks so in the end

00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,550
then we need to figure out how to take

00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,350
the open source thing then the internal

00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:59,810
thing and then glue it all together and

00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:02,300
this is what we've been working on like

00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:04,430
very recently and I'm planning to finish

00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:06,440
it like next week because we really need

00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:08,960
it actually from someone from your team

00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:11,230
so they can contribute checks to checks

00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,230
to it

00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:33,060
yeah Denise you also do so please so

00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:37,980
I've been working to adapt escaped we

00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:40,410
have to reach the base image and Hajus

00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:46,560
tree that have peed at home and

00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:48,120
hopefully will so do the grunt tool that

00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:50,490
we used to deny the manifest list

00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:52,850
doesn't support the authentication

00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:57,240
method of our registry so we have to

00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:59,400
work on that and I'll try to work on

00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,830
that next week and I hope by the end of

00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:05,970
this month we'll have at least the base

00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:10,290
image for me triage on the registry yeah

00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:14,130
they are already on docker hub but it's

00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:16,500
using actually it doesn't even depend

00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:18,630
from fedora info I think it's another

00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:22,700
team that pushed those to do docker hub

00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:22,700
we just ping them and they are blatant

00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:31,530
and yeah yeah but they asked from what I

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,920
understood they asked someone else to do

00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:39,120
it I think also more indeed a change and

00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:42,540
we started to the plan is to to start to

00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:45,360
push the wide image every every day the

00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:49,460
Horde void base base image on the

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,460
registry every day so you have a fresh

00:18:54,900 --> 00:19:00,940
so the always be is that is currently

00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:05,320
deployed in partition support rebuild

00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:10,810
when the base image change is not

00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:14,890
enabled yet I can look at this also yeah

00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:22,930
we have the latest OS BS in fedora in

00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:29,350
production now so we atomic reactor is

00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:31,060
311 I think now so I think some of the

00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:32,170
nice thing I don't know if you if you

00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:35,020
went for the new features

00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:37,210
not quite the nice thing where I think

00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:39,820
we can use is the automatic release bump

00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:42,820
so we don't have to manage the released

00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:45,850
label in the docker files when you

00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:48,760
trigger build always be just take care

00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:50,470
of it so that's quite nice and then

00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:54,760
automatically build when the base image

00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:57,580
is updated I think that's like the two

00:19:54,760 --> 00:20:08,350
main features that we can we can try to

00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:10,450
involve soon I guess the second one will

00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:12,160
be will be really handy when rebuilding

00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:19,270
images you just push the new base image

00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:22,710
and then we can look at automating so we

00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:25,000
supposed to release new ways image and

00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:27,730
layered image every two weeks but we

00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,220
haven't been really good at that

00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:32,980
mostly because part of the time of SBS

00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:36,610
was broken and we were busy with other

00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:41,020
things so the idea is to try to automate

00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:42,910
that as much as possible and use fan

00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:48,190
message to trigger the rebuild the

00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:51,610
release and we are we shouldn't be too

00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:54,790
far from having container updates in

00:20:51,610 --> 00:21:01,020
body also so that without making the

00:20:54,790 --> 00:21:01,020
other it is more more friendly

00:21:04,649 --> 00:21:13,720
so I would like to I know that Yaqoob

00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:17,230
has been doing some work on PowerPC 64

00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:20,559
le but we'll be chatting in boxes in the

00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:24,010
info I think the plan was to reuse some

00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:27,750
of the Builder of PowerPC 64 because

00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:32,350
there would be discontinuing away in f29

00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:32,860
but I would like also 12a arts 64 for

00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:37,950
IOT

00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:37,950
I think his domain is the main target so

00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:46,149
but will come last I guess I think they

00:21:43,659 --> 00:21:48,639
I'm not opposed to of anything it's just

00:21:46,149 --> 00:21:50,830
a matter of priority and I don't think

00:21:48,639 --> 00:21:59,019
we will be able to deploy them all

00:21:50,830 --> 00:22:00,880
together and resources yeah so yeah okay

00:21:59,019 --> 00:22:05,940
so yeah we might not have a lot of

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,940
resources for s 390x

00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:21,500
yeah I think yeah well in my head at

00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:23,510
least and if people have a request and

00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:26,030
things on overwatch is more important

00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:33,410
they have just please tell me and I'm

00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:37,100
happy to accommodate another few thing

00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:38,000
if we want to talk what do you have

00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:42,260
available

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,330
of a project to show not all so I guess

00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:48,130
we can finish think about automation

00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:48,130
then we can talk about the container see

00:22:53,560 --> 00:23:01,220
ok so so this was the first boat for

00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:05,810
like checking healthiness of docker

00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:08,090
files or actually contain VG's then we

00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:10,130
have another boat which actually took a

00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:12,980
lot time to do because it was not so

00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:17,120
trivial as we thought originally is that

00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:19,760
usually people have their like content

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,830
image sources in the upstream and then

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,900
they just pull it to downstream to

00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:26,900
fedora for example or internally to Red

00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:30,050
Hat and then try to build their contemn

00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:32,240
yuji's from it but still they do all the

00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:35,420
hard work in the upstream in open source

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:37,970
so for that we have both name vodka and

00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:39,590
vodka actually sinks the files from

00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:42,880
upstream to downstream so you could do

00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:42,880
wanna talk about a little bit more

00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:54,690
as I said I don't have any demo I could

00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,580
just maybe show you read me from the

00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:59,280
private repository since you can't

00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:00,420
access it yourself who wants to see the

00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:14,340
readme nobody

00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:18,840
ok so software collections I see our org

00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:24,240
has their repositories on github living

00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:30,470
and yeah we use better controlled it so

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:34,440
it checks the configuration says what

00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:36,210
like downstream repositories wants to

00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:39,090
check our wants to be synched with

00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:41,610
upstream and so it vertically checks the

00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:45,600
up the repositories and once it found

00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:49,010
some new commits it makes poor request

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:51,810
in bagger and I think it also sent some

00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:56,190
notification email that there is this

00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:59,010
poor quest opened and I think we are

00:24:56,190 --> 00:25:01,830
planning to change it to like using

00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:04,710
github deferred message so it uses

00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:06,060
notifications and not checking

00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:11,970
periodically upstreams

00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:15,870
and I think that that's all yes probably

00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:21,000
the most like the most tricky tricky

00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:23,940
thing is to is to actually like how do

00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,800
you configure this thing because ok so

00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:28,710
you have some boat running inside of

00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:31,710
infrastructure and then you want people

00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:33,810
to be easily able to tell the boat that

00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:36,120
okay this is my upstream repo this is my

00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:37,770
downstream repo and for example this is

00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:40,500
some configuration which files should be

00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:42,630
copied but how do you make the boat

00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:44,610
aware of this configuration without

00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:46,530
without restarting it or something like

00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:49,520
that and I don't think we actually

00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:49,520
figured out that

00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:59,170
yes yes it could but still like the boat

00:25:57,310 --> 00:26:00,940
needs to discover the configuration

00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:03,210
first so it's like a chicken and egg

00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:03,210
problem

00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:28,820
it's actually a really good idea so okay

00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:31,909
so there'll be a message like there's a

00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:33,919
new like new commit and a specific file

00:26:31,909 --> 00:26:36,409
but we will need to parse like every

00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:46,640
single message and like filter it

00:26:36,409 --> 00:26:49,070
somehow or you can you can actually trim

00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:52,130
down I think that message across is just

00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:59,029
like saying but with where books you can

00:26:52,130 --> 00:27:00,919
choose but but we but we will need to

00:26:59,029 --> 00:27:05,830
probably enable it for all the like

00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:05,830
container related repositories but

00:27:11,789 --> 00:27:17,879
you could check with pingu if we can

00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:22,550
laughs so I grabbed namespaced based way

00:27:17,879 --> 00:27:28,040
books on fan message

00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:29,960
yeah sounds really good and if you

00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:32,360
realize like how powerful powerful this

00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:34,280
is like you can have your maintainer

00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,590
work on the upstream a positive and

00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,760
whenever they create a pull request

00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:40,010
upstream they can easily you can easily

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,990
sink it downstream and like try to

00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:45,380
integrate it into the distribution and

00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:47,570
see how it goes and basically report the

00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:49,130
results back to upstream so they get

00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:51,470
feedback right away as they are working

00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:55,100
on a new feature or something like that

00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:57,350
so yeah so this is something very

00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:59,090
interesting and I'm really wondering if

00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:03,590
this is like also good for fedora

00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:05,810
because for example as you talked about

00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:07,730
software collections they actually have

00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:09,520
all of their images on their github

00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:12,050
repository

00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:14,420
organization and they even most of the

00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:16,790
repositories expect a docker files for

00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:19,270
Federer so it could be really

00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:19,270
interesting

00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,549
we agree

00:28:35,419 --> 00:28:41,429
yes so does this comment is whether

00:28:38,789 --> 00:28:44,909
there is some like dueling or some like

00:28:41,429 --> 00:29:00,479
that to create container images out of

00:28:44,909 --> 00:29:02,279
modules is it correct like 95 96 each

00:29:00,479 --> 00:29:05,749
one would be intern module and then you

00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:08,460
create containers based on those modules

00:29:05,749 --> 00:29:16,440
so I'll probably have like two answers

00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:18,029
for that so ya know so back in the day

00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:20,820
our team was actually working for

00:29:18,029 --> 00:29:23,489
modularity team so like all three of us

00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:25,409
and this was actually one of the cards

00:29:23,489 --> 00:29:27,719
we are trying to figure it out how could

00:29:25,409 --> 00:29:30,239
we automatically generate docker files

00:29:27,719 --> 00:29:33,330
or even images from modules but we are

00:29:30,239 --> 00:29:35,940
not able to finish it or like complete

00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:38,190
it because the issue is metadata you

00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:40,889
need to put all the metadata into module

00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:43,830
MD and then generate the co file out of

00:29:40,889 --> 00:29:45,839
it which sounds kind of ok but then you

00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:47,820
would have specific metadata to the

00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:50,849
container images which would not be

00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:53,399
relevant for other artifacts and we were

00:29:50,849 --> 00:29:55,859
not able to like come to a conclusion

00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:58,669
like how this metadata would be stored

00:29:55,859 --> 00:29:58,669
inside so

00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:10,510
back to just something the classic

00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:10,510
model

00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:22,480
and there there look

00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:33,750
so you already have files inside the

00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:37,550
module dis gate which are related to

00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:37,550
flood packs aha

00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:49,570
well so we could directly crate the

00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:53,370
containers plane we could directly

00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:53,370
create the containers from the module

00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:02,480
I mean the other way

00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,480
well

00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:17,070
there is

00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,970
you can say

00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:43,620
the way

00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:46,250
take containers and black backs

00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:46,250
completely out

00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:53,340
essentially there is a young lingo that

00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,340
gets created somewhere

00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:58,970
[Music]

00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:31,729
[Music]

00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:41,700
[Music]

00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:49,350
there's yeah there's that workflow had

00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,860
No

00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:58,280
Devon

00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:06,540
yeah

00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:08,679
however that was that was like your

00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:16,379
though you were saying with

00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:16,379
was the thing yes yes exactly

00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,990
where the dockerfile

00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,910
so like one way would be to store that

00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,340
along with

00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:34,080
spec followed whatever else and you are

00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:37,520
peon

00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,230
right there in the park campus

00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:40,500
being a separate biscuit it's

00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:43,050
theoretically

00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:44,520
people who maintain the rpm might not

00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:45,990
want to create a painter but there's

00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,360
somebody else that wants to create a

00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:51,470
container out of it

00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:53,290
they came facility side you know the

00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:59,520
pervert

00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:59,520
that modules in container 1

00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:10,279
you know provide that might like

00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,700
for what

00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:38,970
but anyway we are definitely not in like

00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:40,500
not planning to do this so like dusty or

00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:42,180
others if you are interested in doing

00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:44,490
this you should probably reach out to

00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:46,290
model RT team and maybe discuss with

00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:48,600
them because this was already on the

00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:52,050
plate but we just were not able to

00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:53,580
execute so maybe this time around when /

00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:55,130
and figure out how to do this for flat

00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:58,910
backs we could do it similarly for

00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:58,910
container images as well

00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:12,789
yeah absolutely so I actually wrote a

00:35:10,539 --> 00:35:14,530
blog post about that on Federer magazine

00:35:12,789 --> 00:35:17,109
that it's actually really beneficial to

00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:18,880
use modules and specific versions inside

00:35:17,109 --> 00:35:20,890
condom images and then we could easily

00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,930
solve the problem that hey we have this

00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:25,890
container image but what is the version

00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:28,480
of MySQL inside so we can easily tag it

00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:31,270
but we probably just need to do the

00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,000
final steps here or maybe have the

00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:44,680
content actually the modules themselves

00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:47,500
version okay so I won't spoil anything

00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:49,900
so we have another boat and I actually

00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:51,849
spoilt already so if you already have a

00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:53,680
full requesting beggar you can easily

00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:55,990
create a scratch build out of it right

00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:58,410
so the music I want to talk about it a

00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:58,410
bit more

00:36:08,229 --> 00:36:17,420
actually it was kind of inspired by

00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:20,589
removal so Sonia now can react on Borah

00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:23,920
quests and changes in polar quests and

00:36:20,589 --> 00:36:27,170
create scratch-built

00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:30,890
we had some problem with it and I think

00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:32,900
it will be resolved soon because I don't

00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:36,200
know how it works in federal but

00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:39,410
internally we couldn't trigger trigger

00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:41,839
script builds on um Forks because we

00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:46,729
don't have we didn't have branch that

00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:50,180
would be like usable from from from

00:36:46,729 --> 00:36:55,339
building tools so so we were actually

00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:57,680
able to push the change push people to

00:36:55,339 --> 00:37:03,529
make the change so we can make builds on

00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:08,779
on on Forks and it will be updating our

00:37:03,529 --> 00:37:13,630
quests with flux that will tell about

00:37:08,779 --> 00:37:13,630
the result of the material let's see

00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:24,380
since we have something similar for our

00:37:21,769 --> 00:37:27,019
PM's there is some service listening and

00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:29,180
trying to discourage built-in Koji I'm

00:37:27,019 --> 00:37:31,400
not sure if we would be able to like

00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:34,339
unified to have like single code base to

00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:38,960
do both I don't know if anyone of you

00:37:34,339 --> 00:37:40,729
know how this works for our PMS god this

00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:45,559
place is pretty much specific for our

00:37:40,729 --> 00:37:49,670
PMS using fat pockets I I did at the

00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:53,140
roof Avenue because I wanted to do it it

00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:53,140
wasn't very trivial work

00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:06,330
yeah it's worth it's worth like getting

00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:11,240
the two code base in 20 remember the

00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:14,790
Kaji taught me well it's good

00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:17,340
could you see yeah yeah it was called

00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:20,400
son like this courtesy I oh yeah it's

00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:22,950
pretty specific to to up here mmm-hmm

00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:26,720
yeah maybe Indian doesn't make sense to

00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:26,720
so merge them with just an idea

00:38:44,369 --> 00:38:47,119
you know

00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:15,519
okay so we have next item which is most

00:39:12,789 --> 00:39:17,920
last one for the automation part and

00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:21,279
that's something how our boats are

00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,749
running actually so they are so I don't

00:39:21,279 --> 00:39:23,199
know Dominica you want to talk about it

00:39:22,749 --> 00:39:30,400
or

00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:34,509
Eirik oh okay so we have these boats

00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:37,599
travel no but Castle Ania and we have

00:39:34,509 --> 00:39:42,969
also this oho service which Rose them

00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:46,180
all and so they usually react on some

00:39:42,969 --> 00:39:51,640
other event on some message bus and this

00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:53,829
ho which is Czech word for year recent

00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:58,239
on this message bus and submits a task

00:39:53,829 --> 00:40:01,630
for these boats and it's that the task

00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:04,269
it's we use sorry for that so the boats

00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:06,219
listen on some queue and who submits the

00:40:04,269 --> 00:40:09,519
task since its interview and once the

00:40:06,219 --> 00:40:15,809
boats gets takes it from the queue and

00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:19,150
performs it and that's basically it and

00:40:15,809 --> 00:40:21,219
home for our BOTS I don't know what you

00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:26,440
meant with that so as you said they are

00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:30,180
mostly in our private repositories okay

00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,180
okay so I didn't write it either

00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:47,160
metaphorically I see this as a home like

00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:50,220
everyone that's there and we had also

00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:51,930
like Bodhi but we already spoke about it

00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,440
a little bit I'm not sure if we covered

00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:54,630
it all

00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:57,030
I know the dentist said that he would

00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:59,910
come but he then said that he needs to

00:40:57,030 --> 00:41:03,060
go to the infrastructure thing but what

00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:05,910
I was able to ask him in the meantime

00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:08,790
was that like the support is already in

00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:13,500
body to be able to release contain

00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:18,120
images so what we have so the code is in

00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:22,890
body the body server is configured to be

00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:28,020
able to push to the registry more

00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:30,720
uncreated releasing staging for f28

00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:33,900
containers I think or like so we have

00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:37,940
all the koji tags in place we just need

00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:40,260
to try so quickly tried last week but

00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:42,120
obviously didn't work first the first

00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:44,370
one didn't work so we need to

00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:48,140
investigate what's what's blocking there

00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:48,140
might be simple or not

00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:59,430
there is one thing we after it's more

00:41:54,270 --> 00:42:01,380
like process but we might want to try to

00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:06,530
think how we use body do we want to use

00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:09,540
it the same way as rpm so for example

00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:11,790
maybe we that we need to have lower

00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:18,690
requirements on camera or things like

00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:23,610
that that maybe most all our containers

00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:26,820
are using rpms so it might make sense to

00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:29,190
have like a lower bit the gate for four

00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:37,890
and so especially RPS from stable

00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:44,910
repository right yeah about the two

00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:49,740
weeks revealed so if we have this with

00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:53,160
in combination with an automatic rebuild

00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:55,910
of the layer image I would see that we

00:42:53,160 --> 00:43:00,570
would just rebuild the base image maybe

00:42:55,910 --> 00:43:04,770
like every two week so quickly and then

00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:12,180
always be s should rebuild all the layer

00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:14,580
image and create the body updates so

00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:17,160
some tooling would create the updates in

00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:19,320
body right and even attach the builds it

00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:20,640
would it would be it would be it would

00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:23,600
be nice to have the twelve that

00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,600
automated

00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:46,030
should be able to use fan message of

00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:48,610
Sofia maybe to to see whenever we got

00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:50,830
like when we have a new build for a

00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:53,110
continued image from former SBS we could

00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:57,870
have like a service that just listen fan

00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:57,870
messaging and create the body update

00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:05,300
[Music]

00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:22,100
you know okay so this is probably all

00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:27,700
for the automation so if you have any

00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:36,020
questions you can dress them and if not

00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:39,740
we can talk about the cig automation so

00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:42,890
currently that so the tour's output

00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:47,480
source but the way to one Dame yeah it

00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:49,670
isn't yeah yes so I think once we have

00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:52,130
them it's good opportunity to try to see

00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:54,200
how we can put them in infidel help and

00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:56,390
shift and that might be some good

00:44:54,200 --> 00:45:01,010
content for the sea and people to get

00:44:56,390 --> 00:45:03,590
involved to help us to like deployed

00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:06,369
that in a in fedora info I think you

00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:06,369
know it's really great

00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,760
[Music]

00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:29,170
[Music]

00:45:24,579 --> 00:45:32,890
oh I have one thing related to

00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:34,689
automation I guess not sure whether you

00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:38,650
solve it already because I missed the

00:45:34,689 --> 00:45:42,009
beginning so the register that is used

00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:45,670
for building is it still stable register

00:45:42,009 --> 00:45:48,309
or I believe that it should be possible

00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:50,259
to use the candidate against register

00:45:48,309 --> 00:45:52,179
for that because that would speed up the

00:45:50,259 --> 00:45:55,329
development or even without the ultra

00:45:52,179 --> 00:46:01,529
boats and stuff and he did do it like

00:45:55,329 --> 00:46:07,539
internal it's it's working okay so maybe

00:46:01,529 --> 00:46:09,039
open the ticket on the sig ya ayats in

00:46:07,539 --> 00:46:12,459
the atomic see yeah we can move it to

00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:14,559
the kinetic I think I it's just a

00:46:12,459 --> 00:46:18,699
configuration configuration change in

00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:23,849
you know SBS to do that so yeah we can

00:46:18,699 --> 00:46:23,849
go into to change that

00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:32,550
[Music]

00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:44,090
so do we talk about the sig like how

00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:46,070
would it work and it's probably not a

00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:48,950
good time there's probably many people

00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:52,010
in the room it's possible yes

00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:52,010
[Music]

00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:02,210
[Music]

00:47:10,269 --> 00:47:15,880
yeah yeah absolutely yeah it's really

00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:15,880
great idea dusty

00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:32,970
I'm not sure we need to

00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:35,720
because this party we

00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:38,720
discussion

00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:38,720
hmm

00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:03,760
so there isn't much caffeine in the sick

00:48:01,310 --> 00:48:03,760
because I

00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:11,300
I think

00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:15,740
yeah cool I just created pretty much the

00:48:14,059 --> 00:48:18,829
wiki page and I didn't want to put any

00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:20,960
kind of process or anything I think it's

00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:27,910
nicer if we decide together what we want

00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:33,020
to do we have also category on the new

00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:34,730
discussion dot federal project ugh where

00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:37,569
I try to put I think there are like

00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:37,569
currently two

00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:57,359
there are currently two topics there but

00:48:54,720 --> 00:49:04,410
I think it would be nice to use this

00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:06,779
instead of mailing list yeah that's the

00:49:04,410 --> 00:49:09,180
disco and you can log with you you can

00:49:06,779 --> 00:49:13,190
log in with your FAFSA console you don't

00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:13,190
need to have an extractant or anything

00:49:13,579 --> 00:49:21,150
it's just a bit more friendly for people

00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:26,729
to to use and like not buried as deep as

00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:32,489
mailing lists and so so I started fight

00:49:26,729 --> 00:49:34,920
on is he eating I'm not a big fan of

00:49:32,489 --> 00:49:38,999
having twenty thousand meetings per week

00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:44,249
so I wanted to see what people think

00:49:38,999 --> 00:49:49,099
about having a meeting and what if if we

00:49:44,249 --> 00:49:52,920
should have a meeting what would be the

00:49:49,099 --> 00:49:56,519
the pace of it so monthly every two

00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:58,469
months for every week I think we'd like

00:49:56,519 --> 00:50:00,479
a few comments about like having it

00:49:58,469 --> 00:50:04,289
maybe every every two weeks at the

00:50:00,479 --> 00:50:06,299
beginning so it's not like we just not

00:50:04,289 --> 00:50:08,249
meet and say oh I didn't have time to do

00:50:06,299 --> 00:50:12,589
anything in one week so the days

00:50:08,249 --> 00:50:17,759
actually some progress to do after

00:50:12,589 --> 00:50:22,039
organization wise I think I created on

00:50:17,759 --> 00:50:22,039
anti-gay group so

00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:48,720
which I'm currently the only person Hin

00:50:44,279 --> 00:50:51,210
but I see I see this group as being like

00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:53,549
if you're interested to join the seek

00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:55,319
just join the group on Peggy and you

00:50:53,549 --> 00:50:59,940
have like access on the tickets and

00:50:55,319 --> 00:51:04,230
everything and that would be the no week

00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:06,809
not yeah group member system so if

00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:09,299
people we can actually do this to now if

00:51:06,809 --> 00:51:15,049
people are interested to to join the cig

00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:18,480
and I can I can add you to the group and

00:51:15,049 --> 00:51:21,930
yeah we can I think what the ste said

00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:24,299
it's quite a good idea we can try to to

00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:26,130
list so I started on on Peggy I started

00:51:24,299 --> 00:51:29,759
to put some tickets we can maybe fill

00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:34,019
more tickets also on on what people

00:51:29,759 --> 00:51:38,069
actually want to want to try to do and

00:51:34,019 --> 00:51:40,559
maybe what they think the come to how

00:51:38,069 --> 00:51:46,589
they think the container effort infidel

00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:47,920
should should look like and that would

00:51:46,589 --> 00:51:50,939
be a good start I think

00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,939
[Music]

00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:59,640
no configure together

00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:25,500
so I actually have one question for

00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:25,500
dusty after he finishes writing

00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:42,410
like what's the future of atomic working

00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:44,599
Europe in federal know literally atomic

00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:47,630
working or like when it's gonna be like

00:52:44,599 --> 00:52:51,979
shut down and how and like what's gonna

00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:54,049
happen okay so it's probably not the

00:52:51,979 --> 00:52:56,029
good time to start moving issues from

00:52:54,049 --> 00:53:02,229
atomic working up to the other working

00:52:56,029 --> 00:53:02,229
groups I know do we want to do it okay

00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:39,690
yeah it sounds like a girl I mean this

00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:41,519
was actually my original intention to

00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:43,289
sit around the round table but there's

00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:52,349
just so many people that will be able to

00:53:43,289 --> 00:53:54,779
think one yeah like yeah so the question

00:53:52,349 --> 00:53:58,200
is about the atomic working group and

00:53:54,779 --> 00:54:03,329
kind of what's the future there I think

00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:06,029
that the sooner that we basically start

00:54:03,329 --> 00:54:08,549
the Container sig and obviously that's

00:54:06,029 --> 00:54:12,750
kind of what we're here today for the

00:54:08,549 --> 00:54:14,760
better mainly because we're not having

00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:16,349
regular meetings for the atomic working

00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:17,819
group anymore because we've started kind

00:54:16,349 --> 00:54:21,150
of working on the Fedora core or less

00:54:17,819 --> 00:54:23,490
stuff and Lamont showed up to the Fedora

00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:25,440
core OS meetings and was like hey are we

00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:27,480
interested in discussing containers here

00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:29,549
like we did in the atomic working group

00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:32,640
or should do we think it's worth having

00:54:29,549 --> 00:54:35,490
our own you know special interest group

00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:38,099
for containers I personally think is you

00:54:35,490 --> 00:54:40,980
know in the best interest of you know

00:54:38,099 --> 00:54:42,390
the container space being healthy for

00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:44,339
people to be able to show up to

00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:46,200
something that is focused specifically

00:54:44,339 --> 00:54:48,420
on what they care about somebody might

00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:50,460
care about containers that cares nothing

00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:53,099
about an immutable operating system

00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:54,779
right so that was one thing that we

00:54:53,099 --> 00:54:57,150
noticed in the atomic working group was

00:54:54,779 --> 00:54:58,829
people would show up we talked in a

00:54:57,150 --> 00:55:00,900
meeting for 45 minutes about something

00:54:58,829 --> 00:55:02,460
they didn't care about or we wouldn't

00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:04,710
get around to a topic at all that they

00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:07,319
cared about so you know they might not

00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:09,720
show up as much so the recommendation

00:55:07,319 --> 00:55:12,029
was you know let's see if there's

00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:14,720
interest for a container cig and he put

00:55:12,029 --> 00:55:17,309
out an email and obviously got a lot of

00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:21,029
responses back which I was like you know

00:55:17,309 --> 00:55:23,400
super happy about so I you know I think

00:55:21,029 --> 00:55:26,309
obviously he's already made a repo not

00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:27,839
the one we're looking at right now but

00:55:26,309 --> 00:55:29,519
he's already made a repo where we can

00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:31,529
kind of organize a little bit and kind

00:55:29,519 --> 00:55:33,450
of choose you know if we want to do a

00:55:31,529 --> 00:55:37,170
weekly meeting or bi-weekly or something

00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:40,140
like that and actually have people sign

00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:42,559
up there and we can organize that way on

00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:49,759
the container sig

00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:54,449
grupe repo I just started a new issue

00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:58,469
there's like hey you know if you are

00:55:54,449 --> 00:56:01,170
interested in like being a part of this

00:55:58,469 --> 00:56:02,759
you know just add a comment here that

00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:04,229
way it's really easy because like

00:56:02,759 --> 00:56:05,430
sometimes people come up to you and

00:56:04,229 --> 00:56:09,209
you're like hey I'd like to be involved

00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:11,160
in the group but like their name Maps

00:56:09,209 --> 00:56:13,259
nothing to their fast ID or something

00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:15,959
like that and so if you just come in

00:56:13,259 --> 00:56:18,059
here you know exactly what their best

00:56:15,959 --> 00:56:19,380
ideas if you mouse over their name it

00:56:18,059 --> 00:56:21,749
tells you what their name is or at least

00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:28,229
what they prefer to be called in fedora

00:56:21,749 --> 00:56:31,799
so if you go to the Container sig slash

00:56:28,229 --> 00:56:35,190
container cig Packer repo and just add a

00:56:31,799 --> 00:56:37,650
comment to issue number three you know

00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:40,019
that lets Clement know you're interested

00:56:37,650 --> 00:56:41,489
he knows you're fast ID already if you

00:56:40,019 --> 00:56:44,789
want to add a comment saying why you're

00:56:41,489 --> 00:56:47,369
interested that might help too but as

00:56:44,789 --> 00:56:49,910
far as migrating stuff away from like

00:56:47,369 --> 00:56:53,369
the atomic working group issue tracker I

00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:55,499
think he may have already had it up but

00:56:53,369 --> 00:56:58,229
there's a bunch of issues labeled

00:56:55,499 --> 00:57:00,209
containers some of them are related to

00:56:58,229 --> 00:57:02,969
container runtimes a lot of them are

00:57:00,209 --> 00:57:05,969
related to application containers some

00:57:02,969 --> 00:57:08,039
of them are related to like governance

00:57:05,969 --> 00:57:10,920
like you know guidelines and stuff like

00:57:08,039 --> 00:57:14,009
that probably half of these things could

00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:17,400
be just not migrated I I'd probably

00:57:14,009 --> 00:57:19,349
encourage you to use some judgement I'm

00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:21,739
not sure we could probably talk to pingu

00:57:19,349 --> 00:57:26,039
and see if there's like an easy way to

00:57:21,739 --> 00:57:31,130
migrate a bunch of issues over and there

00:57:26,039 --> 00:57:31,130
is okay it's a get repo

00:57:31,930 --> 00:57:37,770
right yeah I didn't know if there'd be

00:57:33,789 --> 00:57:37,770
like some automated tooling or anything

00:57:41,819 --> 00:57:54,250
yeah company from one tagger repo to

00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:56,980
another cool yeah so something like that

00:57:54,250 --> 00:58:00,119
might be useful if you want to go

00:57:56,980 --> 00:58:02,559
through individual tickets at some point

00:58:00,119 --> 00:58:04,210
we can do that I mean like we could do

00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:05,859
that today theoretically I don't know if

00:58:04,210 --> 00:58:08,079
that's the best use of everybody's time

00:58:05,859 --> 00:58:14,619
here today or not

00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:17,410
so definitely open to ideas right well

00:58:14,619 --> 00:58:19,089
yeah well it also depends you know if

00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:21,069
people are planning to stay here the

00:58:19,089 --> 00:58:24,819
whole time or go to another session

00:58:21,069 --> 00:58:26,890
which I think oh actually oh yeah I've

00:58:24,819 --> 00:58:29,200
got another session or another thing at

00:58:26,890 --> 00:58:34,900
3:30 definitely I'm not sure about this

00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:42,910
current time period but yeah so yeah

00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:45,099
yeah that works ok cool is there anybody

00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:50,289
here today that's interested in the

00:58:45,099 --> 00:58:53,140
container sig that you know yeah nice oh

00:58:50,289 --> 00:58:54,730
that like you know has a specific thing

00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:57,010
that they're looking to get out of it

00:58:54,730 --> 00:58:59,349
right has like you know not many people

00:58:57,010 --> 00:59:01,390
do things in open source without wanting

00:58:59,349 --> 00:59:04,450
something out of it that's what makes it

00:59:01,390 --> 00:59:06,849
work you are by nature selfish you want

00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:09,549
to achieve a goal this is why you were

00:59:06,849 --> 00:59:11,829
helping right you know like I think

00:59:09,549 --> 00:59:13,029
everybody's you know doing it out of the

00:59:11,829 --> 00:59:16,960
goodness of their own heart but that

00:59:13,029 --> 00:59:18,730
doesn't last over time so like is there

00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:20,740
anybody here that like has a particular

00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:24,099
thing or a particular agenda they want

00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:27,010
to advance we know Dennis wants multi

00:59:24,099 --> 00:59:31,329
art really hard so we're happy about

00:59:27,010 --> 00:59:32,799
that but is there any multi Arts for

00:59:31,329 --> 00:59:34,839
YouTube okay

00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:39,029
but is there anybody here like you know

00:59:34,839 --> 00:59:39,029
from the community Chris

00:59:43,450 --> 00:59:52,099
gotcha so we've got Christian here and

00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:54,020
he wants to learn how to get some

00:59:52,099 --> 00:59:55,700
applications within fedora that he cares

00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:56,990
about packaged in containers so that he

00:59:55,700 --> 01:00:03,470
can use them as containers which is

00:59:56,990 --> 01:00:06,760
awesome it's a great reason this might

01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:08,780
be a wider community thing well I think

01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:10,750
currently if you want to package a

01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:13,070
container you have to be a packager and

01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:15,320
out currently yes yeah

01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:18,230
which is which is I think that was

01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:20,599
mostly because that was the easiest

01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:22,250
thing to implement yeah right which is

01:00:20,599 --> 01:00:24,410
not necessarily good because like

01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:26,990
somebody might be a great container

01:00:24,410 --> 01:00:31,490
package or that never ended are for

01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:32,570
example if I take my case I much prefer

01:00:31,490 --> 01:00:35,240
doing

01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:37,790
Doka files and I would be much more

01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:41,089
interested in packaging containers than

01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:43,099
the RPMs it's just like like personal

01:00:41,089 --> 01:00:45,080
interests I think it's maybe so I know

01:00:43,099 --> 01:00:53,270
that now we can push through these gates

01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:55,730
using Fox and edged HTTP HTTP so it

01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:56,450
might be also a good good time to and we

01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:59,359
actually do that

01:00:56,450 --> 01:01:01,400
yeah he's been deployed last week or so

01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:03,800
like before if they do a fork and they

01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:05,420
make a commit locally and they want to

01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:08,540
push it you can do a pull request now

01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:11,599
yeah you don't have to do it from like

01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:13,490
another pulley question you can just but

01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:15,470
it you said over HTTP so it doesn't work

01:01:13,490 --> 01:01:17,359
as I say cheeky you have to like push

01:01:15,470 --> 01:01:19,460
and then like login with your faz

01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:22,580
username a user ID and password

01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:24,530
I haven't tried them either way that's

01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:26,150
you know we had the we have the pull

01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:28,130
request model now but if you're not a

01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:31,940
package or you can actually you can do

01:01:28,130 --> 01:01:35,089
pull requests oh yeah I'm not sure what

01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:37,010
to use experience but you can you can do

01:01:35,089 --> 01:01:39,800
pull request as non package oh now so

01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:42,790
nice that's maybe one thing we want to

01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:45,800
do or we want also to consider having

01:01:42,790 --> 01:01:47,180
like container maintain them all right

01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:52,940
yeah so the

01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:54,950
take away from that as we may want to we

01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:57,380
may want to lower the barrier to entry

01:01:54,950 --> 01:02:00,530
for kin for people who want to do

01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:03,440
containers to not have to have them be

01:02:00,530 --> 01:02:07,190
in the package or group first so we make

01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:08,750
like a new container or group now that's

01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:13,490
a bad name but you know what I'm saying

01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:15,650
yeah yeah but yeah so I think that'd be

01:02:13,490 --> 01:02:17,930
a great you know thing for the working

01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:20,589
group to pick up and like consider as an

01:02:17,930 --> 01:02:23,569
agenda they look they'd like a push

01:02:20,589 --> 01:02:25,609
because I'm sure that's a barrier to

01:02:23,569 --> 01:02:27,349
entry for people it's like of course I'd

01:02:25,609 --> 01:02:31,309
love to have this because like I already

01:02:27,349 --> 01:02:32,990
you know maybe the maintainer of said

01:02:31,309 --> 01:02:35,720
package that I want to use in a

01:02:32,990 --> 01:02:37,940
container you know is a great maintainer

01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:39,950
for the RPM but has no interest in

01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:42,410
running as a container so they're not

01:02:39,950 --> 01:02:44,270
going to do the work to like you know

01:02:42,410 --> 01:02:47,540
create a docker file or whatever else

01:02:44,270 --> 01:02:49,579
for it but I would love to but I'm not a

01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:53,170
packager right so like that would that

01:02:49,579 --> 01:02:53,170
would be great I love that

01:03:00,470 --> 01:03:03,610
[Music]

01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:10,880
it would be good to have like a wider my

01:03:08,930 --> 01:03:14,750
people that are not put present there

01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:16,340
isn't to have that input also so yeah

01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:19,100
that could probably easily be like a

01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:20,440
topic for folks I would say for a first

01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:23,720
meeting but that wouldn't make sense

01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:25,880
necessarily what hey we're gonna meet to

01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:39,800
talk about when we're gonna meet except

01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:41,600
when should we meet to do that or is it

01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:47,000
we just we were just doing this course

01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:50,090
or so we have a mailing list but I I

01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:51,560
personally don't like to have to look at

01:03:50,090 --> 01:03:54,410
two different places to get information

01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:56,810
right so I'm not opposed we have the

01:03:54,410 --> 01:03:58,910
mailing list so we can use it but if it

01:03:56,810 --> 01:04:00,680
would be nice to have just like at least

01:03:58,910 --> 01:04:03,380
there's a clear message we already have

01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:04,730
like the tickets in pygar so there would

01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:06,020
be all you have to go and check in

01:04:04,730 --> 01:04:08,090
package you have to do any checking

01:04:06,020 --> 01:04:10,310
right here would be my suggestion and

01:04:08,090 --> 01:04:13,250
more or less create an issue in packer

01:04:10,310 --> 01:04:15,230
we have a sig packer now and then draw

01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:18,020
attention to it from other places yeah

01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:19,370
so like if you have a mailing list send

01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:20,630
out a message on the mailing list that

01:04:19,370 --> 01:04:22,970
says hey I want to draw your attention

01:04:20,630 --> 01:04:25,220
to you know helping us decide our

01:04:22,970 --> 01:04:27,440
meeting time can you comment over in

01:04:25,220 --> 01:04:28,610
Packer so I don't have the don't have

01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:30,260
the conversation on the mailing list

01:04:28,610 --> 01:04:32,990
let's have the conversation over here

01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:35,570
there's a single place for that and then

01:04:32,990 --> 01:04:36,980
maybe even seen that Bell list so people

01:04:35,570 --> 01:04:39,620
who haven't yet signed up for the

01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:41,990
Container sig mailing list also get that

01:04:39,620 --> 01:04:44,270
information except both of those are

01:04:41,990 --> 01:04:46,340
funnels into the correct place to have

01:04:44,270 --> 01:04:47,690
the conversation so that would be my

01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:49,340
suggestion and you'll probably get a

01:04:47,690 --> 01:04:51,350
pretty good idea when to have the first

01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:52,700
meeting and then people can show up at

01:04:51,350 --> 01:04:56,090
the first meeting and say this meeting

01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:57,990
time sucks let's change it so I think

01:04:56,090 --> 01:05:03,589
that should work pretty well

01:04:57,990 --> 01:05:03,589
well yeah when is good yeah that's true

01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:18,630
yeah yeah yeah that's something we're

01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:20,910
trying to work through in the Fedora

01:05:18,630 --> 01:05:23,609
chorus working group too because like we

01:05:20,910 --> 01:05:26,760
have mailing lists we have discourse we

01:05:23,609 --> 01:05:30,780
have Packer you know kind of the

01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:34,380
guidelines that we are floating towards

01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:36,690
over there is this course is kind of

01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:40,109
like a forum so like to me that you know

01:05:36,690 --> 01:05:42,990
a user says hey I'm trying to do XYZ and

01:05:40,109 --> 01:05:48,089
I'm hitting a problem so like more user

01:05:42,990 --> 01:05:52,020
facing stuff and the Packer tracker is

01:05:48,089 --> 01:05:54,900
more like hey you know should we change

01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:56,790
the root filesystem to XYZ right so like

01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:58,829
more design type stuff or like

01:05:56,790 --> 01:06:00,900
governance type stuff and then the

01:05:58,829 --> 01:06:02,640
mailing list is like announcements or

01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:04,380
drawing your attention to something else

01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:10,130
where we can't have discussions there

01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:13,049
but you know obviously people aren't as

01:06:10,130 --> 01:06:14,880
interested in following mailing lists as

01:06:13,049 --> 01:06:16,559
much as they used to be so like we're

01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:19,400
trying to explore different avenues for

01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:19,400
for different things

01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:25,490
I'm gonna stop talking now

01:06:36,530 --> 01:06:39,430
Aarthi

01:06:45,869 --> 01:06:51,030
there's always someone

01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:51,030
I think I see

01:06:52,970 --> 01:06:54,970
Oh

01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:06,490
beautiful thing this

01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:12,810
so yep during this channel

01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:22,509
tutorials or sunset the ultimate IRC

01:07:20,089 --> 01:07:22,509
channel

01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:31,050
yeah so the Potomac IRC channel really

01:07:55,490 --> 01:07:59,920
I guess you could theoretically brought

01:07:57,050 --> 01:07:59,920
like a pack

01:08:12,410 --> 01:08:15,520
[Music]

01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:31,180
like I imagined

01:08:42,609 --> 01:08:45,780
things that you would

01:08:49,290 --> 01:08:51,799
I think

01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,170
what is the Delta

01:09:05,599 --> 01:09:08,049
who

01:09:08,380 --> 01:09:11,410
so I

01:09:21,799 --> 01:09:28,690
obviously this

01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:38,660
but there are some people

01:09:39,730 --> 01:09:42,969
they go

01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:50,400
or

01:10:30,140 --> 01:10:32,170
Oh

01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:50,950
and it seemed crazy things like they

01:10:48,170 --> 01:10:50,950
turned out to be bad

01:11:16,429 --> 01:11:18,969
right

01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:37,960
yes

01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:45,730
so I interpreted the faculty

01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:05,949
so the idea here was

01:12:15,530 --> 01:12:18,640
maybe let's see

01:12:21,269 --> 01:12:24,170
Express

01:13:16,530 --> 01:13:19,670
issues is very

01:13:55,409 --> 01:13:58,409
blame

01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:02,270
[Music]

01:14:11,700 --> 01:14:18,680
I would also like to see

01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:23,560
to help me

01:14:28,220 --> 01:14:31,220
nice

01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:20,310
so do we want to discuss like the focus

01:15:18,630 --> 01:15:23,070
of the working group in detail

01:15:20,310 --> 01:15:25,850
maybe the responsibility or just like

01:15:23,070 --> 01:15:25,850
otoscope

01:16:00,230 --> 01:16:03,230
01:16:04,570 --> 01:16:07,110
then

01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:10,880
so it's instantly

01:17:10,969 --> 01:17:18,230
it's been what

01:17:14,090 --> 01:17:18,230
but I think that it's like

01:17:18,349 --> 01:17:21,609
a lot of you

01:17:26,860 --> 01:17:32,559
and previously

01:17:29,719 --> 01:17:32,559
process

01:17:34,889 --> 01:17:39,080
your estimate these

01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:53,970
things like that

01:18:00,010 --> 01:18:03,000
yeah the process must be

01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:13,430
yeah it is was it was we got some

01:18:17,550 --> 01:18:23,010
so one thing actually I wanted to

01:18:19,590 --> 01:18:24,990
discuss is that we are probably aware of

01:18:23,010 --> 01:18:27,920
the repository which is projected to

01:18:24,990 --> 01:18:31,290
make slash container image labels

01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:34,680
something like very long repository name

01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:37,310
and it's the home of like definitions of

01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:40,410
labels like what label should be put on

01:18:37,310 --> 01:18:42,870
images but unfortunately it's not

01:18:40,410 --> 01:18:45,630
maintained anymore pretty much I mean I

01:18:42,870 --> 01:18:49,250
open issue and sit there for months and

01:18:45,630 --> 01:18:51,840
the one response so as far as I remember

01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:54,320
originally or a lot maintained was

01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:59,130
supposed to be our our only way to come

01:18:54,320 --> 01:19:01,110
but so yeah my question is like what do

01:18:59,130 --> 01:19:03,600
we do about it like do we still follow

01:19:01,110 --> 01:19:08,060
the repository with guidelines for

01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:08,060
labels or do we just like

01:19:08,290 --> 01:19:11,479
[Music]

01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:20,100
yep

01:19:24,449 --> 01:19:27,170
really

01:19:43,149 --> 01:19:48,829
the other option is paid

01:19:45,689 --> 01:19:48,829
what's the status we'll be late

01:19:58,280 --> 01:20:01,360
No

01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:03,940
he's talking about the project

01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:07,830
but basically we pooled some definitions

01:20:03,940 --> 01:20:07,830
from another

01:20:12,969 --> 01:20:16,750
typically some labels

01:20:22,550 --> 01:20:25,809
is this very personal

01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:40,600
they

01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:55,310
yeah I agree so so it's definitely not

01:20:53,450 --> 01:20:57,950
up-to-date because for example this

01:20:55,310 --> 01:21:00,590
repository suggest to some labels

01:20:57,950 --> 01:21:02,450
related to open ship but Appa ship

01:21:00,590 --> 01:21:05,240
doesn't consume them anymore so they are

01:21:02,450 --> 01:21:08,540
like deprecated or even should not be

01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:10,400
used because users might get my idea

01:21:08,540 --> 01:21:14,180
that oppa ship you're consuming but we

01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:16,220
do not it could be even harmful so yeah

01:21:14,180 --> 01:21:18,680
so I opened a bunch of issues and no one

01:21:16,220 --> 01:21:20,270
responded so I think that like this

01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:21,500
circles there is no longer maintained

01:21:20,270 --> 01:21:23,420
and we should probably figure out what

01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:26,200
to do about this

01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:26,200
- I made

01:21:27,559 --> 01:21:36,070
the beginning of a circus I think that

01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:36,070
that should be the athletics

01:21:39,330 --> 01:21:41,960
maybe even a

01:21:42,679 --> 01:21:49,460
this maintaining the to maybe have an

01:21:46,380 --> 01:21:53,480
easy access for people to connect with

01:21:49,460 --> 01:21:56,900
if it can be in the tulipe is the best

01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:59,470
my personal view

01:21:56,900 --> 01:21:59,470
please

01:22:00,110 --> 01:22:03,280
[Music]

01:22:11,780 --> 01:22:15,100
is this

01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:24,550
because there

01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:54,480
yeah that's a good question so that

01:22:52,250 --> 01:22:57,809
organization is actually from our team

01:22:54,480 --> 01:23:00,659
and we develop DVDs when we were working

01:22:57,809 --> 01:23:03,090
for modularity and if it was like proof

01:23:00,659 --> 01:23:05,309
concept and we actually stayed as a

01:23:03,090 --> 01:23:07,320
proof of concept so they're not supposed

01:23:05,309 --> 01:23:09,780
to be like production ready or anything

01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:12,270
like that even so we have like tens of

01:23:09,780 --> 01:23:15,360
thousands of pools on docker hub so if

01:23:12,270 --> 01:23:17,159
you'd actually work yeah so it's

01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:20,059
probably up to us to figure out what we

01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:20,059
want to do with it so

01:23:23,719 --> 01:23:26,719
yeah

01:23:29,290 --> 01:23:34,180
they are

01:23:31,090 --> 01:23:34,180
[Music]

01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:37,890
we have

01:23:38,590 --> 01:23:41,160
a lot

01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:49,070
as well as in our own people

01:24:13,370 --> 01:24:16,480
day off

01:24:18,119 --> 01:24:24,440
yeah does the thing like do all of us

01:24:20,670 --> 01:24:24,440
have time to execute this

01:24:48,030 --> 01:24:53,760
main objective and because we are

01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:36,070
sure

01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:50,350
great job

01:25:58,369 --> 01:26:02,800
he said dependencies on Syria

01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:06,770
[Music]

01:26:37,770 --> 01:26:41,120
just their use I guess it does

01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:53,190
honestly should

01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:53,190
is she driving

01:26:58,380 --> 01:27:04,050
but still is kind of hard

01:27:01,119 --> 01:27:04,050
we through

01:27:07,130 --> 01:27:13,289
if I'm playing over behind

01:27:10,030 --> 01:27:13,289
there are a lot of

01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:19,160
the

01:28:29,770 --> 01:28:32,950
all right

01:28:53,350 --> 01:28:57,690
that but I think this world

01:28:55,090 --> 01:28:57,690
right

01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:07,390
and now have those roadblocks basically

01:29:04,280 --> 01:29:07,390
all that

01:29:14,650 --> 01:29:17,820
either there

01:29:39,170 --> 01:29:44,170
is there anybody else's interest and you

01:29:41,150 --> 01:29:47,040
know possibly

01:29:44,170 --> 01:29:49,840
in class and

01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:53,100
cheeps live in the grass you know

01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:53,100
separately they may not have

01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:02,090
if read

01:30:17,909 --> 01:30:20,909
really

01:30:32,580 --> 01:30:35,570
to the road yeah

01:31:13,850 --> 01:31:18,790
so I think we already have a leader who

01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:18,790
seeks Oh

01:31:19,180 --> 01:31:22,440
he's fine with it

01:31:35,059 --> 01:31:40,300
so we are about 15 minutes till my

01:31:37,670 --> 01:31:40,300
coffee break

01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:44,900
I'm not sure what your energy level

01:31:42,889 --> 01:31:47,110
right now whether we should go for Kofi

01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:47,110
or

01:32:01,260 --> 01:32:04,640
something similar

01:32:07,309 --> 01:32:13,250
my name before

01:32:10,170 --> 01:32:13,250
the same system

01:32:24,790 --> 01:32:27,790
No

01:32:28,730 --> 01:32:31,730
nice

01:32:41,490 --> 01:32:47,350
although it was the negative through

01:32:45,350 --> 01:32:47,350
Oh

01:33:01,079 --> 01:33:06,929
yeah they should have whole system of

01:33:03,449 --> 01:33:10,849
their own to like build images from

01:33:06,929 --> 01:33:10,849
github and put to registry

01:33:23,079 --> 01:33:28,030
which should be visible from the contain

01:33:25,160 --> 01:33:28,030
my plane

01:33:30,699 --> 01:33:32,729
I

01:33:41,650 --> 01:33:44,100
Centaurus

01:34:02,510 --> 01:34:06,340
all right we actually met with Ballmer

01:34:08,260 --> 01:34:12,030
okay so I guess that we can invite them

01:34:10,210 --> 01:34:15,229
for for this meeting

01:34:12,030 --> 01:34:15,229
[Music]

01:34:34,770 --> 01:34:37,490
and

01:34:44,599 --> 01:34:48,789
doing a volunteer for that

01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:56,639
[Music]

01:35:09,059 --> 01:35:12,800
whether going this would have no idea

01:35:17,160 --> 01:35:21,300
and especially when the biscuit

01:35:19,220 --> 01:35:24,020
repositories will be combined it would

01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:24,020
be an easy way

01:35:29,519 --> 01:35:32,300
beside it

01:35:57,340 --> 01:36:01,200
I think

01:36:08,120 --> 01:36:11,020
when would be

01:36:20,889 --> 01:36:25,170
so anything else before the coffee break

01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:34,900
so I guess what Smith was go for coffee

01:36:31,860 --> 01:36:39,099
after the break we can probably look at

01:36:34,900 --> 01:36:41,230
the shoes in the ethnic video think

01:36:39,099 --> 01:36:43,860
