Talk: Fedora containers: next steps
Presenters: Tomas Tomecek, Dominika Hodovska, Jiri Popelka, Clement Verna

Description: Complete agenda for this workshop can be found in this etherpad:

https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/flock-2018-containers-workshop

Our team has a focus on automation and streamlining the process of Red Hat container images
delivery. We would love to bring some of our tools and ideas to Fedora!

Outcome: faster delivery process, container images are up to date, less work
for maintainers, containers are validated

Proposal/agenda:

1. Introduction of stakeholders.
2. Introduction of what we did at Red Hat (processes) and introduction to our tools.
3. Design discussion on what can we do at Fedora side:
* Validation.
* Automation (least amount of steps for container maintainers).
* Delivery (can I have the container on my system ASAP?).
