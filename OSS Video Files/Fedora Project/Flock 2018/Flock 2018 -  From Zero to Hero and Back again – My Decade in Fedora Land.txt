Talk: From Zero to Hero and Back again – My Decade in Fedora Land
Presenters: Christoph Wickert

Description: I joined Fedora in 2005 and quickly became one of the most active contributors. I not only maintained ~150 packages but also took over leadership positions in FamSCo, FESCo, the Fedora Board and later the Council, until I eventually vanished two years ago.
In this talk I will share the story of my exciting decennial journey through Fedora land. I won't be talking about my myself (too much) but about mistakes I made and lessons I learned; things every Fedora contributor or leader should know. I will show how Fedora has changed – for better and for worse. You will hear about friends I made, problems we faced, the battles we fought, and the victories we celebrated. And last but not least, I will tell some funny and embarrassing anecdotes. Hear stories you almost forgot and see pictures you wish they never existed!

I will dissolve the mic in my hand it's

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:15,619
probably easier so thanks everybody for

00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:18,830
showing up I'm happy that you're here

00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:21,359
I'm I was a bit concerned about the

00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:23,689
scheduling because we have the amide

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:28,699
shared session in parallel to this one

00:00:23,689 --> 00:00:31,050
so people interested about the future or

00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:34,140
about what to improve in fedora are

00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:37,530
probably in that session while others

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:40,920
might think this session is only about

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:45,510
the past about my decade in fedora while

00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:47,190
in fact it is not I'm going to tell you

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:50,280
something about the lessons I learned

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:52,170
and the mistakes or the mistakes I made

00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,980
and the lessons I learned from that and

00:00:52,170 --> 00:01:01,890
also the lesson so that the mistakes red

00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:04,140
hat or the IDI fedora governance bodies

00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,360
various bodies or various people made

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,600
and also the lessons we learned from

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:13,380
that in order to not repeat the history

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:16,500
mistakes of the past so I think this

00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:20,460
talk would have been an excellent opener

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:24,780
for the my chair session and watering

00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:28,130
their schedule to in parallel well

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,130
that's not my problem

00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:35,939
yes so this will probably be my last

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:40,079
talk on a fedora well not on a fedora

00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:43,110
conference I hope to be back every now

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,659
and then as justice I will be around in

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:48,049
the greater open-source community but it

00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:51,570
will probably be my last talk with my

00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:53,790
fedora head on yesterday I gave a talk

00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:56,290
about technical writing this was with my

00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:59,470
Susan had on our with

00:01:56,290 --> 00:02:04,110
suza sure gone while today I'm wearing

00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:07,720
the Berlin shirt that's from 2009

00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:12,690
that is the first I attended and

00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:16,780
that's the boldest shirt I have

00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:18,250
so what are we going to talk about we

00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:20,500
are talking about what I did for in

00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:23,610
fedora the mistakes are very and the

00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:27,400
lessons I learned various ways how to

00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:29,280
upset the community and at the end we

00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,690
are going to have some fun time I

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:36,340
selected a couple of photos

00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:38,590
unfortunately leave office is very bad

00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:43,390
and scaling photos so I didn't put the

00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:46,060
photos into the slides so we will just

00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:48,160
see them at the at the end in no

00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:51,010
particular order of more or less random

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:54,760
not chronologically or something what

00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:57,760
you might expect I apologize that this

00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:59,650
talk won't have consistent plot I

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,390
recently attended a storytelling

00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:04,959
training and presentation training that

00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:07,180
they say that's all about the plot but

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:10,570
this talk will rather be a collection of

00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:14,080
anecdotes and and yeah nice or not so

00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:16,360
nice story so don't expect too much of a

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:20,739
red line but hopefully in the end it

00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:24,880
will make some sense so first of all why

00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:27,730
did I join fedora I have been as a

00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:31,920
student so I already come from a totally

00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:35,920
different background from so I studied

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:39,269
linguistics Germany linguistics German

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:43,090
literature political science and history

00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:46,660
so I got into Linux when I was working

00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:50,380
at a local ISP as a student somebody

00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:55,570
introduced me to Linux I bought my first

00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:57,250
copy of Suzy Lee notes 6.1 I think and a

00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:59,110
week later my flatmate

00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:03,400
the time came around the corner with the

00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:05,860
Red Hat 6.0 which at that time was still

00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,410
the boss product that you could buy at

00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:11,440
the supermarket which seems of very

00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:14,860
weird these days right then I quickly

00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:19,420
switched or I promise back and forth

00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:21,400
between sue the bread then I got a 2d

00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:24,160
yarn that's where I learned a lot of

00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:26,290
stuff while Sousa and Red Hat have

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,470
worked pretty much out of the box in

00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:31,960
Debian nothing did that's why I had the

00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:35,530
steep learning curve but it also helped

00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:37,600
me I use Divya for quite a while until

00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:39,520
what he was so outdated that it was

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,520
hardly usable and they didn't have a new

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,430
release actually I wanted to join Debian

00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:48,850
I was in the queue to become a Damian

00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:51,580
maintainer but they had pretty much of a

00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:53,080
problem because the previous I'm not

00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:56,140
sure if you're familiar with how DB on

00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:58,660
maintainer z' are how they become

00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:01,479
maintainer or developers you need to

00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:04,780
know at least X other developers you

00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:07,300
need to have your GPG keys signed by

00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:10,240
their keys and so on the problem at that

00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:13,930
time was the person who was in charge of

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,880
all the German Debian developers got

00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:18,640
into a fight with the rest of the Debian

00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:21,340
community he left and he took all the

00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:24,430
keys and everything with him so they

00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:27,250
couldn't accept any new Debian

00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:31,300
developers for over in years ink and

00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:33,220
then reddit announced they would go they

00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,800
would make fedora a community project

00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:40,479
and I immediately switched back I think

00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:43,870
it was by Fedora core 1 beta 1 or

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:46,870
something and yeah that's when I also

00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:50,650
started contributing I think my first

00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:52,210
contribution was a bug report about and

00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:54,980
our contact rushing when you make an

00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:57,680
accidental triple click somewhere

00:05:54,980 --> 00:06:00,620
how I found that out but yeah that was

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,110
my first-ever contribution I started

00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:05,120
building packages mainly xfce packages

00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:09,830
at some point on the mailing list I

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:13,430
asked for a nice front-end I had a

00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:17,630
repository of my own and I asked

00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:19,340
somebody I know about create repo but by

00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:29,720
the time there was no label view yet

00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:31,820
there was some weird thing and so I was

00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,410
writing how to get a nice I was writing

00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:36,770
an email to the mailing lists how to get

00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:39,920
a nice weapon you web interface for the

00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:41,980
package connection and costly moose you

00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:46,400
probably know him responded and said

00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:49,220
well you could use this but why not join

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,200
fedora just upload the packages to our

00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:53,360
servers and we take care of everything

00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:57,980
so trust in sponsor me which I'm very

00:06:53,360 --> 00:07:00,160
grateful for and yeah that's when I

00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:03,860
joined fedora that was in September of

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:07,630
2005 I joined as a packager I quickly

00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:12,250
became a Tetris sponsor

00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:16,100
yeah a little over a year and in April

00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:18,380
2007 I became a fedora I pass at all we

00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:21,260
didn't have a real drums s fallen

00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:23,650
actually I became the Fedora ambassador

00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:25,760
for my state because I was the only

00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:30,680
Fedora ambassador in the North

00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:32,390
rhine-westphalia by that time yeah

00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,610
that's when I started going to cook

00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:36,860
going to events and that's where I would

00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:38,660
argue that that's when my career started

00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:43,790
because it's all about the people

00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:45,470
go out and meet people make friends do

00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:47,180
some networking if you want to achieve

00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:52,670
something as a community but one that

00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:56,750
later in 2010 I got elected into vesco

00:07:52,670 --> 00:08:00,170
be here later I got elected into the

00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:00,870
board and at the same time I also became

00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:04,470
the

00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:06,990
codeshare the first member and I think

00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:09,570
in the second year the chair I've been

00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:11,820
serving on femco for I don't know how

00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:14,730
long I that's why there's no end date I

00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:20,430
think it was like three years four years

00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:22,350
in a row in 2014 I became a board member

00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:25,110
again but this time not elected but

00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:28,890
appointed the I was the community or

00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:31,830
outreach representative and I remained

00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:36,990
in this role when we switched from the

00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:40,710
board to the council but say a year

00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:42,750
later I that must have been in 2014 or

00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:47,280
2015 I stepped down from the role

00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:49,770
because I could no longer do it so what

00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:52,230
have I done or whatever else did I have

00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:55,170
apart from these official title I wasn't

00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:57,500
the xfce SiC the Kevin and I were

00:08:55,170 --> 00:09:00,450
maintaining most of the xfce stack

00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:03,000
traditionally heated to XFC core while I

00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:06,120
was doing the XFC goodies

00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,810
I was the member of founder of the

00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:14,180
Alexia sick which was well the lxd usik

00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:16,830
never really existed it was just making

00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:20,070
festival believe it does in order to get

00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:22,680
my future proved I was a member of a

00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:24,960
spin sick of the medical sick I was the

00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:27,720
spins Wrangler I still am even though

00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:30,510
there is no spins Wrangler anymore I was

00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,710
the I still get emails every now and

00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:34,680
then about that we should probably

00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:36,780
updated this in the wiki I was the EMEA

00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:41,370
media Ranga means I was in charge of

00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:44,580
media production for the EMEA region

00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:46,920
I had like yeah I will show you a

00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:49,530
picture later and I was also in charge

00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:52,430
of this web production I produced the

00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:55,170
the blue ambassadors

00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:58,050
I produced the blue ambassadors shirt

00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:59,880
for not only for Europe but because they

00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:03,870
were so good quality and it was actually

00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:05,400
cheaper to ship them it's a bit weird we

00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,640
shipped them to measurer they were

00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,790
probably produced in

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:12,399
and we ship them back cheaper and for

00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:15,820
them buying them there so basically I

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:19,810
took care of the global ambassador or

00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:21,959
shirt distribution and other swag yeah I

00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:25,570
did a couple of features as I said I

00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:27,820
brought LXDE into Fedora by the way it

00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:31,089
was the purpose the program minute

00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:33,279
nobody's not here with us oh you mailed

00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:35,579
me about the Alex Diaz bill yes please

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,579
kill it

00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:42,459
don't die burning in the fire it's no

00:10:40,329 --> 00:10:45,850
Alex de upstream is debt or more that's

00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:47,560
debt there's a cute based variant of

00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:49,870
that XD which is called very cute

00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:52,120
there's a different spin but the gtk

00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:54,010
version is dead and please offer the

00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:57,640
spin i have no resources suggested

00:10:54,010 --> 00:11:00,970
please yes thank you very much

00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:02,800
alright well unless somebody's this is

00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:05,140
willing to maintain it but it's if it's

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:09,010
dead upstream it's no use

00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:12,010
okay then Kevin and I did xfce 4.6 and

00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:14,890
4.8 later and I think we even did 4.10

00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:16,779
4.12 together I'm not sure if there were

00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:19,990
no features but at some point I just

00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:23,199
stopped counting together with Jeff

00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:25,750
Bukoba I did Kudo we we package tracker

00:11:23,199 --> 00:11:29,410
or bra six and mechanical start

00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:31,930
successor together with Europe zero and

00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:34,920
I worked on the security spin we had the

00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:39,430
multi desktop DVD together with spot

00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:42,850
yeah and the question is now why did I

00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:45,220
eventually leave fedora well on the one

00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:48,430
hand like that

00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:50,890
well that start with the simple solution

00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:53,949
or the the obvious answer

00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:57,820
I joined Sousa a little over two years

00:11:53,949 --> 00:12:00,720
ago my initial idea was continue with

00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:06,160
fedora as a hobby and work on Sousa

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:07,870
in a day job but that didn't quite work

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,579
out and actually I should have known

00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:13,150
that from the start because when I was

00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:15,490
in Fedora I always was a very

00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:18,490
strong advocate of the community and I

00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:21,820
was really angry at read her to us who

00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:23,950
don't care about fedora or who don't

00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:28,420
care about the community but just about

00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:32,350
their day job having this yes split

00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:35,920
brain situation day job versus versus

00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:38,200
community so I was angry at them and I

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:43,120
wanted to do the same which was a really

00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:45,210
bad idea so I don't at the moment I'm

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,500
not really in the openSUSE community I

00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:50,950
probably will take over some packages

00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:52,570
for example xfce because I know we could

00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:54,940
do better they could be in better shape

00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:58,510
we could do also pet just like we had a

00:12:54,940 --> 00:13:01,390
fedora and so on but I'm not I'm I don't

00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:05,260
have any intentions to become a member

00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:08,980
of the the openSUSE Board or whatnot for

00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:12,850
me it feels like I've like a game I've

00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:16,270
done all the levels I made it to the

00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:18,430
final boss and I don't want to start as

00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:22,660
a mere mortal again so I would do my

00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:25,090
stuff and yeah and also I simply don't

00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:29,740
have the time any longer life has

00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:32,200
changed I now have a wife well we are

00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:33,820
not yet married but I just call her my

00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:36,220
wife actually because it calls me her

00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:39,340
husband and we have her little son now

00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:41,670
he's four months old so yeah

00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:43,780
priorities change life goes on and

00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:47,710
that's why I said we don't have the time

00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:53,290
and that already leads me to the lessons

00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:55,720
I learned so my motto throughout all

00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:58,900
these years was community first I'm not

00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:02,440
sure if I'm that was actually my slogan

00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:04,870
but nowadays it feels weird to say this

00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:07,960
because other people are using our

00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:11,970
rhetoric combinations of word and first

00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:18,959
I wouldn't say make Fedora great again

00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:22,799
again so it's my advice for everybody

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:24,989
who wants to have a career if you will

00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:27,959
in Fedora or in any other open source

00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:30,239
project is go out and meet people

00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:32,099
my I mean I've been have been a packager

00:14:30,239 --> 00:14:34,619
for two years before I first went to

00:14:32,099 --> 00:14:36,299
lean on Star and Linux hardware was

00:14:34,619 --> 00:14:39,899
really when I got into the office as a

00:14:36,299 --> 00:14:44,369
community meeting people meeting people

00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:45,749
is not really though if you don't meet

00:14:44,369 --> 00:14:47,759
the people if you just communicate

00:14:45,749 --> 00:14:48,689
through mailing lists or whatnot it's

00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:55,259
not the same

00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:57,839
so people are sometimes quite different

00:14:55,259 --> 00:15:01,499
on mailing this than in real life so

00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:04,069
that's also a lesson I learned and

00:15:01,499 --> 00:15:11,609
that's actually my next point

00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:18,299
in 2001 was Tempe 2009 I think it

00:15:11,609 --> 00:15:23,039
was 2009 2010 was 11 right 11 think 2009

00:15:18,299 --> 00:15:25,379
was Berlin obviously 2010 I could I can

00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:27,259
look it up we can look it up later 2011

00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:30,509
was my first us fat corn

00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:32,279
well Berlin Berlin doesn't really

00:15:30,509 --> 00:15:34,349
count I would argue because it was just

00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:36,899
a mini Falcone and it was combined with

00:15:34,349 --> 00:15:39,539
Linux Agua which was a very bad idea if

00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:42,239
you want to get done because well

00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:43,889
do you have a booth and you have to do

00:15:42,239 --> 00:15:45,299
booth service and on the other hand you

00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:47,970
have talked so you're there's this

00:15:45,299 --> 00:15:51,269
constant distraction our hope was that

00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:53,189
we would get denotes track visitors over

00:15:51,269 --> 00:15:54,989
to the fat corn but that didn't work out

00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:57,509
so for getting done

00:15:54,989 --> 00:15:59,369
I think location like this one not

00:15:57,509 --> 00:16:01,769
necessarily in the city center and

00:15:59,369 --> 00:16:04,829
everything is closely together so that's

00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:08,039
the best if you want to get it up the

00:16:04,829 --> 00:16:12,400
interesting part for me about the fat

00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:15,190
corn and taffy was I finally got to know

00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:18,279
the American people that I only have

00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:22,029
been communicating through email with

00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:24,370
and what happened to me was that not

00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:28,390
only one but in fact three people

00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:29,470
approached me and I pretty much taught

00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:31,450
me the same story

00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:33,310
oh you're Christopher wicked now that

00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:37,630
we're talking you're actually a nice

00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:41,190
nice guy I love the manliness I think

00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:41,190
you're a complete dick and that is cool

00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:50,440
so I learned a lot about the cat

00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:53,380
smooch said my mail sound passive

00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:56,740
aggressive I didn't even know the words

00:16:53,380 --> 00:17:00,300
because we don't have well at least

00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:00,300
until I got to know my girlfriend

00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:06,939
usually we don't have this concept of

00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:16,209
passive-aggressive as a German I mean we

00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:18,970
are active aggressive so we are active

00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:21,400
aggressive and I was just an active

00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:24,160
aggressive German trying to be polite

00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:27,309
and that for him sounded passive

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:30,700
aggressive but you will face the same

00:17:27,309 --> 00:17:34,600
cultural differences everywhere think of

00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:37,330
Asians I recall an Asian computer

00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:42,190
contributor who submitted a patch to gtk

00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:44,260
and the dtk upstream simply said oh that

00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:48,309
is an interesting match we're

00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:52,900
interesting can mean anything but they

00:17:48,309 --> 00:17:54,640
just asked him could you please slice it

00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:58,929
down into smaller channels to address

00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:01,950
the individual problems and I mean

00:17:58,929 --> 00:18:06,400
that's a perfectly reasonable request

00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:10,900
right but for him it was he felt refused

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,970
and he never ever responded he never

00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:17,490
ever project

00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:19,920
TDK again so go out and meet people it's

00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:22,680
easier but beware of the cultural

00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:24,840
differences it's easier to to avoid

00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:26,490
these problems are the problems that

00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,080
browse through these cultural

00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:31,350
differences if you're meeting

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:34,290
face-to-face be careful with email in

00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:37,460
particular or be even more careful with

00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:40,530
IRC because when you're writing emails

00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:44,460
you still have the option of sending it

00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:48,420
later sleep at night over it reread what

00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:51,000
you have written I remind you everything

00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:54,660
you write usually shows up in some

00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,700
public archive of that mailing list so

00:18:54,660 --> 00:19:01,560
everybody will be able to read it again

00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:04,320
years later and when I read some of my

00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:07,350
emails from Beckett back off in those

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:12,960
days actually I think the guy was right

00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:16,230
calling me didn't complete in the next

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:19,590
advice for new contributors is set your

00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:22,890
pace I've shown you the roles that I had

00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:27,360
in fedora before and some of these roles

00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:30,560
can be very time-consuming at some point

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:34,080
yeah I was in the board and it helps go

00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:36,270
that makes say four hours of IRC

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:39,060
meetings a week but then we have the

00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:41,220
EMBA IRC meetings of the European

00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:42,510
ambassadors which I was sharing and I

00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:45,120
was sending out the meeting minutes and

00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:47,970
inviting people and whatnot that add

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:53,580
another two hours every second week

00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:56,850
every other week and yeah in the end I I

00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:59,370
spent I have no idea at least 20 hours

00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:02,430
the week or Fedora packed maintains that

00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:06,480
world there's nothing wrong with that if

00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:08,250
you can't afford it I at that time could

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:12,140
afford it because either I was still a

00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:15,450
student or I was working as an intern

00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:16,120
self-employed contractor or consultant

00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:18,760
and divided

00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:20,920
have any consulting gigs I invested time

00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,690
on Fedora and actually that helped me to

00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:25,420
gather a certain reputation which later

00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:27,700
got me various jobs so that is time well

00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:32,080
spent but please make sure that you

00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:34,960
don't burn out I only do what you want

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,520
to do as long as you can do it better

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,160
student there's nothing wrong if you're

00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:42,010
if you're have holidays between the

00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:44,760
semesters you can do a little extra work

00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:49,180
or so but don't do it in the long run

00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:52,240
don't do yeah don't get overworked don't

00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:55,570
get burned out and don't only do what

00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:58,510
you actually want to do don't do stuff

00:20:55,570 --> 00:21:00,580
because only because nobody else does

00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:02,800
I found myself in the situation that

00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:06,370
nobody wanted to take care of this or

00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:08,260
that and I stepped up and I did it just

00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:10,570
because we needed somebody to do it but

00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:13,720
that's that's not healthy that's not

00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:16,690
sustainable in the long run and if

00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:20,350
nobody else is willing to stand up and

00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:25,140
go and do it maybe this is no longer

00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:28,920
necessary if the community doesn't feel

00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:32,080
we need this or that maybe well so be it

00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:34,330
of course we do need somebody to send

00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,890
out all the media of course we do need

00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:38,770
somebody to take care of the year

00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:41,980
ambassador polos or so on but if nobody

00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:44,320
volunteers then you need to find a

00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:46,250
different solution for that problem

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,550
maybe record can help

00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:52,580
or whatever and actually sometimes

00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:55,010
stepping aside is a good opportunity we

00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:57,680
have seen that for example when I at

00:21:55,010 --> 00:22:00,920
some point I was I didn't get reelected

00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:04,880
that response co-chair Jersey had become

00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:07,250
more active and they elected yearly at

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:10,010
first I was upset but then I realized

00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:12,650
well he has done a better job throughout

00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:14,540
the last year and he is now doing a

00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:16,550
great job it was a great relief for me

00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:18,980
actually so sometimes it's good if your

00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:22,190
step aside because you give room for

00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:24,080
other contributors they get attention

00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:27,290
they get focus and in the end we

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:29,420
ultimately need new faces new fresh

00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:31,100
blood every now and then because life

00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:33,470
goes on people get a family or whatever

00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:36,440
so a healthy community should always be

00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:40,850
in the the should always be able to

00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:42,680
replace you if it's some stupid routine

00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:44,870
job they will replace you with a shell

00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:48,380
script or something but if it's a people

00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:53,780
thing somebody else will hopefully you

00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:59,660
stand up then one thing that I would

00:22:53,780 --> 00:23:01,520
like to talk about is the situation of

00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:04,850
the spins because I've been deeply

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:07,820
involved with that these are two quotes

00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:13,220
from the fedora

00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:16,220
davell mailing list and the funny thing

00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:19,660
is these are actually took words from

00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:23,990
the same person so first they tell me

00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:26,870
LXDE and KDE should be on the DVD they

00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:31,550
didn't want any spills and then they

00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:33,830
were no don't put it on the disk so as a

00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:36,770
spin maintained how busy you can - right

00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:38,850
I know Dennis there it was do that's

00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:41,370
that's I can I know

00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:44,160
you can you can look it up who wrote it

00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:47,250
Oh excellent

00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:50,940
you have a brilliant memory thank you

00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:53,730
well he had his he had good strong

00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:56,790
arguments for his points yeah arguments

00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:58,620
that I from my perspective as a spin

00:23:56,790 --> 00:24:01,980
maintained I didn't see his arguments

00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:04,890
but for Mike's from Mike's perspective

00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:08,490
as the infrastructure guy he did have

00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:10,860
valid points so but again that's

00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:12,870
something you need to well I think

00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:14,790
Fedora needs to think about carefully

00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:16,860
you think about the spins about the

00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:18,750
future of the spins or if they're

00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:20,310
obsolete or not that's it's not on me to

00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:22,170
decide that's on the Kedar community to

00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:24,480
decide I'm pretty sure this topic will

00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:27,620
come up every now and then again and

00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:32,280
yeah let's see what happens we're better

00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:35,610
then another story I would like to talk

00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:37,860
about the year federal objectives in

00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:39,930
2011 that's the first time we start a

00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:41,730
bit with our objectives I think we did

00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:44,700
call them objectives but we called them

00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:48,410
goals I was very unhappy about this

00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:51,540
because I felt it wasn't like it

00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:53,970
top-down approach first they had asked

00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:56,040
the individual groups projects like the

00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:57,930
ambassadors and the six at or not but

00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:00,200
they had asked them for input but when

00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:02,730
they finally came up with the list of

00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:06,030
objectives which I will show in the next

00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:08,070
slide I felt like nothing that none of

00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:11,220
the CIM input from the community was in

00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:12,720
these objectives all right you know

00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:14,310
that's actually that is already the

00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:19,230
slide with it so these were the go to

00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:22,050
the objectives for 2011 these are all

00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:25,620
worthy goals they are nice adhere and I

00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:27,740
can subscribe to all of them but that

00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:30,870
doesn't mean that they are good goals

00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:33,930
because they are way too long there's no

00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:38,070
immediate action that results from any

00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:39,410
of them there's no way to measure your

00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,850
success that's

00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:42,980
I think that's why we now call it

00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:44,510
objectives instead of goals the

00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:47,150
difference is you can actually measure

00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:50,960
it you can you need to measure the

00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:53,720
impact you can never really reach your

00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:56,750
goal because you're never there you can

00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:59,740
always improve and also you cannot end

00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:03,170
for stuff when we revisited these

00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:06,560
objectives in 2012 and by that time I

00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:10,190
was on the board we realized nothing had

00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:14,120
really changed because why because

00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:17,300
nobody was champion any of them I mean

00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:19,670
it's easy to say go ahead go make it so

00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:21,680
I mean if you're Catholic I can tell

00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:27,080
this too right but you cannot tell this

00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:30,470
to the community right so what the board

00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:32,870
realized what our failure was we tried

00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:35,270
to enforce something but we didn't occur

00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:38,660
or enable it or we didn't champion it I

00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:41,270
think nowadays the the council is doing

00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:43,370
a way better job because the individual

00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:46,970
representatives in the council they all

00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:49,940
represent their groups and they drive

00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:53,060
for what their projects and we actually

00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:57,260
have the option that that somebody joins

00:26:53,060 --> 00:27:00,620
the council to achieve that or this or

00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:03,950
that objective so that's a way better

00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:07,340
approach I think this is this is

00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:09,620
something that we fedora as a as a whole

00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:12,170
as project has granted us and very well

00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:14,480
but we can all learn from that failure

00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:17,150
because it whatever you do even as a

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:20,120
single contributor pick your favorite

00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:21,549
project and champion it if you're going

00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:24,879
to drive something in the Ambassador

00:27:21,549 --> 00:27:30,249
group go ahead and do it lead by example

00:27:24,879 --> 00:27:36,249
and if you're good others will follow me

00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:38,559
period okay then the big topic of the

00:27:36,249 --> 00:27:45,100
deagle stop is not here with us

00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:48,070
unfortunately well yes were spot that is

00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:50,559
very true but not only poor spot but

00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:52,779
also poor community I thought well spot

00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:55,119
was between the lines yeah on the one

00:27:52,779 --> 00:27:57,460
hand you had ratted legal and on the

00:27:55,119 --> 00:28:02,590
other hand you had the community I think

00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:05,169
the this the the time were where this

00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:08,999
really totally escalated was also in

00:28:05,169 --> 00:28:11,109
2011 back in the old days we had an

00:28:08,999 --> 00:28:12,909
European entity we had a legal

00:28:11,109 --> 00:28:17,889
foundation a fedora

00:28:12,909 --> 00:28:19,450
EMV AEV with an own bank account it was

00:28:17,889 --> 00:28:23,769
a legal entity and we were actually

00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:26,320
allowed to accept donations they were

00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:29,529
texted October as I said we had a bank

00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:33,399
account and max as a community leader

00:28:29,529 --> 00:28:36,519
had granted us a non-exclusive license

00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:39,549
to use the fidor trademark and then in

00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:44,080
2011 Fedora or rat had changed its

00:28:39,549 --> 00:28:46,960
trademark policy and in fact max was

00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:49,269
never into position to grant us any

00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,789
license because I mean he was not the

00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:55,230
owner of the trademark we used it to

00:28:51,789 --> 00:28:58,049
produce swag with a fedora logo on it

00:28:55,230 --> 00:29:01,570
with the old fedora even globally even

00:28:58,049 --> 00:29:05,080
but yeah he was not allowed to do it and

00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:11,019
actually the German eme iev received

00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:13,480
some funding from red head and so the

00:29:11,019 --> 00:29:18,159
thing is we were no longer allowed to

00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:20,350
use the trademark and red head head had

00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:22,330
to cut its funding armature if they had

00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:22,640
to or if they wanted to if they wanted

00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:25,310
to

00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:28,940
priestly pressure on us but it resulted

00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:32,570
in that the yeah the the foundation the

00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:36,230
EMEA Germany the Europe fedora EMBA was

00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:38,630
closed it was founded at FOSDEM in 2009

00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:42,320
I think and it has to be had to be

00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:46,970
closed down in 2011 for these legal

00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:49,520
reasons so if there is a way to upset

00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:52,460
your community I think the number one is

00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:54,980
always legal stuff because there's

00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:59,560
nothing you can do against it

00:29:54,980 --> 00:30:03,280
not even math you can not even spot can

00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:08,510
I know back in the old days maybe max

00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:10,940
went into somebody's office and yelled

00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:11,630
at people or whatever but that doesn't

00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:14,240
change a thing

00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:17,990
legal is the period full stop you cannot

00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:20,680
change the rock so but yeah try to try

00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:24,230
to avoid this wherever possible and

00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:30,380
general trying to avoid any red tape

00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:32,810
that is possible so if I were to give

00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:35,330
you the six key points I think it should

00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:39,140
be between five and seven so I went for

00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:44,060
six I think it's always community first

00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:47,360
it should be bottom up not top down set

00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:50,180
your own pace as a contributor avoid red

00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:52,760
tape I think Franco was very good at

00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:54,620
creating red tape at some point they

00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:58,670
want to stand up operating procedures

00:30:54,620 --> 00:31:02,030
for everything which I can okay that's I

00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:03,590
can kind of understand that but if you

00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:07,100
have everything written down set in

00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:10,400
stone it's it's you're creating they

00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:14,180
never heard yeah

00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:16,450
lead by example enable and don't enforce

00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:16,450
and

00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:26,870
one thing that just came to my mind

00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:28,910
we have topics that pop up every other

00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:32,690
year again for example the topic of

00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:34,280
inactive ambassadors and then I as an

00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:36,320
older person s have come on we have beat

00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:39,260
this topic to death we have this already

00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:43,010
so many times and the younger ones then

00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:45,830
come up again so my advice for everybody

00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:50,810
is if you are one of the old parts like

00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:52,850
I am make sure to write down why you

00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:55,220
made this all that decision it should be

00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:57,380
properly documented in the weekly not

00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:59,270
hidden somewhere in a mail on on a

00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:01,550
mailing list or a little bit even worse

00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:03,860
than an IRC log you will never be able

00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:05,330
to find this it again and so make sure

00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:07,790
every decision you make is probably

00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:09,800
documented your rationale is documented

00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:12,640
why you made this or that decision and

00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:15,740
for the for the newcomers I think

00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:18,890
respect the elders the structure you'll

00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:21,680
find at least at some point served for

00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:25,010
certain purpose it there is a reason why

00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:27,170
things they are the way they are so they

00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:29,540
show some respect to the elders but also

00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:32,840
be willing to challenge them every now

00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:34,850
and then if we figure out this no longer

00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:38,540
works for the community maybe we need to

00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:41,870
revert that so document why this

00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:44,600
decision was made but feel free to

00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:47,600
question it later and of course like for

00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:49,790
every every community think show some if

00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:55,520
you're discussing show a minimal amount

00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:57,290
of respect for everybody okay let's

00:32:55,520 --> 00:33:00,440
quickly switch to

00:32:57,290 --> 00:33:00,440
[Music]

00:33:06,669 --> 00:33:20,299
last but not least some photos and so

00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:23,030
this is Kevin when was it that was next

00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:26,600
burn that was no that was Blacksburg

00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:30,409
actually so there talked about this

00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:34,820
wouldn't be complete with a picture of

00:33:30,409 --> 00:33:36,610
Seth I owe this meant so much or we as a

00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:38,720
project Oh him so much

00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:42,460
people who follow me on Facebook or

00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:44,990
Google+ now know that I'm a very vocal

00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:46,429
activists for for safe bicycle

00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:48,860
infrastructure we are going to have a

00:33:46,429 --> 00:33:51,169
referendum in Berlin and one of those

00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:53,030
reasons is yes that I'm kind of

00:33:51,169 --> 00:33:54,860
passionate scientist just like Seth

00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:56,980
wasn't in fact we talked a lot about

00:33:54,860 --> 00:34:00,799
cycling we exchanged private emails

00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:02,900
about this particular topic so yes I

00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:06,080
don't want to lose another friend in a

00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:09,589
deadly accident so let's all remember

00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:11,690
him speaking of remembering people

00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:14,149
that's max I'm not sure how many people

00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:19,550
of you still remember him and also

00:34:14,149 --> 00:34:22,429
there's a very young spot and come on

00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:24,379
don't don't tell there's also here who

00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:26,450
was around here I'm very happy he's in

00:34:24,379 --> 00:34:30,050
divine chair session so I'm very happy

00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:33,950
that she flashes there so actually that

00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:36,379
was for them in 2008 my first posture

00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:37,040
and I'm glad to see that people are

00:34:36,379 --> 00:34:39,020
still around

00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:45,649
okay Francesco from Italy no longer is

00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:48,560
but yeah things times change but people

00:34:45,649 --> 00:34:51,619
yeah some people stick around here for

00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:55,030
example we have a very young I think he

00:34:51,619 --> 00:34:55,030
reminds me of Steve

00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:15,170
so that was a Linux truck in 2000 2008

00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,790
yes that was my first little stock and I

00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:17,690
really is you will see another picture

00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:20,660
of Linux target

00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:23,360
okay that is that was Kuala

00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:27,170
Lumpur that was the release party we had

00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:29,750
on the last day because it's they have a

00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:32,900
significant amount of Muslims in their

00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:35,360
population so it was a non-alcoholic

00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:38,840
release party but if you look at these

00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:41,030
pictures is hard to to believe that they

00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:42,560
can have so much fun without alcohol

00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:44,960
so we had a big cake fight they had

00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,670
these giant for their arcades ended it

00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:51,830
ended up in a there were certain areas

00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:55,940
that ended up in a giant cake fight this

00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:57,650
is again back to 2008 think of

00:35:55,940 --> 00:36:00,620
lineaments our contributions have

00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:03,980
changed think of how our appearance on

00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:05,990
events has changed we have been at linux

00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:09,020
tagged with this giant booth you can see

00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:12,500
these individual kiosks on every kiosk

00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:17,150
we had so we had known KDE xse and on

00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:19,760
the very right you can see the old pc

00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:22,040
which was a big deal so the the federal

00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,140
presence and in all circles of all was

00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:26,600
exceptional we have like 20 people there

00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:28,520
they caught off the Blue Man Group was

00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,050
they of the shirts and I think we were

00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:32,420
the most professional team there

00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:35,450
nowadays when we go to an event we go

00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:38,360
there with a much smaller team which is

00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:40,610
good is enough to take care of the booth

00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:43,310
service obviously but don't

00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:45,530
underestimate the the impact it has on

00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:47,300
community building even if it's

00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:49,370
expensive to bring all these people to

00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:52,250
Berlin and even if the big booth and so

00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:55,910
on is expensive I think that was money

00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:57,770
well spent at least at that time events

00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:59,470
have changed Fedora has changed or the

00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:03,940
role of distributors has changed

00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:07,090
pointed out for example in OnStar which

00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:10,180
was a giant event no longer exists it

00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:15,930
cease to exist two three years ago but

00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:20,890
it was a great time as you can see right

00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:22,090
this was also an e not sir yeah it one

00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:25,930
night when we had drinks

00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:29,109
I remember when when we had dreams and

00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:31,810
we got up and we were already 20 meters

00:37:29,109 --> 00:37:34,359
away from the bar and the waitress came

00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:38,080
after us and we still had 200 euros open

00:37:34,359 --> 00:37:41,020
not building and yeah I think max just

00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:47,440
grabbed his credit card his rented

00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:50,950
credit card and this is a photo by Tata

00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:55,260
Karma this is all so Tambe 2011

00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:58,480
give back our distro who remembers this

00:37:55,260 --> 00:38:01,990
actually I remembered it but I didn't

00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:04,720
remember what it was about I knew that I

00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:08,740
was I have one of these buttons in fact

00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:11,470
I have it here and John gave gave it to

00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:13,690
me so I was obviously on the say

00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:17,650
opposing side in the often the

00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:20,980
opposition so well there were some

00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:23,500
concerns about changes on the one hand

00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:26,290
there was this which took note 3 with

00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:28,500
this new user interface that Evo Brent

00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:31,300
Martin use and it's no longer the hacker

00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:33,010
desktop and at the same time we had

00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:34,720
certain changes in the design team and

00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:37,480
in the overall strategy we wanted to

00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:40,570
broaden our target audience and some

00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:43,450
people were well it was the Girl Scouts

00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:45,910
versus the hackers thing looking back

00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:48,010
well I can see their concerns but

00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:49,900
looking back I mean nobody has taken our

00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:52,540
just throw away it or else to exists

00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:57,730
it's to a community thing it totally

00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:59,320
wasn't worse that the fight and I think

00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:01,270
we should have handled it better because

00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,510
we need lost some good people left and

00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:04,240
right

00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:08,980
I don't think John is still active in

00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:11,259
fedora Nico isn't either so these people

00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:14,500
things will happen again in the

00:39:11,259 --> 00:39:16,599
no matter if it's no.4 or whatever it

00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:20,079
will be there will be conflicts and

00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:25,240
please try to solve them in a way that

00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:27,339
leaves nobody behind oh that's another

00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:31,390
very professional photo of me from the

00:39:27,339 --> 00:39:35,009
know second - no yeah he knows talk 2013

00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:35,009
I think on a great panel

00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,289
no but that's that's one of the nice

00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:43,599
things I like about being a community

00:39:41,289 --> 00:39:46,210
person so you get on stage people get to

00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:49,210
know you this is actually a professional

00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:53,529
photo by some some photo prefer from

00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:56,200
from a magazine yeah and another thing

00:39:53,529 --> 00:39:58,720
that I like going to attend to these

00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:01,809
events opens doors that you usually

00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:06,160
never open this is at sharp CERN the

00:40:01,809 --> 00:40:08,529
Large Hadron Collider Gerhard so we have

00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,269
to fudge the throw activity day and I

00:40:08,529 --> 00:40:12,460
found you know it was the event owner

00:40:10,269 --> 00:40:15,190
and he knows somebody working there

00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:17,619
normally it's it's impossible to get

00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:21,730
there I mean they do guided tours but it

00:40:17,619 --> 00:40:23,799
takes years to get a free slot so yeah

00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:27,839
I'm very grateful for everything that

00:40:23,799 --> 00:40:30,970
that fedora has allowed me to see and do

00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:35,019
and last but not least this is probably

00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:38,650
my favorite yeah yeah that was thievery

00:40:35,019 --> 00:40:40,869
my all time highlighting fedora I showed

00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:43,539
up with these that was Ellen I

00:40:40,869 --> 00:40:45,490
showed up with the III so we head to

00:40:43,539 --> 00:40:47,500
dinner I disappeared and showed up with

00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:50,529
a costume again and people totally

00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:55,480
freaked out they carried me on their

00:40:50,529 --> 00:40:58,450
hands through the restaurant Thank You

00:40:55,480 --> 00:41:01,790
Fedora community

00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:05,840
this is media production and that was

00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:07,340
only part of it if you order 3000 DVDs

00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:09,170
make sure you're prepared for it it's

00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:11,270
because it's more than you think that's

00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:13,300
probably only a thousand so the guy

00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:15,530
shows up with a lorry and

00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:17,480
please make sure you have significant

00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:21,020
storage and you can actually carry this

00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:24,830
stuff this is also one thing we shipped

00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:26,710
like thirty thousand DVDs of fedora 15

00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:30,410
which was an achievement because I was

00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:33,800
also writing for a magazine and mag

00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:36,320
magazine at the time that was really

00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:39,290
awesome but again it has gotten us into

00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:40,880
legal problems because they were not

00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:44,360
following the local guidelines as you

00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:46,280
can see the multiboot word mark doesn't

00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:52,880
really match the font of fedora and

00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:54,200
whatnot so yeah it's it's and I think

00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,800
they didn't sign the cover mount

00:41:54,200 --> 00:42:01,160
agreement so again a legal problem at

00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:05,180
some point well the good thing about

00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:07,520
this is the DVDs were already out there

00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:09,260
fedora couldn't or redhead couldn't do
