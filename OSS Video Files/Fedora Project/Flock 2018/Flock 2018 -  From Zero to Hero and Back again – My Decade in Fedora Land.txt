Talk: From Zero to Hero and Back again – My Decade in Fedora Land
Presenters: Christoph Wickert

Description: I joined Fedora in 2005 and quickly became one of the most active contributors. I not only maintained ~150 packages but also took over leadership positions in FamSCo, FESCo, the Fedora Board and later the Council, until I eventually vanished two years ago.
In this talk I will share the story of my exciting decennial journey through Fedora land. I won't be talking about my myself (too much) but about mistakes I made and lessons I learned; things every Fedora contributor or leader should know. I will show how Fedora has changed – for better and for worse. You will hear about friends I made, problems we faced, the battles we fought, and the victories we celebrated. And last but not least, I will tell some funny and embarrassing anecdotes. Hear stories you almost forgot and see pictures you wish they never existed!
