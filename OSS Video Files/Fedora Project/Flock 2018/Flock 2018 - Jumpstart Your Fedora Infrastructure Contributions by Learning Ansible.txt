Talk: Jumpstart Your Fedora Infrastructure Contributions by Learning Ansible
Presenters: Adam Miller

Description: Ansible is a radically simple agentless IT automation system. It handles configuration-management, application deployment, cloud provisioning, ad-hoc task-execution, and multinode orchestration - 
including trivializing things like zero-downtime rolling updates with load balancers.

The Fedora Infrastructure Team has been long time users, advocates of, and contributors to Ansible, with both Fedora and Ansible having a long shared history. In this session we will discuss Ansible: what it is, general concepts, how to use it, and how it can be used to automate IT operations. From there we will discuss some specific aspects of how the Fedora Infrastructure Team uses Ansible to configure and automate the Fedora Infrastructure, which itself powers the Fedora Project. This aims to provide a jump-start to the skill set of systems administrators who are interested in getting involved with the Fedora Infrastructure Team.
