Talk: What next with spec files?
Presenters: Florian Festi

Description: The basics of RPM spec files have been unchanged for decades. I want to survey for use cases that no longer fit the traditional model or need new features. We are for now going to focus on larger groups of packages. E.g. packages in a given programming language or packages with a given function like language packs or add-on documentation.

Issue could be
* Difficulties moving from one interpreter version to another
* Supporting multiple versions of a language in parallel
* Not enough flexibility when creating sub packages
* The dependency system not quite cutting it
