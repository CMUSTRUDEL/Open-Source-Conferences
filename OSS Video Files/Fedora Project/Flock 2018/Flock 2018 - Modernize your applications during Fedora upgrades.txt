Talk: Modernize your applications during Fedora upgrades
Presenters: Vinzenz Feenstra

Description: The Leapp project wants to give more power into the hand of application developers
and system administrators to perform additional tasks during the upgrade process.

Leapp extends the power of the DNF upgrade capabilities and allows additional
custom handling to be added at many stages of the upgrade process.

This talk gives an introduction how Leapp can help to improve the upgrade
experience for Fedora users.

Examples what Leapp could do on top of the normal DNF system-upgrade:

Ask the user if they would like to switch to the new BootLoaderSpecification
as part of the upgrade process - and do the conversion during the upgrade
process for them

Modularity:

[Idea] detect python2 apps and automatically subscribe to python2
module streams

[Idea] detect postgres 9.x and ask if the user wants to upgrade to the
latest version or would like rather to subscribe to an appropriate
9.x postgres module for them

[Idea] Service Defaults
Ask the user if they would like to apply newly implemneted service
defaults or stay with old ones

More can be done these are just examples that are possible. More in the talk :-)
