Talk: Fedora in Google Summer of Code and Outreachy - Project Showcase
Presenters: Laura Abbott, Jona Azizaj, Brian Exelbierd, Dusty Mabe, Bee Padalkar, Abhishek Sharma, ...

Description: Google Summer of Code(GSoC) is a program aiming to bring more student developers into open source software development. It enables students to spend their summer break working with open source organizations on projects proposed by participating organizations and supported by mentors. Outreachy (previously, Outreach program for women) provides three-month internships in free and open source organizations for people from groups traditionally underrepresented in tech.

The Fedora Project has participated in Google Summer of Code (GSoC) as a mentoring organization for over a decade now and has been participated in Outreachy since its' early rounds. This session will be an opportunity to showcase projects of current and former GSoC and Outreachy interns in Fedora to the community. This session will cover

What is Google summer of Code(GSoC) and Outreachy? Information about the programs including timeline, similarities and key differences.

GSoC, Outreachy and Fedora

Why should you become a GSoC or Outreachy mentor?

Steps to apply to become a GSoC or Outreachy mentor - Things to keep in mind and important tips from current and past mentors and/or Fedora coordinators for the program

Project showcase from current and former GSoC and Outreachy interns.

We are working on compiling a list of interns who can showcase their projects. We will reach out to everyone soon. In the meantime, if you are interested to showcase your GSoC or Outreachy project or have been a mentor for either of the programs in the past and want to talk about your experience or want to help us organize this session, please reach out to us: bee2502@fedoraproject.org

	00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:09,360
so welcome everyone today we are going

00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:13,049
to talk about fedora in google Summer of

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:15,179
Code and outreach e so we have a short

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:17,910
introduction for these programs if you

00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:19,590
don't know what they are and then we

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:23,130
will talk about the application process

00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:25,199
and timeline for this programs and like

00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:28,349
some guidelines you need to keep in mind

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,090
when you are proposing projects for this

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:33,780
program or when you are applying as

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:36,590
students we will also have the Fedora

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,920
admins for these programs Laura and

00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:40,559
Becks

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,629
come up and talk a little bit about

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,559
fedoras involvement in these programs

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:46,670
and some tips

00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:50,399
probably for proposing the projects and

00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:53,910
we will also have the students

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,140
showcasing their mint demos about the

00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:59,129
projects what they did over the summer

00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:03,329
and also mentors talking about their

00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:08,159
experience in this program so yeah if

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:09,720
you don't know me I am B I am also

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,549
involved in the community operations

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,700
team and the diversity and inclusion

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:16,860
team I was also a google Summer of Code

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,840
mentor this year for the fedora

00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:23,990
happiness packets project along with

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:28,380
Jana who is my co-presenter and she will

00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:34,140
do some parts of this presentation so

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:36,420
let's begin so can everyone here just

00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:39,560
like show their hands if they have

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:43,619
already heard of google Summer of Code

00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:47,070
okay so I guess most of you know about

00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:50,460
what Google Summer of Code is so it will

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:52,470
we can skim over this part so it's like

00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,869
a remote paid internship program with

00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:56,189
Foss organizations and Fedora has been

00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:59,520
involved with google Summer of Code

00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:03,479
since a long time it's open to all

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,759
students who are 18 plus and you can

00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:08,550
propose like programming projects

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,619
through this program it happens once

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,540
every year during the summer and the

00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:16,390
internships are from May to August

00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:20,849
but the project proposal deadline is a

00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:24,700
bit early around I guess early femme and

00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:26,739
can you know like can you now do a show

00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:29,409
of hands for outreach e how many people

00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:32,650
have heard about out to ichi okay so

00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:36,670
about on what's the same oh cool

00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:38,909
so outreach e is similar program to

00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:41,409
google Summer of Code but it is

00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:44,109
basically it also has another goal in

00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:48,069
mind to improve diversity in open source

00:02:44,109 --> 00:02:50,470
communities so it is open

00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:55,000
internationally to women trans men

00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:56,220
genderqueer folks and US residents and

00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,549
nationals who are from underrepresented

00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:03,549
communities and the difference the main

00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:06,129
difference here is that outreach e also

00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:10,829
has non technical project so if you have

00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:14,470
like a design project or or like

00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:16,599
graphics project or like documentation

00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:19,359
project or something else you can

00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:22,389
propose it through outreach e outreach e

00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:24,310
has two rounds every year the

00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:29,979
internships are from May to August and

00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:34,919
also from December to March so we will

00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:38,019
talk a little bit about fedora and

00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:40,840
fedoras participation in google Summer

00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:43,840
of Code and outreach e so fedora has

00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:48,190
participated in google Summer of Code

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:51,400
since its first round in 2005 so it has

00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:57,669
been more than 13 years now and we have

00:03:51,400 --> 00:04:02,199
had around 80 projects to date so yeah

00:03:57,669 --> 00:04:04,090
so some so you will see some of the

00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:07,299
projects we are developing over the

00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:09,549
summer after some time so as you

00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:11,650
probably already know all projects are

00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:14,609
programming projects and over this

00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:20,199
summer the students have worked on

00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:23,320
projects ranging for like analyst for

00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:25,590
container spoke like kono and open and

00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,570
also fedora happiness packets

00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:28,919
and also they have developed like the

00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:32,970
front end and back end for fedora

00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:34,560
community gap now I will talk a little

00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:37,020
bit about fedoras involvement in

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,440
outreach e so Fedora has been involved

00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:44,449
in outreach e since its early rounds in

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:48,600
2013 I guess we have had more than five

00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:50,880
students through outreach E and we'll

00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:55,560
have Murray who will talk about her

00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:58,110
design Badgers design project which was

00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:04,080
a part of outreach in 2015

00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:07,020
I guess 2013 again and we have also had

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:11,430
a few other like design interns

00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:13,740
throughout ricci for Fedora so I hope

00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:15,330
like you'll get to see some projects

00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:18,930
which have been showcased and talk to

00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:21,510
the mentors so why does Federer

00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:24,660
participate in outreach he and google

00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:27,600
Summer of Code so I mean obviously it

00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:29,760
helps us identify and bring in newcomers

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,910
talented people with a diverse skills

00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:35,360
get into Fedora community and it also

00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:40,229
helps us support and improve diversity

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:44,190
and broader like in other in the whole

00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:49,320
open source project communities so yeah

00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:52,440
so I guess when our program coordinators

00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:54,960
Laura and brand they come up and talk

00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,570
about this they will also mention a few

00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,410
points about fedoras involvement in this

00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:03,780
programs and also have some tips for

00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:06,479
mentors who are going to submit but who

00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:08,910
want to submit project proposes to be a

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:13,020
part of these programs so we will have

00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:14,639
that within a few minutes and before

00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:20,520
that I just want to introduce the

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:22,560
timeline and everything okay so why

00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,930
should you be involved in this project

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,229
so there are two ways for you to be

00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:30,630
involved in google Summer of Code and

00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:32,729
outreach e if you are a student or if

00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:35,310
you are looking for an paid internship

00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:38,940
in open source community and especially

00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:42,120
federal so you can get paid

00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:45,330
to develop your skills and contribute to

00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,640
projects in Fedora if you apply as an

00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:50,130
intern throughout Ricci or google Summer

00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:52,800
of Code to one of the projects we have

00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:57,180
proposed or it is also possible for you

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:59,220
to propose your own project and if you

00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:02,010
have like a mentor in mind who can

00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:05,850
mentor you through the entire internship

00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:08,810
duration and for mentors which is

00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:14,610
basically what we are looking forward to

00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:17,400
from this session so if you want to

00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:21,180
browse proposed project proposal you

00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:24,150
like through this program you get to

00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:26,910
build and grow your team and also like

00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:30,750
get people from with a diverse skill set

00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:34,050
into your team and like well getting

00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:37,830
like building your projects so it's a

00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:42,030
great way to onboard newcomers and like

00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:46,230
have them contributing to your projects

00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:47,970
so yeah we are looking for project

00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:51,900
proposals for the upcoming outreach

00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:54,660
around the open call for proposals is on

00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:58,380
community blog and you can go through it

00:07:54,660 --> 00:08:04,800
and say probably send in your project

00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:06,480
proposal so it's on a wiki page so you

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,490
have all the details in there about how

00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,390
to submit a proposal and we are looking

00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:11,760
forward to it

00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:16,020
the projects can be technical or

00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:18,870
non-technical so we don't really have a

00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:21,540
requirement but we have a few tips

00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:26,040
before you submit the project proposals

00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:29,070
like like defining the scope of the

00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,930
project which I will get to before but

00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:33,630
just before that I want to talk about

00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:35,640
the timeline for both outreach E and G

00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:39,360
SOG for proposing projects and for the

00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:43,169
internships so I hope you can see this

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:47,580
the font is a bit small so Google Summer

00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:51,030
of Code like internships are from me to

00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:52,020
August this every year so we just

00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:55,440
finished the round

00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:57,780
for this year and but you can always

00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:03,870
submit proposals for next year the

00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:06,120
proposals will open in Jan so you can

00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:08,310
submit your proposals then like we will

00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,010
know whether them are where the fedora

00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:13,530
has been accepted as a mentoring

00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:15,930
organization in Feb 12 and after that

00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:19,470
you can submit the project on our web

00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:22,320
page the internships the application

00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:25,740
period for internships will begin in

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,990
March and it will go around till end of

00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:31,170
March and the internships will begin in

00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:34,260
me and they will go on till August for

00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:36,660
outreach either like I said now the call

00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:39,240
for proposals for the December round is

00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:42,300
open the internships for this round are

00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:45,750
from December to March the application

00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:47,880
period starts in September and the

00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:52,620
deadline for applications is in late

00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:54,900
October out reaching into link outreach

00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,910
applicants are expected to do like a

00:09:54,900 --> 00:10:00,630
small initial contribution during their

00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:03,180
application period so like you should

00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:04,890
definitely expect people to like

00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:08,520
applicants to already start like

00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:13,260
contributing towards beginner tasks

00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:17,760
during this period so so here are a few

00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:19,830
things and tips basically for future

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,380
mentors who want to submit a project

00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:27,330
proposal so if you want to submit an

00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:30,600
idea every project needs at least one or

00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:34,070
like possibly hopefully two responsible

00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:37,560
mentors to teach and help the intern

00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:41,940
it's at least a Fire's per week

00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:44,160
commitment and it begins it starts from

00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:46,830
beginning of the application period so

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,920
for the outreach e round it will start

00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:52,290
around mid-september and it will go on

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:55,230
till the end of the internship so which

00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:56,820
is around mid March but you can expect

00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:59,780
like the evaluations and everything so

00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,780
till March

00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:07,710
and personally from X from experience I

00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:11,370
would say like even though it says fires

00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:13,620
I guess fires is the least amount you

00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:17,160
should do you should at least like

00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:20,010
expect to talk to your mentee every week

00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:23,550
and go through their code reviews so

00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:27,870
while it's not that intense it's like

00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:29,970
it's still like helping a newcomer to

00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:34,110
your project start so it takes some time

00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:38,910
out of your day like out of every week

00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:40,680
and yeah so like I said before outreach

00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:42,510
he applicants are expected to make a

00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,810
first contribution to the project they

00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:47,670
are applying for so when you submit a

00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:51,020
project proposal you also need to have

00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:53,880
some like beginner tasks for applicants

00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:56,520
like properly defined so that they can

00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:59,220
work on it and this is also helpful for

00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:04,800
google Summer of Code like even though

00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:06,720
they don't have like they don't have a

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,240
requirement like this it is always

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:13,860
helpful to have some small like beginner

00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:18,390
tasks for newcomers who want to apply

00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:21,350
for the project to start on and yeah so

00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:25,020
we are looking forward to applications

00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:28,470
for interns and project proposals from

00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:32,370
fedora community and now I want to

00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:34,110
invite Brian and Laura here to talk a

00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:36,950
little bit about google Summer of Code

00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:36,950
and out Ritchie

00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:51,480
hi for those who don't know me my name

00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,970
is Laura Abbott and I get excited about

00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,770
kernels a lot and this is part of the

00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:58,350
reason why I love doing outreach E and

00:12:55,770 --> 00:13:00,150
being an organizer because I get to get

00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:03,300
other people excited about what they

00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:06,450
love in open source I don't think we had

00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,440
anything really formal planned but X you

00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,910
want introduce yourself

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,500
I'm Brian axel beard I'm the Fedora

00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:11,910
Community Action and impact coordinator

00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,650
and I help with the google Summer of

00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:15,840
Code program and support Laura where I

00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:22,850
can and I get really excited about

00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:24,930
watching kernels boot on my laptop so

00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:27,960
things that was a great introduction to

00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:29,690
outreach in google Summer of Code I just

00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:33,570
wanted to talk a little bit about

00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:38,010
mentors and mentors for Ritchie and

00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:40,310
mentors or what really make the outreach

00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:42,390
experience I think both having an

00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:45,780
enthusiastic mentor and also a

00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:46,980
well-designed project and I know for a

00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:49,050
lot of people this may be the first time

00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:50,310
they try doing something like this and I

00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:52,670
would say if you have any questions at

00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:56,160
all please come talk to me and

00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:58,890
especially before things start if you

00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,840
know I'm happy to help talk about

00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:02,610
experiences mentoring setting up a plan

00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,870
reviewing things because we ultimately

00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:05,910
want to make sure this is a great

00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:08,040
experience not just for the student but

00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:09,630
for the mentor and this is also

00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,190
something I will give a tip for anyone

00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:13,500
who ever decides that when I mentor is

00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:17,610
make sure you're communicating both with

00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:19,890
your student and you know community the

00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:21,570
administrators frequently again we want

00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:23,490
to make sure problems are solved and

00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:25,440
that is the biggest thing I you know

00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:27,020
always think is takeaways just you know

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,310
communication solves a lot of things

00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:31,050
anything you want to talk about what I

00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:33,630
would add is to kind of echo some of

00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:35,490
what Laura said the mentors are the only

00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:37,950
reason the programs are successful quite

00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:39,510
frankly as administrators there's very

00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:41,100
little that we can do that is going to

00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:42,780
change the outcome of an individual

00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,550
student because of all of the other work

00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:46,200
that we're trying to accomplish it

00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,670
really comes down to the mentors doing

00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,130
that and the students are going to bring

00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:53,820
all of the energy and all of the

00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:56,340
the work and and the success but they

00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:58,710
need the mentors help it works a little

00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:01,470
bit differently with Google with the

00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:03,300
google Summer of Code program we are we

00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:04,770
try to get the entire community involved

00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,660
which is certainly done with an outreach

00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:08,670
e but it's a much more compressed time

00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:10,920
scale and so we're really looking to

00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:13,010
have multiple mentors on projects we try

00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:15,510
to have very strong project proposals

00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:17,250
and we try to do a public review of

00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:18,630
projects these days so we really

00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:21,300
encourage you even if you don't have

00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:23,610
time to be a mentor show up in the the

00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:25,050
public review give your comments talk

00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:26,340
about where you could help or where

00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:28,500
these code projects might fit better

00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:30,180
into other parts of the project because

00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,490
it really is a community effort

00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:35,220
it's Fedora's participation not one

00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:37,380
person's participation yeah and another

00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:38,940
thing I'll say is is that if for some

00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:41,460
reason you decide you don't want to be a

00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:43,620
mentor I think that's ok I love it when

00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:45,600
people mentor but I also appreciate that

00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,830
it is a time sink so don't force

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,480
yourself to mentor if you have other

00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:50,430
things going on and you don't think

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,690
you'll have the time this is not to say

00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:53,910
you know you can't work with us to say

00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:55,260
make it work but you know it is a

00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:57,240
commitment and it needs to be taken

00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:58,680
seriously but what I will also say is

00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,260
that just because you can't do it this

00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:03,180
round there's always next round

00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:05,310
if you have an idea I'd say especially

00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:07,200
now that we've done the work to get into

00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:09,240
pack you're it's pretty easy to put a

00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,590
ticket and we can tag it and say hey

00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,020
this might be a good idea for next round

00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:14,730
and we can always revisit it so again

00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:17,130
there's always opportunities for

00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:18,840
mentorship yeah I just I go it is never

00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:21,690
too early to put a ticket in with an

00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:23,130
idea for a project never too early apps

00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,300
there's a lot of things that we want to

00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:27,090
get done in our project that are

00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:28,770
fantastic for both of these programs so

00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:30,360
let's go ahead and get those ideas out

00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:32,670
there so that we can keep refining them

00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:36,180
for the students the other thing I would

00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:38,070
say is that the our G program in the

00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:39,360
google Summer of Code programs work very

00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:41,310
differently from an administrative

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,860
perspective on the google Summer of Code

00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:45,570
side the mentors really also help drive

00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:47,430
a lot of that communication because

00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:50,570
they're in such constant contact in that

00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:52,800
compressed period there are multiple

00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:54,570
evaluation periods within the google

00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,490
Summer of Code program and components

00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:58,500
like this so even if you don't want to

00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:59,880
be a mentor we're always looking for

00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,800
some level of assistance on the

00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,430
administrative side it's not a full-time

00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,290
commit by any stretch

00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:07,300
but there are some needs that we have

00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:08,950
whether it's just assisting us with you

00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:11,110
know cleaning up websites for the next

00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:13,780
year figuring out where the problems

00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:16,630
were from workflow or application flow

00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:18,400
things like this down to I sometimes get

00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:21,220
terrible while I'm planning a conference

00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,980
about sending emails about google Summer

00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:25,240
of Code maybe and somebody can kick me

00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:27,430
in the backside and make sure that

00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:30,340
happens and I would also like to give a

00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:32,350
big shout-out to Moe Duffy who also did

00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:34,150
outreach your organization for four

00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:41,050
years so she definitely did there and

00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:43,720
you know yeah and I think that's about

00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:45,310
all I wanted to say I would just as well

00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,350
give a shout-out to my co administrator

00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:51,640
Martin I'm gonna mispronounce his last

00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:53,080
name Jie Jie Jie Jie thank you is all of

00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:56,350
the checks have said it correctly in the

00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:57,460
audience I'll go with pooja sorry that's

00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:59,860
the best I can do Martin if you're

00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:02,920
watching the recording I tried to put

00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:04,900
all those hot checks there but he's been

00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:07,030
fantastic to work with and has served as

00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,410
both a great person to send things and

00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:20,500
kick me in the backside when things

00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:23,740
needed to get done so now we will have a

00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:26,620
discussion and I will invite the mentors

00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:30,930
and later the mentees the students but

00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:35,170
before I wanted to say that so Brian

00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:37,270
Lara and mentors and students please

00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:40,540
don't go after we finish because we want

00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:43,720
to do a group photo with all of you so I

00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:47,020
want to invite the mentors to come

00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:49,600
so we'll be discussion with them they

00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:52,270
will give some tips share their

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,940
experience with us and if you will have

00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:58,630
questions you are more than welcome to

00:18:54,940 --> 00:19:03,210
do it so first of all I would like if

00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:03,210
you can present yourself a bit

00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:10,419
don't hit the screen

00:19:07,749 --> 00:19:13,149
my name is dusty I'm involved in the

00:19:10,419 --> 00:19:16,450
atomic working group and the project I'm

00:19:13,149 --> 00:19:18,429
helping mentor this time is the google

00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:22,239
Summer of Code project for the fedora

00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:25,869
IOT Edition helping detect failed boots

00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:27,609
and automatically roll back so that's my

00:19:25,869 --> 00:19:32,529
involvement this year pass it on the

00:19:27,609 --> 00:19:36,070
beater on beta on the fedora IIT lead

00:19:32,529 --> 00:19:38,190
ICO mentored with dusty dusty did most

00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:44,320
of the work from an admin point of view

00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:48,190
I proposed the idea is like a ji-suk

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:49,509
project for fedora it's not iit specific

00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:53,769
and it will be useful for the entire

00:19:49,509 --> 00:19:57,789
atomic core OS platforms moving forward

00:19:53,769 --> 00:20:00,659
and generally in fedora I was really

00:19:57,789 --> 00:20:04,230
excited to get a G sock student and

00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:08,710
Christian was absolutely fantastic so

00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:12,210
early in the Fedora IOT evolution for me

00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:15,369
it was a really positive experience and

00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:17,350
with the outreach II stuff I've suddenly

00:20:15,369 --> 00:20:20,529
had a thousand extra ideas so watch out

00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:22,539
I think we'll see fedora IOT and Armen

00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:27,759
related stuff there in the future

00:20:22,539 --> 00:20:30,100
because I it's been fab hi my name is

00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:33,639
Siobhan troll and I work for the federal

00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:35,350
QA team and this time if for G sock

00:20:33,639 --> 00:20:37,869
I started mentoring for something called

00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:41,799
fit or a community app it's app which

00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:44,230
lets the uses and fedora like one who is

00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:46,359
enthusiastic about the next federal next

00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:46,809
to know mostly what's going on in the

00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:49,450
project

00:20:46,809 --> 00:20:53,230
so mostly targeting towards users and

00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:56,379
then later make them transfer to a small

00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:58,600
contributor specific stuffs so yeah I

00:20:56,379 --> 00:21:00,220
had intern so the project was split

00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,049
between two parts which is the front end

00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:04,570
and the back end so we used to have a

00:21:02,049 --> 00:21:07,419
very basic app before which was not

00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:10,470
doing much and then this year G sock we

00:21:07,419 --> 00:21:13,570
had two awesome people who helped us

00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:15,549
work with them and one one is Abhishek

00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:18,220
who which who was meant

00:21:15,549 --> 00:21:19,779
Kanika one of my colleagues and he

00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:21,759
worked on the front end part of the app

00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:23,440
while Armitage worked on the back end

00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:26,860
part of the app and we kind of revamped

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:29,019
the entire UI the entire structuring by

00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:32,080
implementing caching and the rest of

00:21:29,019 --> 00:21:34,539
what those guys will speak more but yes

00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,379
we kind of now have an app which can be

00:21:34,539 --> 00:21:40,029
given to any person any student any

00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:42,360
anyone who wants to know what's going on

00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:44,919
in the project which part and exactly

00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:47,830
maybe attend meetings scheduled meetings

00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:50,499
and ask fedora is integrated so you can

00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:52,389
probably even see what are the if you

00:21:50,499 --> 00:21:54,999
have an issue we can look into and see

00:21:52,389 --> 00:22:00,549
if that works good so that's all about

00:21:54,999 --> 00:22:04,119
me hi everyone so you probably know me

00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:07,529
already I'm Bea I was mentored for

00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:12,519
Federer had happiness packets project

00:22:07,529 --> 00:22:15,009
Jana here so the idea behind this

00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:18,399
project is that we will be having a

00:22:15,009 --> 00:22:22,359
Federer appreciation week in November to

00:22:18,399 --> 00:22:24,580
like appreciate all the work the federal

00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:27,909
community has been doing for the

00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:30,999
contributions like in open-source you

00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:33,100
sometimes we always like we feel like we

00:22:30,999 --> 00:22:35,139
are not appreciated enough so this week

00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:37,809
is dedicated to all the federal

00:22:35,139 --> 00:22:41,409
community members and to say thank you

00:22:37,809 --> 00:22:43,629
to them so people will send like we

00:22:41,409 --> 00:22:47,830
expect contributors to share their

00:22:43,629 --> 00:22:50,080
experiences and send like like thank-you

00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:53,710
messages to each other during this

00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:55,929
period so we have built a website for

00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:58,210
that which is basically a fork of the

00:22:55,929 --> 00:23:01,059
happiness packets website but it has

00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:02,919
some federal specific features so Ana

00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:04,889
has been working on the federal

00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:08,590
happiness packets project website and

00:23:04,889 --> 00:23:11,679
its development and design over the

00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:15,489
summer for like through google Summer of

00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:18,249
Code and yes so she will be doing a demo

00:23:15,489 --> 00:23:22,149
like present short presentation about

00:23:18,249 --> 00:23:24,860
project details later on and basically

00:23:22,149 --> 00:23:28,470
that's it and

00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:30,720
so yeah you explain what our mentor did

00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:33,450
so I wanted to ask now

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,940
the mentors like what tips you would

00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:38,340
give to the other mentors but during the

00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:40,320
application period so let's say the

00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:43,530
qualities that they need to look for

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,990
while they select the students or some

00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:48,480
tips when they let's say need to create

00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:50,910
some beginner tests so the students can

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,860
do their first contributions something

00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:55,740
that you want to highlight for them so

00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:59,160
the application period can be I don't

00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:02,400
know what should they do so it will be

00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:07,410
easier for people to contribute to your

00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:09,150
idea I don't know how good my answer

00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:11,390
will be because Peter actually wrote the

00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:14,040
project proposal for mine but like

00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:17,070
obviously having a fairly well

00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:19,710
thought-out project proposal helps a lot

00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:22,470
because that kick-starts the entire

00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:25,559
project and already having you know some

00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:29,309
sort of you know structure and goals

00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:33,630
involved I would say when you're trying

00:24:29,309 --> 00:24:36,179
to select a student it obviously helps a

00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:38,280
lot if the student already has some sort

00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:40,590
of open source contributions already

00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:42,510
obviously you don't necessarily want to

00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:44,190
make that a requirement because we want

00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:46,980
to bring more people into the open

00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:48,530
source community not just you know take

00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:50,790
people that are already there and

00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:53,010
subsume them into the community but that

00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:54,660
definitely affects how much time you

00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:57,900
will spend with them over the course of

00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:59,700
the project so like I guess that's a bit

00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,809
of a challenge is like you don't just

00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,270
want to take people that you already

00:25:00,809 --> 00:25:05,220
know are good you want to also you know

00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:07,020
bring more people into the community as

00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:09,600
well but you also have to consider how

00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:12,179
much time you have to mentor them on

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,500
things like you know how do you

00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:16,380
communicate in an open source project

00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:18,990
how do you properly have patience to

00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:21,780
wait for people to reply how do you

00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:23,880
appropriately you know periodically

00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:25,590
nudge them for an answer maybe they

00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:28,320
missed the notification before stuff

00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:30,270
like that so I don't know that was a bit

00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,799
of a rambling answer but maybe let

00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:33,799
somebody else take a stab at it too or

00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:42,470
so when it this is the first time I've

00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:45,980
been involved in G sock and Brian pinged

00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:47,990
me one morning and said we need to get a

00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:52,730
whole bunch of ideas up on the website

00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:56,000
now and so I threw like three or four I

00:25:52,730 --> 00:26:00,170
think it was IOT related ideas and

00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:03,170
raspberry pi related ideas as proposal

00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:06,580
ideas because even before I think the G

00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:09,260
sock application like went into Google

00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:13,850
for the organization we needed to have

00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:18,230
ideas this year I then proceeded to get

00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:21,830
drowned in emails from people that

00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:25,010
wanted to work on those projects which

00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:27,490
is a good problem but like I as an

00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:31,460
individual it's pretty busy as it is

00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:33,770
found that daunting to deal with it to

00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:35,480
the point where the Raspberry Pi 1 I say

00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:41,570
to Brian just literally deleted off the

00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:42,860
website and I got emails particularly

00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:45,920
about that from people that had never

00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:48,890
used fedora and that that one was Python

00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:50,660
bindings for GPIO they'd never used

00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:53,390
fedora they didn't have a Raspberry Pi

00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:59,930
they'd never written Python and I'm just

00:26:53,390 --> 00:27:04,520
like oh X and so the writing of the

00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:06,380
ideas for projects to contribute to was

00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:09,740
a big learning experience for me

00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:11,720
like I'd needed and I mean it was a bit

00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:13,280
of a throw it up there in a few minutes

00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,050
because we need to get this done today

00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:18,590
so that we will be accepted as an

00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:20,260
organization so for next year I'm gonna

00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:23,780
spend a lot more time writing that

00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:25,430
experience required Fedora like actually

00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:27,560
use fedora before actually written

00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:28,940
Python libraries before that sort of

00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:33,910
stuff

00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:36,350
and as dusty said that preparation and

00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:38,780
like obviously one of the things with

00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:42,230
gee Sokka is you don't want a student

00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:44,630
that can do it necessarily because they

00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:46,160
need to grow as part of that process but

00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:48,440
at the same time I

00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:50,860
didn't have time to be teaching someone

00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:54,410
how to boot the door on a Raspberry Pi

00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:59,440
and so you need to I think setting

00:27:54,410 --> 00:28:03,470
expectations with those sort of ideas is

00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:07,160
very important to begin with and it sets

00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:10,970
the project off for both you the mentor

00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:14,240
and thus potential students by setting

00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:16,850
those expectations properly I think so

00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:19,160
like the Raspberry Pi GPIO stuff and

00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:21,310
like even after we've taken off the site

00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:26,180
I was getting emails about a month later

00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:28,820
so it was whereas with the atomic host

00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:31,280
one I think we had this real fall or

00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:34,250
like the applications were weeded down

00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:38,630
to three to four candidates and they

00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:42,890
were all pretty strong candidates well

00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:45,560
and well Raspberry Pi and GPIO and stuff

00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:48,020
like that probably like boarding people

00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:49,430
that weren't even Fedora users and I

00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:54,260
think I had one or two that had never

00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:58,030
even used Linux and so that for me was a

00:28:54,260 --> 00:29:01,310
big learning experience and you know

00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:02,780
we've been Christian was a fantastic

00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:06,200
student I hope he's gone from the

00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:11,210
experience but like we had weekly video

00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:15,170
calls we had you know regular daily IRC

00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:17,690
chats you know Christian got to touch

00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:19,970
things from the low-level grub boot

00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:21,470
level all the way up through the stack I

00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:22,760
think that was probably pretty daunting

00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:25,130
for him

00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:27,230
we got Leonard on a video can't fun day

00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:29,270
so he got to chat away with Leonard

00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:30,860
pottering from systemd and stuff like

00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:34,430
that so I think he had a pretty good

00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:38,750
experience but but like the process to

00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:40,910
get there was fairly full-on and just to

00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:43,760
add to that just a little bit Peter

00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:45,500
mentioned that you know we got several

00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,660
people involved with mentoring in the

00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:50,200
project and I think that's a big key so

00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:53,720
like obviously Peters a busy person I

00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:55,670
I'm a busy person as well and what we

00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:58,160
essentially did was we spread around the

00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:59,450
load I know she was that you or her that

00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,610
mentioned earlier about

00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:03,049
the five hours minimum of time that you

00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:04,789
would want to spend well we essentially

00:30:03,049 --> 00:30:07,210
had like five different people help

00:30:04,789 --> 00:30:09,559
mentor in our project and that helped us

00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:11,539
spread around the load a little bit so

00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:13,549
when you create the proposal if you

00:30:11,539 --> 00:30:15,350
could get buy-in from several people on

00:30:13,549 --> 00:30:17,059
a couple different teams you know

00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:19,220
different levels of expertise in

00:30:17,059 --> 00:30:20,830
different pieces I can really help but

00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:24,139
you do need somebody who's kind of like

00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:26,240
you know overall responsible for the

00:30:24,139 --> 00:30:28,789
project moving forward and like that

00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:31,190
helps but you know having other people

00:30:28,789 --> 00:30:33,080
pitch in which is essentially what we do

00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:36,200
in the open-source communities anyway

00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:38,000
we're used to doing that right is what

00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:40,580
really helped our project be successful

00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,809
so if you when you create a proposal if

00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:44,029
you reach out to somebody and say hey

00:30:41,809 --> 00:30:46,519
I'm creating this proposal I'm gonna run

00:30:44,029 --> 00:30:48,500
it to ground but if we get to a point

00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:49,970
where I need some help you know teaching

00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,600
somebody how to boot put it on a

00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:52,519
Raspberry Pi

00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:54,470
could you help and if they say yes that

00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:57,320
basically helps the project be more

00:30:54,470 --> 00:31:08,450
successful I think we talked a long time

00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:10,399
sorry yeah so I just want to add a few

00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:13,580
words they basically covered most of it

00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:16,610
but I just want to say that when you

00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:19,429
define your proposals don't put in too

00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:23,269
many fedoras specific tools in it like

00:31:19,429 --> 00:31:26,809
we had like we put a separate section

00:31:23,269 --> 00:31:28,519
for skills which the applicant should

00:31:26,809 --> 00:31:30,350
probably already have like Python

00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:33,710
programming or like a little bit

00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:36,860
experience with UI UX development maybe

00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:39,679
because it was a web site so in there we

00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:43,250
also put like penguin and everything so

00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:45,700
don't like don't do that because people

00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:48,139
like who apply they come from like

00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:49,909
diverse background and they don't know

00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:52,130
about federal specific tools they can

00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:53,929
obviously learn as they go but if you

00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:55,549
put it in the project proposal they find

00:31:53,929 --> 00:31:57,320
it intimidating that they need to know

00:31:55,549 --> 00:32:01,399
so many technologies so they might not

00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:04,070
reach out to you and also like be

00:32:01,399 --> 00:32:07,070
expected to have a lot of messages over

00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:10,490
IRC emails and like you will have them

00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:12,830
so you need to have some time during the

00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:15,110
application period and

00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:17,630
another thing is what we did for our

00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:20,030
project was we used Twitter to promote a

00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:23,390
project proposal to get more applicants

00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:26,660
in for the project so and I think Anna

00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:29,270
read about I saw the project via Twitter

00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:31,460
so if you want to do that you can also

00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:33,110
do it because the distribution of

00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:35,210
applicants over projects is pretty

00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:37,880
uneven some projects are very common

00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:39,800
like amongst applicants but some others

00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:45,290
like get very few applicants so you can

00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:48,440
use your social media to promote it okay

00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:51,140
so we mentioned even some tips during

00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,790
the internship but I want to ask again

00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:55,690
like some things that you want to

00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:58,610
highlight now for mentors especially

00:32:55,690 --> 00:33:01,190
tips that they need to let say be

00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:03,050
careful during the internship like some

00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:07,730
tips how to communicate with their

00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:09,650
mentee like how often or let's say some

00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:11,420
of the challenges you had if you were

00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:17,600
like in different time zones or

00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:23,530
something else and yeah I mean what do

00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:27,860
you think that it's so I would say

00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:30,800
definitely make it clear to the student

00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:32,600
that they don't have to wait for a

00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,460
scheduled meeting in order to reach out

00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,679
to you if they're having a problem

00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:39,290
reach out earlier than later because

00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:40,460
like sometimes you have a problem and

00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:42,740
you think you're gonna overcome this

00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:43,850
problem and you continue to have the

00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:45,170
problem but I'm really close to

00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:46,520
overcoming the problem and then you

00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:48,380
continue to have the problem and then it

00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:51,080
becomes a real problem right because

00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:53,690
we've waited so long so more or less

00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:55,250
just encourage the student to you know

00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:57,950
if they hit a roadblock if they hit a

00:33:55,250 --> 00:34:00,230
road bump you know just reach out

00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:02,600
earlier than later you know and say hey

00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:04,790
I'm having trouble you know building

00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,590
this thing that should you know I feel

00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:09,200
like it should be easy but I'm having a

00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:11,629
problem and you know the mentors

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,649
probably do this particular thing all

00:34:11,629 --> 00:34:14,750
the time

00:34:12,649 --> 00:34:16,520
so it should be pretty easy to say oh

00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:17,960
yeah we hit that problem you know maybe

00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:20,960
there's an issue in our documentation

00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:22,700
for our project or whatnot so just

00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,490
encouraging the student to know that

00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:27,619
they can reach out obviously if

00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:29,990
if I'm not available right now you know

00:34:27,619 --> 00:34:32,629
that's just the the culture around our

00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:35,210
IRC you know nobody is particularly

00:34:32,629 --> 00:34:38,149
expected to respond to you immediately

00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:40,220
on IRC so reach out you know as soon as

00:34:38,149 --> 00:34:43,490
you have a problem or as soon as you

00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:45,350
start to have a problem and you know not

00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:47,480
necessarily bug somebody all the time

00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:48,950
but like obviously if it's taking you a

00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,540
significant amount of time and you feel

00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:52,909
like it should be an easy task

00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:55,129
reach out earlier than later don't

00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:56,929
necessarily wait for a weekly meeting

00:34:55,129 --> 00:34:59,300
and I do recommend at least a weekly

00:34:56,929 --> 00:35:01,250
meeting and maybe you know buy a you

00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:03,470
know more than once a week if once you

00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:05,140
get into a period of time where like

00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:09,010
you're getting close to a deadline maybe

00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:11,840
so communication obviously and

00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:13,250
expectation setting for you know it's

00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:23,510
not a big deal for you to reach out to

00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:25,550
me I'm available so something else that

00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:27,980
we were mentioned mentioning our mentor

00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:31,310
a lot is that not only to ask the mentor

00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:33,440
specifically but also different IRC

00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:34,970
channels that we have because if we

00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,800
might not be available at the time

00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:40,040
someone else will be and they can

00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,600
respond to them so and this helps them

00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:54,650
even to engage more with the community

00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:57,320
also not only with the mentor yeah

00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:59,240
exactly on those lines I mean we we as

00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,830
mentor shouldn't be blockers to the

00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,810
students I mean there is an open channel

00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:05,030
for them to ask questions and yes that's

00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:07,460
that's one of the greatest way even they

00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:09,500
develop community bonding skill and

00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:12,020
that's basically the phase one of the

00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:14,600
evaluation in itself right you you get

00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:17,750
on board with the community and what I

00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:19,790
believe is kind of Jesus Oh Fedora

00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:22,100
project org admin Beck's kind of does it

00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:24,290
very good so we get a list of all the

00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:26,240
email threads you probably need mailing

00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:28,400
lists you need to subscribe to these are

00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,560
the IRC channels in the fastest and all

00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,990
the prerequisites so it's it's it's

00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:36,140
indeed a great experience to get started

00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:37,730
in at first so yes that's that's one

00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,180
thing a student should always remember

00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:40,339
in

00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:42,770
when they get started it's it's all

00:36:40,339 --> 00:36:45,289
about get starting the very basic things

00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:47,569
right so you don't have problem by going

00:36:45,289 --> 00:36:50,480
forward I mean if you're committing co2

00:36:47,569 --> 00:36:52,369
per gr it's essential that you put your

00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,529
SSH key out there and you know you do it

00:36:52,369 --> 00:36:56,450
to the right way so you when you are

00:36:54,529 --> 00:36:58,190
actually hitting some problem and it's

00:36:56,450 --> 00:37:00,710
it's not actually a problem if you

00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:03,950
followed the steps right so yeah I think

00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:06,109
you know you we have done that bit

00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:10,599
pretty pretty good so yeah

00:37:06,109 --> 00:37:13,940
I just want to add one more thing here

00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:17,240
like you it's helpful for you to set

00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:20,420
like goals like weekly goals or weekly

00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:23,660
expectations with your mentor mentee so

00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:27,589
what we did was we had a list of tasks

00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:30,140
which we wanted to be completed in those

00:37:27,589 --> 00:37:32,420
weeks so obviously some of them might

00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:38,150
turn out to have blockers dependent on

00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:40,549
others so it like they can be done in

00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:43,670
the next weeks but it's useful to define

00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:45,650
them early on so that the main mind he

00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:48,770
knows what they are expected to do this

00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:51,980
week and there is like a project

00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:54,440
proposal timeline in the application for

00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:57,349
ji-sook and I think also for outreach II

00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:59,900
but this timeline always at least for us

00:37:57,349 --> 00:38:02,059
it got really evaluate it and redefined

00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:04,579
because as we moved forward we saw

00:38:02,059 --> 00:38:08,750
different blockers and different tasks

00:38:04,579 --> 00:38:11,359
got like a higher priority so be like I

00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:14,329
mean when you define the timeline be

00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:16,880
open to redefining it and always set

00:38:14,329 --> 00:38:19,220
like some weekly expectations from the

00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,480
mentee and be clear about it so that

00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:22,549
they also know what they should

00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:28,400
prioritize and it's not confusing for

00:38:22,549 --> 00:38:32,599
them so I think the three big things

00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:34,760
that I found one like for the project I

00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:38,420
had a bunch of ideas set in my head as

00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:40,849
to how it would look the way it actually

00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:44,510
is is nothing like that at all so be

00:38:40,849 --> 00:38:46,309
flexible because you know obviously you

00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:50,270
as a mentor have an idea how you think

00:38:46,309 --> 00:38:51,770
things should be but the student or

00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:55,430
other people may have other

00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:57,950
ideas that are quite often better so be

00:38:55,430 --> 00:39:02,930
flexible and again with the

00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:05,870
communication thing like I expect a

00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:07,700
student to reach out and engage in other

00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:11,030
parts of the community because

00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:13,730
ultimately part of growing as a student

00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:17,600
is being able to do that but some areas

00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:21,730
of the community are daunting and so

00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:25,040
like for example we didn't expect

00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:27,170
patches needing to go into grub and the

00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:30,670
grub maintainer in Fedora is insanely

00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:32,660
busy so he will generally ignore

00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:34,010
conversations from people he doesn't

00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:36,890
know

00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:39,260
and so sometimes it's you as a mentor

00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:41,750
that needs to start that communication

00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:45,200
like I think dusty emailed Leonard about

00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:46,880
system D and I wouldn't have expected or

00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,770
it would have been very daunting for say

00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:53,000
Christian to do that and so sometimes

00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:55,520
like there are things that the student

00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,550
should be doing but sometimes the mental

00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:00,500
needs to do that and to you know you

00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:03,410
need to be the one to be you know

00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:06,020
proactive there so that the student can

00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:08,870
be successful and you know some things

00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:12,470
are daunting like you know anything into

00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:14,810
a lot of say certain parts of the kernel

00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:17,360
community can be very daunting to get

00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:19,640
engaged in first and and so sometimes

00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:22,400
you need to be the leader and set up the

00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:24,650
introductions first so that you know you

00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,690
could so the student can ask those

00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:30,260
questions and what have you but you need

00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:31,910
to kind of see it so like while there is

00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:33,260
a certain level of expectation the

00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:36,230
student should be able to do all of that

00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:38,180
sometimes it makes it easier and less

00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:40,670
confrontational for the student for the

00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:44,740
mentor to start that process and I think

00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:50,470
that's something to be very mindful of

00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:52,869
and so I want to add even something else

00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:55,900
that encourage your students to write

00:40:52,869 --> 00:40:58,660
reports so it's not only for the google

00:40:55,900 --> 00:41:01,030
Summer of Code but especially even for

00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:03,220
the community so they know what the

00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:06,070
student is doing how the work is going

00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:08,619
on and also especially if they found a

00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:10,630
problem and they found the solution how

00:41:08,619 --> 00:41:12,940
to solve it it's great right

00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:14,710
blog even especially for that so someone

00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:16,359
else will benefit and if they have the

00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:19,480
same problems they know how to fix it

00:41:16,359 --> 00:41:22,540
and you can of course that you can help

00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:25,000
them to connect their blog with federal

00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:28,300
planet so everyone can check that or

00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:31,060
they can post their articles on federal

00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:33,220
community blog but I think that part is

00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:35,680
also very important so everyone in the

00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:39,760
community can know also what the student

00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:42,310
is doing and not only the mentors so

00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:50,170
thank you for all the tips that you gave

00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:52,240
and the words that thank you so now it's

00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:54,400
the time for the mentees to show their

00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,150
work what they have been working during

00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,030
the summer

00:41:55,150 --> 00:42:01,619
the first one is Anna and she will talk

00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:01,619
about her happiness packets

00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:07,230
here

00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:22,489
I can just died anyway

00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:28,990
hi so I hope I don't have to introduce

00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:31,930
myself my name is Anna and I was working

00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:33,940
for the fedora happiness packets for

00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:36,640
this summer for the past three months

00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:39,490
and as you know my mentors are the

00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:41,500
lovely B and Jana over there and so I

00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:44,320
guess they already explained the project

00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:47,020
so I really don't have to talk about why

00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:50,470
I worked on it so fedora happiness

00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:52,150
project was basically done for further

00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:53,920
appreciation week to encourage people

00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:54,940
who like contribute like share their

00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:59,410
appreciation for their fellow

00:42:54,940 --> 00:43:04,360
contributors basically yeah and what is

00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:07,930
it if tech-wise like I had like work

00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:12,070
with Django the Django ecosystem and for

00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:13,960
me like that I don't know like the

00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:17,050
channel ecosystem likes lettuce celery

00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:19,360
and Jennings unicorn like it was a full

00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:24,190
like a whole stack experience what I had

00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:27,270
basically so yeah and basically what my

00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:30,420
job was to integrate the open-source

00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:34,120
happiness packets with the existing

00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:37,840
federer ecosystem like it had to work

00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:40,240
with fed message and you know the users

00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:42,790
had we login and authenticate with their

00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:45,310
fast ID accounts basically so that's

00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:47,080
pretty much what the main gist of my

00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:51,190
project is just integrating with the

00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:55,030
feral ecosystem so what I worked on

00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:59,890
basically I mentioned that already but

00:43:55,030 --> 00:44:02,950
and you know my primary deliverables

00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:06,760
were like get the fastest indication

00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:09,910
working make a new batch so like one of

00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:11,710
our new user contributes like sense of

00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:13,600
happiness packet they get a new batch

00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:16,560
for that so you guys can like look

00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:19,690
forward to a new batch collect now and

00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:21,970
yeah that's basically why I did and why

00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:24,790
I learned so yeah the fine final results

00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:27,640
I'm happy to say I finally finished the

00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:29,620
primary delarue's and the site is up and

00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:31,619
running so you can go check it out

00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:38,160
actually like right now

00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:39,690
and just like some yeah that's about it

00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:42,299
and so this is just like a screenshot

00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:43,739
I'm not a designer so it doesn't look

00:44:42,299 --> 00:44:45,809
really good right now but this could

00:44:43,739 --> 00:44:49,549
possibly be an outreach II project maybe

00:44:45,809 --> 00:44:53,400
who knows I might start mentoring so

00:44:49,549 --> 00:44:55,380
yeah so this is like basically what we

00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,960
are expecting it's going to look a lot

00:44:55,380 --> 00:45:00,479
whole lot better like for further

00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:03,119
appreciation week but basically you have

00:45:00,479 --> 00:45:04,979
you can send these small little notes of

00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:08,279
appreciation to your fellow contributors

00:45:04,979 --> 00:45:12,269
make them feel special you know so yeah

00:45:08,279 --> 00:45:14,789
and yeah so once you log in you should

00:45:12,269 --> 00:45:17,549
be able to just put in the person's name

00:45:14,789 --> 00:45:18,930
their email and send a message and if

00:45:17,549 --> 00:45:20,789
your introvert like me you don't like

00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:22,349
coming up to people and doing this face

00:45:20,789 --> 00:45:26,309
to face you can just like hide your name

00:45:22,349 --> 00:45:27,989
if you want yeah and I guess I should

00:45:26,309 --> 00:45:30,239
just talk a little bit of what I learned

00:45:27,989 --> 00:45:32,309
for me wipe this project was perfect for

00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:36,440
me I'm new to fedora like I just started

00:45:32,309 --> 00:45:38,969
three months ago and well for me like I

00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:41,369
I'm a Python developer but I never had

00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:44,039
to like really learn Django but you know

00:45:41,369 --> 00:45:46,559
like working with this project I got let

00:45:44,039 --> 00:45:48,359
go to the whole jungle ecosystem like as

00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:50,700
I mentioned that is celery nginx and

00:45:48,359 --> 00:45:53,190
unicorn and plus the other great thing

00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:55,140
about this project was I have to

00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:57,150
collaborate with other teams besides the

00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:58,559
coop seam so it's not just like I had a

00:45:57,150 --> 00:45:59,910
talk with the infra team and I had to

00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:04,469
like talk with the design team as well

00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:05,999
so that's something new and plus and the

00:46:04,469 --> 00:46:08,789
other thing is like I touched on a lot

00:46:05,999 --> 00:46:11,460
of other federal projects like epsilon

00:46:08,789 --> 00:46:13,650
fed messages so for me this was like

00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:17,539
perfect yeah so that's why I did the

00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:17,539
summer thank you thank you

00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:30,300
yeah

00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:44,680
I don't think we have time for that we

00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:49,150
will do that when all the students will

00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:51,220
finish the presentation and one more

00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:53,140
thing we will do usability testing for

00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:55,630
happiness packets project doing the comm

00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:58,090
ups hack session today in the afternoon

00:46:55,630 --> 00:47:00,640
so if you want to be a part of the

00:46:58,090 --> 00:47:04,420
usability testing sessions please feel

00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:07,900
free to join us during calm ups workshop

00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:16,380
and it will be at most like 15 to 20

00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:16,380
minutes thanks and so hello

00:47:45,049 --> 00:47:50,779
it's okay so my name is rod oh I will

00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:53,569
get it

00:47:50,779 --> 00:47:58,489
quick because we're kind of running out

00:47:53,569 --> 00:48:00,399
of time so I was doing this as a google

00:47:58,489 --> 00:48:02,569
Summer of Code project was like a

00:48:00,399 --> 00:48:03,049
kubernetes and OpenShift support for

00:48:02,569 --> 00:48:08,019
Kona

00:48:03,049 --> 00:48:11,630
I will explain what is Kanu at first so

00:48:08,019 --> 00:48:14,809
Kanu is basically Python API for your

00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:17,329
containers we have a upstream repo on

00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:20,869
github or you can check it out there is

00:48:17,329 --> 00:48:25,039
a lot of examples in readme if you want

00:48:20,869 --> 00:48:27,829
to know more about it and our google

00:48:25,039 --> 00:48:29,899
Summer of Code our goal was to implement

00:48:27,829 --> 00:48:34,279
this support for kubernetes and

00:48:29,899 --> 00:48:36,169
OpenShift so as I mentioned it's like

00:48:34,279 --> 00:48:39,439
library which makes it easy to write

00:48:36,169 --> 00:48:41,269
tests for your containers and it's handy

00:48:39,439 --> 00:48:47,299
when you playing with containers inside

00:48:41,269 --> 00:48:50,839
of your code so the question was why do

00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:53,899
we need this support and Kanu had just

00:48:50,839 --> 00:48:56,349
support for standalone containers but

00:48:53,899 --> 00:48:58,669
nowadays all applications running in

00:48:56,349 --> 00:49:04,539
kubernetes or in OpenShift

00:48:58,669 --> 00:49:07,669
and another thing was that a test for

00:49:04,539 --> 00:49:10,399
images that needs to run in openshift

00:49:07,669 --> 00:49:14,809
were are mostly written in bash which is

00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:19,909
hard to maintain so this was the main

00:49:14,809 --> 00:49:23,439
advantage and so as the last thing I

00:49:19,909 --> 00:49:28,130
will show my really simple example of

00:49:23,439 --> 00:49:32,209
how it works so in this code important

00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:37,099
wine is when 8 where you can like easily

00:49:32,209 --> 00:49:42,559
create pot that you easily like run your

00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:46,839
image in the pot in kubernetes and then

00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:51,240
you can like wait until it's running and

00:49:46,839 --> 00:49:55,530
verify that it's it's ready

00:49:51,240 --> 00:50:00,750
and as an output Wiggy of this code we

00:49:55,530 --> 00:50:06,089
give to user like lock that is like easy

00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:09,089
to read and that's it actually if you

00:50:06,089 --> 00:50:11,160
want to see more examples like more

00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:15,380
advanced examples also for open shift

00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:19,680
you can just check the upstream repo and

00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:32,190
there is more examples there so that's

00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:35,160
basically so next one we have the

00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:37,349
federal community app app in check is

00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:40,050
the first one sorry for seeing your name

00:50:37,349 --> 00:50:43,040
wrong you will be together okay and

00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:43,040
emitters

00:50:48,349 --> 00:50:55,460
I'm just reloaded I am ready

00:50:52,809 --> 00:50:58,249
fashion should I bring my life isn't

00:50:55,460 --> 00:51:00,549
that record it's open an actor you just

00:50:58,249 --> 00:51:00,549
love him

00:51:05,459 --> 00:51:08,459
connected

00:51:16,110 --> 00:51:19,229
[Music]

00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:33,959
good afternoon everyone I'm Abbie shake

00:51:29,549 --> 00:51:35,909
and good afternoon I'm Jewish so this

00:51:33,959 --> 00:51:37,859
summer we work on the Fedora community

00:51:35,909 --> 00:51:40,559
app initially we had a really basic

00:51:37,859 --> 00:51:41,819
version so we made some UI changes and

00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:43,499
there were some improvements on the back

00:51:41,819 --> 00:51:45,179
end I worked on the front end he worked

00:51:43,499 --> 00:51:48,389
on the back end so we just walk you

00:51:45,179 --> 00:51:51,869
through the changes we did so this was

00:51:48,389 --> 00:51:53,909
the on the on the right you can see

00:51:51,869 --> 00:51:55,889
there is the old whole home screen on

00:51:53,909 --> 00:51:59,189
the left there is a new home screen we

00:51:55,889 --> 00:52:01,709
change the navigation and the stuff and

00:51:59,189 --> 00:52:03,389
in the back end part initially

00:52:01,709 --> 00:52:03,899
everything was loaded directly from the

00:52:03,389 --> 00:52:05,939
Internet

00:52:03,899 --> 00:52:08,339
now we have an offline caching system

00:52:05,939 --> 00:52:11,189
and we also revamped the storage system

00:52:08,339 --> 00:52:15,659
that was present earlier so that this

00:52:11,189 --> 00:52:17,219
loads around five times faster now then

00:52:15,659 --> 00:52:19,349
we have the fedora magazine so that your

00:52:17,219 --> 00:52:20,849
users can read the latest articles which

00:52:19,349 --> 00:52:23,009
means the interface for this as well

00:52:20,849 --> 00:52:27,509
there's the bookmarking option so you

00:52:23,009 --> 00:52:29,489
can read the articles offline yeah

00:52:27,509 --> 00:52:31,889
implementing this offline part was a

00:52:29,489 --> 00:52:33,239
challenge in itself like how long do you

00:52:31,889 --> 00:52:34,589
want to keep it and how do you

00:52:33,239 --> 00:52:38,069
synchronize with the updates that are

00:52:34,589 --> 00:52:40,439
happening on the website in the federal

00:52:38,069 --> 00:52:43,699
acts zine so it was a interesting part

00:52:40,439 --> 00:52:46,169
that we worked for around 2 weeks and

00:52:43,699 --> 00:52:47,839
then we have the as fedora so the users

00:52:46,169 --> 00:52:51,059
can browse through their doubts

00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:53,009
ok and so we segregated into three parts

00:52:51,059 --> 00:52:55,439
you can see the latest questions or what

00:52:53,009 --> 00:52:56,909
are the most uploaded doubts then we

00:52:55,439 --> 00:52:58,949
have the fedora calendar so you can see

00:52:56,909 --> 00:53:00,209
what were the past events and what are

00:52:58,949 --> 00:53:02,069
the upcoming events you can add the

00:53:00,209 --> 00:53:03,749
events to the calendar amatory improve

00:53:02,069 --> 00:53:07,019
the subscription manager so he'll talk

00:53:03,749 --> 00:53:08,549
about it yeah now you can see that there

00:53:07,019 --> 00:53:10,589
there is a button called

00:53:08,549 --> 00:53:13,889
add to calendar now when you click this

00:53:10,589 --> 00:53:15,599
button all the events of the same

00:53:13,889 --> 00:53:17,609
calendar or if you are clicking on the

00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:18,839
particular event then all the future

00:53:17,609 --> 00:53:20,969
occurrences of the event will be

00:53:18,839 --> 00:53:23,189
automatically synced to your phone now

00:53:20,969 --> 00:53:25,380
if the phone is connected to Google

00:53:23,189 --> 00:53:27,180
Calendar then you will get the same

00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:32,130
in all the devices that are synced to

00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:33,420
the same calendar then we added a few

00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:34,859
more features like the package search

00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:36,390
was there and we added a small section

00:53:34,859 --> 00:53:37,970
about the Fedora app I mean oh she will

00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:40,589
tell something about the package search

00:53:37,970 --> 00:53:42,210
so the package search lets you search

00:53:40,589 --> 00:53:44,249
the packages that is available on the

00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:46,739
federal repos so it will walk through

00:53:44,249 --> 00:53:48,960
the package the kind of package it is

00:53:46,739 --> 00:53:52,979
then the sub packages that are available

00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:56,460
and how to install it using DNF and a

00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:58,079
very short description of the package so

00:53:56,460 --> 00:54:00,059
this was something I've done it was the

00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:01,950
fedora podcast we integrated into app so

00:54:00,059 --> 00:54:04,829
the users can listen at anytime anywhere

00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:06,630
and this was something I worked on this

00:54:04,829 --> 00:54:08,130
with the added states in the app so we

00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:09,599
need to show some cool illustrations

00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:12,180
when there is no right hours if there is

00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:14,519
some error then these are some back-end

00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:17,329
features I'm toch will talk about it

00:54:14,519 --> 00:54:20,400
yeah I talked mostly about that all the

00:54:17,329 --> 00:54:23,249
while we are the morning the screens now

00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:26,210
we also didn't have a lot of unit tests

00:54:23,249 --> 00:54:29,160
and integration tests so I worked in

00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:31,109
implementing them now before at least we

00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:32,640
can actually be sure that every all of

00:54:31,109 --> 00:54:35,670
the screens are actually working and

00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:39,210
also when we started we were like around

00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:41,279
two or three religious behind and we

00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:44,880
migrated the old frameworks into the

00:54:41,279 --> 00:54:47,039
latest version of the code yeah so I

00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:48,569
guess that's all from us start you can

00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:51,589
start contributing to the app we really

00:54:48,569 --> 00:54:54,190
need someone to help us and thank you

00:54:51,589 --> 00:54:57,380
thank you leave someone in iOS

00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:57,380
[Applause]

00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:13,590
okay so next we have crease that we'll

00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:13,590
talk about today IOD atomic host upgrade

00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:21,040
hello everybody

00:55:16,090 --> 00:55:23,320
I'm Christian and I worked on the atomic

00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:27,400
host upgrade daemon which was ideated by

00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:38,890
Peter I'll just quickly open the or

00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:42,280
Steve okay yeah so it quickly came to

00:55:38,890 --> 00:55:44,920
well quickly became clear that we didn't

00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:46,990
want to write another big fat daemon to

00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:49,420
to do this kind of thing to enable

00:55:46,990 --> 00:55:52,360
automatic upgrades and fallbacks

00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:55,030
so we chose system D to do all the heavy

00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:57,130
lifting and I sort of had to look at the

00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:59,680
ecosystem and see what parts of this

00:55:57,130 --> 00:56:02,290
functionality we're missing still and

00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:05,380
what could be used from what projects

00:56:02,290 --> 00:56:08,410
so yeah this culminated in one project

00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:11,620
which is called green boot it's sort of

00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:15,250
for boot success determination you can

00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:20,860
define your own your own checks require

00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:23,200
checks which will make make the the boot

00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:25,060
status fail make it red when they fail

00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:26,920
at the required ones and the wanted ones

00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:29,680
which are optional tests which you can

00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:31,090
just sort of put in in the check section

00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:33,850
as well and then you have a green

00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:36,400
routine and a red routine which will

00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:40,150
sort of run red scripts or green scripts

00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:42,640
depending on your boot status yeah this

00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:45,070
is the project that sort of came from

00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:50,260
this that what change is required in

00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:52,360
grub to enable a yeah it's a we call the

00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:56,680
boot counting it's a boot attempt

00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:59,650
countdown so you can define a number X

00:56:56,680 --> 00:57:02,740
of boot attempts you will try one new

00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:05,170
entry and if that fails repeatedly for x

00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:06,390
times it'll automatically fall back to

00:57:05,170 --> 00:57:10,470
the older version to the sec

00:57:06,390 --> 00:57:12,329
buuut entry in grub so yeah I submitted

00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:13,950
a patch to grub which was actually has

00:57:12,329 --> 00:57:21,029
actually already been merged into the

00:57:13,950 --> 00:57:27,059
federal 29 branch of grub so yeah if you

00:57:21,029 --> 00:57:32,670
want to use this go to github alura's

00:57:27,059 --> 00:57:35,460
Chris a green boot green boot and check

00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:38,940
it out if you have any tests in mind

00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:41,819
this is obviously very useful for for

00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:45,089
the IOT stuff testing sensors and

00:57:41,819 --> 00:57:47,819
running just tests if you have any any

00:57:45,089 --> 00:57:51,380
specific tests in mind I'm I'm very

00:57:47,819 --> 00:57:54,869
happy to accept tests sort of general

00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:56,490
generally useful tests into this there's

00:57:54,869 --> 00:57:59,010
already a sub Packer there's already a

00:57:56,490 --> 00:58:00,690
few sub-packages in this one it's not

00:57:59,010 --> 00:58:04,260
yet in the federal repos it's on copper

00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:07,799
so you can get have enable lower bus /

00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:12,210
green boot to install it mmm it'll be an

00:58:07,799 --> 00:58:15,420
inferior very soon I hope yeah give me

00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:20,180
I'm yeah very open to feedback put it

00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:20,180
under some scrutiny yeah

00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:28,760
and the last one is Mary that she did

00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:36,090
the outreach

00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:39,240
internship in 2013 for federal badges hi

00:58:36,090 --> 00:58:42,330
everybody so I'm just gonna take the few

00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:47,100
moments that I've been given to talk

00:58:42,330 --> 00:58:50,340
about myself as a success story I did

00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:53,850
outreach in 2013 as they said and my

00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:57,840
mentor was mismo and she was amazing I

00:58:53,850 --> 00:59:04,140
can't speak highly enough about how she

00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:05,580
worked with me so I think beyond just we

00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:07,530
had kind of established like this is how

00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:09,930
we're gonna work we met once a week it

00:59:07,530 --> 00:59:12,420
it that part was kind of just like easy

00:59:09,930 --> 00:59:16,110
cuz I'm very self-motivated and there

00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:19,380
was a lot to do but I think beyond the

00:59:16,110 --> 00:59:22,830
actual internship I think it's really

00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:27,030
important for mentors to encourage their

00:59:22,830 --> 00:59:30,750
students to or mentees to come to events

00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:33,390
like flock or you know any other event

00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:36,000
that might be applicable so I had done

00:59:33,390 --> 00:59:38,460
the internship and I had really only

00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,650
interacted with her and a few other

00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:45,390
people on tickets I had never used

00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:48,090
Fedora before I don't write code even

00:59:45,390 --> 00:59:50,160
still but I found a place here in this

00:59:48,090 --> 00:59:57,480
community and that was because of mismo

00:59:50,160 --> 01:00:01,020
so she she encouraged me to go to flock

00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:04,260
in 2014 and speak about what I had done

01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:07,590
speak about my internship and so I came

01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:10,470
to that that conference and it was an

01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:13,500
amazing experience I I felt a little

01:00:10,470 --> 01:00:14,820
alone because I'm not a developer so

01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,960
that that experience is a little tough

01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:17,100
it would have been great if she were

01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:20,820
there I think that would have made it

01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:23,130
even better but I started talking to the

01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:24,720
people in the community and everyone was

01:00:23,130 --> 01:00:27,570
like what you did this you know we've

01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:29,460
been seeing this this is awesome and you

01:00:27,570 --> 01:00:31,230
know I had those moments to start making

01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:33,030
friendships which I think we all know

01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:37,080
that that's one of the biggest parts

01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:39,180
about Fedora so you know encouraging

01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:42,600
and kind of keeping a relationship with

01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:45,630
your mentee after the internship is over

01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:47,900
I think is really important checking in

01:00:45,630 --> 01:00:50,430
checking in with them if you can

01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:52,650
encouraging them to do other events or

01:00:50,430 --> 01:00:56,430
get involved in others in other aspects

01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:59,040
so after I did Fedora badges then Moe

01:00:56,430 --> 01:01:00,840
you know encouraged me to get involved

01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:02,910
in the design team and hey do you want

01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:04,860
to do this ticket do you want to do this

01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:08,900
thing and hey do you want to come to the

01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:11,220
fad and so it you know she continued to

01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:13,410
look after me a little bit and

01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:16,830
encouraged me until I I really felt

01:01:13,410 --> 01:01:20,580
comfortable in the community and I think

01:01:16,830 --> 01:01:23,850
it for outreach am a success story you

01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:26,070
know I'm still here five years later you

01:01:23,850 --> 01:01:29,250
know running Fedora badges on the design

01:01:26,070 --> 01:01:31,550
and and so I really attribute all of

01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:34,860
that to mismo and and her awesome

01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:41,280
mentoring so that's that's really all I

01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:43,320
want to say so I know that we are

01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:46,170
running out of time or we are already

01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:48,630
very late but I want to ask all the

01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:52,200
students to come and ask them only one

01:01:48,630 --> 01:01:54,000
question because I think that all of us

01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:56,300
are interested to know the challenges

01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:59,580
that they had during their internship

01:01:56,300 --> 01:02:03,930
how I don't know how you solved it or

01:01:59,580 --> 01:02:07,580
what you learn for from this experience

01:02:03,930 --> 01:02:07,580
who wants to start

01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:14,750
yet for me the the most challenging

01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:17,990
thing was actually communication dusty

01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:20,210
mentioned it already because I had to

01:02:17,990 --> 01:02:22,579
sort of look into different projects

01:02:20,210 --> 01:02:25,520
outside of Fedora even a systemd and

01:02:22,579 --> 01:02:27,710
grew up I was sort of it was required

01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:30,820
that their maintenance gave me input and

01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:32,780
that was at times a bit frustrating but

01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:35,359
communication is key and that's

01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:40,880
definitely what I learned to communicate

01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:42,140
more than less and then things just get

01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:44,660
worked out even if you have to wait a

01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:47,570
few days maybe for a reply eventually

01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:50,270
someone will will give you some feedback

01:02:47,570 --> 01:02:52,700
and then you can sort of go ahead with

01:02:50,270 --> 01:02:54,770
your work and yeah not to get frustrated

01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:57,829
by this kind of thing that's definitely

01:02:54,770 --> 01:03:00,200
what I learned and also in general how

01:02:57,829 --> 01:03:02,359
community works what-what that there are

01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:07,609
that many communication channels mailing

01:03:02,359 --> 01:03:10,010
lists IRC even yeah what's called

01:03:07,609 --> 01:03:12,380
discourse so there's just so many

01:03:10,010 --> 01:03:16,069
channels you can you can get in fro form

01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:19,359
from it's just you know it's just

01:03:16,069 --> 01:03:22,790
important to learn about all of them and

01:03:19,359 --> 01:03:26,390
see who's on what channel and stuff like

01:03:22,790 --> 01:03:27,859
that so adding to what Christian said I

01:03:26,390 --> 01:03:29,660
basically learned the power of

01:03:27,859 --> 01:03:30,890
collaboration so we've - both were

01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:32,119
working together he was working on the

01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:34,819
backend I was working on the front end

01:03:32,119 --> 01:03:38,060
sometimes I had to wait for him so he

01:03:34,819 --> 01:03:39,920
had I so he can do some stuff there were

01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:41,900
some blockers so I really learned how to

01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:45,940
work in a team this was something I

01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:49,100
wanted to share but sue

01:03:45,940 --> 01:03:50,390
so in my part I had a completely

01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:52,880
different set of challenges than they

01:03:50,390 --> 01:03:54,650
did so one of the interesting thing that

01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:57,200
I was sitting and solving was

01:03:54,650 --> 01:03:59,080
localization so there was just so many

01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:01,190
data and time formers and so many

01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:04,670
expectations of different kinds of

01:04:01,190 --> 01:04:06,590
people around the world now I was living

01:04:04,670 --> 01:04:10,040
in a time zone where we do not observe

01:04:06,590 --> 01:04:13,490
DST but I wanted to test how the app

01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:15,350
actually ran in DST so that test was

01:04:13,490 --> 01:04:17,810
continuing till the day I had that block

01:04:15,350 --> 01:04:20,300
so since I separate from a non DST ODST

01:04:17,810 --> 01:04:22,400
and I'm happy that my work my app and

01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:24,380
the code works perfectly and that was

01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:27,590
one interesting challenge that I had and

01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:30,560
the second challenge is this is a very

01:04:27,590 --> 01:04:31,910
well-known fridge too different too

01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:34,910
difficult stuffs in computer science

01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:36,680
cash validation and naming things so

01:04:34,910 --> 01:04:39,290
cache invalidation was some challenge

01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:42,260
that was like it was working sometimes

01:04:39,290 --> 01:04:44,360
it wasn't then when we did some quote

01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:46,190
pushes and did some Mudge's then the

01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:48,050
cash validation logic totally went hey

01:04:46,190 --> 01:04:50,270
where so then again I had to sit and fix

01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:59,540
it but that was one one challenge that I

01:04:50,270 --> 01:05:01,160
had to solve so I will say just one

01:04:59,540 --> 01:05:04,850
quick thing and it's about the

01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:08,180
application process and I strongly

01:05:04,850 --> 01:05:10,460
advise all the students to actually

01:05:08,180 --> 01:05:13,400
start contributing to project before

01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:17,869
application period even like one month

01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:20,000
two months before because because that

01:05:17,869 --> 01:05:21,920
is what I think mentors wants to see

01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,820
that you really contribute to the

01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:24,820
project before

01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:33,760
besides the communication thing like he

01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:36,400
said I actually one of the plugin Django

01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:38,860
klunkins had a bug on it so I couldn't

01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:40,510
continue and that was a blocker so what

01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:42,310
happened is I opened up an issue and

01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:44,410
it's tough for like a one month and then

01:05:42,310 --> 01:05:45,880
I was like you know what I have to fix

01:05:44,410 --> 01:05:49,360
this I need to like get this done for

01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:52,000
Chuseok immediately but besides that I

01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:54,850
had like get very creative with the

01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:58,420
people like who I asked questions again

01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:59,710
like bad look for help because I live in

01:05:58,420 --> 01:06:02,800
a different time zone yeah I got like

01:05:59,710 --> 01:06:04,720
this whole G sock they were in Germany I

01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:06,400
was in India and then like not India

01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:08,320
like Dallas I don't live there anymore

01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:10,210
yeah Dallas so we had totally different

01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:12,820
time zone so I had like make a list of

01:06:10,210 --> 01:06:14,560
these questions which I posted up in the

01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:18,070
middle of the night and when I wake up

01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:21,010
next morning they're all answered so

01:06:18,070 --> 01:06:23,080
yeah like it was for me is like a bit of

01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:25,240
a balancing work time management and

01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:27,850
just being judicious with time and

01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:29,170
planning beforehand you know because I

01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:33,760
had to keep in mind that we had a

01:06:29,170 --> 01:06:36,310
different time zone yeah and what's next

01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:38,560
for you like in Fedora hour in general

01:06:36,310 --> 01:06:44,320
now that you are finishing the

01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:47,140
internship I am already a federal

01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:49,660
contributor since last two years so I'll

01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:52,500
definitely be continuing in the area so

01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:55,210
I have now this project got me

01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:56,920
introduced with some other interesting

01:06:55,210 --> 01:06:58,810
projects that we have mostly in the

01:06:56,920 --> 01:07:02,650
infrared so I have been contributing

01:06:58,810 --> 01:07:04,600
there - so I'll be probably working on

01:07:02,650 --> 01:07:06,490
the app itself and if anyone in the

01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:13,420
federal community needs help with UI or

01:07:06,490 --> 01:07:15,400
something just hit me up so yeah I'm

01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:17,200
definitely like God if you continue

01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:19,930
contributing because my work is not done

01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:21,400
further appreciation week is gonna

01:07:19,930 --> 01:07:23,800
happen like in a few months from now but

01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:25,990
I've been so inspired like start

mentoring for Jesus and outreach for

01:07:25,990 --> 01:07:31,040
this year

01:07:28,450 --> 01:07:34,460
yeah for me it's all so I'm gonna keep

01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:36,680
maintaining green boot and hopefully add

01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:39,560
lots of things to it and make it really

01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:44,830
useful I'll stay a member of the atomic

01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:49,240
or nowadays core OS favourite core OS

container that's gonna there's going to

01:07:58,490 --> 01:08:04,640
be the new build system for 4 core OS

01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:06,470
and all the OS 3 based editions of

01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:10,820
failure which I'm really interested in I

01:08:06,470 --> 01:08:14,960
just love that tag yeah so I will

01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:17,120
continue to maintain the co new and also

01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:20,500
I will be somewhere around the

01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:27,230
containers in fedora and next year's

01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:29,570
months maybe so thank you for all the

01:08:27,230 --> 01:08:31,790
