Talk: Befriending the elephant in the room: Fedora/RHEL kernel
Presenters: Laura Abbot, Stef Tobias Walter

Description: Fedora serves as an important part of the development process for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), despite the two distributions having different focuses and development processes. The kernel in particular has long diverged to an extreme degree between RHEL and Fedora. There’s an increased interest to make Fedora more useful as a RHEL upstream by sharing a common kernel. The focus of this talk is to explain why Red Hat wants to synchronize with Fedora, what’s going to change and how this will be beneficial to both RHEL and Fedora.
