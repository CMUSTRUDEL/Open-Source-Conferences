Talk: Improving Fedora Compose process
Presenters: Lubos Sedlar, Mohan Boddu

Description: Fedora's compose process creates deliverables such as bootable isos, installation trees, and more. Release Engineering want to reduce the compose process from today's eight hour minimum to something allowing faster iteration.

The community is invited to listen to our proposals and share their own ideas about how to make composes faster. We can all benefit from more consistently usable nightly rawhide composes and faster respins for testers during the development freeze.
