Talk: Desktop testing using dogtail and behave
Presenters: Petr Schindler

Description: I'd like to describe how desktop applications are tested in Red Hat's DesktopQE team. I started with upstreaming tests and would like to introduce them to QA community so they can participate in creation of automation of desktop testing in Fedora.

In the talk I'll show how tests written in behave look like and how to write a new one. I'll also show how to use At-spi browser and ipython to find UI elements of application we want to test and how to simulate user actions with dogtail.
