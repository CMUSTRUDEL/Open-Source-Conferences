Talk: Imposter Syndrome Workshop and Unconscious Bias Training
Presenters: Jona Azizaj, Justin W. Flory, Bee Padalkar, Amita Sharma

Description: This session will involve a one hour Imposter Syndrome workshop followed by an hour long Unconscious Bias training.

What is Imposter Syndrome and why we need to discuss it?
Impostor Syndrome is the feeling that you aren’t actually qualified for the work you are doing and will be discovered as a fraud. It is prevalent amongst a lot of members of open tech/culture, especially people from underrepresented backgrounds, many of whom have been socialised to value other’s opinion of their work above their own, and to do things “by the book.”

What to expect from attending the Imposter Syndrome workshop?
The workshop will enable attendees to understand, identify and talk about impostor syndrome and provide some guidelines on managing it during our day-to-day life.

What to expect from Unconscious Bias training and why is it relevant?
People make, and sometimes act on, snap judgments based on the other person’s race, without any conscious intention. The training will begin with demonstrations of how the mind operates in such ways that are outside of conscious awareness or control. We will then move on to enable attendees to understand and identify such interactions in their daily life and will provide suggestions on how to be more inclusive in such collaborative environments. I feel that in a diverse and collaborative community like Fedora, it is important for us to be able to learn to identify our implicit biases in order to have effective and inclusive communication.

Further notes:

The Imposter Syndrome Workshop and Unconscious Bias Training will be adapted from training resources and guidelines from Ada Initiative and Google from Fedora community and my prior experience in this area. I am welcome to suggestions about more resources.

This session is a part of Diversity and Inclusion Team activities and we feel that conducting this workshop and training at FLOCK will allow us to have a wider and better impact on Fedora community in these directions.

Attendees are welcome to attend either of the sessions individually i.e. You can join/leave at the one hour mark when the second session begins. The first session will be Imposter Syndrome workshop. The second session will be Unconscious Bias training.

opportunity to kind of show some of our

00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,530
own biases that we bring in to working

00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,700
in open source project communities and

00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:45,360
becoming more aware and conscious of

00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:47,130
those biases and spoiler alert - you'll

I said this earlier but we would really

00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:13,739
appreciate if you sit along the center

00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:20,850
instead of being so distributed and yeah

00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:23,489
it would be really nice exactly see I

00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:26,910

00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:36,690
this is the agenda of the workshop we

00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:39,209
have what is the impostor syndrome and

00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:41,400
unconscious bias we got to talk about it

00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:45,470
a little more in detail we all know

00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,470
about the definition aware about it

00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:53,400
am i audible okay so we know about the

00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,260
definitions of course but we're gonna

00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,989
gonna go deeper about it if we're gonna

00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:00,269
know more facts about it and we will

00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:03,000
explore ourselves if if there are any

00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:05,459
symptoms we have about these things or

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,340
the people around us what to expect from

00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:10,890
this workshop there are lots of game

00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,510
we're gonna play so usually in the

00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:16,170
session or all of the sessions you are

00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:17,910
sitting at your place and just listening

00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:19,769
to one person so this is not going to

00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:23,669
happen in this workshop you need

00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:26,460
to move a little bit and I increase the

00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:29,460
steps on your raw whatever your you are

00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:31,800

00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:34,289
ready for that be little active you had

00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:37,770
a coffee why do we need to talk about it

00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:40,650
in fedora so we had a fantastic talk

00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:43,860
from Rebecca and we know that well the

00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:46,919
problems exist right so but we always

00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:49,560
try to ignore them or just try to deny

00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:53,039
them so that should not be the case we

00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,720
we should Excel you know we should be

00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:57,270
aware about that these problems or

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,250
issues exists and that is why we are

00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,810
here the open source communities and the

00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,639
people in the open source community who

00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:04,620
are the contributor they have they faced

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,240
these challenges or the issues so that

00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:09,720
is why we would like to discuss these

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,520
things here in this workshop how can we

00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,349
manage such feelings in our day to day

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,380
life so we're going to give some tips

00:05:13,349 --> 00:05:18,479
and you will you know come to know after

00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:22,229
doing some of the activities about these

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:24,840
tips and I just quickly want to add that

00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:26,969
we are so glad that you are all here and

00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,550
that you want to be a part of this

00:05:26,969 --> 00:05:32,520
workshop so we feel that you at least

00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:35,099
recognize this a little bit but even if

00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:39,120
you don't we have like a few slides to

00:05:35,099 --> 00:05:42,330
explain you what it is right so this is

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:47,039
for no heads-up that not everything you

00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:48,810
try today will feel comfortable so well

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,880
it is nothing to scare you

00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:53,909
but the activities we gonna do the

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,009
things we would relate with are the

00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:59,069
things which you will do and make you

00:05:56,009 --> 00:06:00,630
think about your past or the things that

00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:03,599
you encounter you have encountered in

00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:05,969
your life may you may become emotional

00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:08,250
about that stuff like that so there is

00:06:05,969 --> 00:06:09,569
nothing like that to hide or you know

00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,940
feel uncomfortable about it

00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:15,860
even if you do that please feel free to

00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,860
take a moment and for yourself

00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:24,600
okay so now we'll start the imposter

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:28,470
syndrome workshop it will be about an

00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:30,389
hour or so and yeah yeah so this program

00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:33,780
is divided into two part first we will

00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:35,850
talk about the impostor syndrome we have

00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:37,710
few slides and then we have a activity

00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:39,720
for the imposter syndrome and then we'll

00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:42,270
have a small break and then we'll talk

00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,500
about the unconscious bias what it is

00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,270
all about and then we'll have the

00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,699
activities related to the unconscious

00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:50,940
bias okay so what is exactly the

00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:53,940
impostor syndrome any of you my or would

00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:56,160
like to talk about it what what do you

00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:57,660
feel what it is all about I know that a

00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,740
definition is there and you are reading

00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:04,440
very fast but still deep inside what do

00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:09,630
you think what it is are may by show of

00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:13,099
hands how many felt that like you don't

00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:16,080
deserve the opportunity that you had

00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:18,900
okay why is it why am I the person oh

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,030
yes why am I here why am i this imposter

00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,949
why I'm such a fake what are they gonna

00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,699
find out that I'm a fraud I have no idea

00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:30,630
what I'm doing

00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:34,260
so I know for me exactly so that is what

00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:36,630
it is we all face so this is an emotion

00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:39,539
human emotion that you face it in your

00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:41,580
life once toys or more than that or you

00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:43,710
are in that phase that you are feeling

00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:45,690
it it's a feeling it's natural

00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:50,190
so nothing to hide about it and nothing

00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:53,300
to ashamed about it right so we gonna

00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:55,500
learn about it why activity is more

00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:58,020
instead of just reading through the

00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,570
slides and here is one picture in the

00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:02,760
next slide which be like the Lord that's

00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:06,090
why I put it in the slide and she would

00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:08,430
like to explain it yes so how many of

00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:11,099
you have ever felt something about this

00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:15,440
that you were talking about some topic

00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:18,419
with your friend or your coworker and

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,550
you said some a few things but you still

00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:22,590
felt like you didn't know much about the

00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:25,200
issue maybe it was about politics or

00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:27,779
some International Affairs or just music

00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,669
or anything and you felt like you were

00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:30,270
just going on and on about something you

00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:32,760
didn't know

00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:38,580
like just show your hands if you if you

00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:43,800
have ever felt like this yeah yeah baby

00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:47,690
it flog a few times okay so I have found

00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:51,390
this a lot too that's why I like this I

00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:53,160
like this image and I feel like this is

00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:55,709
like a good representation of how

00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:59,220
imposter syndrome catches us in our

00:08:55,709 --> 00:09:01,470
daily lives like we don't realize it

00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:03,690
what's happening but we start feeling

00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:05,430
ashamed of ourselves or that we don't

00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:08,190
know enough stuff to talk about

00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:10,560
with other people so this is just one of

00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:14,640
those impostor syndrome moments which I

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:20,160
wanted to show you okay so this picture

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:21,899
says a lot if you see we the people who

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,390
are going through this phase or feeling

00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:27,240
that they think that they don't know

00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:29,820
much about the topic but the rest of the

00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,899
world is to come accomplished they know

00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:35,459
that stuff they are talking about it and

00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:38,940
they know everything and the moment you

00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:40,890
start feeling that I meant unconfident I

00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:43,890
mean not very confident about yourself

00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:47,820
and that that is the moment you start

00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:51,660
you know stop even participating in in

00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:55,230
the conversations for example there was

00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:57,870
a meeting last night I was in and there

00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,970
was a topic going on about containers

00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:03,959
and many people were talking about it

00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:05,970
and I was like I felt little withdrawn

00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:08,220
from the discussion that I owe

00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:11,130
oh my god these are the geek people they

00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:13,020
are talking something very rocket

00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:15,810
science and then the moment came okay

00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:17,610
I also use the container and III can

00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:19,350
probably talk about a sentence or two

00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:21,779
and then I was not feeling very

00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:24,209
confident that I should speak about it

00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:26,730
or not and I was just thinking about it

00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:28,890
and then the other person does spoke

00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:32,579
about the same sentence which I was

00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:36,300
about to talk so for that time period I

00:10:32,579 --> 00:10:38,640
was in this feeling and this is the

00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:41,070
feeling which can come and go this can

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,480
be a phase where you are in for a longer

00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:45,280
time or this can be the

00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,900
which you have been facing your life

00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:49,510
long since your childhood because of

00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:51,880
some incidents okay especially if it's

00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:55,240
something like this how many of you have

00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:57,130
ever felt like everybody else has their

00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,590
careers figured out their life plan

00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:01,840
figured out like they know they want to

00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:03,610
have babies they want to get married or

00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:06,670
like they know what they want to do in

00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:08,710
their life till they're old but you just

00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:10,960
feel like you're just going through Dave

00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:12,430
on a day-by-day basis like you just know

00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,230
what you want to do for the next 24

00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:15,730
hours or just like this week this week

00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:17,860
I'm just completely going to concentrate

00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:20,080
on vlog and I don't know what I'm going

00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:22,600
to do after have you ever felt like this

00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,500
so just like show your hands if you feel

00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,320
like this before

00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:29,080
so yeah so this is another relate

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:32,530
example of how imposter syndrome catches

00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:34,000
you when you are not aware of it and you

00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:35,860
feel like everybody has everything

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,380
sorted out in their life their life is

00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:40,840
very nice and just you know breezing

00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:44,260
through but I am struggling with my

00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:46,090
daily efforts or with my tasks so this

00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:48,400
is just a case of impostor syndrome this

00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:50,470
happens with everyone like this is a

00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,840
short disclaimer it will come to that

00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:54,670
later but don't feel worried this

00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:57,400
happens with everyone this is not just

00:11:54,670 --> 00:12:00,670
you and we will realize that in a few

00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:03,430
more slides yeah and to add to that is

00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:06,760
it is okay to be silly sometimes it's

00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:09,370
it's okay to talk your mind and even if

00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:12,190
you don't don't feel like it is correct

00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:14,830
or not it it's okay to be silly so you

00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:17,080
have to accept yourself how it is you

00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:20,650
cannot have all the knowledge in the

00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:23,590
world of all the topics so it's okay to

00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:26,370
not to know few things so don't you

00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:29,230
don't have to feel negative about that

00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:30,160
so next slide do you feel like you are

00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:32,260
faking it

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,750
I mean you are into a job which you have

00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:37,450
been doing since pages I mean many years

00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:40,480
and and then suddenly you start thinking

00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:44,440
okay I'm no normal good fit for this job

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:46,420
I'm just seeking it and what if my boss

00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,580
figure it out I will be kicked out of

00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:51,870
the job and then carrying that baggage

00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:55,750
and the fear almost every day about it

00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:56,320
do you think you can relate just show

00:12:55,750 --> 00:13:01,270
your hand

00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:04,420
quickly so so they're quite a few hands

00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:08,470
for all of these different examples of

00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:10,300
impostor syndrome so we know that some

00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:12,370
of us are feeling it so we are going to

00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:17,650
play a quick game so that we can

00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:20,920
identify when we get caught with the

00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:22,300
Sims symptoms all I mean the game will

00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:25,030
help us realize what are these

00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:28,150
situations which can which lead us to

00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:30,940
feel feeling like an impostor and also

00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:33,610
sometimes we see a person is very

00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:36,370
confident sometimes overconfident and

00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:38,500
when she or he says that I'm feeling

00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:41,560
impostor syndrome I or I'm facing this

00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,970
phase in my life we say okay but you

00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:46,270
seem very confident even the

00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:48,280
overconfident sometimes so this is the

00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:51,490
side effect of the impostor syndrome if

00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:53,650
the person deep inside feeling not very

00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:56,020
confident they tend to show these

00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:58,360
symptoms that they are very confident I

00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:00,580
mean they are they start faking it so

00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:03,910
that is another side effect so it's a

00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:06,070
game-time so you have a paper which Jana

00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:10,660
is distributing and I'll hand over the

00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:13,090
mic to be to take it so I hope you are

00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:16,990
all excited for this game have you ever

00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:19,630
played bingo before oh yeah so it's like

00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:22,690
a bingo for imposter syndrome but we

00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:25,750
have a few modifications to the game we

00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:28,870
will call out the statement and if you

00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:31,060
have ever felt like that before we want

00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:33,040
you to cross it out or if that statement

00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:36,670
applies to you you should cross it out

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:39,840
and we will stop the game when we cover

00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:43,410
like a majority of these statements and

00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:46,060
after that we will just like do some

00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:49,060
introspecting and show of hands to see

00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:52,960
how other people feel too so if you ever

00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:55,660
feel like uncomfortable being a part of

00:14:52,960 --> 00:15:01,030
this game just feel free to take a

00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:03,270
moment for yourself and I mean maybe you

00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:05,650
don't want to cross out something so

00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:07,810
ideally we would like you to be truthful

00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:08,420
to yourselves but if you don't feel like

00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:12,110
it we

00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:22,490
we encourage you to just you know take a

00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:26,150
moment the prices okay it's a secret we

00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:28,970
are not going to know okay so are you

00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:31,780
ready to start the game do you all have

00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:35,240
the paper for the bingo and a pen I

00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:37,580
think it's a very exciting game and it

00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,440
will let you think about yourself more

00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:41,600
this is the time that you think or

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,480
introspect your own feelings so don't

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,800
hesitate to play it honestly and I am

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,410
also playing with you people

00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:52,660
yeah we are all also playing with you so

00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:52,660
you will know how we felt in this game

00:15:55,090 --> 00:16:02,890
okay so is everyone ready

00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:06,730
cool so the first statement is that I

00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:10,970
should feel lucky to have gotten into

00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:13,670
school the job the promotion etc have

00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:17,590
you ever felt like this if you have felt

00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:17,590
like this just cross out the box

00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:33,250
yeah so I'm repeating the statement I

00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:38,760
should feel lucky to have gotten into

00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:38,760
the school the job the promotion etc

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:47,770
does anyone want me to repeat it or did

00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:52,990
you get it okay so yes so the second

00:16:47,770 --> 00:17:01,030
statement is I always hold back when

00:16:52,990 --> 00:17:04,089
working in a group or a team always hold

00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:06,250
back when working in a group or in so if

00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:14,230
you have felt like this before or you

00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:17,400
feel like yeah you don't you don't voice

00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:17,400
your opinions

00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:48,280
yeah the communication part so the

00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:50,680
question he asked is what is the meaning

00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:53,290
of the holding back here so when you

00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:55,240
have doubt on yourself in in spite of

00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:57,730
that you know about the topic but still

00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,500
you hold back to share your opinion and

00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:01,990
come and don't communicate

00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:04,090
for example the I have shared one

00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:07,150
example with you about the meeting where

00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:09,040
I know I was aware of the subject but

00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:11,290
why I was holding back a little bit

00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:13,390
because I have seen people who are much

00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:16,120
more aware about the topic and I mean

00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:18,250
they developed that product so I was

00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:20,530
little holding back that I may or may

00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:22,300
not be correct about the statement I am

00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:28,270
going to make so that is the holding

00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:30,970
back here okay so the other statement

00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:33,940
have you ever said to yourself I should

00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:36,640
be able to do everything myself so I

00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:43,090
don't need others to help me and I can

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:47,250
just do this alone so the statement is I

00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:47,250
should be able to do everything myself

00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:58,390
should we continue okay so the next one

00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:05,830
never tell someone you met in a bar you

00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:09,910
are an engineering math or science mayor

00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:13,310
so have you here we just don't want to

00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:15,440
like it might be a bar or it might be a

00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:17,870
stranger like you never tell someone

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,550
some stranger you met like on the first

00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:23,210
conversation that you are an engineering

00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:25,370
maths or science major and yeah because

00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:27,800
you feel probably that person would be

00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:33,830
better than you and you just don't say

00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:36,530
this in the beginning with the example

00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:39,320
that if you walk in the bar and you say

00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:42,860
that I am the doctor or engineer or I am

00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:45,530
I'm the modular modularity engineer and

00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:48,230
the person may start asking you the

00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:50,750
questions yeah okay and you have the

00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:53,780
fear what if I won't have the answers to

00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:57,350
his questions so that is holding you

00:19:53,780 --> 00:20:00,620
back from disclosing your identity if

00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:02,480
you feel like telling others that you

00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:04,940
are a science or engineering major is

00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,250
basically pigeonholing you into a

00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:11,030
concept or into a stereotype which you

00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:15,050
don't want to belong to okay so can we

00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:17,300
move like to I share the joke well I

00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:24,400
would you like to share the joke what

00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:24,400
was it I want alliance please if you can

00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:36,460
[Laughter]

00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:43,880
[Music]

00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:54,990
so the next one I should succeed at

00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:59,200
everything I do

00:20:54,990 --> 00:21:01,510
because you are afraid to fail and you

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:07,510
think that you need to succeed on all

00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:13,450
the things that you do I should succeed

00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:25,960
at everything I do and just feel free to

00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:28,800
say bingo when you hit bingo okay okay

00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:31,990
so moving on the next one is like I

00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:35,590
should be able to anticipate problems

00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:39,490
before they occur if you have ever faced

00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:41,800
like this like if I should be able to

00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:44,130
anticipate problems before they occur so

00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:48,010
this might be related to your work like

00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:50,440
some product crashing or some bugs or

00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:52,720
something or that maybe you could have

00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:55,510
coded it better to avoid that fault if

00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:58,020
you have ever felt like this then just

00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:58,020
cross it out

00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:10,660
okay so moving on I always share credit

00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:13,750
with others even if you did all the work

00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:15,880
so the statement is always share credit

00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:19,150
with others even if you did all the work

00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:22,300
so if you have ever done this maybe at

00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:24,940
your university or school projects your

00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:26,440
school projects team projects where you

00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:30,040
know your friends don't do nothing but

00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:45,490
you will put their names and get credit

00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:48,760
for them yeah no bingos yet okay so next

00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:53,190
one is always assumed you will fail so

00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:53,190
you will not be disappointed when you do

00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:58,720
I'm going to repeat it always assume you

00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:04,960
will fail so you will not be

00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:07,150
disappointed when you do so this is

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,610
basically about scholarships or like say

00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:12,370
job applications where you feel like you

00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:16,470
won't get the opportunity so you just

00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:16,470
set up a negative mindset for yourself

00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:24,940
okay so next one I always panic before a

00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:32,740
test presentation performance or

00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:34,480
interview so I'm going to be truthful

00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:38,610
I'm going to cross this out because I

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,610
panic before this workshop a lot

00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:55,070
yeah it is always so always always you

00:23:47,149 --> 00:23:58,460
have to follow it okay and okay so the

00:23:55,070 --> 00:24:02,619
next one is I was admitted or hired

00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:05,619
because of some kind of mistake

00:24:02,619 --> 00:24:05,619
yeah

00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:16,300
I mean there was any any any yeah yeah

00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:19,290
yeah so horizontal vertical slanting but

00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:22,480
it should all be in a line you know yeah

00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:25,090
so the statement is I was admitted or

00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,520
hired because of some kind of mistake so

00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:31,000
maybe in your university you felt like

00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:33,100
you didn't deserve the chance to go to

00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,420
that university or in your job you felt

00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:37,720
like it was some kind of mistake

00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:40,060
to get that position maybe some glitch

00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,740
in the system or something so if you

00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:50,140
have ever faced like this just cross it

00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:54,810
out okay so no bingos okay next one I

00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:54,810
never never challenge yourself too much

00:24:55,770 --> 00:25:00,100
so the statement is that you never

00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:04,360
challenge yourself too much maybe at

00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:15,070
work or just in studies or in personal

00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:21,430
life or everything the next one never

00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:23,380
show up men especially yeah never show

00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:26,770
up men especially so it basically means

00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:30,010
that you never talk back to men I guess

00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:31,660
this relates more to women who'd be like

00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:34,810
an impostor and they never talk back to

00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:37,510
other people so we are giving all the

00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:39,430
girls out there an extra chance if they

00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:44,400
have ever felt it you know to get ahead

00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:44,400
or anyone we know you're near

00:25:47,429 --> 00:25:51,029
I think it's probably okay if there is

00:25:49,499 --> 00:25:52,799
some flexibility that you know doesn't

00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:54,690
have to be always or never but if you

00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:57,210
have identified you felt this way before

00:25:54,690 --> 00:26:00,210
I think a lot of times not just like

00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:01,950
once something is not every time it's

00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:05,219
not always it's not never

00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:10,469
but like most often it's it's still okay

00:26:05,219 --> 00:26:16,019
to cross the space so then there are at

00:26:10,469 --> 00:26:18,359
that points like yeah the next one is I

00:26:16,019 --> 00:26:24,899
always apologize for mistakes or for not

00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:34,229
knowing something I know I do

00:26:24,899 --> 00:26:40,769
especially with my family but okay so

00:26:34,229 --> 00:26:43,139
the next one is like I always assume

00:26:40,769 --> 00:26:45,809
when people are complimenting you that

00:26:43,139 --> 00:26:47,190
they are just being nice like you don't

00:26:45,809 --> 00:26:50,070
deserve it and they're just being nice

00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:52,409
and telling you that about the

00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:56,309
compliment that you deserved it or like

00:26:52,409 --> 00:26:59,309
you got it and so on are you sure

00:26:56,309 --> 00:27:02,869
they're no bingos yet and purposefully

00:26:59,309 --> 00:27:02,869
trying to avoid my bingo here

00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:14,809
what the last session when people are

00:27:12,739 --> 00:27:17,049
complimenting you they are just being

00:27:14,809 --> 00:27:17,049
nice

00:27:18,369 --> 00:27:26,659
no straight lines horizontal lines like

00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:30,860
slant lines somewhere they're just okay

00:27:26,659 --> 00:27:33,799
so the next one is I never make

00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:37,759
declarative sentences statements like I

00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:39,590
know the answer so if you have like if

00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:41,179
you never confidently say that you know

00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:46,279
the solution or the answer or you never

00:27:41,179 --> 00:27:53,899
boys up if even if you know it then yeah

00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:57,320
most of the time is okay nobody wants it

00:27:53,899 --> 00:28:13,220
we are just going to take it the next

00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:15,109
one is okay so you are always attribute

00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:21,950
your accomplishments to something other

00:28:15,109 --> 00:28:26,179
than yourself cross it out people cross

00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:28,549
out things let us know okay so the one

00:28:26,179 --> 00:28:35,869
after that is you do not let people see

00:28:28,549 --> 00:28:37,609
you studying or working too hard do not

00:28:35,869 --> 00:28:40,539
let people see you studying or working

00:28:37,609 --> 00:28:40,539
in too hard

00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:47,850
how'd you surely have

00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:57,850
okay maybe this is like just the last

00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:01,470
two if you don't get a bingo in this

00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:19,300
nobody gets surprised like we leave it

00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:23,680
yeah we take the prize so we have a

00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:24,430
special candy for you but we will give

00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:28,210
it to you later

00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:30,900
after the workshop nice you went because

00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:30,900
of this right

00:29:47,190 --> 00:30:07,770
I feel happy anybody else who would like

00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:10,530
to share their experience while playing

00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:13,170
this game would like to share some

00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:15,600
example which are relevant to any of

00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:18,510
these statements we encourage you to

00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:21,870
come over here or speak about it so that

00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:24,120
we can learn from you and how did you

00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:26,870
overcome them I think you want to speak

00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,870
for sure

00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:34,370
Marie be a big clap for Marie

00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:48,050
so Marie is a badges Queen fedora badges

00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:51,420
Queen mic so I did not get a bingo and

00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:54,780
there were actually things that you

00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:59,630
listed or named off that I've overcome

00:30:54,780 --> 00:31:03,390
and I didn't cross them off because I

00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:08,160
look at my life and I see what I'm doing

00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:12,090
and I'm proud of it and I've come to own

00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:16,140
that and when people ask me about my

00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:18,690
life I tell them proudly and people are

00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:21,660
always kind of impressed that I have a

00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:24,720
full time job and I do this and I do my

00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:29,670
fine art and there's a lot that I want

00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:32,510
to do and accomplish and I guess I'm

00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:36,210
proud to say that I did not get bingo

00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:39,060
because thank you because I've overcome

00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:42,960
some of those feelings so like when I

00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:46,920
came to my first flock four years ago I

00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:48,750
think that I struggled with a lot more

00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:51,680
of these things but I've realized that

00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:54,279
it's okay that I'm not an expert

00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:57,549
developer or engineer or

00:31:54,279 --> 00:32:01,119
I don't do ambassadors or anything else

00:31:57,549 --> 00:32:03,879
I'm here to do design and to contribute

00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:10,269
that knowledge to this community and I'm

00:32:03,879 --> 00:32:12,309
proud of that so thank you very much

00:32:10,269 --> 00:32:14,649
Marie for sharing your experience so

00:32:12,309 --> 00:32:16,809
that is what as the bottom line is you

00:32:14,649 --> 00:32:20,049
have to accept yourself you have to

00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:21,879
respect yourself first because you

00:32:20,049 --> 00:32:23,769
cannot know all the topics in the world

00:32:21,879 --> 00:32:26,440
you cannot be the expert of each and

00:32:23,769 --> 00:32:29,499
everything just be happy of doing what

00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:32,049
you want to do in your life and accept

00:32:29,499 --> 00:32:34,779
it accept yourself embrace your skills

00:32:32,049 --> 00:32:38,080
and respect yourself that is what it is

00:32:34,779 --> 00:32:41,710
all about we are also going to do like a

00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:43,539
quick show of hands so you can come the

00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:47,379
number of things you crossed out and

00:32:43,539 --> 00:32:51,339
every thing every box you crossed out

00:32:47,379 --> 00:32:53,710
gets one point so we did about 15 to 20

00:32:51,339 --> 00:32:57,159
statements so I'm just going to divide

00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:59,799
them into some buckets so if and if you

00:32:57,159 --> 00:33:02,769
are in that bucket range just you know

00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:05,259
raise your hand so if you crossed out

00:33:02,769 --> 00:33:10,599
less than five statements on this bingo

00:33:05,259 --> 00:33:15,669
just raise your hand okay yeah less than

00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:19,059
five okay so we have three people here

00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:23,589
who crossed out less than five if you

00:33:19,059 --> 00:33:27,159
crossed out five to ten statements on

00:33:23,589 --> 00:33:30,159
this bingo yes so I guess most of us

00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:33,580
crossed out five to ten statements here

00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:36,759
and I guess that I mean it's equally

00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:38,649
balanced between everyone and if you

00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:43,509
crossed out more than ten statements on

00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:45,369
this bingo just raise their hand okay so

00:33:43,509 --> 00:33:47,559
I am going to raise my hand too because

00:33:45,369 --> 00:33:50,860
I almost crossed out everything I said

00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:54,039
somehow but

00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:56,380
okay so yeah but I just want to let you

00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:59,620
know that you're not alone how like

00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:02,710
whatever level of impostor syndrome you

00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:06,399
feel you are like there are always other

00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:10,419
people who feel the same and so you are

00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:11,649
not alone who feels like this and I mean

00:34:10,419 --> 00:34:14,290
it might be because of your background

00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:15,879
or your experiences or something but I

00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:17,589
just want to let you know that there are

00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:20,830
also other people out there who feel the

00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:24,129
same way so we are quickly going to move

00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:27,389
on to our next slides and because we are

00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:33,220
running short of time for this workshop

00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:35,980
so after this we yeah we wanted to

00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:38,770
basically this game was to identify how

00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:42,940
impostor syndrome affects us so how this

00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:47,200
different situation sabotage our like

00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:49,240
our career or a work or academics and we

00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,070
want you to be able to identify these

00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:53,200
situations from now on so that whenever

00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:54,970
something like this happens to you you

00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:58,240
can recognize it and just stop yourself

00:34:54,970 --> 00:35:00,400
and take a moment and think like this is

00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,290
just my impostor syndrome speaking I am

00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,170
doubting myself I am NOT going to do it

00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:06,490
I'm going to rest and I am going to be

00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:08,980
confident because I have done so many

00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:12,280
things till now I have been here for

00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:14,770
like for me 23 years of my life or like

00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:17,230
and I'm moving on and I'm going to move

00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:20,589
on from this too and I'm going to keep

00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:22,540
on moving forward so example I would

00:35:20,589 --> 00:35:26,290
like to share I was going through the

00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:29,320
notes of B sorry I am sharing it

00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:31,510
there were a lot lots pain no it's not

00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:34,660
returned scribbling flowcharts

00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:38,560
everything and in the corner of those

00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:41,770
notes it was written to it be pulled and

00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:45,670
it was highlighted start with colors and

00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:47,680
everything so this is what you can do in

00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:50,650
your life just to boost your morale and

00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:52,570
confidence and we also have some tips

00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:55,660
for how to tackle impostor syndrome

00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:57,520
later on just in a few slides

00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:59,319
in a few minutes you'll see them and you

00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:02,670
can actually use them in your daily life

00:35:59,319 --> 00:36:09,299
when you feel like imposter syndrome is

00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:12,720
affecting you yeah so yeah so this is

00:36:09,299 --> 00:36:14,760
just a quick game we are showing a few

00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:20,519
quotes on the screen can you identify

00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:22,349
who said these quotes I mean you can

00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:27,210
guess basic things even if you cannot

00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:29,339
say the name like so the core is why

00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:32,160
would anyone want to see me again in a

00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:35,309
movie and I don't know how to act anyway

00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:37,619
so why am I doing this so yeah when you

00:36:35,309 --> 00:36:40,349
see the word movie for example you make

00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:42,650
the connection with an actress or actor

00:36:40,349 --> 00:36:46,910
or actor

00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:52,410
yes some may be oscar-winning actor yeah

00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:55,650
what no it's not Mel Gibson you are very

00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:59,460
near the name is the same no it's not

00:36:55,650 --> 00:37:02,549
maybe a similar not no it's the same she

00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:08,940
said married she said men huh and I said

00:37:02,549 --> 00:37:11,819
the name okay so this was said by Meryl

00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:13,680
Streep and we all know how a great actor

00:37:11,819 --> 00:37:15,869
she is she has already went like eight

00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,549
Golden Globes and three Academy Awards

00:37:15,869 --> 00:37:21,000
and I'm pretty sure you have seen at

00:37:17,549 --> 00:37:26,940
least one movie with her in it so if not

00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:28,890
you need to go watch her movies so yeah

00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:30,990
that was her and even though she is such

00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:33,329
a brilliant actor she said that code so

00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:35,339
it's not just us but like also famous

00:37:33,329 --> 00:37:37,859
people and celebrities who feel it

00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:41,910
yeah the successful people basically so

00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:44,430
this is another one and yeah so so I

00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:47,339
have written 11 books but each time I

00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:50,099
think oh oh they are going to find out

00:37:47,339 --> 00:37:53,970
now I've run a game on everybody and

00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:59,269
they are going to find me out no it's

00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:59,269
not George I don't know what No

00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:07,579
no she's a poet memories I mean I said

00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:08,059
she JK rowling could have been an answer

00:38:07,579 --> 00:38:12,859
buddy

00:38:08,059 --> 00:38:17,299
this quote is not by her yeah she's a

00:38:12,859 --> 00:38:22,160
civil right activists and also a Nobel

00:38:17,299 --> 00:38:25,849
laureate yes it it was said by Maya

00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:28,579
Angelou and my aunt she won a Nobel

00:38:25,849 --> 00:38:31,520
Prize and yet she feels like this so I

00:38:28,579 --> 00:38:33,710
mean I can't imagine myself winning a

00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,990
Nobel Prize and I try to reassure that

00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:38,270
is just impostor syndrome talking that

00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:41,150
maybe I can win it but still she already

00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:43,430
won it and she feels like it so we just

00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:45,530
wanted to let you know that it's not

00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:48,140
just like people like you and me but

00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:50,390
also successful people who are like very

00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:53,150
ahead in their careers in their life and

00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:55,280
they still feel this so this is an

00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:58,460
important thing which is happening to

00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:00,829
most of us and we need to I don't be

00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:04,180
able to identify like when this affects

00:39:00,829 --> 00:39:07,339
us and to recognize it and you know to

00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:10,069
effectively like handle it so that we

00:39:07,339 --> 00:39:12,700
can still be successful or like move

00:39:10,069 --> 00:39:19,220
forward in our lives

00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:21,650
yes so just a quick question like do why

00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:24,440
do we feel like why do we feel this why

00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:27,220
do we feel like an imposter does anyone

00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,220
have any ideas

00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:36,140
okay why do we feel like an impostor

00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:38,480
because it depends on the situation or

00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:40,490
the circumstances we are in which we

00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:43,220
have more geek or skilled people around

00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:45,650
us and we feel little under confidence

00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:49,369
and we don't want to talk about the fact

00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:51,290
we know that is an example of when we

00:39:49,369 --> 00:39:54,740
encounter the imposter syndrome and

00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:57,589
sometimes we we have been failing you

00:39:54,740 --> 00:40:01,099
know continuously on some attempts and

00:39:57,589 --> 00:40:03,440
then our confidence is going low on

00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:06,410
every attempt then after that also we

00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:09,319
start feeling that okay I'm not the one

00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:11,420
who can accomplish this in my life so at

00:40:09,319 --> 00:40:14,710
that point we also feel started feeling

00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:17,780
like this sometimes there are negative

00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:19,970
thoughts and the negative discussions

00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:23,329
coming to towards you from some people

00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:24,680
and you you know that they are false but

00:40:23,329 --> 00:40:27,079
still they are impacting your

00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:29,540
unconscious mind and that is how you

00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:31,579
start feeling negative about yourself so

00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:43,700
these are a few points where you want to

00:40:31,579 --> 00:40:47,450
talk a little bit more walk so something

00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:48,980
that so something that I feel and I

00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:52,670
think other people might identify with

00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:55,339
as well like starting as a youth like

00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:57,200
you see maybe an older successful person

00:40:55,339 --> 00:40:59,540
like you're young maybe you're seven

00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:02,119
you're eight you're 12 and you think to

00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:04,460
yourself that person has it all together

00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:07,819
they have a career they have a life and

00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:11,240
you continue on and you get those things

00:41:07,819 --> 00:41:14,059
but your mind never really changes

00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:15,680
you're still with your own mind and like

00:41:14,059 --> 00:41:17,450
you feel like there should be this

00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,609
moment where you're like I've made it

00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:21,349
I've I've done it all or I've

00:41:19,609 --> 00:41:24,260
accomplished these things but you're

00:41:21,349 --> 00:41:27,859
still you're still that same person so

00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:30,319
part of you like hold on are me part of

00:41:27,859 --> 00:41:33,710
me hold on to that feeling that I

00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:36,710
haven't accomplished that thing yet but

00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:38,930
I think in reality there's not going to

00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:41,790
be that epiphany moment there might be a

00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:44,790
moment where you feel the success

00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:48,300
or you feel an accomplishment or but

00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:50,520
you're still in that same mind that

00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:53,310
you've had your whole life I mean I

00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:56,880
don't know if anyone else feels that way

00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:59,190
but I do absolutely and one other point

00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,870
which is which you might agree or not

00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:03,930
but I'll give you the example to back

00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:06,900
that up your physical parents also comes

00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:09,390
into the picture sometimes for example I

00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:11,760
love dancing a lot my friend knows how

00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:13,830
much I love dancing but I have never

00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,510
ever participated in any dance

00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:18,840
competition during my school or college

00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:20,730
days because I think I look bulky and if

00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:24,240
I dance on the stage people will judge

00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:27,900
me and I it'll look awkward or bad but

00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:30,390
them but when I started doing it after a

00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:31,650
long long long time I mean in the

00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:33,750
redhead Pony office we have the

00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:36,480
opportunity to do dance on the stage

00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:39,540
show show it of the people the number of

00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:41,970
compliments I got even the people who

00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:44,910
saw me dancing I mean they can tell that

00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:47,760
I dance well so these kind of things

00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:50,190
small things can hold you back and I not

00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,560
today I regret that that I I never

00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:54,480
participated in any dance competition

00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:58,020
during my school or college why I have

00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:01,110
not done that before so there is also a

00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:03,240
category where you you feel like your

00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:08,700
physical appearance can come in between

00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:14,150
your success so we don't have a lot of

00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:14,150
time so I will say them a bit very fast

00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:25,200
and Justin wants to skip the slides so I

00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:27,030
don't want to say again all the things

00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:31,470
that we said but we want to emphasize

00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:35,310
that I mean we we are not alone in this

00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:38,040
so and it's okay if we failure or it's

00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:41,100
okay even to suck because in this way we

00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:47,280
will learn from our mistakes and we will

00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:49,710
be better so we have let's it too kind

00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:52,230
of tips when you suck at something but

00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:55,260
gradually improve two things can happen

00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:58,680
right so you know what being awful at

00:43:55,260 --> 00:44:01,280
something really feels like and you

00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:03,630
realize that you do have a talent or

00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:08,370
four-sevenths and this builds confidence

00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:10,260
at you so have you ever heard of the

00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:13,110
code like failures at the stepping stone

00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:14,970
to success so it's like suppose you

00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:17,550
applied for a job maybe you didn't get

00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:20,250
that job but you got another better job

00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:22,200
because you had that interview you

00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:24,270
practice there you networked with other

00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:25,800
people there and they recommended you to

00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:28,800
a better position which might have been

00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:32,250
a better fit for you so we just want you

00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:34,260
to know that it's okay to fail that you

00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:36,960
might fail a lot of times everybody

00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:38,340
fails a lot of times but still like it

00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,680
will teach you something and you should

00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:43,230
take that as a learning opportunity it

00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:45,720
will teach you about hard work and it

00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:48,810
will teach you other aspects maybe and

00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:51,030
you will realize that you can keep going

00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:55,410
on and on so it will just build your

00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:58,290
perseverance so we just this is a last

00:44:55,410 --> 00:45:00,750
like we have some tips to tackle

00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:02,970
impostor syndrome so with the game I

00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:04,520
hope we taught you a little bit about

00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:07,350
situations where you can identify

00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:09,720
impostor syndrome and these are a few

00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:11,700
tips to tackle it if you have ever if

00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:14,610
you ever feel like imposter syndrome is

00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:16,560
creeping up on you or like you feel like

00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:19,260
you're imposter syndrome is acting up

00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:23,599
again before say a big opportunity or

00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:26,989
something so you can so the first one is

00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:28,759
like you should keep a journal so I I

00:45:26,989 --> 00:45:31,819
don't know how many people actually do

00:45:28,759 --> 00:45:34,999
this but I recently tried it a little

00:45:31,819 --> 00:45:36,829
bit and it can be anything like some

00:45:34,999 --> 00:45:40,039
small points about your day about what

00:45:36,829 --> 00:45:44,059
you did or like how you felt so this

00:45:40,039 --> 00:45:45,890
will help you basically identify maybe

00:45:44,059 --> 00:45:47,539
impostor syndrome situations or like you

00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:50,119
might write about the challenges you

00:45:47,539 --> 00:45:52,430
faced like maybe later on after you've a

00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:55,430
few days you realize that maybe it was

00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:58,849
wasn't big as a failure as you thought

00:45:55,430 --> 00:46:01,160
it would be I agree that keeping a

00:45:58,849 --> 00:46:03,440
journal will help you a lot because even

00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:06,140
if you are in a job and after six months

00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:08,509
or one year you are assessed in that job

00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:10,160
for the appraisal I never used to

00:46:08,509 --> 00:46:12,440
maintain a journal but I have been done

00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:14,660
for a year and every time I don't think

00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:17,630
there is any human who can remember

00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:19,339
everything you do for one last year then

00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:20,989
my manager suggested me to keep a

00:46:19,339 --> 00:46:24,380
journal of what the things you have to

00:46:20,989 --> 00:46:26,690
have been doing and I was amazed to look

00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:28,519
at that the points the number of points

00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:30,769
I have written for myself for that year

00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:33,979
which I have done which I would never

00:46:30,769 --> 00:46:36,349
have been able to remember if we I have

00:46:33,979 --> 00:46:38,029
not written them in a journal and I

00:46:36,349 --> 00:46:39,529
think also one thing to note there too

00:46:38,029 --> 00:46:40,999
is after you do it for a while you'll go

00:46:39,529 --> 00:46:43,309
back and you'll read something you wrote

00:46:40,999 --> 00:46:45,319
and you'll be like you'll look back and

00:46:43,309 --> 00:46:47,450
go wow did I really think that way we're

00:46:45,319 --> 00:46:49,279
like wow I was so silly of me to think

00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:50,809
that I couldn't do this thing and you'll

00:46:49,279 --> 00:46:52,700
look back you know a year in hindsight

00:46:50,809 --> 00:46:53,930
and realize that whatever these

00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:55,190
challenges are these things that you

00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:57,109
were going through or the things that

00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:59,359
you're trying to accomplish were they'll

00:46:57,109 --> 00:47:01,130
feel like you'll feel silly or you'll

00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:02,960
feel it'll be it'll be a funny

00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:04,130
experience just to go back and read and

00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,539
be like wow like that's how I was

00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:08,930
thinking even just like a year ago and

00:47:05,539 --> 00:47:12,329
see how things have changed for yourself

00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:15,509
yeah and another one I want to quickly

00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:18,869
emphasize is that maybe you should build

00:47:15,509 --> 00:47:21,660
like a positive community around you you

00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:23,940
can have a group of friends who discuss

00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:26,369
like with whom you discuss challenges

00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:28,890
you faced recently or you discuss about

00:47:26,369 --> 00:47:30,869
your work or just like personal life so

00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:33,630
basically build a professional support

00:47:30,869 --> 00:47:35,759
network and you can ask them for advice

00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:37,079
or just you know talk to them so that

00:47:35,759 --> 00:47:40,259
you know that they are also going

00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:41,700
through similar experiences or they have

00:47:40,259 --> 00:47:44,309
also faced these kind of situations

00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:46,680
sometimes in their life and that will

00:47:44,309 --> 00:47:51,539
just help you keep moving forward

00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:55,500
so yeah and and another thing we wanted

00:47:51,539 --> 00:47:57,630
to say was that and this is very

00:47:55,500 --> 00:48:00,390
important like you have to recognize

00:47:57,630 --> 00:48:03,150
that failure is a part of learning

00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:06,599
process so I don't think I can emphasize

00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:08,490
this enough so I know it's tough I have

00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:10,710
been there myself I have failed multiple

00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:13,619
times and I have applied for so many

00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:17,549
scholarships and I am Not sure like I

00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:19,380
have I got maybe one or two so but still

00:48:17,549 --> 00:48:20,700
it's a learning process with every

00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:24,799
application I learn something new about

00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:28,140
myself about what I am doing and that

00:48:24,799 --> 00:48:32,809
I'm actually contributing something here

00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:35,339
in Federer or at my university and I'm

00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:38,160
doing something good even though it's a

00:48:35,339 --> 00:48:41,970
bit even it's if it's little or

00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:45,000
something here so I just want to quickly

00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:47,849
go through this and so the first one is

00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,710
like keeper journal second one is you

00:48:47,849 --> 00:48:52,859
set some goals for yourself so maybe you

00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:55,920
can take up running just set a goal that

00:48:52,859 --> 00:48:58,079
I will run one kilometer everyday and

00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:00,059
when you do that you feel a sense of

00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:01,819
accomplishment like you did something

00:49:00,059 --> 00:49:05,190
small already and you do it consistently

00:49:01,819 --> 00:49:06,869
so it will help you you know feel better

00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:09,630
about yourself that you are already

00:49:06,869 --> 00:49:11,910
doing this much and it will create that

00:49:09,630 --> 00:49:15,329
positive energy into your work or like

00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:17,069
personal life and the third one is what

00:49:15,329 --> 00:49:19,200
we already talked of talked about like

00:49:17,069 --> 00:49:21,450
build a professional support network it

00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,280
can be professional or it can be a group

00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:26,160
of friends

00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:28,710
and that can also help you get like by

00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:31,050
360 degrees we men like it can help you

00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:32,670
get diverse feedback so you will know

00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:35,040
different opinions from different people

00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:36,930
about what they are going through and

00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:40,740
you will know different perspectives

00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:44,250
about the same thing which you might not

00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:46,140
have thought before update your CV you

00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:48,270
have many more accomplishments than you

00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:51,060
think you have do not underestimate

00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:53,280
yourself in your resume write it all

00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:55,680
there maybe they can go through it they

00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:57,240
can read it it's but you have to put

00:49:55,680 --> 00:50:00,210
yourself out there and recognize that

00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:04,500
you have done it all and be proud about

00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:08,180
it the next one is get a coach it can be

00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:11,730
your friend or some peer or maybe like

00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:14,400
somebody yeah some mentor or some senior

00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:16,770
from your work or university someone

00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:19,350
it's just someone who has gone through

00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:22,380
the same challenges or like who can

00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:24,630
guide you through the process we already

00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:27,450
talked about recognize learning and

00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:29,160
failure are okay and yeah keep a

00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:31,860
positive feedback file it can be your

00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:34,290
journal just write that just write

00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:36,510
something simple like I'm glad I did

00:50:34,290 --> 00:50:39,240
this today like this is one thing I did

00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:41,820
and I'm very happy about it or something

00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:45,630
simple like that and it will help you

00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:47,370
reinforce positivity in your life the

00:50:45,630 --> 00:50:49,080
next one is do things outside of work

00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:50,910
that make you feel good so basically

00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:53,340
take up hobbies like we said you can set

00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:56,160
some small goals and try to achieve that

00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:57,960
and the last one is like yeah this is

00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:01,590
very important that you say it out loud

00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:03,570
to someone you trust like that you talk

00:51:01,590 --> 00:51:06,900
about your imposter syndrome so the

00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:09,180
first step to tackling imposter syndrome

00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:12,690
is trying to identify it and the next

00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:16,710
one is like saying it like recognizing

00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:18,450
it and talking to people led that this

00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:20,250
is happening so that you learn how they

00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:23,610
are doing like if they are feeling the

00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:25,980
same or like how they are tackling it

00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:27,750
and what they are doing about it or so

00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:29,280
they'll call you out when you are

00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:32,270
feeling like an impostor but you're

00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:35,610
really you really evidently

00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:37,650
okay so these are a few tips from us and

00:51:35,610 --> 00:51:39,480
that is the end of this impostor

00:51:37,650 --> 00:51:41,700
syndrome workshop we will have the

00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:45,750
unconscious bias and training workshop

00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:47,550
after this and yeah if you thanks a lot

00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:52,080
for being here and if you have any

00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:54,360
questions just let us know now we will

00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:56,100
have we plan to have a five-minute break

00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:57,570
which might be a little bit shorter

00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:58,770
because we are running a little bit out

00:51:57,570 --> 00:52:00,900
of time so it might be a two-minute

00:51:58,770 --> 00:52:04,650
break but if you want to go out and grab

00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:06,780
some water or coffee or just feel free

00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:08,900
to do that does anyone have any

00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:08,900
questions

00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:45,180
so hey I found out that it doesn't

00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:46,680
really help me to know that other people

00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:48,990
feel the same things is important to

00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:50,070
know because I would like that well they

00:52:48,990 --> 00:52:52,020
just have this syndrome but they're

00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:53,310
still way better than I am and I

00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:55,710
shouldn't be here so it doesn't really

00:52:53,310 --> 00:52:57,900
help me to know that what helped me is a

00:52:55,710 --> 00:53:00,450
video that I saw once on the Internet

00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:02,010
you see I remember that it was kind of

00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:04,200
popular there was this guy dancing at

00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:06,570
the Music Festival it was on the hilltop

00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:08,190
and he was dancing in a crazy manner all

00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:11,100
alone on his own the sign there were

00:53:08,190 --> 00:53:12,630
people sitting and it was long like four

00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:14,910
five minutes and then there's another

00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:16,290
person who comes and join him and dance

00:53:14,910 --> 00:53:18,450
in the crazy manner - and of course

00:53:16,290 --> 00:53:20,220
thirty seconds later there's like a

00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:22,080
crowd of people joining them and all

00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:24,570
dancing in a crazy manner of together so

00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:26,490
what I learned is yeah exactly so it's

00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:28,500
it's very important to have leaders and

00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:31,140
to have people who do this crazy thing

00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:33,780
but it's extremely important to have the

00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:38,010
number to the person who joins them and

00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:39,720
who creates the whole movement so in in

00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:41,100
a world where everybody is pushing you

00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,930
to be a leader and all that I think it's

00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:45,060
very important to not be the leader but
