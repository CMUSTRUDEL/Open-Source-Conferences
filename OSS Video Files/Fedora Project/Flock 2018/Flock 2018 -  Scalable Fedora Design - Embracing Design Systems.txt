Talk: Scalable Fedora Design - Embracing Design Systems
Presenters: Abhishek Sharma

Description: Do you know the Fedora website uses 6 different shades of the Fedora blue? Even the font size is specified in different forms for different elements - sometimes it’s percentage, sometimes ems and sometimes even px or rems. I feel it’s the time for Fedora to embraces a design system to ensure consistency and manage design debt.
A design system unites teams around a common visual language. It reduces design debt, accelerates the design process, and builds bridges between teams working.
Many teams are now taking a more systematic approach to design by using Design Systems. But What is actually is a design system? What makes a well-functioning system? What do effective systems have in common? Finally, how can Fedora actually go about laying the foundations for a shared design language?
These are some questions to which I will share my answers with the community.

oh good afternoon everyone thank you for

00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:09,170
coming so I'm Abhishek I'll be talking

00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,900
about Design Systems basically today so

00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:14,340
let me start with my introduction

00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,420
basically into product design UX went

00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,970
and I was a google Summer of Code

00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,160
student with fedora this summer I worked

00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:24,000
in the community app and I go by the

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,150
fast and the little wonder so let me

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,949
tell you about the basic plan of today's

00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:30,599
we will start with what is design system

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:32,640
and why we should have a design system

00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,050
then I will start how the designers can

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,870
start designing the design system and

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,550
finally what the developers can how can

00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:41,989
the look should quote the design system

00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:44,940
and use it okay so we should start with

00:00:41,989 --> 00:00:47,910
what is the design system so the problem

00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,440
basically started in 1960s when the

00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:52,050
computers became cheap but the

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,980
development process it was basically a

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:57,570
rewritten and rewritten and difficult to

00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,250
maintain so someone suggested why don't

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,809
you use common reusable components so

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,090
you don't have to write the code again

00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:05,280
and again so we are facing a similar

00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,799
problem in design these days so what you

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,159
see is whenever you have to create

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,330
something you create it for individual

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,159
problems you create dilemmas or

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,479
solutions for individual problems like

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,040
you have to release something you create

00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,240
a page for it you have to really

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,810
something else you create a different

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,939
page for it

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:24,119
so design is still being used for

00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:26,610
individual problems so here we have a

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:28,020
screenshot for from the gate Fedora page

00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,430
for the federal apps for the federal

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,630
magazine everything looks different

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:35,310
since unless they are already a part of

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,049
a same ecosystem but still they look so

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:40,079
different so this is the problem and

00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:43,560
trying to address so the solution I

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,390
propose is design system so but design

00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,130
systems ensure is that you can use

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:49,170
reusable design components which can

00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:51,930
which ultimately means you can scale the

00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,549
scale that isn't very easily just have a

00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,950
very formal definition of the design

00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:57,630
systems so it is a collection of

00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,070
reusable components guided by clear

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,439
standards that can be assembled together

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:03,570
to build any number of applications so

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,369
but very important here is the reusable

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,619
components and the clear standards if

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:09,569
you have like if you want a very real

00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:11,550
simple example of design system look at

00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:13,680
Google material design so it is used in

00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:16,049
the web app in the mobile app everywhere

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,610
the design is very consistent and you

00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:22,769
know from the friend that this is the

00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:24,629
Google product so let me just go into

00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:26,220
the two main points the components and

00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:27,810
the standards components basically means

00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,579
the UI components the buttons the forms

00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:31,650
how the things will look and the

00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:33,269
standard standards is basically rare due

00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,920
to you we have to use those components

00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:37,470
why to use this component how to use

00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,939
this component there are guidelines when

00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,220
when where and how to use basically a

00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:42,989
documentation on using the components so

00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,670
I'll go into drifts into the standards

00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:46,409
in standards you need to define the

00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:48,690
naming conventions so when you are

00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:50,549
writing the code but naming convention

00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:52,980
are using are using kebap case are UK

00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:55,049
are camel case and what is the name of

00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,269
the variables in the CSS and the things

00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:58,859
like that and then we come to the file

00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:00,780
structure so in the file structure

00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:02,549
basically so where do you put the images

00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,599
do we put in the static so everything

00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:05,579
should be consistent throughout the

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,980
theme then there's things like color

00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:11,790
spacing motion whites I'll come back to

00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:14,159
them later then the main point and

00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:15,840
babbling about what is design system the

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,359
main point is why do you redesign system

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,949
so as the team scale you see that people

00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:22,199
start working on the discrete part of

00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:23,669
the app so somebody designs his own

00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:25,829
solution and other one designs his own

00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:27,900
solution so things got starts getting

00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:29,609
fragmented so you can see that there is

00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,139
no consistency left so if used the

00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:33,060
design system everything will be

00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:34,980
consistent and the experience will be

00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:38,310
same so the users will find it intuitive

00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:40,199
and predictive to use the interface plus

00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:41,699
you can if you have a reusable library

00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:43,620
of label you can just prototype very

00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:46,169
fastly because you can just like put

00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,879
together Legos and you can use them to

00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:49,799
build type very fastly so the main

00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:51,449
problem in design is you are trying to

00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:53,879
solve problems so you can focus on

00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:55,829
solving the problems instead of creating

00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:58,769
the buttons and the layout again and

00:03:55,829 --> 00:04:00,269
again so you can prototype faster this

00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:01,979
is a very important point that you get

00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:04,199
build in accessibility in with design

00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:07,889
systems so what I mean with builds Bend

00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:09,209
is a built in accessibility is that in

00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:11,310
design system you have individual

00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:12,750
components so when you design the

00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,040
component you take care of accessibility

00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,659
so if you are designing a button you

00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,430
will pick make sure that the contrast is

00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:19,289
right it can be read by other colorblind

00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,549
people as well as normal people so if

00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:22,229
you have the accessibility in all the

00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:24,120
individual components but you altima to

00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:25,530
create will have higher accessibility so

00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,130
this is the proper this is a very

00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:31,070
good benefit of a design system and

00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:34,110
there are some myths associated with

00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:36,150
many people start using design systems

00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:38,490
one of them is loss of creativity people

00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:40,680
will think that okay we have a system

00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:42,389
you have to follow it as a designer

00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,520
waste my creativity how can I experiment

00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:46,500
in most things so as I designer your

00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,450
main problem your main task is to solve

00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,190
problems you don't need to design one

00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:53,550
thing again and again for every same

00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:55,020
project so if you have a reusable every

00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:56,700
available at your disposal you can

00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,990
simply just drag and drop those things

00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:00,090
and focus on solving the real problems

00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:03,450
so there's no loss of creativity

00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:05,280
actually it saves your time and another

00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:07,710
methods people think that ok accurately

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,480
design system ok this is done now we are

00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:11,310
sorted now let's move back to the other

00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,950
stuff but this is not the case design

00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:15,270
system needs to be evolved with time

00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:17,640
because once you ship the design system

00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:19,380
you will see that as you some of your

00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,270
assumptions might not be right so you

00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:23,790
need to see how the things are

00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:25,169
performing iterate accordingly so many

00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:28,370
of the organizations like IBM Google

00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:31,470
they have a dedicated design system team

00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:33,450
so let's start with how other designers

00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:39,390
you can like start laying the foundation

00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:40,620
of a design system so who needs to be

00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:42,270
involved in designing a design system

00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,220
basically first designers because they

00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:46,650
need to layout the visual language and

00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,850
the UI components they need to be the

00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:50,789
front end devs who will write the code

00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:52,350
for those components and they will be

00:05:50,789 --> 00:05:54,990
content strategists who will write the

00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:57,300
UX UX copy for this so the button should

00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:59,100
say shoot the buttons ok to continue or

00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,950
please click ok to continue this will

00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,440
reflect the tone of your product they

00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:05,910
should be product managers who will

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,039
force you all the operations if the

00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:12,419
design systems go aligned with the but

00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:13,590
actually the consumers want so before

00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:15,240
designing the design system you should

00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:16,800
interview their customers who actually

00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,270
use the design system will be used by

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,919
the developers as well as the designers

00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:21,780
so you should interview them ask them

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,210
how do the things how do they do the

00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:26,310
things currently and create on the basis

00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:29,100
of it so that it fits into the workflow

00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:31,289
very seamlessly if you create without

00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:33,390
their help and then you give it to them

00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:35,970
use it they will they won't use any all

00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:37,260
your effort will go into waste so if you

00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:38,760
in case you plan to open-source the

00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,420
design system you must talk with open

00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:43,410
source community

00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:44,790
what challenges they face like if there

00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:46,200
are specific use cases they need to be

00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:49,200
handled given must talk to them and

00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,580
include them in design system and so for

00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,960
this thing your design system must be

00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:57,030
very generalized so which can be

00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:58,200
extended by anyone so once you have

00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:00,120
interviewed the customer you have some

00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,890
data to make decisions you can start

00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,950
creating two things and inventory of the

00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:07,230
visual attributes and the UI elements so

00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:09,060
I'll come to the visual attributes so

00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:11,360
first of all create a conduct an audit

00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,440
so this is the screenshot from the

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,540
AppStore federal project dot orgs

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,340
website so there's a site called CSS

00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:19,860
stats you can get the stats of a website

00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:21,450
page so here you can see almost 30

00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,610
unique colors are used in a single page

00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:25,620
of a website so you can start scratching

00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:28,410
the similar colors and reduce the

00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:30,570
palette similarly there are like lots of

00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:33,300
font sizes being used points pixels EMS

00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:35,700
so you can have a consistent type scale

00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,380
whether to use e m and increase it

00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:40,290
accordingly so there is consistency all

00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:42,150
throughout the products and similarly

00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:43,470
there's the font family right now you

00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:45,150
see we are using like a nine font

00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:49,860
families so this can be easily build

00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:51,690
used to like one or two so once you have

00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,130
been the audit and we have reduced the

00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:56,520
things these are some of the things you

00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:58,080
need in your visual inventory first of

00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,340
all there are things like colors so

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,320
colors we there will be a brand color

00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,940
primary then there will you a background

00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:05,600
some light colors but for borders there

00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:08,130
is success error in warning colors and

00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,470
one more thing while doing the color

00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:13,380
check you must ensure that the contrast

00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:14,280
is right because you don't need to you

00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,900
need the accessibility in your

00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,340
components so there's a tool called

00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,900
color able you can check the

00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:22,950
accessibility in real time of the

00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:25,920
background as well as text and then

00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:27,900
comes the typography you must ensure

00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,670
that the fonts and the weight font and

00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,200
font their weight you have to use both

00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:33,450
italic you have to ensure that

00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:36,090
everything's aligned finds so last

00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:38,400
summer I was working with a biological

00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:42,150
firm so when I was creating the design

00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:44,390
system they wanted to they had lots of

00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:47,070
chemical formulas so by choosing the

00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:49,310
font family I need to ensure that the

00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:52,260
all the chemical formulas can be

00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:52,750
represented well so I choose a font that

00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,310
is

00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,170
all the numbers and the chemical

00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:58,810
formulas very accurately so you need to

00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:01,420
ensure that whatever font you choose it

00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:02,920
fits the requirement then there is

00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:05,199
leading then the type scale type scale

00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:08,259
is how your type skills but it is h1 h1

00:09:05,199 --> 00:09:12,220
h2 and there's leading but you the space

00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:13,930
between your sentences and then comes

00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:16,389
the spacing and sizing so what is the

00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:18,040
space between two two components we will

00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,689
recommend in the material design it

00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,610
recommends the multiple of four so in

00:09:19,689 --> 00:09:25,870
the icon size you see is it it is either

00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:27,850
16 32 64 so it is up to you most

00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:30,160
prominently uses for point and 8 points

00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:32,350
so the spacing will be either 8 16 24

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:36,850
because it scales really well with the

00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:38,740
One X 1.5 X + 2 X displays then comes

00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:40,329
the images so if you are using images on

00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:42,910
the website what file format will you

00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:44,529
use if you use PNG or JPEG you have to

00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:46,449
decide on that if you are using a

00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:48,610
calligraphy you need to decide whether

00:09:46,449 --> 00:09:49,689
you will use fill icons or will you use

00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:51,220
color like urns what kind of

00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:54,220
illustrations using so you have to lay

00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:55,509
down all the clear standards then comes

00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,430
the motion in some part I have not

00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:58,540
really explored this thing but in the

00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:01,180
motion you need to define the

00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:02,860
interactions so throughout the website

00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,629
or the app you need to ensure that all

00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:06,870
the transitions are same so if you are

00:10:04,629 --> 00:10:09,550
is the ease in transition with a

00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:11,079
transition time of 0.25 second make sure

00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:13,149
that it is same everywhere because if

00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:14,769
one transition takes one second and when

00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:17,100
another one take one minute so it's

00:10:14,769 --> 00:10:19,809
really not really a great experience so

00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,879
once you have laid down all the visual

00:10:19,809 --> 00:10:24,399
attributes then come the UI components

00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:26,139
so what people really recommend is using

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,730
atomic design system atomic design

00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:28,779
system is once you create elements

00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:30,790
combine the elements to create

00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:32,170
components create combined components to

00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:35,110
create regions and finally the layouts

00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:38,050
so I will give you an example elements

00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:40,569
you can take like a button or icon or

00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:42,639
maybe a so suppose you have a button and

00:10:40,569 --> 00:10:44,199
a label so you combine them to create a

00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:47,079
search box search box is the component

00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:48,879
and you add a couple of other things

00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:50,290
it's in the search box to create a

00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:52,990
region like a sidebar or a top

00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:54,490
navigation bar and layout is the

00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:56,559
complete layout of the page to where

00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:58,360
this sidebar goes it is it does it good

00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:00,050
in the left this is going the right so

00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:03,709
you need to decide on that

00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:06,589
by designing the individual components

00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:08,180
this is a screenshot from a u.s. website

00:11:06,589 --> 00:11:09,560
design system you need to ensure that

00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,690
you are taking care of all the use case

00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,850
like they have default over active focus

00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:17,570
disable how the all things look you need

00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:19,450
to decide it predominantly so once you

00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:21,380
have the designer have done all the work

00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:22,670
you have the components ready you have

00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:25,220
the visual attributes ready now it's the

00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:27,620
time for coding so what the developers

00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:29,480
need is they need to ensure that the

00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:32,029
code is consistent all throughout so you

00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,649
need something like code style guides so

00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:35,660
where where does the color base code

00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:37,010
does it go in this first line second

00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:39,440
line so you can use something like

00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:43,640
linting so it can automatically check

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:45,560
for things then this is a really

00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:48,370
important point that the design system

00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:50,750
and your main code this should be

00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:52,700
exclusive of each other so you don't

00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:55,279
create components and things away from

00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,720
the irrespective of the situation it is

00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,459
being used so it is a generalized thing

00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,930
so you have a wrapper for design system

00:11:58,459 --> 00:12:01,220
and wrapper for the main code design

00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:04,100
system is very generalized it can be

00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:07,130
used anywhere and there's one single

00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:08,690
source a single source of truth like you

00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:10,220
have a good trapper where you put all

00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:12,680
the design system files and even can

00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:14,630
fetch it and use it in real time there's

00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:18,079
no conflicts and when you update it it

00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:19,880
gets updated the same way so there are

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,680
these are some principles that your

00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:24,020
comprehensive to follow they should be

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,250
modular what I mean by modular is a two

00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,950
component should not depend on each

00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:29,089
other

00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:30,440
composable like two components can be

00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:32,810
combined to create one single component

00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:36,279
and generally it means that it can be

00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:36,279
extended to create a variety of things

00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:41,810
accessibility is another point like the

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,370
15% of the world why people suffer from

00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:45,350
some kind of impairment

00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:47,149
maybe the something with the hands or

00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:49,790
the color blindness and stuff so you

00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:52,100
must ensure that the whatever components

00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:53,870
you create accessible accessibility will

00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,350
eventually mean a better experience for

00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,540
everyone

00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:57,410
your site should get ranked higher in

00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:01,610
SEO

00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:03,860
plus you will no longer have no lawsuits

00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:05,560
another thing the design system code

00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:08,530
should be very robust

00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:10,090
the point is that no it will allow

00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:11,770
people to use the design system very

00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:14,260
efficiently without the fear of having

00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:15,880
things broken so for a robust design

00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,590
system what you need is you need to test

00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,450
it very well you can write JavaScript

00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:21,280
you can do unit testing to check the

00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:24,400
individual JavaScript functions you can

00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:26,380
do visual regression testing to really

00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,970
test if the if you changed one component

00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:29,770
does it have only to change another

00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:31,360
component style so it will basically

00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:33,220
take the screenshot of both and compare

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,680
before and after there's a library

00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:37,210
called backstop GS for it and there's

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,880
automated accessibility checking so you

00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:41,110
can once you a clear cream you once you

00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,900
have created all the components you can

00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:45,550
just test the accessibility there's a

00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:50,620
tool from PayPal called double a double

00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:52,570
T for that thing so once you have a like

00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:54,790
created all the code but the challenges

00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:56,650
people really face is maintaining the

00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:57,820
documentation so you change the design

00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:59,500
of one thing you have to change in the

00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:01,750
documentation like this thing goes here

00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:04,300
and here so what the solution is you

00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:05,230
like maintain it this is maintain the

00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,690
design system as well as the

00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:09,430
documentation in the same repo so

00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:13,930
whenever you change the code you change

00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:16,900
the documentation as well and handling

00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:19,690
changes so if in case you ship something

00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:24,010
and it was broken and you can directly

00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:26,230
fall back so use versioning so the final

00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:27,580
key takeaways were what is nine system

00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:29,589
design system is made up of components

00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:32,260
and standards components are the UI

00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:34,360
components and standards basically out

00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:35,860
of what rules to use what are the colors

00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,470
being used what is the coding standard

00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:40,480
in the rules and for designers

00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:42,700
understand how the team will use it what

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,230
is the use case before starting then

00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,640
create a visual and then treats decide

00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:49,240
on the color stress spacing and stuff

00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:50,920
then start creating the components for

00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,930
developers it's really important that

00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,260
they lay down the style guides and the

00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:55,270
rules

00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:57,160
what is the coding syntax and stuff and

00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:58,870
develop them as self-contained

00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:01,180
components not dependable each other

00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:04,180
everything is exclusive and take care of

00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:05,680
accessibility so all the slides are

00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:09,750
available at this URL or you can scan

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,750
the QR and questions

00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,839
yeah

00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:33,300
so are you asking why can we not use a

00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:33,300
simple Abra like bootstrap

00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:02,579
no no no it has to be consistent all

00:16:00,809 --> 00:16:04,259
throughout all the products so you can

00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:06,869
change like the main color so if you see

00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:08,489
a gmail app or the Google Play Store app

00:16:06,869 --> 00:16:11,009
both of them have the same navigation

00:16:08,489 --> 00:16:13,319
but the images and the colors are

00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:14,730
changed so you can change the basic

00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:16,860
things according to the brand of the

00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:18,660
product but the basic layout and all the

00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:20,339
stuff should remain same so that is the

00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:22,110
whole point that the person who is using

00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:23,459
is he will get the experience that ok

00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:26,819
this is the product of Red Hat because

00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:30,379
this thing works like this does that

00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:30,379
clear that out ok

00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:47,320
the language

00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:52,860
okay so your question is that is there a

00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:55,740
common library for the mobile

00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:58,110
development as well as development so as

00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:59,639
far as I know in the and if you are

00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:01,139
developing the Android application the

00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:02,910
native may using the Java and stuff you

00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:04,980
have to write the different kind of code

00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:06,750
but in the web you have to write CSS so

00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,919
I don't think that is possible but if

00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,689
you are using something like react

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,900
native and stuff you can use a common

00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:14,309
CSS library so if you are using react

00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,539
native or something like view native you

00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:16,860
can use that if you are using web

00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:19,110
technologies to develop the mobile app

00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:21,150
but if you are writing the native code

00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:23,909
in Swift or Java I don't think that's

00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:27,150
possible so what people generally do is

00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:28,409
they write as a simple library different

00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:31,470
different library for web as well as

00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:32,880
different library for Android but if you

00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:34,080
are using like many of the companies

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,150
have shifted to react native and stuff

00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,460
like air B&B and they have a common sea

00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:46,740
celebrity you just NPM it and it's ready

00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:48,090
to go yeah no no no this is okay the

00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,980
question is is this something and

00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:51,870
welding or is it just general

00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:55,289
application so when I started working

00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:57,480
when Fedora in like April so I saw that

00:17:55,289 --> 00:18:00,480
everything was very different so this is

00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,039
something is my proposal that I can work

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,690
on and kind of like a general

00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:07,010
introduction to everyone so why should

00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:07,010
we use it in what exactly is it

00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:18,860
so do I know about the federal partner

00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:21,049
library yes I got in touch with someone

00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:22,640
from the design team I guess so she told

00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:25,250
me like the Patton library isn't really

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,620
active these days or something so like

00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:29,330
the project started Midway but it hasn't

00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:31,600
been completed or deployed something

00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:31,600
like there

00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:39,789
but

00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:47,900
okay so what are the differences between

00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,900
the pattern library and design system

00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:54,360
and can I use the work of their partner

00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:55,740
library in the design system so I don't

00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:58,320
really know what is the status of the

00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:59,820
pattern library project but if you are

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,250
talking about a design system and a

00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:05,370
pattern library battle library but I

00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:08,100
believe is specific to a platform so it

00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:09,900
will be of either web or mobile so but

00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,400
design system layout sentence how and

00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,110
where to use these components now how

00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,570
things will look pattern library is

00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:17,310
basically the UI components generally

00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:20,220
you don't consider other things like the

00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:21,660
motion and all that stuff it is you can

00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:25,190
consider parallel arrays as a subset of

00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,190
this thing of the design system

00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:38,880
so the slides are available here if

00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:44,300
anyone's interested and I guess that's

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:47,819
all if no doubts are there okay

00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,819
