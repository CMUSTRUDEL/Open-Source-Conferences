Talk: Scalable Fedora Design - Embracing Design Systems
Presenters: Abhishek Sharma

Description: Do you know the Fedora website uses 6 different shades of the Fedora blue? Even the font size is specified in different forms for different elements - sometimes it’s percentage, sometimes ems and sometimes even px or rems. I feel it’s the time for Fedora to embraces a design system to ensure consistency and manage design debt.
A design system unites teams around a common visual language. It reduces design debt, accelerates the design process, and builds bridges between teams working.
Many teams are now taking a more systematic approach to design by using Design Systems. But What is actually is a design system? What makes a well-functioning system? What do effective systems have in common? Finally, how can Fedora actually go about laying the foundations for a shared design language?
These are some questions to which I will share my answers with the community.
