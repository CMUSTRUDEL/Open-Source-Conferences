	00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:07,290
so yeah I was told please provide me

00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,170
your slides and that will integrate them

00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:12,090
into the rest of the deck so I chose to

00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,820
not have a title and then on top of that

00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:19,679
I have a mish mish mash I can't even

00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:21,659
talk of like formats going through so it

00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:24,239
should it should look awesome

00:00:21,659 --> 00:00:26,310
so I'm Langton white I've been the

00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,390
modularity objective lead for quite some

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,449
time now

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:33,090
I think rings are trash as if you've

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:35,789
seen my older talks you'll know why

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,500
and I think modularity is much better so

00:00:35,789 --> 00:00:41,160
this is a little bit of an objective

00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:43,469
update unfortunately I don't have lots

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,350
and lots of bullets because that would

00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:52,190
require me to like write bullets so

00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:55,710
instead I have fun pictures so Fedora 27

00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:57,559
with modularity we were so close we

00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,870
really were and I would disagree with

00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:05,190
Gallagher from earlier I still have hope

00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:07,320
and you know so we we have as you may

00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:09,000
have seen before the modularity Lego

00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,860
kind of theme going on so we've got a

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,400
nice Ninjago character there and the

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:16,680
guys I or gals I don't know

00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:19,650
so we tried really really hard to

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,420
basically do a fully modular OS that we

00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:25,290
could ship like essentially a minimal

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:27,720
set for fedora server for a number of

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,270
reasons but partially main like mostly

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,880
wrapped around maintaining it we decided

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:36,030
not to so the maintainer ship side of it

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:39,450
is it was as difficult if not more so to

00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:42,990
maintain the core component modules as

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:46,590
the entire distro and so until we find

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:49,710
ways to improve that that experience

00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:53,100
it's just it just wasn't something we

00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:55,950
could ship that combined with the humans

00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:58,380
involved in maintainer ship we kind of

00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:01,500
didn't really realize how much they

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:05,520
would have to be integrated immediately

00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:08,700
into the modularity effort in order for

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,990
us to maintain this set of base modules

00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,760
and so as a result

00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:17,290
kind of have to we had always wanted it

00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:18,820
to be kind of an opt-in feeling but we

00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:20,880
kind of would have to opt-in that which

00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:23,410
is like 200 people or something

00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:26,160
immediately and we thought that probably

00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:30,900
wasn't going to fly very well so that

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:37,450
was why we said back off on Fedora 27

00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:40,630
then moving on then we decided hey why

00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:45,580
don't we blow the whole thing up and and

00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:47,050
redo it differently so in the in the

00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,380
simplest case what we decided to do was

00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:54,130
essentially cheat at the platform level

00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:57,240
and declare existing rpms as if they

00:02:54,130 --> 00:03:00,400
were the core of the and now I'm gonna

00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:04,690
yeah right no I was good I was gonna

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:07,360
collide I'm core OS actually but so the

00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:09,040
the core component and call it the

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,920
platform module is what we were calling

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:17,200
it originally but just treat traditional

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:19,030
Fedora as that module so in theory and

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,380
the incredibly short blog post that

00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:22,450
Steven Gallagher wrote about it this

00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:24,490
sounds really easy and there's a nice

00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:26,980
picture here that makes it look really

00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:28,240
easy and oh my god it ran into a bunch

00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:31,510
of problems that we didn't anticipate

00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:36,840
because the architecture changed in the

00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:36,840
middle and so that was fun but but

00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:44,300
we did finally ship it and it works in

00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:47,840
Fedora 28 that one over there is my

00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:52,970
daughter that kid I don't know these

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:54,800
guys you know who they are so we we

00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:56,300
managed to ship it it's it wasn't

00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,340
everything we hope to dream but it does

00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,830
in server you know works well with DNF

00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,150
you can have multiple versions of things

00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:04,100
it actually was kind of mind-blowing

00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:06,920
literally I think it was like a week or

00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:09,320
two before we released I was trying to

00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:12,440
get a piece of software to run it needed

00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:15,350
node it no js' six we only had no js8 in

00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:18,470
f28 and so I used a module for nodejs

00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:21,470
six and it just worked it was crazy

00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:24,050
so but we still needed all these changes

00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:26,419
in Lib DNF so that all the other package

00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:29,030
managers that kind of you know are used

00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:30,979
in various places in fedora would

00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:33,919
inherit but basically knowledge of

00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:36,830
modularity that took a while

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:43,550
however I think it's in rawhide and

00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:46,790
working officially now as mostly so but

00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:53,810
the goal is to have that ironed out you

00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:55,100
know as soon as possible so it landed

00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,900
two weeks ago and no one has complained

00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:01,970
although I have seen some complaints so

00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:03,200
yeah great insult exactly exactly if

00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:04,190
someone's if someone's complaining that

00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,850
means they're using it which is always

00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:09,950
good so then finally I just want to

00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:12,200
wanted to talk about and this is kind of

00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:14,120
where we're going so there's currently a

00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,470
fedora change this one's terrible I

00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,440
agree I couldn't

00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:21,050
who takes a picture of a thing with

00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:26,750
black edges on a black background I mean

00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:30,810
really like so but it was missing all

00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:33,060
the all the edges are black whatever

00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:34,889
I'm very annoyed with the random people

00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:38,040
on the internet who I you know steal

00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:41,060
their work but there are attributions

00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:45,169
it's all fair use you know whatever but

00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:47,250
so what I want to talk about here was

00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:51,150
you know modules for everyone is the

00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:52,800
name of the change for f30 and the idea

00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:55,290
basically that we will have modules in

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,620
all the editions and available you know

00:05:55,290 --> 00:06:00,600
in containers etc in the package

00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:04,139
managers that are appropriate to those

00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:11,940
environments sorry

00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:14,250
Oh 28 wait 29 yeah so yeah I have a

00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:16,590
mental block about what version were on

00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:21,090
and which ones next I always mess it up

00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:24,030
so the next version whatever that is so

00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:30,479
that's modules for a even wrote F 29 in

00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:33,150
my notes so I have notes so modules for

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:35,310
everyone that's the idea however the big

00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:37,320
thing is we need more modules you know

00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:39,300
Matt alluded to it earlier we need

00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:41,340
people creating them we also need to

00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,530
improve our tooling such that it can be

00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:46,050
essentially a non-event to create a

00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:48,600
module which we're very close on but we

00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:50,400
have to kind of you know kind of improve

00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,350
the kind of documentation and getting it

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:56,520
out there and that kind of stuff but

00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:59,460
it's mostly in place let's see what else

00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,620
oh and then we also want to make sure

00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,419
that we get a stronger integration with

00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,400
modules leading to various container

00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:08,310
technologies so that might be snaps it

00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,680
might be flat packs it might be you know

00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:12,600
we don't say that you know the whatever

00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,990
pod man containers now or build up

00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,990
containers

00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:23,269
yeah cryo is yeah whatever yeah OCI

00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:25,729
images there you go that's good that's a

00:07:23,269 --> 00:07:26,359
good nun yeah it's a good PC way to put

00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:29,959
it

00:07:26,359 --> 00:07:32,449
so yeah but I reinforce we need more

00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:35,049
modules really hope the community can

00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:38,179
start participating and find it useful

00:07:35,049 --> 00:07:39,259
but I highly recommend trying out being

00:07:38,179 --> 00:07:43,879
able to use two different versions of

00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:45,889
something it's really really handy then

00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:47,869
the last thing I want to talk about was

00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:50,959
just kind of the talks that will be

00:07:47,869 --> 00:07:53,329
covering during flock about these

00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:55,459
subjects modularity also will touch some

00:07:53,329 --> 00:07:59,119
other talks and if I miss a direct one I

00:07:55,459 --> 00:08:01,849
apologize but there's the talk later

00:07:59,119 --> 00:08:05,389
today that Matt also talked about

00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:07,609
already that is Paul fields and somebody

00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:10,669
I can remove and somebody else would

00:08:07,609 --> 00:08:12,859
Paul oh and Josh will be giving that's

00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:15,049
kind of talking about life cycle and why

00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:18,079
it's interesting and why you know and

00:08:15,049 --> 00:08:20,119
modularity is a big part of that and

00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:22,669
then the too fast too slow so this is

00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:24,769
Steven and I kind of talking about when

00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:27,019
does the module make sense and when

00:08:24,769 --> 00:08:29,539
might it not and so we have a bunch of

00:08:27,019 --> 00:08:31,669
use cases where we kind of say you know

00:08:29,539 --> 00:08:33,709
this this is a good idea for this reason

00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:35,839
and how to do that

00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:38,870
and then after that I actually am doing

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,490
a talk about what other distributions

00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:43,159
are doing to solve this same problem

00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:45,319
because over the last whatever number of

00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:47,300
years we've been working on this other

00:08:45,319 --> 00:08:49,759
distributions have noticed the same

00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:52,790
problem and have started to have other

00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:57,050
solutions for example Amazon Linux two

00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:59,809
is a good example then that's my talk

00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:02,839
and then the modularity restrain this is

00:08:59,809 --> 00:09:04,610
Steven Gallagher again and Mohan talking

00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:06,189
about how the modules get built and how

00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,720
that you know that whole pipeline works

00:09:06,189 --> 00:09:10,250
and then the state of fedora server

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,410
Edition and talking about where the

00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:14,240
future of the server is and it's tight

00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:17,029
integration with modularity so please

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:20,360
come to that for ideas and then finally

00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:21,709
we're gonna do a helpdesk style you know

00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,879
kind of workshop where if you want to

00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:24,500
come and build a module or you're not

00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:26,959
sure how do or whatever you can come in

00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,880
and ask us and I will be there but I

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:32,270
won't really be the expert it'll be like

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:36,550
telogen people so yeah but so those are

00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:39,670
all of them and I think that's my stick

00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:39,670
thank you

00:09:45,540 --> 00:10:00,360
our next speaker is going to be Steph

00:09:47,799 --> 00:10:02,709
Walters doc sorry I apologize for the

00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,779
wait happens you're not allowed that

00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:08,829
slides either apparently oh wait are you

00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:10,389
this one yeah so I have mispronounced

00:10:08,829 --> 00:10:14,259
Steph name Steph's name and I want to

00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:18,730
apologize that he is Steph Walter yeah

00:10:14,259 --> 00:10:20,619
yes is Colin here alright he's now

00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:24,759
calling Walter - this way I don't have

00:10:20,619 --> 00:10:27,249
to learn which one has the s do you want

00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:28,929
this micro do you want this Mike that's

00:10:27,249 --> 00:10:29,619
good alright this Mike is this Mike is

00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:31,569
totally awesome

00:10:29,619 --> 00:10:36,489
please welcome stuff he's gonna talk to

00:10:31,569 --> 00:10:42,399
us about continuous integration so

00:10:36,489 --> 00:10:54,089
Dominic was good we have to find the

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:54,089
mouse and now we click the thing

00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:00,910
make it happen

00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:08,510
alright so Dominic is actually the

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,360
objective lead and I am NOT Dominic

00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:13,490
Dominic couldn't make it but I'm happy

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,830
to update you on how Fedora CI is

00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:17,960
looking this is this is something that

00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:22,670
was started around the time of the last

00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:24,470
flock and the the intent was we started

00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:26,390
with atomic host but we expanded beyond

00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:29,270
that was to make sure that changes in

00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:32,030
fedora land when they're functional not

00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:34,100
just when they're packaged right we

00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:36,200
prevent that non-functional changes from

00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,300
landing so that they don't break other

00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:41,000
people's development work users of

00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:43,040
fedora and so on from this is known as

00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,350
continuous integration basically

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,150
integrating the thing together making

00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:49,310
sure that it's tested the whole thing is

00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:56,930
coherent and doing that for every single

00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:59,930
change so a bunch of pieces are there

00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:01,340
and working one of the biggest

00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:03,230
fundamental changes that you would have

00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:06,350
noticed is that instead of just defining

00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:09,110
what goes into fedora in disk it

00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:12,530
we started defining how it works and

00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:14,690
that is the tests directory or test

00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:18,650
directory you can see this in so many of

00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:21,350
the packages that aren't for Darnell and

00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:24,500
these are tests from all over the place

00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:26,600
wrapped in a standard specification kind

00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,200
of like we take tar balls from all over

00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,740
the place

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,210
wrap them in spec files and you know by

00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:34,220
hook or by crook bring them in to a

00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:36,530
consistent packaging format similar

00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:38,180
effort and that's been going on in

00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:39,920
addition the pipeline to run the tests

00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:44,890
have been running it's been running

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:47,930
against Fedora 27 Ford or 28 Tomic hosts

00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:50,720
the results are being stored in results

00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:53,600
dB there's a engine called green wave

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:58,250
that has policy for gating on those

00:12:53,600 --> 00:13:01,390
tests and there's code in bode that

00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,390
allows gating

00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:08,470
so on the other side we also want to

00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:11,770
modernize the workflow because it turns

00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:14,410
out people nowadays use pull requests

00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:16,810
use proposed changes use code review and

00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:18,550
we were not doing that in this skit this

00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:22,060
is something that was started as well

00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:23,620
many of you were involved in a pingu

00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,120
couldn't make it this time to flock but

00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:30,520
he's been someone who's been heralding

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:33,610
this and there's pagaron diskette source

00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:35,050
SRC dot four-door project dot work it's

00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,310
not just a theoretical thing it's not

00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:39,760
just a prototype people are actually

00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:42,900
using it and this is what's really cool

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:46,420
[Applause]

00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:49,480
there's a 4500 pour requests that have

00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:51,340
been filed and know most of them have

00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:54,340
been merged and closed they're not just

00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:56,140
standing there and before you ask where

00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:58,030
those all automated or there's all

00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:59,320
scripts or whether there's a just a few

00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:01,570
people well it turns out some of them

00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:04,210
were automated open but if you look at

00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:06,340
those very carefully that I know that

00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:08,920
the Python project renaming a bunch of

00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:12,070
packages posted a ton of pull requests

00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,530
if you look at those you'll see that

00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:16,060
many of them are opened by someone

00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:17,980
reviewed and merged by someone else and

00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:21,640
that's exactly what we want to see so

00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:23,500
that's cool in addition 250 diskit repos

00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:26,620
have used more than two pull requests so

00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:29,830
you can look at that 4500 and if you're

00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:31,210
thinking oh most all of those are from

00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,720
such a mass effort now that's not the

00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:34,000
case

00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:36,940
250 different project different repos

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,830
have used more than two pull requests or

00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:40,870
two to pull requests or more actually

00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:42,400
that's wrong yeah and so that's actually

00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:44,230
showing that code reviews starting

00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:47,110
people are actually using this and that

00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:48,940
change in the way we do development the

00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:51,160
way we collaborate on stuff rather than

00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:53,680
having a single king of the repository

00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,910
or a package the maintainer were

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,070
actually starting to collaborate

00:14:54,910 --> 00:15:00,750
properly starting to act more like

00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:00,750
modern development like github

00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:08,970
and excuse me the problem is given all

00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:12,990
those ingredients we have tests we have

00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:15,810
tests running we have pull requests we

00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:19,650
have a code review going on we're still

00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:20,520
in the awkward place where CI is not

00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:23,640
having an effect

00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:25,710
and so Schrodinger's test is a test

00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,390
where no one looks at the results and

00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:30,150
that test can be said to have neither

00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:32,310
past nor failed until someone takes a

00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:34,650
look until it has an effect until it has

00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:38,100
an action and I have pointed my finger

00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:39,570
at various CI efforts and said hey this

00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,180
is a problem well it turns out this is

00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:46,920
happening pretty close to home so

00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:49,710
awkward and we need to close that gap in

00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:55,190
order for the Fedora CI objective to

00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:58,980
meet its goals this needs to be done and

00:15:55,190 --> 00:16:01,170
let's see what that would take so there

00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:02,750
is assembly still required we have

00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:05,640
pieces that are really working

00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:10,830
individually great but they're not

00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:13,050
working together we tried and around

00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:14,250
last flock was a time when the gating

00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:17,550
was going to be enabled then it got

00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:21,950
delayed due to various deadlines it was

00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:21,950
enabled for packages that opted in for

00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:27,570
quite a few months like four months

00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:30,450
until April what does gating mean in

00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:33,840
this case it means that a package that

00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:35,610
has broken or failing tests does not get

00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:39,600
to merge something through Bodhi doesn't

00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:43,020
know I get to have it's it's update go

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,300
into the compose via Bodhi so in April

00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:47,520
the gating policy was disabled well

00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:51,510
actually the gating mechanics are still

00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:53,820
there but all the policy was removed for

00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:57,690
any not just for testing biscuit but for

00:16:53,820 --> 00:17:01,050
other stuff too so that gating is pretty

00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:04,230
much off it's not enforced in in in in

00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:05,940
Bodhi so workflows were being

00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:07,800
interrupted it was a good point there

00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:11,130
was some usability issues particularly

00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:14,100
around waving of fail of false positives

00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:15,089
you know so you know this is not this is

00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:19,360
not

00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:24,910
it was terrible it was terrible

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:27,520
exactly and since April so that's four

00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:29,230
months by the time this is fixed

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,660
probably have five or six months to fix

00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:35,559
that terrible UX and people in this

00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:37,570
community here and I meant and then

00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:39,190
someone who are not someone couldn't

00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:41,410
make it have been working on fixing that

00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:43,990
so apparently you know it takes some

00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:45,910
time to make that change in the meantime

00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:48,610
though the tests that are there are

00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:50,410
having no effect and the tests are bit

00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:53,320
rotting because as you as you change the

00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:55,840
package if the test is not enforced to

00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:57,429
be updated for a given behavioral change

00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,980
or something like that it gets out of

00:17:57,429 --> 00:18:02,260
sync and eventually you have most of the

00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:03,640
tests in a rotten state so this is not a

00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:07,780
good place to be in something that we

00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:10,630
need to fix so what do we need to happen

00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:12,580
well there are Bodhi fixes for this UI

00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:15,010
change for this for the for the UI fix

00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:18,700
they have been coded and they are in

00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:20,110
staging they need to be deployed the

00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:25,000
gating policy needs to be enabled again

00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:28,120
and remember all those 4500 cool pull

00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,950
requests that are using that are using

00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,240
code review that are that are having

00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:33,990
multiple contributors to a change in

00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:37,330
discont we need to finish doing the work

00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:38,980
to actually do testing on those pull

00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:41,110
requests tie the test results back to

00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:43,030
the pull request this is not theoretical

00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:46,059
this is happening and other Pegler

00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:47,500
instances on disk --it so really it's

00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:49,150
just deploying the changes here and

00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:54,910
actually having them taking effect in

00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:57,280
the Fedora community so pitch Brian

00:18:54,910 --> 00:19:00,580
Stinson he's giving a talk about Ford or

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:03,790
CI he's there because see this talk

00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:06,640
about the pipeline about how it effects

00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:09,280
a packager maintainer about the waving

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:13,120
the the terrible UI changes that are now

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:15,580
being fixed about all aspects of this

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,350
and about how fedora and sent us are

00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:20,650
also this is a great example of Fedora

00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:23,840
CentOS working together so make sure to

00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:34,590
go to that talk all right

00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:36,360
that's it thank you very much next up is

00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,980
going to be Peter Robinson whose slides

00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:44,090
we hope have collapsed into a single

00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:44,090
quantum state probably not

00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:57,750
do you use HD which are the 700

00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:00,480
standards of video connector I can't

00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:03,110
pull that out I think I can use that one

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,110
all right

00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:19,380
except upholstered pieces you're never

00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:22,250
getting that power cord back it's a

00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:22,250
community effort

00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,940
seriously that's your password

00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:45,870
I am disappointed you need more entropy

00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:47,520
I know it's a great wallpaper but a

00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:55,559
single letter password that's just

00:20:47,520 --> 00:21:01,020
unreal well I understand it runs it like

00:20:55,559 --> 00:21:04,919
an IOT device and no computer can work

00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:07,799
that fast so I'd like to introduce Peter

00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:10,260
Robinson talking to us about IOT maybe

00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:16,530
yes okay IOT do you want this mic or

00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:20,880
that mic I think it may even it may even

00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:24,799
work hi I'm Peter I'm the fedora IOT

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,799
lead for the objective

00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:32,820
it may even oh my laptop needs a reboot

00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:37,620
but I wasn't going to risk it just

00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:40,230
before wrong yeah you know anyway so

00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:43,890
this is an update to the one I gave to

00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:46,890
Council back in February Valentine's Day

00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:50,120
if I remember correctly no one ever said

00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:50,120
I wasn't married to the project

00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:58,499
so just quickly how we fit to the Fedora

00:21:56,429 --> 00:22:00,389
mission I don't think I need to go into

00:21:58,499 --> 00:22:06,149
too much detail Matt covered this fairly

00:22:00,389 --> 00:22:10,470
well and his talk so yes so it's to make

00:22:06,149 --> 00:22:14,879
it Fedora a default place to innovate

00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:20,249
for IOT and i-80 related areas I realize

00:22:14,879 --> 00:22:24,960
I ot is a vast swathe of a billion

00:22:20,249 --> 00:22:27,590
different ideas out there and so and

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,179
most people that know me realize I have

00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:34,019
more fingers than I have in more pies

00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:35,580
than I could eat so for the first time

00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:37,470
in a long time I'm actually trying to

00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:40,139
focus on small bits so that I actually

00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:43,019
or we as a community actually achieve

00:22:40,139 --> 00:22:45,149
stuff but of course can't be done by

00:22:43,019 --> 00:22:49,309
just me even though in a lot of cases

00:22:45,149 --> 00:22:49,309
people know that I will try

00:22:53,070 --> 00:23:07,380
whoo so the audience well it's many

00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:09,269
varied wide so hopefully and especially

00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:12,059
in the case of things like the raspberry

00:23:09,269 --> 00:23:13,919
pie I'm hoping that we can get this into

00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:15,590
the education thing and I was going to

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:19,259
have a chat with Matt at some point

00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:22,169
based on his education slide that made

00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:23,970
it know where there's a bunch of

00:23:22,169 --> 00:23:26,220
different ideas and a bunch of different

00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:29,070
initiatives around the place where this

00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:31,080
is useful I'm hoping to be able to fix

00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:36,149
up a bunch of the Raspberry Pi

00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:38,220
stuff with Tom spot Callaway in the

00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:41,009
fedora 29 release which makes it much

00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:42,690
better for the makerspace because we'll

00:23:41,009 --> 00:23:44,700
have hopefully support for cameras and

00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:47,370
hats and various other bits and pieces

00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:53,789
which we haven't had up until now but

00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:57,299
anyway I ot gateways home automation one

00:23:53,789 --> 00:24:00,559
of the fabian has had homer system up

00:23:57,299 --> 00:24:03,950
and running on fedora IOT already

00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:07,200
embedded use cases there's a bunch of

00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:09,029
company and people and various

00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,360
organizations they're interested in

00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:16,200
using it in routers gateways switches

00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:17,820
storage all sorts of various other weird

00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:21,809
and wonderful things that I've never

00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:25,740
even thought of and obviously one of the

00:24:21,809 --> 00:24:28,080
interesting things that IOT brings to

00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:30,659
fedora which we've not had it in the

00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:33,259
past so much from different

00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:37,529
organizations is there's a bunch of

00:24:33,259 --> 00:24:39,149
companies and partners and various other

00:24:37,529 --> 00:24:42,799
bits and pieces that are interested in

00:24:39,149 --> 00:24:45,179
working with us a lot of my time I spend

00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,409
dealing with enterprise stuff as well

00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:49,440
and we've had some very interesting

00:24:46,409 --> 00:24:51,990
meetings with various different and it's

00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,840
amazing the number of organizations that

00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:59,990
have reached out to me about this so I'm

00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:03,169
hoping that'll be a way that we get

00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:06,190
different organizations than traditional

00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:10,360
involve more info Dora

00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:16,230
so we have obviously my objective update

00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:19,300
now is to use case birds of a feather

00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:20,830
Thursday afternoon so if people are

00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:24,220
interested in various different use

00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:25,990
cases interested in working getting it

00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:28,510
on road maps and various bits and pieces

00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:30,790
come along to that and I'll be directing

00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:34,929
that I don't intend on being the only

00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:37,150
person speaking their spod and I are

00:25:34,929 --> 00:25:39,730
doing Fedora on the Raspberry Pi talk

00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:42,190
where we've been where we're going so if

00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:44,920
you're interested in the thousand

00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:47,500
different uses for the Raspberry Pi come

00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:49,929
along to that and you'll get to see a

00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:51,850
bunch of the issues we've had where

00:25:49,929 --> 00:25:55,240
we've been current status and where

00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:59,440
we're going there and then the IOT hack

00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:01,750
face fest on Saturday morning of which

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:05,860
I'm going to be doing up an agenda and

00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:07,929
I'll publish that and if you find me in

00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:09,160
the intervening time if there's stuff

00:26:07,929 --> 00:26:13,300
that you're interested in addressing

00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:15,100
there come along to that and we'll get

00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:17,710
it added to the agenda it should be

00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:20,320
fairly fluid I have a bunch of devices

00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:22,150
and a bunch of stuff and a bunch of

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:25,720
fedora features for Twentynine that I'll

00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:27,550
be working on and helping people out in

00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:31,270
various different bits and pieces and of

00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:32,860
course there's the hallway track because

00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:34,630
you know everyone who knows me knows

00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:40,690
that I like to talk just a little bit

00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:45,580
about IAT so quick technical overview

00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:49,470
I've crossed things out I did crossed

00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:53,740
out x86 86

00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:55,480
although just last week I actually had

00:26:53,740 --> 00:27:00,630
an official request for this and that

00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:03,640
made me sad that the company that

00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:06,520
requested it was requested to actually

00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:07,929
if if they want it that much they were

00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:10,390
told that they need to commit resources

00:27:07,929 --> 00:27:12,970
from the kernel upwards so we'll see

00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:16,300
where that request goes it may be good

00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:18,660
for the ice x86 community in general but

00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:21,150
we'll see

00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:23,850
so as I've mentioned in various

00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:28,820
different places I was very excited

00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:31,470
about the core OS Fedora announcement

00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:33,450
because I think there's a bunch of

00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:37,320
technologies including their updates

00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:40,740
platform whenever that gets released as

00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:46,830
open source that is very exciting from

00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:49,550
an IOT point of view a bunch of stuff

00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:52,080
was covered both by Matt and dusty and

00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:53,880
various other people previously so I'm

00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:59,490
not going to go into all of it

00:27:53,880 --> 00:28:03,810
Multi arch 64-bit x86 64 bit arm on v7

00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:07,920
is coming really soon multi arch

00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:10,110
container builds in OS BS covered

00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:15,480
previously looking forward to that in

00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:17,520
Fedora 29 the plan at the moment is to

00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:21,060
do monthly releases so similar to the

00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:24,140
way atomic was doing two-week atomic

00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:28,110
releases we're probably going to aim for

00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:30,930
monthly sort of rolling releases and

00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:33,510
then automatically moving the releases

00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:34,110
from 28 to 29 to 30 and so on and so

00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:37,890
forth

00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:41,030
and as much see I see detesting as

00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:46,050
possible primarily because I'm lazy so

00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:49,110
we have as dusty mentioned Fedora 28

00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:51,360
nightly releases there we're very much

00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:52,980
just testing the water and to get stuff

00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,910
out there for people to start to play

00:28:52,980 --> 00:29:00,870
with there pretty static and just

00:28:56,910 --> 00:29:03,810
rolling along at the moment f29 is where

00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:05,970
all the fun is landing as I mentioned

00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:08,580
we'll have our v7 shortly I have a whole

00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:11,700
bunch of patches and pull requests in

00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:13,560
process that should by the end of the

00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:15,810
week have them enabled whether they

00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:19,880
actually boot or not will be fun and

00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:19,880
games for mr. Jones and myself to debug

00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:25,530
the contain a tech that we're focusing

00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:31,020
on is the OCI initiative we're shipping

00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:32,900
pod man and not docker by default in the

00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:35,280
images because we

00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:39,210
obviously with IOT a lot of small

00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:43,950
devices so minimum resource utilization

00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:47,820
as possible we'll be moving to the core

00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:50,550
OS bits and focus more on that as they

00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:55,670
land and I'll be following the core OS

00:29:50,550 --> 00:30:01,170
Fedora upstream merge pretty closely and

00:29:55,670 --> 00:30:04,170
hopefully as I mentioned so Fedora 29

00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:06,840
should be a spin I'm hoping Fedora 30

00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:10,020
will be an official edition with all the

00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:12,930
core OS bits there at the moment we have

00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:15,650
a handful of supported devices raspberry

00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:17,730
Pi the 96 board's dragon board 410

00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:23,370
there's going to be a number of other

00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:25,770
devices in Fedora 29 my plan so all of

00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:28,250
the fedora arm devices and x86 and

00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:32,520
everything will work and be supported or

00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:35,730
supportable my intention with IOT is a

00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:41,640
little bit and we'll see how this works

00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:44,580
out trying to dangle carrots for vendors

00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:46,080
to get more actively involved if they

00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:48,210
want their device to be officially

00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,970
supported and they can come along and

00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:53,760
help do some of the work if they don't

00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:56,520
wish to do any work it won't be official

00:30:53,760 --> 00:31:01,190
release blocking device we'll see how

00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:01,190
that works out yes

00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:19,660
it is one common thing that contains all

00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:23,020
the drivers so we're using standard

00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:25,210
Fedora kernel at the moment I haven't

00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:32,950
subjected the kernel team to a custom

00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:34,750
kernel and I mean my intention there is

00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:38,740
to keep it as generic as possible

00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:40,900
because the ability like if we a lot of

00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:43,480
distributions produce an image per

00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:46,270
device and in arm in general we've

00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:49,150
managed to avoid that to date and it

00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:52,270
generally works relatively well and we

00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:54,550
generally get like so Raspberry Pi is

00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:57,040
obviously the most common device in arm

00:31:54,550 --> 00:32:00,100
I expect that to be the case in the IOT

00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:02,530
ecosystem at least initially although

00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:04,300
there is some fairly cool devices that

00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:08,890
I'm hoping that we should have details

00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:12,340
about in Fedora 29 shortly for some very

00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:15,280
interesting IOT use cases the 96 ports

00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:19,410
are ultra 96 with FPGA and things like

00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:22,060
that plus some other higher-end devices

00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:24,880
so we should have more details about

00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:27,640
them and availability around that

00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:31,720
shortly but yeah the intention is to

00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:35,650
have single images available and we'll

00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:37,510
be doing as we get more into it I've

00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:40,210
been asked a lot about how we deal with

00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:43,090
vendor kernels and things like that

00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:44,980
and that certainly on the roadmap but

00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:47,140
obviously I want to focus on stuff

00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:49,300
that's purely in fedora initially so we

00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:50,860
can get a good experience there before

00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:55,590
we start to go more into those sort of

00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:55,590
corner cases and what-have-you so

00:32:57,190 --> 00:33:01,740
the other thing I wanted to highlight is

00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:04,300
we had our first google Summer of Code

00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:11,950
participant Christian who's somewhere

00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:14,320
here I hope thanks to dusty and Jonathan

00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:17,220
for helping the mental side of things

00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:21,370
because it was very much os tree focused

00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:24,160
we pulled in a host of other people

00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:27,760
Peter Jones with grub

00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:32,500
Lenart for system D advice various other

00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:36,520
atomic core OS Colin Walters etc etc

00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:38,680
people the idea is that it's a you know

00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:41,350
you're applying OS update it goes and

00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:43,510
runs a series of health checks checks

00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:45,160
that it can speak to the update platform

00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:48,460
checks that it can get out to the

00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:51,040
internet if necessary checks census and

00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:52,690
various devices that need to be there so

00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:55,240
if it suddenly can't see you know

00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:56,770
critical temperature sensors or

00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,600
something like that it will

00:33:56,770 --> 00:34:00,280
automatically initiate a roll back to

00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:03,610
the previous version

00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:07,420
it was obviously IOT focus for G sock

00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:09,790
the the project as a whole is generic

00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:13,030
and can be used in a standard fedora

00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:15,310
system or an atomic system obviously

00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:17,590
force' standard fedora system it's going

00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:20,620
to be much harder to have a rollback to

00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:24,280
be complete previous version but it's

00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:26,320
generic christian managed to touch

00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:28,840
things from grub all the way through

00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:31,690
system day up white up through so he's

00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:34,480
done very very well and this was very

00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:41,160
exciting and it should be landing into

00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:41,160
rawhide really shortly community

00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:51,650
thanks to the new program manager

00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:55,100
we now have an initial version of the

00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:59,680
PRD and the working group stuff is in

00:34:55,100 --> 00:35:02,600
progress so I'm very excited about that

00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:06,890
we're doing standard fedora mechanisms

00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:08,990
articles various other evangelism to

00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:12,770
build out the community dealing with

00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:15,500
partners etc and that's we're starting

00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:17,420
to actually the meetings are becoming

00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:19,910
fairly active with quite a few

00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:22,670
contributors even though we've only been

00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:25,820
sort of had images and stuff around for

00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:27,950
maybe two months now so I'm very excited

00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:31,490
about that that I'm not the only one

00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:36,620
that's doing it all and then we have

00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:39,740
various communications methods including

00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:43,780
a number of bits that flock obviously

00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:43,780
and that's it

00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:48,689
[Applause]

00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:55,090
you mind leaving your laptop just so we

00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:57,580
have a black screen so I would like to

00:35:55,090 --> 00:36:00,310
bring Matthew Miller back up to do some

00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:03,850
Q&A for us and then I'll tell you about

00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:06,400
lunch no pressure Matthew also for

00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:08,440
anyone who is speaking anywhere at any

00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:11,110
time in the world at a conference always

00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:12,910
repeat your questions that's doubly

00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:14,350
important here because if it doesn't

00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:16,120
come out of the speakers it doesn't go

00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:18,190
in the recording and then you hear

00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:21,220
things like yeah that's a great question

00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:25,990
so if you put 47 in the registry your

00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:30,460
machine will not explode we have a

00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:32,290
registry now it's terrible yeah I didn't

00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:33,880
do questions after my talk because I

00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:35,980
didn't know how efficiently the whole

00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:39,970
rest of things would go but I am happy

00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:41,620
to take some now ask me anything if I

00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:48,070
don't know the answer I will either make

00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:49,450
something up or redirect you so you

00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:56,040
don't get lunch earlier if you don't

00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:56,040
have any questions so yeah

00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:13,950
yeah so the question is I mean the

00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,740
matchstick graph about new contributors

00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:19,109
by release there were quite a few in the

00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:22,680
fedora 23 time frame relative to other

00:37:19,109 --> 00:37:27,030
ones no I don't have any particular

00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:29,900
reason I don't know why that was so good

00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:37,170
at bringing things on see when was that

00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:38,820
subtract back in years five so yeah it

00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:40,980
was around this time the first flock

00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:44,730
maybe that kind of helped bring people

00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:48,480
in I think some of the fedora neck stuff

00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:51,630
was taking off so that kind of kind of I

00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:54,119
think it goes along with a surge in

00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:58,290
popularity overall so I think that might

00:37:54,119 --> 00:38:01,200
be the easiest explanation well but I

00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:04,140
don't I haven't dug into that deeply all

00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,880
the stuff is from public data so I'd be

00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:08,970
really interested in anybody else who

00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:11,550
wants to try and figure out what yeah

00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:13,380
yeah what kind of what makes those

00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:18,170
things kind of happen and how we can

00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:18,170
replicate it yeah

00:38:22,729 --> 00:38:25,729
yeah

00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:39,870
very good actually

00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:41,580
yeah so the question was I said earlier

00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:43,470
that it'd be nice to actually have you

00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:45,870
you IDs and could if you have a better

00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:48,930
sense of what's going on and the

00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:51,240
question is why why don't we have that

00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:53,760
already and what what's the barrier to

00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:57,180
doing it and I think there is kind of

00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:59,730
two things one is like everything else

00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:02,310
ideas are easy lining up all the work is

00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:05,040
actually work and not all of those bits

00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:09,390
have been connected to do that we've

00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:11,730
also had a lot of concern and care in

00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:14,060
the community for privacy and we want to

00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:16,560
make sure we do it in a way that

00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:22,350
respects people's you know preferences

00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:25,110
for privacy i we had previously had a

00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:27,720
thing a long time ago that was an opt-in

00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:30,930
data collection mechanism and that kind

00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:33,180
of failed for two reasons one was the

00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:35,970
amount of data was so huge that it

00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:38,940
overwhelmed the programming of that

00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:41,550
original service and then nobody it was

00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:43,920
able to update it but also because it

00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:46,620
was opt-in we didn't have a really good

00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,570
way of measuring like that versus

00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:49,530
reality and it seemed from the numbers

00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:51,510
we were getting that it was kind of

00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:53,430
skewed in certain ways so it didn't seem

00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:56,100
that valuable so we feel like we kind of

00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:58,200
need something that is opt-out at least

00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:59,070
but with a minimal amount of data we

00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,450
need kind of figure out the right

00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:04,310
balance to all that in a way that

00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:04,310
respects privacy and is useful

00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:15,440
right

00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:22,540
yeah so the old opt-in system was a full

00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:24,040
hardware profile which is probably it's

00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:25,900
pretty hard to make that anonymous

00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:28,390
because it gets unique very quickly

00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:30,490
because there's only so much entropy in

00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:33,160
the world and every little bit cuts it

00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:34,810
down but something very minimal we can

00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,730
probably do in a way that respects

00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:40,290
people's privacy and that's it's mostly

00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:40,290
just a matter of doing it at this point

00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,420
yeah and yeah also figuring out how much

00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:48,610
information we want to include and still

00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:51,040
you know do we processor architecture

00:40:48,610 --> 00:41:01,210
you know what what level do we put into

00:40:51,040 --> 00:41:03,580
the popped out data Stephen what is the

00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:08,950
optimum number of bullets to put in the

00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:16,540
head of I 686 I made me that's a

00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:20,220
question back for Chuck what's that Oh

00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:22,660
how many bullets should we put in I 686

00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:24,430
yeah and so that's kind of hard I mean

00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:26,140
you see in this slide there it's still

00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:29,010
about you know 20% of the system's

00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:31,450
checking in I haven't broken that down

00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:34,420
because I would need to make smooth do

00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:37,690
it by latest releases by the way the

00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:39,490
data comes in to me I assume that most

00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:41,620
of that is an older releases and that if

00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:44,440
we look at current releases it's much

00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:48,910
higher on modern architectures but it

00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:51,100
still is a good chunk and the reason we

00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:53,680
haven't killed it so far is that when we

00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:55,810
said it's time for this to die people

00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:58,210
said wait wait I'm still using this I

00:41:55,810 --> 00:42:01,330
will maintain it so as long as people

00:41:58,210 --> 00:42:04,540
are doing that I think we should keep it

00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:07,750
alive if those people actually it you

00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:11,470
know say ok I can't do this anymore then

00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:15,870
it's time for it to be gently sunsetted

00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:19,900
without violence what fire

00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:25,839
Wow a lot of hatred for that I say 6

00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:34,390
I mic in the back of the room what are

00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:39,130
we doing to attract more use youths not

00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:40,650
olds Young's children's people younger

00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:45,579
than me

00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:47,109
Yeah right not all that much and that's

00:42:45,579 --> 00:42:49,660
something that we can do a lot better

00:42:47,109 --> 00:42:52,029
and I think yeah so I think the

00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:54,190
education market the slide I had there

00:42:52,029 --> 00:42:55,900
is good okay like I've got it I'm going

00:42:54,190 --> 00:43:01,529
to you got your hand up there you're

00:42:55,900 --> 00:43:01,529
gonna answer okay here come take the mic

00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:10,380
I'm handing this over to you mine share

00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:17,549
for those that don't know me I'm Edward

00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:20,099
Lucena now I'm working in from them

00:43:17,549 --> 00:43:24,099
representative of the marketing team and

00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:26,260
the talk I'm doing in in flock about

00:43:24,099 --> 00:43:28,230
marketing is especially to abort that

00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:30,789
kind of issues that we need to

00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:33,130
understand the new style of media

00:43:30,789 --> 00:43:37,180
consumers and try to attract them to the

00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:39,579
project one of the ideas we have is to

00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:41,799
retake the YouTube channel and make it

00:43:39,579 --> 00:43:44,020
more interactive is a lot of people

00:43:41,799 --> 00:43:47,140
they're looking for videos about fedora

00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:49,329
and we are now only publishing flock

00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:51,880
talks and that not right that is not

00:43:49,329 --> 00:43:54,539
attractive to new users the other things

00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:57,880
is already done is the podcast and

00:43:54,539 --> 00:43:59,770
another strategy where I'm going to work

00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:03,130
with the social media team it will be to

00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:05,289
take the Instagram TV to the channel so

00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:08,260
that's the main three things we are

00:44:05,289 --> 00:44:09,650
doing it right now Edward does the

00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:12,880
fedora podcast that's awesome

00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:15,440
[Applause]

00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:18,260
alright alright so not not all that much

00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:19,730
was a pessimistic view of it I think

00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:21,200
there's a lot more we can be doing I

00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:23,750
think the student outreach thing is

00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,700
important another thing we're

00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:27,890
experimenting with and I have a the

00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:29,710
discussion section about this we're

00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:33,170
experimenting with discourse which is a

00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:35,330
web forum platform and I can talk about

00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:38,810
that and hyper kitty and some of these

00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:40,070
other things I know well most of us are

00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:43,250
very familiar and comfortable with

00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:45,110
mailing lists mailing lists are not the

00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:47,600
future they are not the future of open

00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:49,400
source development and even though we

00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:52,250
may be used to them we need new ways to

00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:54,530
communicate we need to have a new web

00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:58,100
presence I know we had the fedora hubs

00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:59,960
initiative previously and we just

00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:01,880
weren't able to commit the resources to

00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:04,220
that to make that really successful so

00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:06,800
we need to kind of explore other ways to

00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:10,430
make a modern web presence for fedora so

00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:13,580
I think that's part of the way we need

00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:15,440
to do this too and I think also the IOT

00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:18,320
initiative is super-important for this

00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:21,050
when I started with computers

00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:23,690
it was Apple twos in the classroom

00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:25,790
hallway and the cool thing about it was

00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:27,440
there was commercial software that ran

00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:30,170
on those things and there was also you

00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:33,020
booted it up to basic and as a fourth

00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:34,610
grader with a lot of work but you know

00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:36,860
it was even within my graph to make

00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:39,110
programs that were basically as good as

00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:41,480
the programs that came on the purchase

00:45:39,110 --> 00:45:43,610
discs and so that was pretty like as a

00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:45,170
kid getting into computers that's

00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:46,910
powerful you can look at it and you're

00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:48,590
like if this computer boots up I can

00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:51,020
tell it what to do I can make it do

00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:53,600
these big important things if you get a

00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:56,900
computer today you know it's got a

00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:59,390
software that has billions of person

00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:00,860
hours into it if you play a game it's

00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:02,390
not a thing that you could write

00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:04,580
yourself it's something that you know

00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:08,030
takes a Hollywood production to make so

00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:10,160
that makes it the in to like making a

00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:13,220
computer do something that makes you

00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:17,870
feel powerful is is a lot harder with

00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:21,020
you know desktop PCs and today so IOT

00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:24,530
kind of gives that that this is not a

00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:26,480
pun it's a gateway basically in

00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:29,150
you into computing because you can get

00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:31,850
something like an Arduino or you know PI

00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:35,870
those things and you can make it do cool

00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:37,010
practical things that you are in full

00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:39,320
control of so I think that's an

00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:40,940
important thing that fedora really needs

00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:45,110
to address that will bring in more

00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:51,760
people who can are into computing and

00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:51,760
open source in general yeah

00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:13,520
yeah Josh is asking me about my slide my

00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:16,340
optimism slide and why it was so low at

00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:18,830
the last flock I think we had a lot of

00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:21,020
things on fire at that time that's kind

00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:23,990
of things that modularity stuff wasn't

00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:30,860
going so well the release we're working

00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:34,040
on is slipped I I just kind of an energy

00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:36,170
thing was low and I think I don't know

00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:38,960
maybe some personal burnout that happens

00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:42,080
I just came now off of two weeks of

00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:44,840
vacation and so maybe like right that's

00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:50,810
also also good for mapped ISM but yeah

00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:58,190
now I'm just feeling good I'm allowed

00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:59,870
vacation right yeah there were a lot of

00:47:58,190 --> 00:48:01,940
questions that we didn't really have

00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:05,060
answers we didn't have a kind of a clear

00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:08,900
path for them I think also the core OS

00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:11,420
thing is a nice injection of some

00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:13,070
exciting new people new ideas new

00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:15,020
technology I think that's gonna that's

00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:21,500
really positive that's a big chunk of my

00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:24,400
optimism there as well that's efficient

00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:27,400
I don't know maybe I'm just you know

00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,400
cool

00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:38,560
anything from like this side of the room

00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:38,560
dentist you have any questions yeah

00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:54,359
Ben has blown his nose at it in an

00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:54,359
opportune time and I didn't hear that

00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:03,309
checking the translators yes our

00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:05,950
translators tracked in the active

00:49:03,309 --> 00:49:08,469
contributors no translations are one of

00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:10,839
the things I'm not counting in that our

00:49:08,469 --> 00:49:15,489
translations giving fed messages right

00:49:10,839 --> 00:49:17,859
now they are okay yeah so I can track

00:49:15,489 --> 00:49:20,109
things that generate fed messages that

00:49:17,859 --> 00:49:22,269
have a user name attached to them one of

00:49:20,109 --> 00:49:24,729
the things that is difficult is some of

00:49:22,269 --> 00:49:28,089
our services are not necessarily only

00:49:24,729 --> 00:49:30,009
tied too fast and have other user

00:49:28,089 --> 00:49:31,809
accounts there and I would need to have

00:49:30,009 --> 00:49:33,849
some sort of mapping from user ID to

00:49:31,809 --> 00:49:36,249
fast in order to track in a meaningful

00:49:33,849 --> 00:49:38,049
way so right now I'm not doing that we

00:49:36,249 --> 00:49:40,089
can talk about that another big thing

00:49:38,049 --> 00:49:42,759
that I could be tracking that I'm not is

00:49:40,089 --> 00:49:45,160
pag or either the source look at those

00:49:42,759 --> 00:49:46,450
pull requests or actually tagger tickets

00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:49,719
and things like that that'd be something

00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:51,640
that'd be easy to add into there I might

00:49:49,719 --> 00:49:53,829
need to add some monkeying with the

00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:57,009
numbers to make it smooth graph but yeah

00:49:53,829 --> 00:49:59,229
I don't have that when I just thought of

00:49:57,009 --> 00:50:01,509
another big thing oh yeah there's a lot

00:49:59,229 --> 00:50:03,279
of activity like the core OS stuff is

00:50:01,509 --> 00:50:04,599
happening on github because that's kind

00:50:03,279 --> 00:50:07,479
of where they traditionally were and

00:50:04,599 --> 00:50:09,099
rather than not in Packer we need to

00:50:07,479 --> 00:50:11,710
figure out a way to integrate that into

00:50:09,099 --> 00:50:13,239
my stats counting because otherwise all

00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:16,599
that's going to not get measured and

00:50:13,239 --> 00:50:19,790
that would be sad Patrick are you

00:50:16,599 --> 00:50:24,050
solving my problem back there

00:50:19,790 --> 00:50:26,000
yeah okay so yes so there's a github

00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:28,760
defend message but we also need to have

00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:31,190
a github ID to fast mapping of some sort

00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:32,570
to make that work properly so yeah

00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:34,490
there's a lot of things not tracking

00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:35,870
translations are one of them stuff

00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:44,830
that's happening outside of the Fedora

00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:44,830
infrastructure also hard to track yeah

00:50:46,989 --> 00:50:50,380
so where do

00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:57,030
yeah so where do I see Fedora project in

00:50:55,290 --> 00:51:01,500
one year and what are we doing to

00:50:57,030 --> 00:51:04,560
achieve it so yeah I hopefully more

00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:06,240
optimism I I think a lot of these

00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:07,760
objectives are basically the things

00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:10,590
we're working on in one year so I

00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:13,650
definitely expect to see an IOT addition

00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:15,120
and a lot more IOT users that are IOT on

00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:18,450
you know on the front page we get Fedora

00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:21,480
core OS will be there replacing atomic

00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:23,430
and I hope to see you know an influx of

00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:25,290
new users for that I want to make sure

00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:27,360
we retain both the existing container

00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:29,910
Linux community and build that up as

00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:32,160
kind of a definitive like this is how

00:51:29,910 --> 00:51:34,200
you want to run containers operating

00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:36,150
systems I think that would be big thing

00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:38,670
and yeah a lot more modules and a lot

00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:41,760
more connection with sent OS those are

00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:44,220
kind of the things I'd like to see there

00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:47,430
and I think what we're doing to get

00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:49,410
there all the stuff that's happening at

00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:53,310
this conference is kind of advancing

00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:57,390
those things I would definitely like to

00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:59,460
see the line clearly going up again and

00:51:57,390 --> 00:52:01,940
I'd like to see the contributor numbers

00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:01,940
wider

00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:16,940
I thought of one test when am I

00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:18,410
expecting to see the first chorus to

00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:21,140
deliver apples and will they be multi

00:52:18,410 --> 00:52:24,710
arch from the start we're expecting to

00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:27,020
see those basically after the f29 fit

00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:28,790
our atomic host release the early

00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:30,530
preliminary deliverables so that should

00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:39,320
be coming out I'm looking over there at

00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:47,630
Benjamin dusty and multi arch you've

00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:52,040
made dusty stand up yes so regarding

00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:53,990
multi arch for I guess Fedora core OS we

00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:55,510
have some members of the community that

00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:58,760
are very interested in making sure that

00:52:55,510 --> 00:53:01,099
multi arch is you know something that we

00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:03,859
consider from the start so that's

00:53:01,099 --> 00:53:07,580
something that we want to do I will say

00:53:03,859 --> 00:53:14,170
that if we have to basically choose

00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:16,400
between releasing you know anything or

00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:17,960
releasing with more than one

00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:21,500
architecture we will probably will

00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:25,310
choose to release with just x86 64 for

00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:27,530
fedora 30 but we really want to make

00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:30,980
sure that you know we do consider

00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:33,380
multiple that we do consider multiple

00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:36,920
architectures and that we have it for

00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:38,180
fedora 30 so we have some very motivated

00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:40,970
community members who want to make it

00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:43,520
happen we're already delivering multi

00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:47,480
arch for fedora atomic host which I

00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:50,119
mentioned earlier so I I we should have

00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:55,300
it I just don't want to promise anything

00:53:50,119 --> 00:53:55,300
there does that help Luka

00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:03,349
[Music]

00:54:09,979 --> 00:54:18,209
right do we do we essentially want to

00:54:15,049 --> 00:54:23,009
speak about tiered support for a

00:54:18,209 --> 00:54:26,609
particular you know is 64-bit AMD you

00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:28,739
know prioritize more yeah so we have

00:54:26,609 --> 00:54:30,749
this concept of a primary architecture

00:54:28,739 --> 00:54:32,670
and alternate architectures is that the

00:54:30,749 --> 00:54:34,319
right terminology now we've changed our

00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:37,109
terminology around a couple of times so

00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:39,660
yeah it would be kind of careful about

00:54:37,109 --> 00:54:42,869
support in general since officially we

00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:44,400
don't support capital s anything it's

00:54:42,869 --> 00:54:45,989
all kind of community support that

00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,219
depends on you know who is there and

00:54:45,989 --> 00:54:50,099
who's interested in making sure that

00:54:47,219 --> 00:54:52,949
things work and are tested and can help

00:54:50,099 --> 00:54:55,410
solve problems so all support us at that

00:54:52,949 --> 00:54:58,109
level of course but for our different

00:54:55,410 --> 00:55:00,089
deliverables we have the concept of this

00:54:58,109 --> 00:55:04,410
is a primary architecture so for example

00:55:00,089 --> 00:55:06,719
for fit our server x86 64 and AR 64 are

00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:08,579
the primary architectures for server up

00:55:06,719 --> 00:55:10,109
so and then there are other

00:55:08,579 --> 00:55:11,910
architectures which are built but are

00:55:10,109 --> 00:55:14,130
not really are not the primary so we

00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:16,650
definitely have that concept so it would

00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:19,499
be possible to say that for for our core

00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:20,969
OS you know x86 64 is the primary

00:55:19,499 --> 00:55:24,239
architecture and these other ones are

00:55:20,969 --> 00:55:27,209
available we don't have anything more

00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:33,269
fine-grained than that which i think is

00:55:27,209 --> 00:55:36,179
okay because there's no SLA s for

00:55:33,269 --> 00:55:38,170
anything anyways so is that address

00:55:36,179 --> 00:55:42,230
thick

00:55:38,170 --> 00:55:43,910
and Peter definitely wanted to comment

00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:47,300
that he's very interested in multi arch

00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:49,070
for the chorus technologies because he's

00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:50,869
so interested in them for IOT we're

00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:54,080
obviously arm and a lot of different

00:55:50,869 --> 00:56:01,970
architectures are important risk risk

00:55:54,080 --> 00:56:05,060
five yes partners in the community are

00:56:01,970 --> 00:56:35,900
particularly interested as well there's

00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:38,380
some whispering I'm not right right the

00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:41,030
other big hammer we have four new

00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:43,609
support tiers is whether it blocks the

00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:45,230
general Fedora release or not that's

00:56:43,609 --> 00:56:49,099
actually one of the things I would like

00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:50,900
to softened and I think the rings and

00:56:49,099 --> 00:56:54,589
lifecycle discussions are kind of about

00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:58,790
that because I would love it if at the

00:56:54,589 --> 00:57:01,660
last minute if there's a bug in xfce

00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:05,359
desktop that makes the xfce desktop

00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:08,300
unusable we can ship the rest of the

00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:09,710
release and then a week later ship xfce

00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:11,780
and say okay we've got it

00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:15,050
XFC released that works or the other way

00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:19,250
around everything's ready to go but you

00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:21,109
know fedora server horribly broken even

00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:23,510
if it's in addition it would be nice to

00:57:21,109 --> 00:57:25,339
be able to say oK we've got all this

00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:27,530
other stuff and we've got a cadence we

00:57:25,339 --> 00:57:31,180
want to keep - let's release this and

00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:33,970
then have a delay for a particular thing

00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:37,279
news

00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:49,700
yeah it that that's an easier said than

00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:51,440
done but it's a Peter Robinson would

00:57:49,700 --> 00:58:00,079
like to resort to violence I would like

00:57:51,440 --> 00:58:01,970
to put further other records he's slowly

00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:10,759
becoming America and I heard him say Z

00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:14,420
instead of Zed the other day any other

00:58:10,759 --> 00:58:17,599
questions are we looking ready for lunch

00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:20,650
here right if you want to ask Brian any

00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:24,829
questions here I'm giving him the mic

00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:26,150
it's any question other than lunch if

00:58:24,829 --> 00:58:28,249
you have not already picked up your

00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:30,410
badge please do so they are supposed to

00:58:28,249 --> 00:58:32,269
be checking those for lunch if you have

00:58:30,410 --> 00:58:34,789
not picked up your shirt please try to

00:58:32,269 --> 00:58:35,989
do so by the end of lunch we are gonna

00:58:34,789 --> 00:58:38,269
start trying to figure out how many

00:58:35,989 --> 00:58:40,729
extras we have for people to potentially

00:58:38,269 --> 00:58:44,390
swap from chosen size to preferred size

00:58:40,729 --> 00:58:46,670
on Thursday that would be tomorrow

00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:48,410
there is a question from Brendan for

00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:56,869
people who are not along the stage now

00:58:48,410 --> 00:58:58,549
but go ahead I I'm sorry the question is

00:58:56,869 --> 00:59:00,650
what do the colors on the badge is

00:58:58,549 --> 00:59:02,569
signify I happen to have a green sticker

00:59:00,650 --> 00:59:04,700
on my badge there are three colors

00:59:02,569 --> 00:59:06,559
stickers available for you please choose

00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:08,420
the one that makes you happy if you have

00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:10,940
a green sticker you are indicating that

00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:12,440
your communication preference is anybody

00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:14,690
can approach you and start talking to

00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:16,640
you if you have a yellow sticker you're

00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:18,650
saying please don't approach and talk to

00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:20,479
me unless I know you and if you have a

00:59:18,650 --> 00:59:22,700
red sticker you're saying I would prefer

00:59:20,479 --> 00:59:26,930
to initiate conversations rather than

00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:31,119
have people approach me so I encourage

00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:31,119
you to wear a sticker if you like yes

00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:37,289
um you will need to figure out that with

00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:39,990
the person involved I would encourage

00:59:37,289 --> 00:59:42,210
you to consider respecting them in the

00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:44,130
order of read takes precedence over

00:59:42,210 --> 00:59:46,319
yellow yellow takes precedence over

00:59:44,130 --> 00:59:49,230
green by the way these colors were

00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:51,359
chosen because it's silly easy to buy

00:59:49,230 --> 00:59:53,279
traffic light colored stickers in a set

00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:54,809
they were not chosen to give any

00:59:53,279 --> 00:59:56,910
judgement about those particular

00:59:54,809 --> 00:59:58,589
communication preferences and we've

00:59:56,910 --> 00:59:59,760
already received some feedback for those

00:59:58,589 --> 01:00:01,109
of you who may have issues

00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:02,849
distinguishing colors we're going to

01:00:01,109 --> 01:00:10,020
look at trying to use shapes next year

01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:11,640
to help with that so the only other

01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:14,160
thing that I have to say is we will

01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:16,170
resume in this room at 1:30 with the

01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:17,760
amazing Penrose triangle so please be

01:00:16,170 --> 01:00:19,319
here and then that will be the last

01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:21,029
keynote for today and we will have

01:00:19,319 --> 01:00:23,579
tracks in all of the rooms after that

01:00:21,029 --> 01:00:25,650
enjoy lunch I will see you in this room

01:00:23,579 --> 01:00:28,549
at 1:30 don't forget to pick up your

01:00:25,650 --> 01:00:28,549
shirt thank you

01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:33,080
