Talk: Fedora and Snaps: A two year retrospective and an exciting future!
Presenters: Neal Gompa, Zygmunt Krynicki

Description: Over the last two years, we've gone from having zero support for using snaps to having almost full runtime support. For this aspect, this will be a retrospective of how that happened, what went well, and what went poorly. We'll also talk about some of the interesting aspects of snaps and the challenges in supporting Fedora from an upstream perspective, and how we work closely with the upstream Snapcraft group to ensure Fedora is a top-tier supported platform.

Now that we have support for running snaps in Fedora, it's time to make the next logical leap: building Fedora-based snaps! We'll talk about what is going on upstream to enable this, and what we're doing within Fedora to make it possible so that anyone can build a snap using Fedora content and ship the latest and greatest software leveraging the Fedora ecosystem to be used on any distribution!

This will also include a short demo of a Fedora-based snap to show off the possibility.
