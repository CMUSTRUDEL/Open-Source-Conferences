Talk: Let's discuss discourse!
Presenters: Matthew Miller

Description: We now have an experimental instance of Discourse, the open source discussion platform. It's been in production for several months as the primary discussion forum for Fedora CoreOS and for Silverblue. It's also had space for other conversation.

Let's talk about how this is working, what opportunities it might bring, and whether we want to expand. We should also talk about other web-based discussion and community software we have in Fedora — particularly, Ask and Hyperkitty. How do they fit in?

	00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:07,200
okay yeah you're right I did

00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:09,150
um I can start over it's of the people

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,290
who came in does anybody not know what

00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:16,190
discourse is okay all right so then

00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:19,980
we're back to this yeah it's a web forum

00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:22,080
in a lot of ways but it also is intended

00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,000
in as a design goal to replace mailing

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:29,340
lists even though it doesn't do it by

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,840
being like a mailing list and I think

00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,500
this is a man we're talking about for a

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:38,040
long time our contribution on the

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:41,370
Internet is buried in mailing lists

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:45,329
which are for old people and you know

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:50,520
IRC which is for weird hacker old people

00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:53,070
not so I think that having a discussion

00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,989
forum that kind of fits in with the

00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,600
modern way people use the Internet is

00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:59,340
important for the future of fedora and I

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,260
thought that all along which is one of

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:05,040
the reasons we have hyper kitty in the

00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,780
first place so not not a surprise it is

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,640
also potentially an ask fedora

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,340
replacement so I'll have a whole bit

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,200
about that later it is a fully open

00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,689
source project but it has a company

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,150
behind it so there's active development

00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:20,670
going on all the time like huge amount

00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:23,180
of amounts of commits and they also have

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:27,330
a hosted option which is nice because

00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:30,659
our infrastructure team is strained I'm

00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:32,700
getting nods Marillion and having

00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:35,850
somebody paying somebody else who is

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,400
doing open source to do it is like super

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:40,799
everybody wins kind of thing especially

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:45,390
if we can get Red Hat to pay for it

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:47,130
which is currently happening so yeah

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,780
this is what it looks like this is the

00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:52,229
discussion that foot our project org

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:54,270
thing that Sonia stood up and Patrick

00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:56,009
and some other people I've done lots of

00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,409
people get credit for this Matias could

00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:59,579
probably get some credit too and so this

00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:01,829
is kind of what it looks like as an

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,329
overview this one view it's kind of a

00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:06,420
top view of the threads is what the

00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:09,360
front page looks like here it's not

00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,550
gorgeous but it's fairly functional and

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,780
I think it's the kind of thing that at

00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,390
first maybe looks a little bit

00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,069
overwhelming

00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:18,660
but it's actually gone through several

00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:21,490
years of like actual interactive use and

00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,709
they're tweaking the design constantly

00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:25,390
so I think that it's the kind of thing

00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:27,310
that is a little bit overwhelming but

00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:29,170
once you start using it is actually

00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,940
everything's pretty practical in my

00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:34,000
experience I mean it's UX is always

00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:35,410
subjective then there's category lists

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,120
here and we have a bunch of different

00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:38,820
categories and that's what it looks like

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,230
you can see up there there's

00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,790
notifications and everything you can

00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:45,670
look at discussion DEP at our project

00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:49,720
org to actually get a better view you

00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:52,840
know what it actually is live and this

00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,640
is a random thread that I picked from

00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,920
just today like somebody has this and

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,230
one of the things that's note is this is

00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:02,380
marked as solved there which i think is

00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:04,180
kind of a useful thing for and like I

00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:07,510
said possibly and ask replacement in

00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:10,120
some ways and I guess it didn't inline

00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:14,890
the SVG is there but I'm sharing it yeah

00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:18,549
yeah yeah but if that were a ping image

00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:20,290
it would have worked so ok so that's

00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:22,269
kind of what it looks like this is the

00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:24,430
what about the hyper Kitty thing

00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:26,380
they're definitely overlapping goals

00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:29,340
like hyper kitty was designed to replace

00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:32,650
mailing lists with a modern thing and I

00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:35,140
when I when we launched this it hurt

00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:37,239
most feelings which I really genuinely

00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:39,700
feel bad about her surprised her with it

00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:41,920
and that was not the intention because I

00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:46,180
initially put a lot of very passionate

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,769
work in the hyper Kitty design and so

00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,540
this kind of overlaps that so putting

00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:51,130
this at discussion rather than having a

00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,900
hyper Kitty thing at discussion without

00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:56,290
actually having discussion about it

00:03:52,900 --> 00:04:00,459
maybe not the most friendly thing to do

00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:03,700
so I regret that but anyways part of the

00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:06,190
thing is yeah the vision of hyper kitty

00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:08,320
they reached the real that like that and

00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:10,239
I'm glad that our alien is also nodding

00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,220
at me here that we never were able to

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,320
realize that vision with hyper kitty we

00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:16,239
just didn't have the resources to do it

00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:19,299
it really would have taken you know a

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:22,440
team of three or four or five people and

00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:24,030
having those people continually work

00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,280
on it now rather than getting it to

00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:28,700
launch and then saying okay finally got

00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,470
to launch you can work on something else

00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:34,290
and we really can't go at alone on this

00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:36,390
and I know that hyper Kitty is a mailman

00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:39,570
three project and isn't nominally a

00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:41,460
fedora only thing but there are not a

00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:43,530
lot of other big hyper Kitty

00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:45,510
installations out there and not a lot of

00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:53,910
other developers is that fair to say is

00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:56,310
it yeah okay yeah right yeah and I think

00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:58,290
no chance of new features is a fair

00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:01,860
thing to say because I've been asking

00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:04,200
for them for like three years and that's

00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:07,350
that there's just not resources for it

00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:09,000
um however we still do need mailing

00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:11,310
lists in fedora I'm not gonna kick you

00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,290
off of your mailing lists that would not

00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:15,420
work and we still need a mailing list

00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:17,190
archive so I'm right now we've got hyper

00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:19,350
kitty up and running as that and I think

00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:20,670
it serves that purpose fine

00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:22,740
I've got a couple more slides of

00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:26,280
pictures of hyper kitty you know this is

00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:28,230
one of the things like right this is

00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,340
right so hyper Kitty has Pistorius as

00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,870
part of it and that and that's one of

00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,090
the things like so this is the point I

00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:34,919
wanted to make though hyper the link to

00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:37,470
hyper kitty is the archives it's not

00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:39,000
this is your web interface a to your

00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,230
mailing list this is your archives of

00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,260
the minute so I think it serves that

00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:46,169
purpose as an archiver better than the

00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:50,160
crappy whatever mailman to archiver was

00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:52,020
called because that was horrible so this

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,030
is a bunch better archiver than that so

00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:56,490
I'm not trying to kill that although I

00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:59,669
would like to fix this thing right here

00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:03,180
do you know this thing if you click on

00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:04,860
this sign-up link up here you get for

00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:09,450
any list in fedora you get told that

00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:13,610
it's closed which is not so friendly

00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:13,610
yeah that's probably it

00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:22,930
yeah

00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:24,970
that that is this happens for a very

00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:27,009
good reason we want to fast but it

00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:29,740
there's art that's artifacts like that

00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:31,960
and I think the thing is we don't have

00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:33,610
time for you to spend all of your time

00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:37,479
on the polish like that and I don't

00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:41,139
blame you at all for this so skipping on

00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:43,569
to ask Fedora so this is ask Fedora is

00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:46,840
are there people ask Fedora users people

00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:48,550
here in this room that's too bad there's

00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,319
a there is a actual community of people

00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,940
who are uh Nazca door and I didn't

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:57,759
actually make a screenshot of it but it

00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:59,919
is a asked bot powered Q&A forum and it

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,889
is basically meant to be an open-source

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,979
clone of Stack Exchange which although

00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:10,270
it is awesome is not at all open source

00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:12,699
and to be blunt I put it in the slides

00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:15,159
event it's a really bad Stack Exchange

00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:17,590
clone it kind of is a clone of what

00:07:15,159 --> 00:07:20,860
Stack Exchange was like six or seven

00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:22,750
years ago in appearance only and not

00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:24,849
really understanding how it worked and

00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:27,009
especially not understanding the user

00:07:24,849 --> 00:07:28,090
interaction and the community moderation

00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:30,610
and all the things that makes Dec

00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:33,130
exchange successful so we're trying to

00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:34,960
kind of build a community on top of

00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:36,909
something that's not very good software

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,759
for our self-powered community so that

00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:42,310
kind of sucks we had been having our own

00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,590
instance of it and it was basically bit

00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:46,719
rotting and becoming very slow and awful

00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:48,880
and not managed at all so we have

00:07:46,719 --> 00:07:53,560
actually moved it to be hosts but hosted

00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:55,840
by the developer of that but I would not

00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:58,240
say that that move has been a homerun

00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,979
it is now updated to a newer version but

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,909
we had a bunch of feature requests and

00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,229
things that we're supposed to be getting

00:08:00,909 --> 00:08:05,740
development kind of as part of the

00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:09,190
hosting deal and that's not really

00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:11,430
happening and so that's and it is again

00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:14,529
it's just one developer working on this

00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:16,120
and a key point is I asked Fedora

00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:19,289
actually so one of the things about

00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:21,699
Stack Exchange is it is very focused on

00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:23,830
you have a question and then there are

00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:25,900
answers to it and every question must be

00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:27,969
an answerable question or it gets shot

00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,440
down whether you like it or not there's

00:08:27,969 --> 00:08:32,140
some good and bad things about Stack

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,520
Exchange there and it they're really

00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:35,680
frown on inter

00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,150
active Diagnostics like okay have you

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,980
tried rebooting your computer have you

00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:41,890
tried this that kind of back and forth

00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:45,160
is not welcome on Stack Exchange in

00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:46,990
general where which is not necessarily

00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,460
great for what we needed Fedora anyways

00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:50,350
it's one of the reasons we didn't just

00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:52,480
say hey just go ask everything on Stack

00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:54,220
Exchange because people didn't like that

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,660
kind of feeling they wanted to actually

00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:59,080
have something where they could help

00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:01,570
people but the a spot tool is not really

00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,910
great for that anyways so actually I

00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:07,210
think something that is more web forum

00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:08,950
like is probably better for what people

00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:11,590
are using ask Fedora for anyways

00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:13,420
especially with the you've solved my

00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:16,690
problem plug-in and some of the other

00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:18,580
things that exist that basically other

00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:21,550
people are working to develop these

00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:24,970
add-ons for discourse that are useful to

00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:27,310
us okay and then this is the other

00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:29,800
resource same thing hubs is another

00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:32,020
project that is dear to my heart and

00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,660
sadly we do not have resources to

00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:36,790
develop basically it is the idea again

00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:39,970
that fedoras web in a web presence

00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:41,860
especially I mean with our refresh get

00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:43,330
fedora in the new doc site and some of

00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:45,880
these things it looks a lot more alive

00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:48,250
than it did but you know several years

00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:50,080
ago if you'd look at fedora your

00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:52,120
interface to it was the wiki and the

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,980
front page of the wiki was not great and

00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,990
then there was some bit rot like two

00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:58,180
clicks away from that and it would be

00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:01,030
easy to have looked at fedora and say

00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:03,940
this is a dead project which is awful

00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:06,340
because even then it is very very active

00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:09,340
every day thousands of you know what it

00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:11,650
is something like you know 1100 IRC

00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:13,270
meetings every year like a lot of

00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:15,550
activity you just not surfaced so the

00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:19,420
idea of hubs was to surface that

00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:21,490
activity but again we don't have the

00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:25,120
resources to develop hubs which but

00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:27,340
that's how it is however it is possible

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,990
and so one of the things hubs was going

00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:30,880
to be is kind of the community front-end

00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:32,950
we have get fedora for a fee or who just

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,390
wants to download fedora and then if you

00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:36,490
want something more than that if you're

00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:38,410
involved in the project there's

00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:41,680
something on the web that kind of is

00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:43,900
feeds you into where you're going it is

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,100
possible but not necessary this isn't

00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,690
the only possible answer that a

00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,490
discourse forum could kind of

00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:50,410
by that front end where every you

00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:52,750
different groups in Fedora could have

00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:54,220
even if it's not their primary like

00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:57,340
maybe they still work on a mailing list

00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:58,690
but you could have a landing page on the

00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:01,750
on the discourse forum that's you know

00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:03,190
this is the ambassador's you know

00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,780
discourse thing that could then have a

00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:07,870
point to resources elsewhere and kind of

00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:09,850
be a front page kind of thing that isn't

00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:12,760
a wiki and is in software that is

00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:15,310
currently maintained yeah so here's the

00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:18,130
other thing I picked this URL discussion

00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:19,990
dat Fedora project org and I didn't want

00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:22,240
to name it discourse because as

00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:24,370
assistant min I've learned never name

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,760
your things after the software that runs

00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:29,290
on it and I wanted the idea was

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:33,760
initially to be discussion for a

00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:35,290
silver/blue and for core OS and I wanted

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,150
something that would encompass both of

00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:39,430
those things and then we thought well

00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:42,430
why not just make it a wider experiment

00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:44,710
and see how it goes so that's kind of

00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:47,680
the idea we've got this hood up

00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:50,560
Sonya who's community for community

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,570
manager for core OS something silver

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:56,260
blue I don't know what her actual job is

00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:57,730
is funding this for us for a while so

00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:00,820
that's a good start and we can figure

00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:03,550
out how that goes from there and that is

00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:07,030
the end of the things that I have slides

00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:10,350
for does anybody have any comments ok

00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:14,100
wait I'm going to give you a microphone

00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:14,100
is that microphone on

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:24,019
I'm gonna give you this Mac wait now

00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:25,190
here you can have my mic Thanks so that

00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:27,200
was just a quick question

00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:30,110
so this discourse instance is hosted by

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:33,350
discourse the company is that it ok that

00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:36,139
was just and for the record the answer

00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:40,070
is yes it is hosted by the company and

00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:41,959
it is their medium level hosting option

00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:44,750
which I forget what the pricing is we

00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:47,959
thought we might need to do the top very

00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:50,060
expensive level but Patrick found out a

00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:51,829
clever way to make it make fed messages

00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:54,050
which was the main reason I wanted it to

00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:55,550
have it be there's like a webhooks thing

00:12:54,050 --> 00:13:00,430
that it can use its generating fed

00:12:55,550 --> 00:13:00,430
messages with that yes

00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,760
yes

00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:34,460
can you make this work

00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:42,900
yes so the question is can this be

00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:46,440
embedded in copper and have topics for

00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:48,560
every project I think possibly I haven't

00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:52,530
seen it scaled up in exactly that way

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:54,980
but one of the places they launched this

00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:59,400
with do you know the blog Boeing Boeing

00:13:54,980 --> 00:14:01,050
it's a geek blog and it was briefly one

00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:04,380
of the top hundred sites on the Internet

00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:07,890
so it's fairly popular that most back in

00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:09,960
nerdy R times probably but still and

00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:11,970
they switch their discussion forum over

00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:15,990
to this so every post gets an automatic

00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:17,970
topic created that is in an in discourse

00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:19,770
so I think something like that probably

00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:23,550
could happen in copper where you get a

00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:25,740
topic for every project yes Brian I have

00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:27,210
a question is this mic on okay yes I

00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:32,850
know the answer now you were the Mike

00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:35,310
Boettcher person so thank you do whom I

00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:37,410
should spoke if I want to make it happen

00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:39,840
well I just checked some documentation

00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:43,500
and there is something like enabling

00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:47,160
embedding so I guess that it will need

00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:49,140
some fitting on the discourse side you

00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:51,990
should go to our discussion at for our

00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:54,600
project org and there's a section on

00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:56,790
there for what topics we go fine fine

00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:00,830
looks most appropriate for that and post

00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:00,830
it there okay how that works

00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:21,270
i time ago i have seen a project to have

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,100
a bridge between mailman three and

00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:26,190
discourse i think that i don't know what

00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:29,070
the stage of this is but that maybe it

00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:31,170
may be possible to relay the discourse

00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:33,150
topics into moments or to a mailing list

00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:36,480
that like a lot of people like to use

00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:38,310
here and so there maybe is a technical

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,620
solution to that if you want to keep

00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:42,600
people having a mailing list oh well

00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:45,030
or should i say if people don't want to

00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,880
leave them email client to participate

00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:49,170
in the discussion so maybe and I'm used

00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:52,470
to repeating things but now you have a

00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:54,750
mic so to repeat it's amazing okay cool

00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:56,340
that sounds awesome and I don't know if

00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,780
their development really started or if

00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:59,310
you twin somewhere but I know some

00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:00,330
people mentioned in the main mentalists

00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:01,920
right so you know one of the things

00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:05,960
around this is it is a very popular

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:09,300
software and what was is it foreman that

00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:11,610
somebody recently for yeah foreman

00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:14,550
recently switched their mailing lists

00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:16,230
over to using this and they have a blog

00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:19,010
post which I maybe should have put in

00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:22,170
the slides but they had a very high

00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:24,540
increase in activity switching from the

00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:26,400
mailing list to this it I think it was a

00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:28,740
experiment in an open source project

00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:33,140
that dump shows this can work

00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:33,140
rich had a question way in the back

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:43,860
yeah yeah I mean if you would like to

00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:47,580
put loads of resources into hyper kitty

00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:49,680
that would also be awesome yeah yeah so

00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:51,840
I just repeat for the camera so yeah

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,760
we've seen some small projects using

00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,680
discourse and still having their mailing

00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:58,440
list where the bridge works out really

00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:01,140
well and inside openSUSE we recently had

00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,460
a discussion about this and the the two

00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:04,050
options about what at the top were

00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:06,450
either discourse or the one that's

00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:08,550
currently most popular is yeah adopting

00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:10,950
hyper kitty so you might see some

00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:12,930
contribution tumors on that yeah and

00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:15,000
like I said I don't think we're going to

00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:18,140
ditch hyper kitty as long as we still

00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,400
need mailing lists what it's not okay

00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:22,470
yeah hyper kitty is still going to be

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,240
important to us for a long time

00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:26,370
one of the things that I'm completely

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,190
unclear about is how well this would

00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:31,890
scale up to 200 different discussions

00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:34,350
going on at once because I think that's

00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:36,450
pretty big scale and you know we've got

00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:40,110
how many mailing lists we have do you

00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:41,610
know yet there's like four hundred

00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:43,560
mailing lists and there's obviously a

00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:47,150
long tail of activity and some of those

00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:49,860
in the middle are just spam like but

00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:52,740
there are there are at least hundreds of

00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:54,450
active mailing lists and so I don't know

00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,820
we can't try I don't think we can

00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:59,430
translate those all into one one

00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:01,080
category per mailing list I don't think

00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:02,970
that would work and I don't think that

00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:06,540
discourse really works with thousands of

00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:07,890
categories so that is something to find

00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:12,170
out in the experiment

00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:12,170
I guess misc

00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:23,160
so I do ever discuss in stones for

00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:25,500
pattern fly and test like reaching 1,000

00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:28,410
category I can spin up a VM quite fast

00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:31,380
and then we can create MIDI on and see

00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:33,270
if it start work or not because the

00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:35,490
other issue I have with that is that we

00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:37,650
are limited by the number of visit and I

00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:41,310
do remember having done the computation

00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:43,980
to see how much we will pay but yeah

00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:46,170
right now I think we need to get the

00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:48,540
enterprise plan the one where if they

00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:51,360
say you need to contact us we said thank

00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:53,910
to you all that you have to pay if we

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:59,880
want to post everything for fedora just

00:18:53,910 --> 00:19:01,680
that you know before yesterday honestly

00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:05,310
I had successful with it that's a

00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:07,740
problem that will be happy to have but

00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:10,140
yeah and obviously it is open source and

00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:11,400
we could look at self hosting as well so

00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:20,610
if we get to the point where it's that

00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:23,760
but you don't know no to self hosting so

00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:26,870
I did try to sell first it and it took

00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:29,940
me two weeks to install it and I did

00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:32,010
swear a lot

00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:34,320
yeah thanks somebody else to do it is

00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:35,480
you know valuable and if it takes you

00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,400
two weeks

00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:41,250
no I because right now the installation

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,230
is you take a container which is based

00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,650
on Ubuntu and I try to make it work on

00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:47,640
Fedora

00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:50,160
and it's working it's not very clean and

00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:53,280
I know that a federal FOIA is not gonna

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:57,240
like it as I was would apply everything

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:59,790
in Javas and do that so I so it will

00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,770
cost some time and resource if we want

00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:05,610
to do self wasted it's like gitlab will

00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:08,670
try to do that in the person instead we

00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:11,240
decided to just write bugger

00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:13,440
[Laughter]

00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,270
for those of you who get the mic please

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,679
hold it away from your computer screens

00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:21,690
there appears to be an interference

00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:29,429
coming off of them that's because we

00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:31,860
turned your computer off yeah I just

00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:33,960
thought about it and we will probably

00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:36,570
run into a problem when we have more

00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:40,650
than 400 categories because the category

00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:45,000
selection happens when you open a thread

00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:46,950
and it will just pull off a list of more

00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,660
than 400 entries and I'm pretty sure

00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:50,400
that this is not very convenient to

00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:52,140
navigate through right yeah it's not

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,030
really a problem of can it technically

00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:55,799
scale it's a matter of can the UX and

00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:58,140
user experience scale to that and the

00:20:55,799 --> 00:21:00,090
answer is probably no on the other hand

00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:02,280
a lot of our discussion is really

00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:04,260
fragmented in the existing Fedora

00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:07,020
mailing lists and we end up cross

00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:09,600
posting between server cloud this and

00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:12,570
you test lists versus other kind of

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,860
things maybe we don't really need so

00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:15,900
many different lists for things

00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:18,570
especially if like some of the project

00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:20,580
lists like anaconda patches just happily

00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:23,330
staying mailing lists forever because

00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,330
that's fine

00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:47,240
all right so that okay yeah so you

00:21:45,649 --> 00:21:51,370
mentioned that there's a Fed message

00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:57,380
hook with this course yeah is it working

00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:59,299
dude so can like we use fedora badges to

00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:02,510
make it more popular what kind of things

00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:04,640
what kind of ideas maybe you or anyone

00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:08,960
else in the room have four different

00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:12,769
badges we could use yeah it also has its

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:14,659
own badges so because because Stack

00:22:12,769 --> 00:22:16,730
Exchange is heavily gamified so it kind

00:22:14,659 --> 00:22:19,940
of ties into that so I haven't actually

00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:22,130
looked very much at those badges and I

00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:24,559
don't know how if they don't use the

00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:26,419
Mozilla the same badges system we do

00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,220
which would be have been awesome if they

00:22:26,419 --> 00:22:30,200
didn't we just tie it together but yeah

00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:32,149
we at there are fed messages coming out

00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,159
that we could easily tie into our own

00:22:32,149 --> 00:22:37,010
badges and we could find some way to

00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:39,559
link the two kinds of badges together or

00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:41,960
rename something to theirs to not be

00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:44,450
badges or I don't know that is actually

00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,279
kind of a problem but we actually

00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:49,460
already have that in a spot because that

00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:51,500
has badges as well but yeah one of the

00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:53,360
things it does have is like Stack

00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,639
Exchange there's kind of a built in

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:58,309
reputation system where you get more

00:22:55,639 --> 00:23:00,679
power the more you more you were active

00:22:58,309 --> 00:23:02,779
in positive ways on the site you you

00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:05,870
automatically gain privileges to do

00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:07,220
things like you've moderate other

00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:10,399
people's messages and things like that

00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:12,590
which i think is generally positive

00:23:10,399 --> 00:23:14,110
because it helps helps empower people in

00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:17,919
the community to do things themselves

00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:20,919
without needing to be granted power

00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,919
automatically

00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:28,540
yes I definitely think so although I

00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:30,220
don't know if we want to rush to doing

00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:32,020
it because if we decide this isn't

00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:34,210
working when I shut it down in you know

00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:37,200
three months then we probably don't want

00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:37,200
to have too many badges

00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:43,650
yes counterpoint was wouldn't it be more

00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:47,450
successful if we had betta coughs oh

00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:47,450
yeah okay let's do badges

00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:58,140
does anyone have ideas in the room but I

00:23:55,860 --> 00:24:00,000
don't know how much people in the room

00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:02,910
have used this course or not but what

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,070
kind of ideas for badges does anyone

00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:07,700
have any I have not personally used it

00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:07,700
so there's

00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:40,529
so what if we did something like you

00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:45,720
earned five ten fifteen badges on

00:24:40,529 --> 00:24:47,159
discourse yeah it's which I'm sure you

00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:50,340
can work with I mean that it's pretty

00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:53,009
meta but I think ya know that's a great

00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:57,090
idea actually and also be styling the

00:24:53,009 --> 00:24:58,470
ticket I can do it right now no I can't

00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:59,700
I have no internet sorry

00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:02,029
someone with internet could file the

00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,029
ticket

00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:19,160
does anybody think this thing is

00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:32,590
horrible and we should not try it or do

00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:34,640
anything with it all right no yeah I

00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:36,020
wouldn't say it's horrible but I have

00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,790
reservations about it at scale

00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:39,500
especially you think about the amount of

00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:41,450
traffic we have on you know the devel

00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,950
mailing list and some of that stuff and

00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:45,799
then thinking about all the different

00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:48,140
SIG's and things like that and then when

00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:50,870
you go and log in there's you know four

00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:52,370
hundred or even a hundred categories to

00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:53,480
try and wade through and find the one

00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:54,260
the three that you're actually

00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,299
interested in

00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:58,510
I think discoverability is gonna be a

00:25:56,299 --> 00:26:01,990
big problem yeah

00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:01,990
very possibly

00:26:08,059 --> 00:26:13,409
so I think one of the main issue is

00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:15,270
discourse there is no sweating I cannot

00:26:13,409 --> 00:26:18,000
imagine having a good flame we're on

00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:20,100
that like disabling kadhi ESL a new

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,890
exotic kind of stuff but it's indeed

00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:24,510
much more friendly for user I don't know

00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:25,980
if people already try when you connect

00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:27,960
for the first time you get a bud that

00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:30,120
explained how to do everything speak

00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,409
with you and everything and I got it

00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,179
three time because I opened three

00:26:31,409 --> 00:26:35,820
account so by now I know what to do to

00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:37,620
get my first budget but everything is

00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:39,899
done to make sure that people do

00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:42,950
something and learn how to use the

00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:45,990
system so I guess it's good for

00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:47,820
user-facing stuff especially since you

00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:50,360
are not forced to create a federal court

00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:53,159
system someone once we bought an issue

00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:54,779
maybe it's overkill to ask for floor

00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:59,340
account and just use Google Facebook

00:26:54,779 --> 00:27:02,210
this kind of stuff yeah I do not see any

00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:05,669
project doing development work on that

00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:09,230
so you cannot send patches and comment

00:27:05,669 --> 00:27:12,330
on them you cannot get sweating

00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:15,659
forwarding this kind of stuff so it

00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:20,669
depends also on who wants to discuss and

00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:24,299
where and oh yeah I think that it

00:27:20,669 --> 00:27:26,309
probably like a patch discussion I don't

00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:28,620
see those mailing lists that work that

00:27:26,309 --> 00:27:30,480
way still moving although I see most

00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:33,000
software that used to send patches to

00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,730
mailing lists and discuss them moving to

00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,200
code review tools and things like that

00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:41,220
instead of discussing on mailing lists

00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,779
anyways but yeah actually I guess we

00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:45,179
kind of solved two of these problems at

00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:47,279
once by not trying to move the devel

00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:49,950
mailing list because that's where the

00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:53,750
most of the threading flamewars happen

00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:57,600
and also where most of the traffic is so

00:27:53,750 --> 00:28:00,649
if we focus on things like the

00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:03,539
silver-blue discussion user discussion

00:28:00,649 --> 00:28:06,539
council discussion i think would be fine

00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:11,610
there move those things that are lower

00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:14,490
traffic that and can we I'm not sure if

00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:16,470
we can get that so private forum because

00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:19,169
you speak about consider mmm

00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:21,020
like oh do we make sure that something

00:28:19,169 --> 00:28:25,620
steady pervert and

00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:28,620
yeah there are private discussion that

00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:31,200
is a possibility but then the admins of

00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:32,970
it also have to all be in on that being

00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,830
private whereas we've got it more

00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:37,830
restricted and we have a council private

00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:40,620
mailing list full disclosure the council

00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:42,510
private mailing list mostly gets

00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:44,490
messages when we have new council

00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:46,830
members where I send a message that says

00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:49,560
so you are now on the council private

00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:51,300
mailing list we sometimes use this to

00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:53,100
discuss confidential and secure

00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:55,020
information but we try to do everything

00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,610
in the public and then there's silence

00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:59,070
on that list for another six months

00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:01,500
until there's new people elected so I'm

00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,550
not super worried about that every now

00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,500
and then there's something more than

00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:05,400
that but that's most of what that what

00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:09,270
goes on on that list

00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:12,720
so most fedora discussion should be in

00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:14,850
the open even in the council so yeah but

00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,730
our code of conduct and first mountain

00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:20,280
just kind of stuff security issues it's

00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:22,140
legitimate reason to be secret and I do

00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:24,270
not know also I can take a look below

00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:25,440
says that so we can remember that I said

00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:29,730
that in six months

00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:32,400
yeah we've been talking about code of

00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:37,470
conduct issues in peg or private tickets

00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:41,070
so that again has admin you can probably

00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:46,590
read them I don't know don't you don't

00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:47,880
want to but yeah the fact that we do

00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:50,270
have other person makes me less worried

00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,270
about that

00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:56,610
okay

00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:59,950
yeah

00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:06,690
so one reason why we are interested in

00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:08,340
using discourse or why we started using

00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:10,590
discos for a silver/blue was to attract

00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:12,480
like new audiences new users who may not

00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:14,220
be comfortable with mailing lists I want

00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,780
to have any way to measure that they're

00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:17,780
actually successful in that discourse

00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:26,190
yes I we definitely can't again with the

00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:28,380
Fed message stuff that's a pretty easy

00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:30,300
way to do it because I can tie in I can

00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:31,590
see are these accounts that are coming

00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:33,600
in are people signing up for new

00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:35,700
accounts and discussing on discourse and

00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,110
we certainly even though we're making

00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,640
people sign up for fast accounts we're

00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:40,680
definitely getting new people coming in

00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,720
to this although a little bit slower

00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:44,340
than the silver-blue things kind of a

00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,790
trade-off and making people make a fast

00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:51,060
account that I don't know I think it's

00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:53,280
worth it also everybody who's not using

00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:57,300
everybody is using Facebook and Google

00:30:53,280 --> 00:31:00,210
to log into things like those accounts

00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:01,680
can be shut down at any time Facebook

00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:03,630
can be like I would like you to mail me

00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:05,970
your your passport please

00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:08,270
and then you can't log into anything

00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:12,390
you're using Facebook to log into

00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:18,360
terrible so anyways that's a different

00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:20,940
topic but I I don't yeah I think that

00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:23,520
that the ability to tie in people who

00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:26,370
are posting on this to other Fedora

00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:29,400
activity makes it worthwhile to ask for

00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:32,430
people have fast accounts alone I mean

00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:34,290
yeah we can definitely maybe I'll put

00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:36,060
reports on this in my next flock talk

00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:39,170
about new countries they come in this

00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,170
way which is a good suggestion

00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:55,620
anything else anybody we can we can run

00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:58,080
early I guess yeah and this is obviously

00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:59,610
a fairly small group of people compared

00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,430
to all of fedora but I definitely

00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:05,250
encourage you that there's a section on

00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:06,960
on the discourse discussion forum

00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:08,790
they're basically saying what other

00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,040
categories should we have so if there's

00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:12,720
something you'd like to try out post

00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:14,700
there and we can create some more

00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:17,730
categories there's a fedora friends

00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:19,650
thing that's just for chatter feel free

00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:21,660
to show up and start chattering there

00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:23,550
and we'll see what kind of activity we

00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:27,060
can start getting and then see how it

00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:28,860
goes in real life from there someone was

00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:31,200
saying that Fedora should do a better

00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:33,810
job at trying things and failing if

00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,310
they're not working so I think it's good

00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:39,240
for us to experiment and then let's

00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:41,880
reevaluate this six months now whatever

00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:45,350
the amount we've paying runs out and

00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:45,350
then see if it's worth

00:32:55,180 --> 00:33:00,029
