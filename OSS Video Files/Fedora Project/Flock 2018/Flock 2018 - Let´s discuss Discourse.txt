Talk: Let's discuss discourse!
Presenters: Matthew Miller

Description: We now have an experimental instance of Discourse, the open source discussion platform. It's been in production for several months as the primary discussion forum for Fedora CoreOS and for Silverblue. It's also had space for other conversation.

Let's talk about how this is working, what opportunities it might bring, and whether we want to expand. We should also talk about other web-based discussion and community software we have in Fedora — particularly, Ask and Hyperkitty. How do they fit in?
