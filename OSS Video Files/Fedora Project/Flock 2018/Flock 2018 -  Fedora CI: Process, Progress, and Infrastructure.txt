Talk: Fedora CI: Process, Progress, and Infrastructure
Presenters: Brian Stinson

Description: In this talk I'd like to highlight the work lots of folks have been doing on the package-level tests, test frameworks, and infrastructure for the Fedora CI Initiative. I'll cover the components, show how the same scheme can be used to test things other than just the distro, and talk about why "ci.centos.org" is showing up so much in Fedora logs/notifications.
