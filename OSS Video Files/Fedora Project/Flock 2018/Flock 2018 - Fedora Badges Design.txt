Talk: Fedora Badges Design
Presenters: Marie Nordin

Description: "Come join us in learning the process for designing Fedora Badges. We will go over all the necessary design tools and resources and get completely set up to design using Inkscape. Next we will go through the Badges tutorial step by step as you design a badge. You will learn how to find the right tickets for you to tackle and remix pre-existing graphics to make new designs. This is a session to learn, express your creative side, and earn badges for your contributions!"

With this workshop I would like to further engagement with the design aspect of Fedora Badges. I hope to impart how easy it is to contribute artwork to this project no matter the skill level of the participant.
Gaining more design contributors to the Badges project would be a tremendous help as there would be more hands on deck to create more badges, and to tackle the mountain of pre-existing tickets. More badges = more participation across Fedora as a whole.
I think this would help attendees by exposing them to a design process which they may not have been previously acquainted with, or to strengthen the design skills they already possess. I also believe it is a light hearted aspect of Fedora, and it could give some variety for Flock attendees to try something new and fun.

good morning everybody

00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:19,990
it's the last day of flock I know right

00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:22,970
I'm sad about it so today I'm going to

00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:27,109
give you guys a workshop on designing

00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:30,829
Fedora badges we've done this at flock

00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:33,200
for the last four years now and it's

00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:38,030
always success so I'm excited to have

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:40,460
you guys all here let's see so if you

00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:42,230
want to check out my blog I don't post

00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:45,050
on there a ton but you'll see some stuff

00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:47,030
after flock and occasionally when events

00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:51,010
happen or we're trying to get something

00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:56,870
done I might post on there alright so

00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:58,820
when designing Fedora badges there are

00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:02,300
some things to understand before you

00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:06,049
kind of jump in so this is the anatomy

00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:08,360
of a fedora badge so basically there's

00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:10,729
gonna be all these different elements in

00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:15,250
any badge that you design for fedora

00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:18,050
badges so you have the outer ring which

00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:20,680
it's just white and then you have a

00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:24,850
colored ring so the colored rings

00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:31,870
represent six different categories it is

00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:31,870
content development quality events

00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:39,380
miscellaneous and the other point that's

00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:44,210
escaping my mind at this moment that's

00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:47,990
the one community so those all correlate

00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:49,340
to the six Fedora colors and then the

00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:52,580
next thing you're gonna have is a

00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:55,460
background so when we first started

00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:58,820
doing badges we tried our best and we

00:01:55,460 --> 00:02:01,450
still try to correlate the background

00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:04,970
colors with each other so for example

00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:07,100
member badges it's a community badge so

00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:09,560
it has a pink outer ring and then the

00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:12,060
background is green so all of the member

00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,280
badges have a pink outer ring and a

00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,800
Green background so we try to keep it

00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:20,160
consistent because it gives a nice

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:23,250
overall look to the entire tire set of

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,040
badges and then you're gonna have some

00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:29,340
kind of a pattern some designs that you

00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,500
may make might not use a pattern it just

00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:35,220
depends on the concept that you're

00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:39,180
trying to do with your badge and then on

00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:42,420
top of that there's a graphic so in this

00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:45,140
instance it's a camera and you have some

00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:49,549
photos so it's gonna be different for

00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:53,760
each badge but every badge that you make

00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:56,190
will have all of these elements so if

00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:00,480
you design a badge and you're missing

00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:03,120
one of these better go back and you know

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:07,830
get that part that you're missing okay

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:09,690
so this is just a you know a little

00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:12,750
quick overview of what the website looks

00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:16,769
like here you have a profile and then

00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:18,600
also you have just an overall view of

00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:20,579
all the badges it seems kind of obvious

00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:24,239
but the reason that I'm pointing it out

00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:27,420
is because you can use this and you will

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,359
use this to reference what has been done

00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:32,459
in the past so especially for people who

00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:34,470
might not be as comfortable doing

00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:36,840
illustrations right so there's kind of

00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:40,220
this like well I can't draw so I can't

00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:44,609
do this but you have all of this artwork

00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:48,260
already there to reuse and remix and

00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:51,060
also it gives you a nice reference for

00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:54,260
you know what people have done in the

00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:59,720
past so you you want to use this page

00:03:54,260 --> 00:04:03,090
when you're designing badges okay

00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:06,180
fedora badges on picture this is where

00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:08,459
the design team does and the developer

00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:12,060
side as well does everything for fedora

00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:16,260
badges so we talked on here we actually

00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:19,650
do have a meeting it's 7:00 a.m. Eastern

00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:22,620
Central time every other Wednesday so

00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:25,800
anyone's welcome to join us otherwise we

00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:29,340
just do all of our communication on here

00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:32,310
and we've actually really enjoyed the

00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:35,750
tags feature on picture it's helped us a

00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:38,160
lot to be able to categorize things and

00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,990
it's just another way we communicate

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,910
about the different things we're trying

00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:48,510
to do there alright so you're not on

00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:50,220
your your own for you don't just have to

00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:52,380
get started and guess things we have

00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:56,910
lots of things for your use so there's a

00:04:52,380 --> 00:05:00,330
style guide and that one it tells you

00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:02,790
you know what size stroke you might want

00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:05,010
to use it tells you what font or

00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:08,070
typeface you're gonna want to use it

00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:12,660
gives you like an established okay these

00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:14,190
are the colors for the Rings so you want

00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,110
to use the style guide as much as you

00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:18,510
can actually I think it might need an

00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:22,470
update so if anyone ever want to work on

00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:24,960
that reach out and since we're on this

00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:28,040
page may suggest that you go to this

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:35,760
website are this link right here and

00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:40,770
download the resources for later on so

00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:46,770
okay next is these are the tickets and I

00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:49,680
mentioned the tags before so we have six

00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:53,729
tags for the different categories and

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,890
then we have artwork needed so if it has

00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:58,200
artwork needed then you know an artist

00:05:55,890 --> 00:06:02,160
can jump on then we've categorized them

00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:05,820
by artwork easy artwork intermediate and

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:11,210
artwork advanced or hard I think it

00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:14,010
might be so if you're a newbie with

00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:15,870
designing or Inkscape you might want to

00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:18,600
choose artwork easy and that's what

00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:21,000
we're gonna do later on we're gonna use

00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:25,140
that tag to find some stuff that would

00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:29,400
be appropriate for today okay so that's

00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:31,560
like the general overview so at this

00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:34,560
time I would say if you don't have

00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,849
Inkscape on your computer get it

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,580
downloaded now

00:06:36,849 --> 00:06:41,740
if you don't have the design resources

00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:44,139
get those downloaded now so if you need

00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:48,009
help finding any of that let me know

00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:56,610
anybody we're all good does everyone

00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:56,610
have Inkscape okay

00:07:04,349 --> 00:07:10,759
Edward - you have Inkscape okay

00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:10,759
what's up Lila

00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:22,339
next question is does everyone have the

00:07:17,929 --> 00:07:25,099
resources downloaded no okay so go to

00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:27,829
the fedora badges batur and you can just

00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:29,839
search in their resources in the in the

00:07:27,829 --> 00:07:31,159
search bar and it should I think the

00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:34,819
tickets 5:30

00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:42,009
let's see 528 and there's a search

00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:42,009
what yeah

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:10,870
do you have internet now maybe alright

00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:13,960
well we'll get there okay so did you

00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:20,819
find the resources Lila do you have the

00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:20,819
resources yep that's it

00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:27,510
I'll be chef do you have the resources

00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:29,490
okay cool I just want to make sure we're

00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:32,430
kind of all moving towards being ready

00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:34,770
as I continue to to talk about this okay

00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:36,720
so that was the overview and now we're

00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:38,700
going to talk about each step when

00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,230
you're designing and so I'm going to go

00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,580
pretty quickly through these slides and

00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:44,280
then we're gonna go through them a

00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:46,140
little bit slower as we design a badge

00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:50,100
so there's you're not gonna try to

00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:53,250
follow along for now we'll get back to

00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:55,710
that okay so the first step you want to

00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:57,840
download and install any relevant

00:08:55,710 --> 00:09:01,950
resources which is what we are doing

00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:07,050
right now you want to identify a ticket

00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:09,810
that needs artwork so you can sort the

00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:12,170
issues by you know there's the top tag

00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:15,290
so you can say artwork needed so the

00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:15,290
what's up

00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:22,640
really oh okay

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,640
so yeah pusher has some

00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:41,190
so there is a known issue in Fodor with

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:45,690
downloads and SVG's and PN G's and I'm

00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:47,340
gonna address it in a little bit some of

00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:48,930
them seem to work like the newer ones

00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,990
that we've added on but anything that

00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:54,180
was brought over from the track is

00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:57,930
broken but you basically just take out a

00:09:54,180 --> 00:10:00,450
little bit of the the link and it's fine

00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:07,880
it's it's still there it's just kind of

00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:07,880
a pain the issue is that well

00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:29,440
that's possible so the issue is that any

00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:33,860
thing that was brought over from track

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:37,280
has like an extra little part in the in

00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:39,950
the link and it's like files and then a

00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:43,550
slash so you're gonna take that out and

00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:45,710
then it would work so I think pingu has

00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:48,200
tried to work on this and there's been

00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:54,020
some improvement you add it to where you

00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:57,470
got the resources okay good okay so Lila

00:10:54,020 --> 00:11:00,380
do you have the resources okay all right

00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:01,760
so that's so once you identify a ticket

00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:05,090
that needs artwork you're gonna set

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,680
yourself to owner you do need to be a

00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:09,770
part of the Fedora badges group on

00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:13,310
kajoor which I'm pretty sure I can set

00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:14,840
that up today for everyone but if not

00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:17,240
you can still work on it you don't have

00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:20,750
to set yourself as owner if you don't

00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:24,740
want to okay so once you've chosen a

00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:28,540
badge to work on you know you'll read

00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:32,090
through the idea for the badge you'll

00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:34,070
see on there that may be myself or Masha

00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:37,370
will help come on and say here's a

00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:38,930
concept for the artwork and at that

00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:41,650
point that's when you're gonna want to

00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:44,360
go back to the Fedora badges page and

00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:47,060
look at similar badges so see what other

00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:49,940
people have done just like any artwork

00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:53,740
there's plenty of it out there and we

00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:57,440
use that to reference and to build upon

00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:59,990
then you kind of finalize a concept for

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,120
the the badge artwork and then you want

00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:04,910
to gather inspiration and resources so

00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:07,610
if you you know you say I'm gonna use

00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:09,860
the badger from this one badge the

00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:12,380
artworks already made you go into that

00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:14,270
badge on the fedora badges site you

00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:18,980
follow that through to the track or

00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:21,110
pleasure and then you download that and

00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:23,360
then for example maybe you want to

00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:25,420
Google something maybe for example the

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,340
one we're gonna do has a bike in it

00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:32,530
or the one that I did for this has a

00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:35,020
bike in it so I picked out a bike from

00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:38,950
just Google Images we're not using it

00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:40,600
we're just using it as reference okay so

00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:42,310
the next thing once you've chosen the

00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,800
concept once you've gathered some

00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:47,230
resources then you use the style guide

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:50,400
to categorize things so the first thing

00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:54,150
you want to do is open the template and

00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:57,520
then you want to save so with Inkscape

00:12:54,150 --> 00:13:01,810
it has a tendency to crash so make sure

00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:05,830
that you're saving every ten minutes I'd

00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:08,170
say it's a pretty safe just save all the

00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:09,730
time so I put that in here because it's

00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:10,900
important you don't want to lose the the

00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:15,340
work that you did that's always very

00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:17,890
frustrating okay so you want to use the

00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:22,530
style guide to define the background

00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:26,680
color and also in the resources there is

00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:28,840
two color palettes which will will

00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:32,080
install those together and like get that

00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:35,470
all set up but those are super

00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:38,470
convenient and not really negotiable you

00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:40,620
need to use them like you can't what's

00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:40,620
up

00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:51,280
really okay well I didn't know about

00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:54,250
that so someone pointed out that you can

00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:56,860
automatically have Inkscape saved for

00:13:54,250 --> 00:14:01,120
you every ten minutes I'd like you to

00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:03,340
show me that later please okay so yeah

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,200
the color the there's two pallets and

00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:07,870
it's not really negotiable we use the

00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:10,510
fedora colors and variations on that and

00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:11,890
then we've established another color

00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:15,850
palette and the reason that we do this

00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:19,600
is so that even though different artists

00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:24,220
are making different badges it gives an

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:26,110
overall feeling and aesthetic to to all

00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:29,170
the badges so you know you have

00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:32,200
different styles no two artists are

00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:36,900
gonna make the same exact style so this

00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:42,070
gives badges a really unifying framework

00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:44,650
so if you can take take a color from

00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:47,440
here sometimes you might need to make

00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:49,720
some variations and that's okay as long

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,000
as it looks good that's kind of how art

00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,440
works in general like if long as it

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,470
looks good you can kind of break the

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:59,380
rules a little bit but generally you

00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:01,720
want to use these colors okay so the

00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:04,750
background can vary depending on the the

00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:07,180
concept you have but we do have a lot of

00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:10,660
backgrounds already kind of established

00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:14,370
so there's this wavy lines one that I'm

00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:18,240
showing here and then like this little

00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:22,300
graphic that I made like there's a

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:24,490
sunburst one so there's some that you

00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:26,890
can kind of just already pull and use so

00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:29,650
you don't have to redo that that aspect

00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:31,930
at all and save your work unless you

00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:35,690
have it automatically set up like some

00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:39,870
people all right then

00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:42,210
okay so this is the yeah this is the the

00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:47,280
little slide here on if the link is

00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:49,440
broken miss this is the issue so

00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:53,430
occasionally you'll counter an older

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:56,010
file so it's going to come up either two

00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:59,670
ways it's gonna come up like the top one

00:15:56,010 --> 00:16:03,930
and then you switch that first part out

00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:05,880
for the second line or it's going to

00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:10,800
come up like the third line here and you

00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:13,490
take out the part that says files does

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:16,980
that make sense to everybody

00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:21,140
it's a hack we've just had to do and

00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:27,200
deal with but it's all still there okay

00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:27,200
next is graphics so this is the fun part

00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:33,390
you want to draw something from scratch

00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:37,050
you want to import you want to reuse you

00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:39,840
want to remix the artwork that's already

00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:42,480
there you know use use what other badger

00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:45,780
artists have done in the past because

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:49,200
there's no reason to spend all that time

00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:51,810
redrawing things and it gives you an

00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:55,500
advantage and even if you feel oh maybe

00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:59,160
I can't draw it's fine there's so much

00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:02,130
out there already so once you kind of

00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,720
get your draft you want to evaluate that

00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:06,600
so you want to make sure you have all

00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:10,110
the components from the anatomy of a

00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:13,079
badge and you kind of want to use the

00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:16,980
style guide to make sure that it's

00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:23,190
fitting in with the aesthetic of badges

00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:25,459
overall so the style guide is in the

00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:27,870
design resources that you've downloaded

00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:29,730
so if you guys want to like pull that up

00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:32,060
and kind of just look through it a

00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:34,710
little bit that would be beneficial

00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:39,180
there's like certain things that we've

00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:42,660
established to keep the fedora badges

00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:44,190
aesthetic so for example we try to avoid

00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,450
the color black I don't know if that's

00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:48,030
actually in the style guide it would be

00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:49,200
good to add too but like whatever use a

00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:51,510
stroke on something

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:55,070
it needs to be one and a half pixels are

00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:58,110
larger so we don't use like tiny little

00:17:55,070 --> 00:18:02,580
strokes on objects you know you have to

00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:04,440
be able to see the badge at a small size

00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:06,539
people are looking at it on their phones

00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,880
okay yeah maybe people are bringing it

00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:11,460
up on their computer but for the most

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,889
part not really and even then they're

00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:17,940
small so the reason that you know you

00:18:13,889 --> 00:18:21,779
use like a larger stroke is to make the

00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:23,159
artwork readable and that that's one

00:18:21,779 --> 00:18:25,230
thing that that helps a lot so that's

00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:28,110
just an example of what's in the style

00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:33,840
guide and there's like a few other tips

00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:36,090
like don't warp or do any like text you

00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,370
would never want to do that you only

00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:40,710
occasionally would use the Fedora logo

00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:42,600
that's something we kind of not try to

00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:46,740
avoid but we only use it when it's

00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:49,490
necessary or when it makes like a lot of

00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:52,919
sense and you you never would want to

00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:56,870
you know shorten or do anything to the

00:18:52,919 --> 00:19:00,510
Fedora logo you you have to preserve the

00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:02,250
dimensions of that okay so once you've

00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:06,179
evaluated your design using the style

00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:08,399
guide then you export a PNG so it's

00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:10,649
really important that we export the PNG

00:19:08,399 --> 00:19:11,940
s all at the same size because you're

00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:15,529
putting them on a website we want them

00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:19,320
to all be the same size unfortunately

00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:20,850
they're not all the same size some

00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:24,299
people might not have used the right

00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:26,190
template or maybe they've exported at

00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:29,010
the wrong size and sometimes we kind of

00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:30,389
just have to push things through to you

00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:32,700
know get that badge out there say we

00:19:30,389 --> 00:19:35,639
need it for an event maybe somehow it

00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:37,679
gets overlooked so you know we ask the

00:19:35,639 --> 00:19:39,450
badge artist to pay attention to that as

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,299
much as they can when you're when you're

00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:46,200
exporting it so you know we can avoid

00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:52,529
that so when you do export a PNG it's

00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:55,460
going to be 96 dpi and 256 by 256 pixels

00:19:52,529 --> 00:19:55,460
so

00:19:55,670 --> 00:20:03,110
next so after you upload your artwork

00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:05,960
which you're always going to want to

00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:08,570
upload the SVG in the PNG and the reason

00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:11,240
that you upload the SVG is so that if

00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:13,400
there's an issue in there one of the

00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:16,180
like badge mentors like me or mosh or

00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:20,530
anyone else who who would like to help

00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:25,640
can go in and look at what's going on

00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:27,890
beyond that if say you don't have time

00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:30,950
to finish it someone can pick it up from

00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:33,410
there and work on it so if you just put

00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:35,510
the PNG on it's not very helpful

00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:37,880
I mean we can work we can work with it

00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:41,390
but you always want to add the SVG on

00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:44,690
there so that future people can work on

00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:47,480
it and then also like for later artists

00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:51,590
remix using that artwork they will need

00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:55,220
the SVG so then after that you want to

00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:59,870
add a tag that says review and one of us

00:20:55,220 --> 00:21:02,090
will review it we try to look at ever

00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:05,690
all the modified tickets every two weeks

00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:09,170
but sometimes it doesn't happen but if

00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:11,510
you did have like an urgent task or it

00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:12,800
may be an event coming or you just want

00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:14,540
to get something pushed really quickly

00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:19,070
you're always welcome to reach out to me

00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:20,840
or Masha by email um you know say hey

00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:24,320
can you look at this we really want to

00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:28,870
get this out there and then you want to

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:32,660
change these artwork status to has draft

00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:35,360
so then as soon as we can we will review

00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:37,070
that and give feedback so after you get

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,040
that feedback you're gonna make

00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:43,640
revisions sometimes more than one

00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:46,760
revision it depends on the badge and

00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:48,680
then once it's complete we'll set it to

00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:51,800
ready to push and then from there it

00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:53,960
goes to the developers it's in their

00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:58,140
hands

00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:59,700
so that's that's the whole process so

00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:03,000
now I'm gonna start at the beginning and

00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:06,570
we're gonna do each step together okay

00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,900
all right so the first step is to so

00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:09,270
okay

00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:13,200
everyone has an escape everyone has

00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:15,570
design resources yeah okay so does

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:21,299
everyone know how to get the pallets

00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:24,120
into Inkscape no all right so you need

00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:27,120
to go into your user folder might be

00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:29,520
hidden and then you go into Inkscape and

00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:32,309
then you go into palettes and you drop

00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:35,190
those two files I think they're GPL

00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:37,169
files and you drop those into the

00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:41,820
palettes folder and then you want to

00:22:37,169 --> 00:22:43,200
restart Inkscape okay so I'm gonna I'm

00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:45,320
gonna go around and help everyone do

00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,320
this

00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,060
also a note if you figured that part out

00:22:56,630 --> 00:23:03,030
go to open font library and download

00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:05,960
comforta the typeface because we're

00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:05,960
going to need that as well

00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:09,600
yeah

00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,740
okay I was a little bit mistaken it's

00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:28,710
the dot config folder and then slash

00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:31,590
Inkscape and slash palettes so that's

00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:37,410
where you want to drop your two GPL

00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:45,450
files is everyone with me successful you

00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:47,940
might you might have it differently okay

00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:50,190
so if it's working then you want to

00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:51,660
restart Inkscape and then once you've

00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:52,740
restarted Inkscape actually I'm just

00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:59,030
going to bring it up right now

00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:59,030
here let's see how do I get it how do

00:25:14,299 --> 00:25:20,869
okay so to test if the pallets are

00:25:17,269 --> 00:25:24,649
working there's this little arrow right

00:25:20,869 --> 00:25:27,499
here on the bottom right corner you

00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:30,769
click that and it should be in here

00:25:27,499 --> 00:25:37,339
there's badges Fedora palette and badges

00:25:30,769 --> 00:25:43,089
extended palette so you'll see at the

00:25:37,339 --> 00:25:47,509
bottom is it working for you awesome and

00:25:43,089 --> 00:25:50,289
yeah so you'll see that you can click

00:25:47,509 --> 00:25:50,289
these different ones

00:25:50,349 --> 00:26:00,070
all right who does everyone have the

00:25:54,619 --> 00:26:03,619
palette installed almost I'll be shy

00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:11,109
not yet okay so while he works on that

00:26:03,619 --> 00:26:16,339
then I want people to get comfort too so

00:26:11,109 --> 00:26:18,799
you can get comfortable on library so

00:26:16,339 --> 00:26:21,079
once you deal with the palettes go to

00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:25,219
open font library or well I guess they

00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:28,399
changed their url font library org and

00:26:25,219 --> 00:26:34,820
then go into the search bar and look up

00:26:28,399 --> 00:26:40,639
the comfort time so this is the only

00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:45,919
typeface we use in badges unless the

00:26:40,639 --> 00:26:50,089
concept warrants a different typeface so

00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:52,789
for example event badges that have a

00:26:50,089 --> 00:26:56,959
logo you're not going to change but if

00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:58,729
you ever put a year a number any kind of

00:26:56,959 --> 00:27:02,049
text you're probably going to use

00:26:58,729 --> 00:27:04,429
comforta so just keep that in mind

00:27:02,049 --> 00:27:06,559
because if you use something else

00:27:04,429 --> 00:27:11,620
we'll come on to the ticket and tell you

00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:17,350
to change it let's see

00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:20,620
I think that's everything we need to get

00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:23,080
set up so once your once you're there

00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:28,860
let me know does anyone need any help

00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:30,610
you need what do you need help with oh

00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:34,150
okay okay

00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:35,080
thank you very much anyone else palates

00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:39,730
working

00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:43,390
do you have comforta downloaded so

00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:46,630
you're going to need to restart Inkscape

00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:50,320
after you install comforta to have it

00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:52,240
show up okay and you would just install

00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,360
that font like you install any other

00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,539
font on whatever system you're using

00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:59,770
okay

00:27:55,539 --> 00:28:06,279
all right so let's go to issues on cos

00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:09,010
you're working awesome okay so bring up

00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:15,669
the page or website for fedora badges

00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:21,580
and then click on issues so we want to

00:28:15,669 --> 00:28:26,640
look at artwork easy so you want to sort

00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:29,470
the badges by artwork easy and then

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:38,490
you're going to want to sort the badges

00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:38,490
by artwork needed okay so

00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:50,950
I think we do have easy fix but but I

00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:50,950
don't use that tag for the design aspect

00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,090
yeah artwork easy

00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:01,480
what easy fix

00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:14,130
mm-hmm

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,240
okay yeah

00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:40,290
so during the sysadmin talk we actually

00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:42,390
discussed potentially redoing the

00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:45,930
website and I think that would be a

00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:48,000
great idea for the redo so having series

00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:50,130
together so you can kind of look at them

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,140
like that that would be a great idea I

00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:54,480
mean we've actually discussed it before

00:29:52,140 --> 00:30:05,970
it's just something that hasn't had the

00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:11,520
time to be done yep yeah I'm with you I

00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:14,700
think that's a great idea we're thinking

00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:18,210
about trying to get a outreach e or yeah

00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:23,700
and outreach e intern to maybe overhaul

00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:27,390
the website right so it's also another

00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:29,880
idea we have is to maybe somehow okay

00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:32,520
ideally I don't know how this would

00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:35,340
happen but I would like to see badges

00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:37,230
like in fedora like so maybe on your

00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:39,630
dashboard you have like a badges thing

00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:42,090
and they like pop up and I don't you can

00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:48,270
like view them in fedora versus like on

00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:51,270
a website but like no like when you open

00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:53,930
your computer you could see badges

00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:53,930
somehow

00:30:55,650 --> 00:31:00,340
exactly like a widget yeah I think that

00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:01,210
would be really cool I have no idea how

00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:04,450
to make that happen

00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:06,880
so if anyone does go ahead and jump on

00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:09,880
that okay so I'm now go to everyone once

00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:13,150
you have the artwork ez-up then kind of

00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:16,990
go through and start looking at the

00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:19,150
tickets and seeing if it's something

00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:20,800
that you feel you can do so I'm actually

00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:25,200
going to come around and help you guys

00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:25,200
pick out tickets okay

00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,740
now I just

00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:52,410
so I just want to show you guys this one

00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:54,420
because this is exactly the point I was

00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:56,550
trying to address earlier if my internet

00:36:54,420 --> 00:37:02,490
will work which it does not look like

00:36:56,550 --> 00:37:10,950
it's working I was trying to use his hot

00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:14,630
spot so should be back soon

00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:14,630
yeah I can try your hot spot what is it

00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:28,320
any caps or anything no lowercase

00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:44,370
I might have typed it wrong qac

00:37:48,050 --> 00:38:01,400
zing got it sorry I thought you said C

00:37:54,020 --> 00:38:02,870
as in cat Z as in zoo alright we're good

00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:05,180
okay so I just want to show you guys

00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:10,010
this one because this is extremely

00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:12,050
frustrating for badger artists Oh lilo

00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:15,380
was looking at this one thinking okay

00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:17,900
maybe we could do this so if you scroll

00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:22,370
down okay

00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:26,120
we have some so a tube addict give us

00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:29,690
this idea here but there's just a PNG so

00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:33,460
this person made more work and did you

00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:38,060
know more work on this and unfortunately

00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:42,740
we can't use it because there's no SVG

00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:44,390
here so like this is here it needs some

00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:46,750
edits one of you guys could have done it

00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:50,150
but hey we can't really do that because

00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:52,010
we don't have the SVG so I'm gonna see

00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:55,130
what the other one looked like does

00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:58,670
anyone have another badge that they're

00:38:55,130 --> 00:39:00,140
ready to jump into have anyone found

00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:10,160
anything they're interested in working

00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:12,410
on okay hold on one sec Colonel test a

00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:16,040
participant badge okay

00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:18,140
so let's read through this okay so this

00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:22,490
badge is for participating in Colonel

00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:23,180
test days so here's some ideas for your

00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:25,910
artwork okay

00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:28,550
one idea would be to remix this badge

00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:31,150
changing the graphics on the computer

00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:33,890
screen to something kernel related or

00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:37,760
the second idea is to remix this badge

00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:40,040
take out the numbers and Mickey give the

00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:43,060
Badger a name tag so let's jump into

00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:46,340
that and see see what that's all about

00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:49,550
so you look at this too okay so one idea

00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:51,960
was to take this out because it's a

00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:55,670
testing badge that's a good idea

00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:59,610
and to give him like a nametag

00:39:55,670 --> 00:40:02,220
or there's this one and take out the

00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:03,900
computer screen stuff and put in stuff

00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,320
criminal related I think this isn't a

00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:09,300
good idea

00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:15,870
so why don't you jump into that if

00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:17,190
you're you're ready okay so then if you

00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:19,320
want to do that one that's great

00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:23,490
so go on that ticket and set yourself to

00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:26,250
the signee yep and then after that

00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:29,580
you're gonna go here and you're gonna

00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:33,470
follow this through and hopefully the

00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:43,020
SVG is here it should be

00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:46,260
and there's your SVG so go in there and

00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:48,930
download this and then open it up in

00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:51,560
Inkscape okay okay so we have you

00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:55,100
assigned one Abhishek do you have one

00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:55,100
for 61

00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:12,280
okay let's talk about this one okay

00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:13,210
you joined a fedora mailing list for the

00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:17,470
first time

00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:18,850
that's a cool badge and this person is

00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:24,510
suggesting that maybe it would be a

00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:26,560
series or maybe we could just kind of

00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:29,620
develop off of this some of different

00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:31,840
ideas our concept should refer to the at

00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:33,820
symbol because it's the basic symbol of

00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:37,660
emails since the early days I agree I

00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:39,400
think that would be cool um badge image

00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:42,970
sample let's check out what they put

00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:45,970
here I mean that's not bad but that's

00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:47,740
not really quite enough to make some

00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:57,570
badge artwork so they kind of just gave

00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:57,570
us a concept badge okay

00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:07,619
so Justin jumped on here and said he's

00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:11,670
not sure that this is possible and then

00:42:07,619 --> 00:42:14,369
about a year ago I pinged and said is it

00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:17,309
possible and we don't have an answer so

00:42:14,369 --> 00:42:20,099
you could make the artwork just to get

00:42:17,309 --> 00:42:23,010
some experience but there's no guarantee

00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:25,140
that this could be pushed so if you want

00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:31,440
to you can try it but you might consider

00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:33,950
doing something we know is possible have

00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,950
you picked out

00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,230
okay

00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:59,630
I actually meant do you have a badge to

00:42:49,880 --> 00:43:02,210
get picked out okay well you actually

00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:08,810
don't need the palette so that's not an

00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:11,840
excuse so try try to find a ticket okay

00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:15,490
so who else is looking for a ticket

00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:24,160
maybe you found one Edward and Lila

00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:24,160
which one did you find okay which number

00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:39,380
okay we're gonna take a look at 240 okay

00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:44,400
so I do recall this one so there's some

00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:46,970
question here I remember about using

00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,970
flags

00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:08,150
so so basically you know someone did a

00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:10,310
bunch of artwork for this which we are

00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:13,400
eternally grateful but it looks like we

00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:16,490
cannot use flags it's kind of it's a

00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:21,200
legal issue so I think this one's open

00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:26,690
again let's see

00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:29,200
so Kyler Conway came on here oh there's

00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:29,200
a lot of stuff

00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:38,900
this one here

00:44:53,679 --> 00:45:01,359
yep go ahead all right so so this

00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:20,840
okay so yeah the little um

00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:26,780
Bonjour fedora yeah those are really

00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:30,470
cute so my thought is we have another

00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:33,980
badge that has a like Oh globe in it and

00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:37,250
so maybe you could grab that one and you

00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:39,880
can you know work off of that so then I

00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:44,000
think you'd want to so you'd want to go

00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:46,240
here I think it's a Content badge maybe

00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,240
not

00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:52,360
[Music]

00:45:54,170 --> 00:46:03,970
okay so here it is you can find work

00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:12,440
so here you can find a globe that we've

00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:14,690
used so you just want to go through here

00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:17,180
and grab the artwork and then you also

00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:19,520
want to grab the artwork from here

00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:22,280
actually I don't have to because you

00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:24,950
could just you can but you don't have to

00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:28,850
but it this would be easy so then you

00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:32,080
want to grab this download this and then

00:46:28,850 --> 00:46:35,870
you want to open up a template and

00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:39,320
import that artwork and your artwork all

00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:43,850
into one and then kind of remix alright

00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:45,440
who is still picking out a ticket do you

00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:48,890
have any ideas of something you might

00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:59,050
want to do are you looking at

00:46:48,890 --> 00:47:02,050
descriptions how about you do you help

00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:02,050

00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:45,250
in one xscape file so occasionally

00:59:41,290 --> 00:59:47,410
you'll find artwork or a badge from like

00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:49,660

00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:51,850

Fedora next

did you comment on this one please do

01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:24,850
you are the little wonder right the

01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:24,850
little this

01:15:32,410 --> 01:15:37,210
so those two that you found might be a

01:15:35,650 --> 01:15:41,950
result of stuff that they were doing

01:15:37,210 --> 01:15:46,050
yesterday that's possible so we'll see

01:15:41,950 --> 01:15:46,050
but either way it needs to be addressed

01:15:52,830 --> 01:15:55,830
BSA

01:15:56,510 --> 01:16:03,739
PSA ba do you like that

01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:21,030
so eventually I don't I don't we may

01:16:17,910 --> 01:16:30,000
have time to finish some art work but we

01:16:21,030 --> 01:16:32,760
might not so once you do finish a badge

01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:37,460
and it gets pushed we don't have like a

01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:41,960
good way of counting them like who made

01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:48,570
who made what so we have this wiki here

01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:52,530
that's the art work log I can find the

01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:55,650
link here it is okay so when you do make

01:16:52,530 --> 01:16:58,380
art work and you finish artwork go to

01:16:55,650 --> 01:17:02,310
this page and edit the wiki adding your

01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:06,710
name in and what badge you completed so

01:17:02,310 --> 01:17:09,530
just put in a link to the ticket and

01:17:06,710 --> 01:17:14,280
then from there this is kind of how I

01:17:09,530 --> 01:17:17,190
award the different badge artist badges

01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:21,320
so actually anyone who finishes a badge

01:17:17,190 --> 01:17:24,510
today I can give you that badge as well

01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:26,720
okay which room I must get missing right

01:17:24,510 --> 01:17:26,720
now

01:17:31,459 --> 01:17:34,510
what's your screen name

01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:39,540

01:18:12,580 --> 01:18:16,270
Savior would you like a badge

01:18:27,659 --> 01:18:35,579
this guy in the back didn't really do

01:18:29,459 --> 01:18:43,219
anything either but he's here counts for

01:18:35,579 --> 01:18:43,219
something so to use are you what's your

01:18:45,409 --> 01:18:52,450
what is it

01:18:48,700 --> 01:18:52,450
[Music]

01:19:01,790 --> 01:19:05,690
I think I meet a likes to call me the

01:19:03,770 --> 01:19:11,870
badges queen so technically I can like

01:19:05,690 --> 01:19:13,190
do what I want so but you were here and

01:19:11,870 --> 01:19:16,300
you helped set up so I guess I'll look

01:19:13,190 --> 01:19:16,300
out for her this time

01:19:16,420 --> 01:19:19,750
nice pick

01:19:22,930 --> 01:19:26,890
you know like curious

01:19:54,590 --> 01:19:59,890
all right who needs help anyone

01:31:14,579 --> 01:31:20,369
so I'm just gonna say it back into the

01:31:17,460 --> 01:31:24,540
mic whenever you're working on badges

01:31:20,369 --> 01:31:27,000
say you get pulled away or you get maybe

01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:30,000
even frustrated and you're like I'm done

01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:32,099
working on this for now so the beauty of

01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:35,460
our community is that we get to

01:31:32,099 --> 01:31:38,579
collaborate with each other and work you

01:31:35,460 --> 01:31:42,540
know not reinvent the wheel stand on the

01:31:38,579 --> 01:31:44,309
shoulders of giants as they say so you

01:31:42,540 --> 01:31:46,829
know if you're done working on it just

01:31:44,309 --> 01:31:48,570
upload it to the ticket and even if you

01:31:46,829 --> 01:31:51,469
do something later if you don't feel

01:31:48,570 --> 01:31:53,820
it's ready don't worry about like

01:31:51,469 --> 01:31:55,920
judgments or anything like that whatever

01:31:53,820 --> 01:31:59,210
work you can do on badges we're gonna be

01:31:55,920 --> 01:32:01,739
thrilled thrilled to have that happen so

01:31:59,210 --> 01:32:04,440
we're about to finish up in five minutes

01:32:01,739 --> 01:32:07,110
so I'm requesting that everyone save

01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:11,550
whatever they have done and put it onto

01:32:07,110 --> 01:32:13,920
the ticket that they've chosen and also

01:32:11,550 --> 01:32:17,429
just thanks for coming I had a lot of

01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:22,400
fun actually so you know if anybody has

01:32:17,429 --> 01:32:24,900
any questions about badges badge ideas

01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:26,730
if you have any questions about Inkscape

01:32:24,900 --> 01:32:29,340
there's actually a lot out there on

01:32:26,730 --> 01:32:33,150
Inkscape I know people who are have used

01:32:29,340 --> 01:32:36,059
other softwares kind of find it a little

01:32:33,150 --> 01:32:40,199
bit hard to settle into but if you do

01:32:36,059 --> 01:32:42,570
persist like other open-source things

01:32:40,199 --> 01:32:44,690
too I think you kind of learn it and

01:32:42,570 --> 01:32:47,820
eventually get used to the little

01:32:44,690 --> 01:32:49,349
intricacies of the program so anyway if

01:32:47,820 --> 01:32:52,199
you have any questions about anything

01:32:49,349 --> 01:32:56,059
badge related you're welcome to message

01:32:52,199 --> 01:32:59,550
