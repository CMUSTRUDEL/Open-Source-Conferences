Talk: The power of one: For the good of the community
Presenters: Rebecca Fernandez

Description: We all have moments in our communities and projects where we wish that we could change something for the better.

How many times have you thought: "If I were in charge, things would be different..."?

But leadership is not something we are appointed to. It's finding the courage and having the skills, in difficult moments, to use our voices and our actions for the good of others.

Learn how to help your community overcome resistance to new ideas; bring calmness, reason, and respect back into heated discussions; and protect yourselves from bad actors and destructive behaviours.

Stop wishing for change. Start recognizing and using the power that you already have... and make a difference.

00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:10,119
want to call out Palfrey olds if he's in

00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:11,530
the room Paul selected the equipment

00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:13,600
which you are hearing my lovely voice

00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:15,369
come through and it was super super nice

00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,720
of him to do all of that work and help

00:00:15,369 --> 00:00:18,670

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,540
equipment this year so if you see Paul

00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:22,480
thank him for that

00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:26,440
and if you see Pavel or MOT I thank them

00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:31,600
for running the equipment for us I see

00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:34,030
you thank you we are looking for people

00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,430
to do outreaching mentorships this fall

00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,690
winter they have a name for that term

00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:40,030
and I forget what it is they're actually

00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:41,500
using months now so for the the months

00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:43,450
that will be occurring in the winter

00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,840
part of this hemisphere we are looking

00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:48,430
for outreach team interns Mentors

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,410
if you are interested there is a comm

00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:52,930
blog article posted or you can talk to

00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:57,160
Laura Abbott you can also talk to me and

00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:59,500
Laura is waving how could you not want a

00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,690
mentor after that so we really are

00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,760
looking for mentors we did not have a

00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:05,619
mentorship this spring

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,530
whatever the spring months are for

00:01:05,619 --> 00:01:10,119
outreach e I don't remember the sequence

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:13,749
so we were really excited about doing

00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:15,729
this in the winter and it is a program

00:01:13,749 --> 00:01:18,549
that targets underrepresented people in

00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:20,829
technology it's fantastic it's like a

00:01:18,549 --> 00:01:22,899
very intensive but longer Google Summer

00:01:20,829 --> 00:01:24,579
of Code in many ways and that's all I'm

00:01:22,899 --> 00:01:26,859
going to say go read the conical it's

00:01:24,579 --> 00:01:28,749
amazing also if you're interested in

00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:30,789
either outreach e or google Summer of

00:01:28,749 --> 00:01:33,039
Code I strongly encourage you to attend

00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:34,569
the session on Saturday where you'll get

00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:36,700
to meet many of the students who were in

00:01:34,569 --> 00:01:38,409
our G sock this summer but also be able

00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,899
to ask questions about how you can help

00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:44,319
enable that program to grow for us in

00:01:40,899 --> 00:01:45,579
future years so the last thing I need to

00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:48,279
do is to introduce our speaker this

00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:49,539
morning Rebecca Fernandes is here to

00:01:48,279 --> 00:01:51,369
talk to us and I'm not going to steal

00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:52,779
anything of her talk other than tell you

00:01:51,369 --> 00:01:55,240
that you can read this slide and see

00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:57,159
it's called the power of one the one

00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,509
thing that I will say is that I have had

00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:00,069
the privilege of being at two different

00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:02,439
conferences where Rebecca has presented

00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:04,299
versions of this talk and at both of

00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:06,340
those conferences I was not allowed in

00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:08,200
the room because it was beyond standing

00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,970
room capacity and they were actively

00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,580
turning away large numbers of people

00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:14,050
so with absolutely no pressure I can

00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,319
tell you that I am super excited about

00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,900
the

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:26,579
talk and it's all yours please welcome

00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:29,290
Rebecca thanks man what an introduction

00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:31,269
well good morning as Beck said I'm

00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:33,099
Rebecca Fernandes I'm here from Raleigh

00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:35,500
North Carolina in the United States and

00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:37,959
I'm here to talk to you today about the

00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,790
power that you have as one individual

00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:42,040
person to make a difference in the

00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:43,569
Fedora community but also in the many

00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,180
other projects and communities you're

00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:47,829
part of so we're gonna talk about those

00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:49,750
moments when you have an idea

00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:51,519
you find yourself wishing you could

00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,769
change something for the better but it's

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,599
not as simple as just doing it right you

00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:57,340
need other people to kind of agree or go

00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,810
along with that or help you we're

00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:02,139
talking about the moments where you see

00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:04,769
something happening and you think that's

00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:06,909
not okay what can I do about it

00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:09,189
so I'm here today to tell you the answer

00:03:06,909 --> 00:03:10,599
is you can do something you can change

00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,579
something for the better you can make a

00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:13,930
difference you can make the communities

00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:16,870
and projects you're part of a better

00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:18,280
place not everything I share today is

00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,790
gonna feel comfortable the first time

00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,530
you try it

00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:22,180
most of these concepts were not

00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,459
comfortable for me at first either

00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,599
we'll talk about that you might need to

00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:27,669
experiment with it you might need to

00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,620
change the words to make it fit who you

00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:30,790
are make it feel like something you

00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,250
could say and not feel silly saying

00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:35,500
right you might also need to change the

00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,900
words to adapt to who you're talking to

00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,400
because that makes a big difference

00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,500
that's to be expected or I'd experiment

00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,090
with it there's no magic formula I can

00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,439
hand you off of some shelf that's gonna

00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,840
magically solve all of your problems

00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:48,430
every time just doesn't work that way

00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,590
but I guarantee you if you try if you

00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:52,329
experiment if you adapt based on what

00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:54,280
you learn you'll find a lot of this

00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:55,479
stuff is helpful and if it's not leave

00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,790
it behind right if what you're doing

00:03:55,479 --> 00:04:00,639
today is working keep doing it but for

00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:02,769
the situations where you feel stuck try

00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:04,569
something different so let me tell you a

00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:08,729
little bit about myself this brings us

00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:08,729
to the obligatory introduction slide

00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:15,830
sorry wrong Chuck in some ways I guess

00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,780
I've become something of an expert on

00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:20,299
this topic I've worked in a company

00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:23,060
RedHat that functions quite a bit like a

00:04:20,299 --> 00:04:24,949
giant messy open-source community for

00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:27,620
most of my career I started out in a

00:04:24,949 --> 00:04:29,570
technical role back in 2005 lightly

00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,979
technical right this was 2005 so you

00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:33,590
remember what web development was like

00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:34,940
back then but these days my role is

00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:37,760
really to help us figure out how do we

00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:39,410
scale the open-source ethos and values

00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,760
that really make Red Hat special how do

00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:43,220
we scale the culture that we don't want

00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:45,260
to lose as we grow we're at 12,000

00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,789
people now that is really big we hire a

00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,169
lot of people who don't come from an

00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:50,210
open-source background I have to kind of

00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:51,710
learn what does it look like to work in

00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:54,560
a transparent way what does it look like

00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:55,940
to ask people for their feedback their

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,979
ideas what does it look like to receive

00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:59,270
feedback it's very different for a lot

00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:00,889
of people right if you work in a tech

00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:02,210
company that doesn't have that ethos you

00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:04,669
know what I'm talking about it's not the

00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:07,039
same kind of culture so I spend a lot of

00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:09,080
time helping people make decisions come

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,180
to an agreement and work together in a

00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:14,150
very messy open environment where it's

00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:15,830
difficult sometimes impossible for even

00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:18,349
the most senior leaders to mandate much

00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:21,530
of anything it's a role I fell into

00:05:18,349 --> 00:05:24,110
largely by accident I think because I'm

00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,639
a people watcher by nature I like to

00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:27,260
observe other people like to think about

00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:29,300
what makes them behave the ways that

00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:31,190
they do and when I see somebody who's

00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,650
really effective at changing other

00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:35,030
people's minds I look really closely at

00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:36,770
that person and I ask what are they

00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,180
doing that's different I try to

00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:40,460
understand where the patterns what are

00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:42,620
the techniques that make that work right

00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,000
how could I do that so in some ways I

00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:46,340
know a lot about this topic I've been

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,380
watching people for a long time but in

00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:50,060
other ways I'm just another person here

00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:52,880
in the room who struggles to influence

00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:54,440
others sometimes navigate conflict to

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,800
get people to work together productively

00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,270
especially a red hat so one of the

00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,580
things I love most about speaking on

00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:02,810
this topic in particular is I take so

00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,150
much away from the questions that people

00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:07,130
ask the stories they tell the examples

00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:08,539
they give it what works for them and so

00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:10,849
we're gonna leave a lot of time for Q&A

00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:12,710
at the end let's use that not just to

00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:14,419
ask questions but Sheriff you've seen

00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:16,130
something work well if you see somebody

00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:18,220
who does something and you're like wow

00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:19,570
people listen when they do that

00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,100
about it we can put our heads together

00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:24,670
figure out why does it work what could

00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:26,800
we learn from it alright

00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:28,570
raise your hand if you ever thought if I

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,770
are in charge around here

00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:35,680
things would be different Matthew Goss

00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:37,690
is that not nice yeah I used to think

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,790
that too we all want to be the person

00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:41,800
who has the authority right the one to

00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:44,320
make the decisions or at least we think

00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,090
we do the truth is though if you sit

00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,430
down and you talk to most of our project

00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:50,170
leaders say Matthew Miller down front

00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:52,780
here they will tell you having that

00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:55,690
official leader title doesn't really get

00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:57,700
them as far as you would think so lately

00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:59,830
my day job has gone from being somebody

00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:02,020
who influences project leaders and

00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:04,510
decision makers to actually leading some

00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,830
pretty high profile culture projects

00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:08,320
with hundreds thousands of participants

00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:10,300
and making decisions that impact other

00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,520
people and I work on stuff where there

00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:15,010
is no shortage of egos or strong

00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:17,050
opinions right people have very deeply

00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:18,580
held beliefs about what is right what is

00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,830
wrong what should the culture look like

00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:22,720
how do we best scale it how we need to

00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:24,490
change it right and just because I'm the

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,020
project leader doesn't mean that people

00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:28,000
are automatically gonna buy into what I

00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:30,400
think we should do usually they don't I

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,169
have to bridge really big gaps in

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,640
understanding and I have to help people

00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:35,890
who sometimes don't like each other very

00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,810
much listen to each other respect each

00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:39,250
other's point of view consider it right

00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:40,780
I have to make choices at the end of

00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,070
these huge arguments about what's gonna

00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:44,169
happen and then I have to win everybody

00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:45,400
over at least to some degree so they

00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:48,520
don't stand in the way of us moving

00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:50,169
forward it's not an easy job and what

00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,600
all of that has taught me is that

00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:55,570
leadership is not really something

00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:58,000
you're appointed to it's finding the

00:07:55,570 --> 00:08:00,370
courage and having the skills in

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,800
difficult moments to use your voice and

00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:06,340
to act in ways that influence people and

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,419
nudge them along a different path so

00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,220
today we're going to take a look at

00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:11,380
three specific scenarios many people

00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,729
encounter where if you are like most

00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:15,820
people you're gonna find yourself

00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:17,080
wanting to speak up change something and

00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,820
if you're like most people when you've

00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:21,640
tried to do that probably haven't had as

00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:23,140
much success as you want to so scenario

00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,850
number one I have an idea

00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:27,640
things could be so much better if people

00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:29,740
would just make a few simple changes

00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:31,019
show of hands who has seen this and

00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,870
wanted to speak up

00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:36,430
okay keep your hand up if you spoke up

00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:39,219
keep your hand up people listened to

00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:40,870
your point of view keep your hand up if

00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:43,000
they made some of those simple changes

00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:45,069
and things turned out better yeah a lot

00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,949
of hands still up scenario number two

00:08:45,069 --> 00:08:49,120
something is horribly broken and bad

00:08:47,949 --> 00:08:49,660
things will happen if we don't do

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,040
something

00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,639
show of hands who's seen this and want

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:57,189
to speak up more hands surprise surprise

00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:58,750
keep your hand up if you spoke up keep

00:08:57,189 --> 00:09:01,149
your hand up if people listen to your

00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:03,370
point of view keep your hand up if they

00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:06,459
made if they solve the problem one way

00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:07,449
or another keep your hand up if they

00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:10,360
solve it the way you wanted them to

00:09:07,449 --> 00:09:12,689
solve it still a couple hands left not

00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:15,879
too many okay scenario number three

00:09:12,689 --> 00:09:17,889
someone is behaving very badly and we're

00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:19,689
gonna lose good contributors if this

00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:21,910
continues show of hands who has seen

00:09:19,689 --> 00:09:24,129
this and wanted to speak up it's always

00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:25,480
my biggest number of hands okay keep

00:09:24,129 --> 00:09:29,439
your hand if you spoke up keep it up

00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:34,420
keep your hand up if the person stopped

00:09:29,439 --> 00:09:35,920
behaving badly in response okay we gotta

00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:38,110
like - that's good it's about I'm not

00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,480
better than zero so what I hope that

00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:43,240
shows you is that one it is possible to

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,009
influence change in a community right

00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:48,519
many of us in the room have done it at

00:09:45,009 --> 00:09:52,180
one point or another and - it's not easy

00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:53,920
and sometimes we don't even know why we

00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:55,120
were successful or why we weren't right

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,579
sometimes it just feels sort of like

00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,899
accident it worked or it doesn't work so

00:09:57,579 --> 00:10:00,970
that's why this conversation day is

00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:02,920
really helpful to have because if you

00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:06,220
can find techniques that are not just

00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:07,629
successful but also repeatable then you

00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:09,990
can begin to build the kind of influence

00:10:07,629 --> 00:10:12,850
you want to have

00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:15,070
okay think about someone in one of your

00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:18,339
projects who you and lots of other

00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:20,860
people really respect and listen to what

00:10:18,339 --> 00:10:22,000
makes them different from other people

00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:25,390
in the community why do you listen to

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
them there are some obvious reasons you

00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:30,670
might listen to someone maybe because

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,350
they're brilliant right they know what

00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:34,959
they're talking about it's a big one we

00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:38,620
generally listen to people like that or

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:40,600
maybe they're competent they have skills

00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:42,820
you respect skills you wish you had

00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,730
right when they speak you know it's from

00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,899
a place of really really good experience

00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:49,810
most of us can't help but listen to

00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:52,350
people like that but what about the

00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:55,060
other people who you listen and respect

00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:56,980
the ones who aren't exceptionally smart

00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:58,570
they're not exceptionally skilled right

00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:00,720
they're not the geniuses among us there

00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:03,670
just reasonably smart reasonably skilled

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:06,970
fairly typical people and yet when you

00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:10,649
speak when they speak people listen you

00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:10,649
listen why

00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:18,660
so in addition to the basic stuff like

00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:20,370
being competent and knowledgeable there

00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:23,010
are some less obvious things that

00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:25,020
influential people do well sometimes

00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:26,550
these things can actually make up for

00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:28,590
what you might lack in knowledge or

00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:31,110
skills or experience right you may not

00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:32,940
have a track record of having success in

00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:34,800
a community for people to trust you so

00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,390
there are ways that you can influence

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,080
others right so highly influential

00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:39,050
people

00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,250
number one they show that they listen

00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:43,080
especially before they speak right it's

00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,790
a signal of respect you can tell they're

00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:47,370
listening they're open to what I have to

00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:48,960
say number two they show that they

00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:51,530
believe you're intelligent you're

00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:54,270
competent you have good intentions

00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:56,190
number three is they show that they care

00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:58,260
about many of the same things that you

00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:59,990
care about right there's common ground

00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:02,220
you have a reason to listen to that

00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:05,010
number four is they show that they're

00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:07,320
open to many possible ways to solve a

00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:09,120
problem and they stay focused on the big

00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,970
picture right they don't narrow in on

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,560
just one tiny piece of it and number

00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:16,320
five they're really really influential

00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:18,180
people they help you see a world where

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,650
things are different and better right

00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:22,290
they help you see something that you

00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:23,730
maybe didn't see was possible before so

00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:25,380
guess what if you want to be an

00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:27,840
influential person you don't have to be

00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:30,300
exceptionally smart or exceptionally

00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:32,220
skilled all it really takes is to do

00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,830
these kinds of things and to do them

00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:36,390
well it's not easy right some of these

00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:38,640
things might require some pretty big

00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:41,180
shifts and how you think so you can act

00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,180
in these ways

00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:45,740
now I know what some of you were

00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:47,690
thinking hold up in this just about

00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:50,990
being emotionally intelligent

00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:52,579
I actually know I am one of the least

00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:53,149
emotionally intelligent people you'll

00:12:52,579 --> 00:12:55,579
ever meet

00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:58,430
I'm serious my default setting is to be

00:12:55,579 --> 00:13:00,170
very wary of emotions for years I looked

00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:02,300
at them very suspiciously they seemed

00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:05,449
illogical they were unpredictable don't

00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:07,579
like those things see one time I took

00:13:05,449 --> 00:13:09,889
this test part of that myers-briggs

00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:11,420
assessment right and you answer these 18

00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,860
questions understand how do you approach

00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:14,360
decisions how do you move through the

00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:16,699
world do you operate on more of a

00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,649
thinker paradigm like logic oriented

00:13:16,699 --> 00:13:20,930
rational or do you operate on more of a

00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:24,410
feeling paradigm relationship oriented

00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:27,230
emotional so I get my results back I'm

00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:31,300
all excited because guys look I have a

00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:34,040
feeling just one but isn't it cute

00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:36,079
that's progress for me so believe me

00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,660
when I tell you this stuff does not come

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:41,360
naturally or easily to me it required a

00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:43,610
huge change in my mindset required me to

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,170
think about people very differently to

00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:47,449
kind of respect people who previous I

00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:49,399
didn't respect if you ask anybody who

00:13:47,449 --> 00:13:50,990
worked with me five ten years ago and

00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:52,880
they still work with me today they will

00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:55,880
tell you I changed to a remarkable

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,470
extent it wasn't overnight I still don't

00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,779
pick up on the kind of cues that other

00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:01,759
people seem to read just effortlessly or

00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:04,160
instantly I'm guessing a lot of you

00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:06,800
probably don't either I remember working

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:09,259
with somebody who tended to shut down if

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,759
you criticize or ideas or you know kind

00:14:09,259 --> 00:14:14,420
of suggested how things might be done

00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:16,339
better just very quick to shut down we

00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,779
were wrapping up this event and we were

00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:19,850
like boxing up you know what was laughs

00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:20,990
and I kind of did my usual thing which

00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:22,819
just started running her through the

00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:24,350
mental list of here all the ways we

00:14:22,819 --> 00:14:26,240
could do better next time you know hear

00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:27,800
the little things that probably didn't

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,720
go so well while you change in the

00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,189
future and finally I just picked up on

00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,339
this signal that maybe wasn't a good

00:14:31,189 --> 00:14:35,750
time to offer her that feedback and so

00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:36,980
later on I said to her hey did you

00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,300
notice I'm really getting better about

00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,740
figuring out when you're not open to

00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,540
hearing my feedback and like saving it

00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:43,040
for a better time like after that event

00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,660
I noticed you weren't really responding

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,800
when I started telling you about all the

00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,770
things we could do better so I dropped

00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,490
it

00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:53,970
she looked at me for a very long moment

00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:58,290
and she said Rebecca you stopped talking

00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:59,670
because I walked away which upon further

00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:01,800
reflection was true but you know what I

00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:03,660
didn't follow her which previously I

00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:06,990
definitely would have so baby steps

00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:10,020
these things come little by little so

00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:11,730
why change it's hard and for me like I

00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:13,890
said it comes little by little trial and

00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:15,600
error a lot of mistakes not easy but

00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:17,520
I'll tell you there was one pivotal

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,180
moment that showed me changing the way I

00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:23,130
approach other people was worth doing I

00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:24,959
came out of a meeting and it was with

00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,310
another team they were sharing an idea

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,899
they had something they were working on

00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:29,430
and I thought it went pretty well

00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:32,160
you're not very calmly rationally

00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:33,180
pointed out every flaw with the idea all

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,370
the reasons why I was probably gonna

00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:37,230
fail gave him a very actionable list of

00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:39,180
things they could do to fix that and be

00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:42,540
successful it seemed like a pretty good

00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:45,320
conversation to me but as we left my

00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:48,779
manager said to me you know Rebecca

00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:50,640
you are really smart one of the smartest

00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:52,649
people I've ever worked with and that's

00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:55,320
taking you really far because nine times

00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:57,839
out of ten you're right the things you

00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:59,520
point out you're right about them but

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,940
you're reaching the point in the things

00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:04,529
you're working on where it really

00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:06,120
doesn't matter anymore how smart you are

00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:08,420
or how right you are

00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:12,640
if people don't want to work with you if

00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:14,990
they feel like you don't respect them

00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:17,000
and it was the first time it ever really

00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:19,339
occurred to me that the relationship

00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,450
with other people could impact whether

00:16:19,339 --> 00:16:21,350
they want to work with me like who

00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:23,870
doesn't want to work with somebody who's

00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:26,930
right that what matters isn't right

00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:30,110
enough no apparently it's not for a lot

00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:33,110
of people what I came to see was that my

00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:35,570
default mode of approaching other people

00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:38,060
approaching their work was to approach

00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:41,390
it from a place of judgment rather than

00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:43,220
curiosity I spoke before I listened I

00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:45,080
assumed they probably weren't as smart

00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:47,029
as me they probably weren't as good at

00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,620
what they did as I was and they probably

00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:50,839
had some kind of agenda right that was

00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:52,790
driving what they wanted to do and even

00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:53,959
recognized that was how I thought you

00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:56,180
know you don't sit down and think is

00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:57,320
this the way I think let alone I didn't

00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:00,290
recognize that was how I showed up to

00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:01,940
other people I made it really hard for

00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:04,819
them to listen to me even when I was

00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:06,589
right I was kind of getting in my own

00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:08,959
way there was just this layer of pride

00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:10,610
and judgment and superiority that I was

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,040
heaping on top of everything I said

00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:16,520
without realizing it and I actually was

00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:19,100
limiting my own impact because the way

00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:22,400
that I communicated even when I was

00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:24,800
right meant that only the most mature

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,449
and patient people were willing to look

00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:30,140
past that stuff to hear what I had to

00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:32,630
say really tough moment and I share this

00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:35,150
with you because many of us show up that

00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:37,220
way without meaning to right when you

00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:39,380
are really good at spotting what's wrong

00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:40,880
with stuff it's hard not to show up that

00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:42,290
way and you want to help you have good

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,700
intentions for doing that right you just

00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:44,780
don't want it to fail it's the only

00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,440
reason you're saying out you're trying

00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,240
to be helpful

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,780
you appreciate when somebody gives you

00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:52,460
that feedback right I get it

00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:55,340
thing is a lot of us are really good at

00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:57,260
spotting problems it's just for much

00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:59,630
better at spotting the problems and

00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:02,179
actually fixing them if there are other

00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:05,300
humans involved to get the things fixed

00:18:02,179 --> 00:18:08,059
and so if I can make that shift in

00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:09,200
mindset and behavior anybody can let's

00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:11,230
take a look at what it looks like in

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,029
those scenarios we talked about

00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:15,340
okay so let's talk about scenario number

00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:16,750
one you have an idea for a way something

00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:18,279
could be much better you know in the

00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,779
community but you're gonna need help

00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:22,269
from other people to actually make it

00:18:19,779 --> 00:18:27,669
happen so these conversations from what

00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:31,360
I've observed often start like this what

00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:34,269
this project really needs is well why

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,789
don't you just or that's such a great

00:18:34,269 --> 00:18:38,860
idea we'd be foolish not to right and

00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:40,659
these kinds of openings they have some

00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:43,419
underlying assumptions that are just not

00:18:40,659 --> 00:18:45,309
very helpful they assume right when I

00:18:43,419 --> 00:18:47,019
speak like this I assume nobody's ever

00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:50,409
thought about or suggested this idea

00:18:47,019 --> 00:18:53,919
before usually false I also assume it's

00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:56,490
simple also usually false I also assume

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:59,919
this idea is really special and unique

00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:02,049
also usually false the reality is most

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,149
ideas that come up in a community have

00:19:02,049 --> 00:19:05,830
been suggested before right this is a

00:19:04,149 --> 00:19:08,049
big project we've a lot of people been

00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:10,419
around for a long time and most of those

00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:12,970
ideas are a lot more complicated and

00:19:10,419 --> 00:19:15,639
time-consuming than they sound on the

00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:17,980
surface there's no shortage of great

00:19:15,639 --> 00:19:20,200
ideas but we can't chase them all right

00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:21,789
communities have to focus so it's not a

00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,519
question of whether it's a good idea

00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:26,860
it's a question of which great ideas are

00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:28,299
the best ones to go after which are the

00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:30,639
ones we can get momentum behind and

00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:31,960
actually turn into reality so if you

00:19:30,639 --> 00:19:34,690
want to get people to pay attention to

00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:36,159
your idea help you make it happen you

00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,720
need some powerful influencing skills

00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:40,980
right you need to build that momentum

00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:43,690
you need smarter ways of communicating

00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:45,669
all right so remember those five things

00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:47,769
influential people do well spoiler alert

00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:51,100
you can turn those into strategies right

00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:52,779
things you can apply so you can show

00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:55,600
that you listen especially before you

00:19:52,779 --> 00:19:57,940
speak you can show you believe others

00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,669
are intelligent competent have good

00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:02,740
intentions you can show that you care

00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:04,039
about many of the same things they care

00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:06,619
about

00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:08,359
you can show that you are open to many

00:20:06,619 --> 00:20:10,700
possible solutions that you're focused

00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:12,200
on the big picture and you can help

00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,989
other people see a world where things

00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,399
are different better so a really easy

00:20:14,989 --> 00:20:18,950
way to show that you listen before you

00:20:16,399 --> 00:20:21,080
speak is to present your ideas in a way

00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:23,539
that offers others to share what they

00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:26,600
know what they see for example you could

00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:29,570
say I have an idea I'd like to hear your

00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,580
thoughts on I've noticed blank it seems

00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:33,559
to me that if we did blank and blank we

00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:36,769
might get better results has this been

00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:38,779
proposed or tried before this often

00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:42,379
yields very valuable information that

00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:43,849
can then inform what do you say next so

00:20:42,379 --> 00:20:46,099
first and foremost if you want to sell

00:20:43,849 --> 00:20:47,899
an idea you need to carefully listen to

00:20:46,099 --> 00:20:49,639
the feedback you get and you've got to

00:20:47,899 --> 00:20:50,960
show that you're listening because if

00:20:49,639 --> 00:20:52,489
people don't think you're listening it's

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,009
really hard for them to say yes I'm on

00:20:52,489 --> 00:20:56,989
board right so you do this by adapting

00:20:55,009 --> 00:20:58,460
your idea based on what you learn so

00:20:56,989 --> 00:21:00,379
instead of saying something like well

00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:02,840
why don't we just you can apply those

00:21:00,379 --> 00:21:05,779
strategies so it might sound more like

00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:08,479
this you know originally I thought that

00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:11,239
we should do blank but based on talking

00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:13,190
with so-and-so so-and-so I realized it

00:21:11,239 --> 00:21:15,590
might be better to do blank instead what

00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:17,629
are your thoughts on that approach this

00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:19,190
shows that you're open to many possible

00:21:17,629 --> 00:21:20,479
solutions you're focused on the big

00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:22,129
picture putting something in place

00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:24,559
that's going to be helpful to the

00:21:22,129 --> 00:21:26,330
project not just to you right and the

00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,429
more that you can pull in people's input

00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:30,229
the more you can adapt your idea to

00:21:28,429 --> 00:21:32,029
solve not just that original problem you

00:21:30,229 --> 00:21:34,159
saw but related problems that other

00:21:32,029 --> 00:21:35,509
people are struggling with you begin to

00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,889
help everybody see a world where things

00:21:35,509 --> 00:21:39,169
could be different where they could be

00:21:36,889 --> 00:21:41,090
better and you get support for your idea

00:21:39,169 --> 00:21:43,190
right which by the way is probably a

00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:45,109
different a better idea than what you

00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:47,539
started with because it's not just yours

00:21:45,109 --> 00:21:49,849
anymore all right let's talk about

00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:51,679
scenario number two something is

00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:53,960
horribly broken and bad things will

00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,909
happen if we don't do something maybe

00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,799
there's a technical cloud of doom

00:21:55,909 --> 00:21:59,149
looming on the horizon and no one's

00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:01,009
doing anything to prepare for it and

00:21:59,149 --> 00:22:04,429
soon destruction will be raining down

00:22:01,009 --> 00:22:06,919
upon us all maybe somebody is neglecting

00:22:04,429 --> 00:22:08,059
something they're responsible for and it

00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:10,519
doesn't make the community look good

00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:12,859
right this scenario can take many many

00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:15,030
different forms so here's a typical

00:22:12,859 --> 00:22:17,400
message that people send when they

00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:19,200
counter this situation something is

00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,910
horribly broken and I've been telling

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,980
everyone for a while now and no one's

00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:24,300
listening and some vague and probably

00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,890
worst case scenario bad things will

00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:28,980
happen if you don't implement this

00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:31,820
specific fix raise your hand if you've

00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:34,620
ever sent a message similar to this one

00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:36,000
yeah I used to send a lot of messages

00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,800
like these just not a lot of time

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,130
writing them we're not usually real

00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:42,930
effective but anybody ever received a

00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:45,120
message that felt a lot like this one oh

00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:48,690
how funny more of us have received them

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:50,280
and send them okay well for me when I

00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:51,750
get a message that feels like this and I

00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:54,150
got a lot of messages like this these

00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:55,800
days the longer you build stuff the more

00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:59,130
messages you get that sound like this

00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:01,650
right my reaction I have to admit like

00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:04,230
my gut initial first reaction is to kind

00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:06,420
of feel like well yeah I've heard you

00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:08,160
saying that and yeah I really do need to

00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:10,410
do something about that right there's

00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:12,900
some truth in what you're saying but

00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:15,330
bigger problems is all in that worst

00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,980
case scenario I mean it could happen but

00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:17,910
it's not super likely it's probably not

00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,680
gonna happen before I get around to

00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:20,880
fixing it and the solution you're

00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,200
suggesting just gonna create all these

00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,970
new problems right that's not the answer

00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,170
at some point I'm gonna get to it but

00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:26,820
it's just not not important right now

00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:28,290
and if it was out easy to fix I would

00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:30,000
have fixed it a long time ago I got lots

00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:32,250
other stuff I need to work on right my

00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,480
defenses go up my resistance through

00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:35,220
what you're having to say goes up

00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:37,020
doesn't put me in the right state of

00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:39,000
mind and I have to work hard as the

00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:41,520
recipient of a message like this to

00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,960
overcome that it makes it difficult for

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,210
me to actually hear what you're saying

00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,700
because my instant reaction is hold up

00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:49,200
you don't know what you're talking about

00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:50,790
five years ago that's pretty much the

00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,440
kind of message I would have sent and I

00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:54,390
probably would have felt so frustrated

00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:56,340
at the response I got back right why

00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:58,260
don't people care as much as I care so

00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:00,810
what I would have thought what I didn't

00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:04,110
see at that point was there is a lot of

00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:06,360
judgment and pride in a message like

00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:08,790
this there's a lot of assumptions that I

00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:10,680
know more about the situation I care

00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:12,630
more about the situation than the person

00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:14,670
who's receiving this that's a big

00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:16,080
assumption for me to make it's an

00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:17,640
assumption that puts people on the

00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,970
defensive

00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:22,650
so fast-forward 5-10 years and a whole

00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:24,510
lot of not very productive conversations

00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:25,650
later it's very different kind of

00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:28,350
message that I would send today

00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:30,179
something much closer to what I'm gonna

00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:33,150
show you especially if it was somebody

00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:34,200
who I didn't know well it's also the

00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:36,150
kind of message I appreciate receiving

00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,190
from a stranger by the way when it's my

00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:40,049
thing that's horribly broken so I

00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:42,120
brought this up a few times I don't seem

00:24:40,049 --> 00:24:43,620
to be getting anywhere I'm concerned

00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,240
about the thing that's broken because

00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:47,910
from what I can tell it appears that

00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:50,070
specific bad things could happen in the

00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:52,290
worst-case scenario really bad thing

00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:55,020
could happen I have some ideas for how

00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:56,220
to fix this such as specific fix but

00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,990
there probably other factors I'm not

00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:00,419
aware of is this something you've looked

00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:03,120
into should I be concerned about it are

00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:05,910
you when you send a message like this

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:08,000
you signal a lot of important things you

00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:09,929
signal that you listen before you speak

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,580
that you think the other person is

00:25:09,929 --> 00:25:13,200
intelligent competent they have good

00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:14,820
intentions that care about the same

00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,559
kinds of things you care about and that

00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:17,190
you're interested in hearing their

00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,049
perspective

00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:20,850
it also shows you're open to many

00:25:19,049 --> 00:25:22,260
possible ways of solving this right you

00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:24,570
care about the big picture putting a

00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:25,799
good solution in place doesn't quite get

00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:26,970
you to a world where you see where

00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:28,970
things could be different and better but

00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:31,410
it's an opening to a good conversation

00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:33,360
or maybe you know the situation and the

00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:35,280
people involved well enough you don't

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,270
need to take that deferential of a tone

00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,500
right remember how I said in the

00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:38,910
beginning you're gonna have to adapt how

00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,980
you communicate based on who you're

00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:42,179
talking to who you are maybe there are

00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:44,040
parts of this problem that you are

00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:47,100
prepared you could help solve pieces of

00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:49,200
it you just need some help right so in

00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:51,510
that case you could be much more direct

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,150
in that conversation you might say a lot

00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:55,590
of those same things in the beginning

00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:57,450
but you might end it differently so you

00:25:55,590 --> 00:26:01,110
might say I have some ideas of how to

00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:02,610
fix this such as specific fix but are

00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:04,620
there other factors I should be aware of

00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:07,020
it seems I would need your help

00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:08,190
and perhaps support from so-and-so right

00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:10,200
I can kind of start that conversation

00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:11,940
because what I'm doing here is I'm

00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,230
showing I believe they're competent

00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,490
they're intelligent they have good

00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:16,530
intentions they want to fix this problem

00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:18,419
- all right I'm not assuming that

00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:19,500
there's you know no reason why they

00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:21,780
haven't fixed except that they don't

00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:24,570
care and I'm not taking their support

00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:26,280
for granted I respect their time I know

00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:27,870
that they care about many of the same

00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,750
things I care about and they have a lot

00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:31,670
of other things going on too

00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:33,500
so here's the thing I can't promise you

00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:36,170
that you're gonna get an instant yes

00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:38,810
when you send a message like this often

00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:41,810
you will many times you will but not

00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:43,240
always influence takes time right it

00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:45,110
takes more than one conversation

00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:47,480
especially for certain types of people

00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:48,860
right some people who are very resistant

00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,350
to change it's going to take more than

00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:54,650
one conversation and that's okay

00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:57,020
the key is to trust that your words are

00:26:54,650 --> 00:27:00,880
gonna permeate their sub conscience and

00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:06,290
reverberate inside their brain until I

00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:11,140
don't know one morning they just wake up

00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:11,140
and decide maybe they'll help after all

00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:17,120
all right scenario number three this is

00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:19,160
a tough one somebody in their community

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,810
is behaving very badly and you know

00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,280
you're gonna lose good contributors if

00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:25,190
this continues maybe you've already lost

00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:27,860
some maybe they are borderline abusive

00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:30,080
to people on your mailing list maybe

00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:33,380
they make comments or jokes that are

00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:35,630
sexist or racist or otherwise alienate

00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:37,370
people who are different from them maybe

00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:39,580
they're rude to somebody who's new and

00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:41,810
tries to contribute or asks for help

00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:43,400
maybe they're impatient or they're

00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:44,570
unkind when somebody's speaking in a

00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,840
second language and they don't use

00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:49,340
exactly the right words right

00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:52,580
fortunately some people do speak up in

00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:59,660
that moment they'll say things like wow

00:27:52,580 --> 00:28:01,400
just wow or could you just want or and

00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:04,640
people wonder why we don't have many new

00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:06,460
contributors all right I can't believe

00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,140
what I just read

00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:11,090
unfortunately what usually happens when

00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:13,610
we send messages like these is that the

00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:16,580
person who's behaving badly often gets

00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:19,460
defensive and sometimes they escalate

00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:20,780
the bad behavior in response right not

00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:24,560
really what we want to see happen

00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:26,750
that's probably why in those moments one

00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:30,169
of the most common things you see is

00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:33,350
just silence

00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:38,779
people are really uncomfortable but we

00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:41,149
say nothing I know that when I've been

00:28:38,779 --> 00:28:43,190
silent it was because I wasn't really

00:28:41,149 --> 00:28:45,409
sure how to speak up without making

00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:47,440
things worse right I didn't want to make

00:28:45,409 --> 00:28:50,659
what already looked like a bad situation

00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:52,580
spiral further downhill and I want to be

00:28:50,659 --> 00:28:54,679
clear here saying something even the

00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:57,070
wrong thing even not the ideal thing is

00:28:54,679 --> 00:29:00,440
almost always better than saying nothing

00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:03,619
because if people see bad behavior go

00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:05,840
unaddressed that's a real problem in any

00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:07,489
community in any organization right it

00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:10,340
becomes a cancer that kind of eats you

00:29:07,489 --> 00:29:12,769
from inside it's not good it leads to

00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:14,629
continued bad behavior and worsened

00:29:12,769 --> 00:29:16,759
behavior leads to an environment none of

00:29:14,629 --> 00:29:20,149
us want to be a part of it costs you

00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:23,299
good contributors but I've also observed

00:29:20,149 --> 00:29:27,710
that when communities just call out that

00:29:23,299 --> 00:29:31,070
behavior like this does here it often

00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:35,899
leads to drama conflict minimal change

00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:38,210
right it just gets yucky and messy and

00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:40,070
that's not ideal the thing is that stuff

00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:41,509
involves judgment calls right not

00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:43,789
everybody's gonna agree on the line

00:29:41,509 --> 00:29:46,009
between reasonable and unreasonable you

00:29:43,789 --> 00:29:47,480
may not always agree somebody may tell

00:29:46,009 --> 00:29:48,470
you at some point hey what you said I

00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,850
just don't think you should say

00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:51,169
something like that and you might be

00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:53,029
flabbergasted right like what's wrong

00:29:51,169 --> 00:29:55,759
with what I said it's not a good feeling

00:29:53,029 --> 00:29:57,649
in the moment and so the last thing you

00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:59,749
want to do is get into some kind of

00:29:57,649 --> 00:30:01,789
emotional debate about whose opinion is

00:29:59,749 --> 00:30:04,730
right that does not lead people to

00:30:01,789 --> 00:30:06,889
change their behavior typically if the

00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:09,470
way you respond to this kind of stuff

00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:12,019
leads people to feel ashamed or

00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:13,820
humiliated for having messed up right if

00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:18,889
they feel sort of publicly shamed for it

00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:20,980
they might feel good but watch out as an

00:30:18,889 --> 00:30:25,519
observer of people I can tell you that

00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:27,139
those angry emotions a defensive

00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:28,730
response you get it might feel

00:30:27,139 --> 00:30:30,049
irrational right that's how many of us

00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:31,970
respond in the moment we think well

00:30:30,049 --> 00:30:34,660
they're being very irrational I was just

00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:37,059
telling them they're wrong but

00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:38,890
it's also extremely predictable I can

00:30:37,059 --> 00:30:40,240
tell you without a doubt if you say

00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:41,679
these things that is probably what will

00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,110
happen next right it happens over and

00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,450
over again there is a logic a pattern to

00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:48,520
emotions there's a predictability to

00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:50,500
them you watch you can say if a then B

00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:52,630
is probably what happens next I might

00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:55,799
not understand why but it does

00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:58,750
and the more anger or shame enters a

00:30:55,799 --> 00:31:00,850
conversation the more everybody involved

00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:03,400
starts to feel misunderstood the more

00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:05,500
they dig in their heels and resist what

00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:08,470
you're trying to say and the more they

00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:09,940
refuse to budge it's often the moment in

00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:12,490
these conversations when it gets really

00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:14,679
ugly that most of us just check out

00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:16,419
right we're just like I'm done this is

00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:19,030
overwhelming it's not productive I've

00:31:16,419 --> 00:31:21,190
got nothing to do here and so my

00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:23,950
challenge to you and you know I spend a

00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:25,870
lot of time on this one my challenge to

00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:29,590
you is this when you see bad behavior

00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:31,720
don't check out one of the values of the

00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:34,929
Fedora project is the idea that we are a

00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:36,909
community of friends we should treat

00:31:34,929 --> 00:31:39,340
each other like friends do right there's

00:31:36,909 --> 00:31:43,559
a code of conduct very simple rules we

00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:47,140
consider it be respectful and for me

00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:49,240
absolute worst moment in any community

00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:50,650
is when somebody is behaving badly

00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:56,080
toward others when they're hurting

00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:57,669
people and no one says anything oh my

00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:01,450
god Martin Luther King quote on you here

00:31:57,669 --> 00:32:03,850
right in the end it's not the words of

00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:06,789
our enemies that we remember it's the

00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:09,190
silence of our friends so I promise you

00:32:06,789 --> 00:32:11,980
there are ways you can respond that will

00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:13,539
not just call out bad behavior but also

00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:15,250
stand a really good chance of getting

00:32:13,539 --> 00:32:18,280
that person to change their behavior for

00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:20,770
the better two strategies in particular

00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:23,770
call people up instead of calling them

00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:26,020
out and demonstrate good behavior so

00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:27,850
let's say somebody is rude to a new

00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:29,710
contributor right they're frustrated

00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:31,840
they didn't follow the rules to submit a

00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:33,250
patch they're asking dumb questions

00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,630
they're doing those things that new

00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:37,360
people do right that we all did when we

00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:38,860
were new to you could absolutely call

00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,450
out that old timer for that behavior

00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:42,320
right that'd be better than saying

00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:46,039
nothing say hey come on

00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:48,440
but as we've said shaming somebody very

00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:50,389
rarely leads to better behavior you have

00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,950
to be a pretty mature individual to

00:32:50,389 --> 00:32:53,360
overcome that feeling and say you're

00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:55,880
right I was wrong I'll do better

00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:58,159
let's not expect everybody to be that

00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:00,649
mature because they're not instead of

00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:03,080
calling them out call them up to a

00:33:00,649 --> 00:33:05,690
higher standard to what you want them to

00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:07,880
be demonstrate what good behavior looks

00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:10,370
like in a way that shows them you know

00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:12,679
they're capable of being better so for

00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:15,230
example you could completely ignore the

00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:16,820
response they made to that newcomer you

00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:19,700
could say in the newcomer in front of

00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:21,590
everybody hey welcome to the project it

00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:23,090
can be really confusing to figure out

00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:25,190
how to best contribute around here

00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:27,649
I'd suggest following these five steps

00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:29,000
right or we put together this page for

00:33:27,649 --> 00:33:30,889
new contributors to help you find your

00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,090
way not every project has these you

00:33:30,889 --> 00:33:34,279
probably didn't even know to look for it

00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:36,200
but I think you'll find it helpful right

00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:38,809
a response like that reminds everybody

00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:40,159
there it's not that hard it's not that

00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:42,289
time-consuming to be gracious to

00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:44,029
newcomers and it reminds them it's

00:33:42,289 --> 00:33:45,470
confusing to find your way in a new

00:33:44,029 --> 00:33:48,100
community right we were all new once

00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:50,990
it's not easy to find your way around

00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:53,899
two more strategies provide a positive

00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:55,340
intention it may not be obvious from

00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:57,409
whatever you're looking at but this

00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:59,840
person who is behaving badly there's

00:33:57,409 --> 00:34:01,610
probably some suspicion you have of a

00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,679
good reason why they might do this and

00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:06,559
if you can't just come up with one why

00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:08,629
might possibly they be doing this and

00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:10,220
focus on the problem not in the person

00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:12,649
so let's say you get one of those long

00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:15,139
angry rant emails like we saw back in

00:34:12,649 --> 00:34:16,849
situation number two from somebody right

00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:18,349
there's a little bit of helpful truth in

00:34:16,849 --> 00:34:20,089
it and a whole lot of not real helpful

00:34:18,349 --> 00:34:22,819
and mostly frustrated stuff heaped on

00:34:20,089 --> 00:34:24,440
top some of that behavior that you see

00:34:22,819 --> 00:34:26,119
right you know it's gonna trigger flames

00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:28,010
people are just going to respond to that

00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:30,260
how wouldn't they it's really easy to

00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:32,569
but here again you can call that person

00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:34,609
up instead of calling them out you can

00:34:32,569 --> 00:34:36,950
demonstrate good behavior and you can

00:34:34,609 --> 00:34:38,540
find some tiny positive intention in

00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:40,550
their email and bring that to the

00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:43,250
forefront so you could say something

00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:45,470
like hey seems like you're trying to

00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:47,540
make us aware of one issue that was

00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:48,859
somewhere in that email to prevent some

00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:50,389
bad thing from happening right I can

00:34:48,859 --> 00:34:52,250
probably guess there's some piece of

00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:53,880
this I can pull the forefront is that

00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:56,040
your intention here

00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:57,660
that's getting lost in your message plus

00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:59,490
some of the details aren't quite right

00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:01,860
so it makes it hard to respond in a

00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:03,480
productive way if you focus on the

00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:05,130
problem that needs to be solved not the

00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,830
person who's doing a poor job of

00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:09,990
expressing the problem you find it

00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:11,580
really really works right head off some

00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:12,930
of the negative responses that you know

00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:14,130
they're probably already getting from

00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:15,540
other people you don't even have to read

00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:16,830
down you can read that first message and

00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:19,230
you know where it's gonna go right we

00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:21,750
all do it's the one where you go oh boy

00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:23,190
here we go help them identify them focus

00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:24,330
on what is the real issue they're

00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:26,220
actually trying to bring to the

00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:29,610
community here help them shift their

00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:31,140
behavior to a more productive place all

00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:33,990
right one last strategy it can be

00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:37,140
tremendously affect 'fl tremendously

00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:39,900
effective so if your community such as

00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:42,360
Fedora has behavior guidelines or a

00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:44,610
conduct that's being violated here

00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:46,740
there's a really easy way to deal with

00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:48,720
this point to the guidelines the reasons

00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:50,610
for the guidelines and do it in a way

00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,620
that calls everybody up to that standard

00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:56,250
because you know how it goes

00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:58,410
soon as one person breaks the rule five

00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:59,940
angry people break it in response right

00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:02,490
in the way that they respond back so if

00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:04,320
our rule is be courteous if I am

00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:06,030
discourteous and that's how I start this

00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,790
what does everybody do right back to me

00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:10,830
the same exact thing yeah we know how it

00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:12,060
goes it's human nature I guess and the

00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:15,330
whole community descends into chaos

00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:19,200
right in that moment so you could say

00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:20,880
something like howdy you might say that

00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,220
if you're from Texas you watch a lot of

00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,170
John Wayne movies stay with me our

00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:27,180
community has behavior guidelines to

00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:28,950
ensure that in tough moments we all

00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:31,290
still work together productively we

00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:32,850
don't alienate each other in particular

00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:35,700
number four is be courteous and

00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:37,260
respectful in my opinion the first

00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:39,120
message in this thread and some of the

00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:41,580
replies don't meet that standard we can

00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:44,430
do better I don't have to be an official

00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:46,440
community moderator or authority to say

00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:48,450
something like this because I'm pointing

00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,190
to something official and I'm being

00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:52,800
clear it's my opinion right

00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:54,690
you can argue if you want I'm also being

00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,550
consistent I'm not calling out just the

00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:58,080
person who I think started it right we

00:36:56,550 --> 00:37:00,020
all have a responsibility to follow the

00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:02,000
guidelines even when other people don't

00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:03,440
and I'm pointing to that guideline not

00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,570
to the individual so it doesn't feel

00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,220
personal at least as personal as it

00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:09,560
would is if I said hey you are not

00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:11,540
following the guidelines this works

00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:13,760
really surprisingly well I'll tell you

00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:15,200
times when I have done this I'm amazed

00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,360
to see what happens people will argue

00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,400
back and forth before about like is what

00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:21,110
I said okay is it not and as soon as you

00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:23,060
say hey we have Community Guidelines in

00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:25,880
one of them is be courteous then people

00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:27,260
are like okay so off list I'm not sure

00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,670
it actually wasn't courteous but I don't

00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:30,110
want to argue on list because I see that

00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:31,550
we have guidelines right it's like

00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:34,640
there's magic and it's written on a

00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:35,990
piece of paper somewhere therefore even

00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,270
if I'm gonna argue I'm gonna do it in a

00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:41,480
more careful way so use that to your

00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:43,100
advantage all right now if you don't

00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,960
have a code of conduct right many of the

00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:47,450
communities and projects we work in just

00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,220
don't or it doesn't really have the

00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:50,840
kinds of guidelines that deal with the

00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:52,540
situation you're looking at so they

00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:54,500
haven't actually violated a guideline

00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:57,650
then it's a little bit different right

00:37:54,500 --> 00:38:00,619
you have to tread more carefully and

00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:02,869
what I find usually works is to focus on

00:38:00,619 --> 00:38:06,200
the impact the behavior has had on me

00:38:02,869 --> 00:38:08,600
personally so I say tread carefully

00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:10,310
because I found this funny thing some of

00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:12,740
the people who appeared to be the most

00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:16,670
insensitive right who say very

00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:17,840
insensitive things in fact the ones who

00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:19,190
tell it like it is

00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:21,200
they were often quite the opposite

00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:24,619
they're very sensitive people very

00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:27,230
defensive very explosive if they see

00:38:24,619 --> 00:38:28,730
they've upset somebody and it doesn't

00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:30,260
seem to make sense right that feels sort

00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:32,330
of hypocritical how can you be so

00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:34,010
insensitive and then be so sensitive but

00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:35,210
the answer is these are just people who

00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:37,520
are not good at regulating their

00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:39,050
emotions they are very uncomfortable

00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,790
when emotion enters the conversation

00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:42,950
because they have a difficult time when

00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:45,650
a motion enters their bodies I'm

00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:47,900
actually one of these people so I get it

00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:49,700
they often behave in very antisocial

00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:51,050
ways when they realize they've upset

00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:52,460
somebody they make the situation worse

00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:54,260
because they're just like I have to get

00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,920
out of this situation not comfortable

00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,810
what do I do

00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:58,880
so that's a big reason why I say tread

00:38:56,810 --> 00:39:02,290
carefully right you I don't care how

00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:06,500
blunt they are to you walk lightly here

00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:08,030
so what I try to do is I focus on the

00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:09,650
impact like I said are the specific

00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:10,530
behaviors had on me personally not the

00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:12,900
person

00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:14,640
the behavior itself and I try to show I

00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,830
have faith in the people in my community

00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:19,200
to care about that impact I trust them

00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:22,260
to do the right thing so I might say

00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:24,900
friends I love that we all communicate

00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:27,270
very casually on our mailing list I'm

00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:33,360
also deeply uncomfortable when that word

00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:35,210
is used here if you're feeling a little

00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:38,340
like I just left you hanging in the air

00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:40,580
that's intentional I'm not really giving

00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:43,110
you something to say yes or no to

00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:45,450
something to agree with or disagree with

00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:47,370
I'm just sharing the impact on me and

00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:50,040
let you sit with that it's an

00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:51,570
uncomfortable feeling right and you'll

00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:53,130
notice I made it about the person who

00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:55,140
did the behavior it's all about the

00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:57,840
action when that word is used here

00:39:55,140 --> 00:40:00,390
there's not even a noun the word is the

00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:03,420
noun not the person so this stuff is

00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:06,330
subtle but it makes a big difference in

00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:09,510
whether somebody feels shame bad about

00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:11,520
themselves or regret not about their

00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:13,560
behavior and in turn that makes a

00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,830
difference in how they respond they may

00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:19,230
not apologize a lot of times they won't

00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:21,540
but over time they almost always change

00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:23,550
their behavior because you've made it

00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:26,310
really uncomfortable for them to persist

00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:29,340
in it you've given them no real easy way

00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:32,780
to argue about it either they might tell

00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:35,010
you how you feel is not my problem

00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:39,039
sometimes people will do that not often

00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:41,989
but sometimes they will and guess what

00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:46,039
you don't have to attend every argument

00:40:41,989 --> 00:40:47,720
that you are invited to you can leave

00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:49,819
them sitting there with the

00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:53,989
uncomfortable weight of their own words

00:40:49,819 --> 00:40:55,749
and say nothing more and I promise you

00:40:53,989 --> 00:40:58,729
they will feel very uncomfortable

00:40:55,749 --> 00:41:01,039
because what they were hoping for was an

00:40:58,729 --> 00:41:02,779
escalated response they were hoping for

00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:05,420
a chance to argue and show you show you

00:41:02,779 --> 00:41:08,089
right I'm right you're wrong you're not

00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:09,680
giving it to them and what's very likely

00:41:08,089 --> 00:41:11,239
to happen too is that other people will

00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,339
speak up and say actually it's not just

00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:16,309
him it's not just her right I feel the

00:41:13,339 --> 00:41:19,400
same way right you can kind of let it be

00:41:16,309 --> 00:41:20,569
uncomfortable and often that's all it

00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:27,019
takes to nudge somebody in a better

00:41:20,569 --> 00:41:28,910
direction in the future okay

00:41:27,019 --> 00:41:30,799
so we've reached that portion of the

00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:33,979
talk where typically I give you partial

00:41:30,799 --> 00:41:36,680
and probably problematic answers to your

00:41:33,979 --> 00:41:38,660
extremely difficult questions so who has

00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:39,829
a question they would like to ask or

00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:43,099
even better who wants to make a comment

00:41:39,829 --> 00:41:46,039
share something they've seen elsewhere -

00:41:43,099 --> 00:41:47,420
over here okay I have to not run you the

00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:48,650
mic after a feature question so try to

00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:52,599
keep it short enough I can repeat it

00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:52,599
let's go Laura

00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:08,090
okay so the question was could be

00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:09,590
helpful for a first-time offender what

00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:11,900
do you do with the repeat offender who

00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:14,330
hasn't changed first thing I would say

00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:16,700
is try this stuff on them so if you've

00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:20,030
been addressing it in other ways try and

00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:21,560
see if you see something and they still

00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:22,640
do it so what if you try it and they

00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:25,220
still do it it's a good question

00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:27,650
I think it really depends on what we're

00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:29,630
talking about right I would anticipate

00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:32,390
with some people I would probably have

00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:34,910
to do this I'm going to do some of these

00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:37,430
five or six times before I really start

00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:39,560
to see something change I don't know

00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:40,550
it's a good question beyond that I mean

00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,960
I think it depends on what they're doing

00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:43,790
you're not gonna change everybody I'm

00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:46,340
gonna win everybody over

00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:48,830
I don't encounter very many people

00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:51,560
though I have to say even in a situation

00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:52,130
the company I work in which is we have

00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:55,730
all types

00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:58,610
I don't encounter very many people who

00:42:55,730 --> 00:43:02,150
just persist I mean there are a few but

00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:06,370
not many so I don't know I'm not sure

00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:06,370
what I would do would have other scene

00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:13,440
I don't know I usually just try to win

00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,720
them over I'm kind of stubborn though I

00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,130
kind of tell myself that like if I just

00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:19,500
stay in there and I keep being

00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:20,730
unfailingly persistent and polite that

00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:23,790
eventually they'll at least be

00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:25,740
embarrassed enough that they stop which

00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:27,060
is true because at some point they start

00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:29,450
to feel like boy I'm looking like a jerk

00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:32,310
here and they do kind of back down I

00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:34,100
don't know there are I mean there are

00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:37,470
always one or two who you don't win over

00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:40,370
maybe you let him go no good question

00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:40,370
over here

00:43:47,319 --> 00:43:52,750
personally I think that is about

00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:58,179
well

00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:58,179
[Music]

00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,619
and

00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:12,410
okay I'm going to try to repeat that one

00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:13,910
so the question is what do you do when

00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:15,620
you point to the guidelines and the

00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:16,280
person says well let's try to change the

00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:20,930
guidelines

00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:23,930
I guess you admire their gumption it's

00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:26,750
good start I would say well first of all

00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:27,950
is there a process in place to revisit

00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:29,360
those because sometimes it's a

00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:31,280
legitimate question right maybe the

00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:34,520
guideline isn't clear or maybe the

00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:37,480
guideline goes too far what I would say

00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:40,010
is probably something to the effect of

00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:43,520
if you feel like the guidelines are

00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:45,950
unfair or don't make sense here's where

00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:47,240
you can go to make that case but until

00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:48,500
they're changed they are the guidelines

00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:53,770
for the community and we expect

00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:53,770
everybody to follow them over here

00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:06,720
okay so the question was better on list

00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:11,010
or better off list better one-on-one or

00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:13,470
in public it's a good question I feel

00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:15,090
like I could make a case for both I

00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:17,100
think some of it depends on what are the

00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:18,870
norms in the place that you are working

00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:20,760
because there are definitely communities

00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:23,370
where taking something off list

00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:25,770
sometimes backfires right that's treated

00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:29,760
as some kind of negative back-channel

00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:31,230
thing so I would try to get a sense of

00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,200
you know depending on where you are I

00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:37,470
generally it just depends right if it's

00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:40,140
I think it's valuable to have record of

00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:42,150
conversations like these for the future

00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:43,830
so if you're trying to lead toward why

00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:45,540
or did we make this decision or didn't

00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:49,320
we it's helpful to have it on record but

00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:52,310
I think also sometimes see Matthews got

00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:54,120
wait I'm on turn to him sometimes when

00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:56,160
some of these conversations are better

00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:57,690
had offline - especially when it's

00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,280
involved somebody's behavior so I think

00:45:57,690 --> 00:46:00,480
it's important that something is said

00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:03,240
publicly if we're talking about

00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,710
specifically the behavior one I think

00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:06,060
it's important that something is said

00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:08,070
publicly because you don't want it to be

00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:09,720
seen as if nothing ever happened

00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:11,070
I've certainly seen communities where

00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:13,560
that's the case everything is handled

00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:15,450
back-channel and it looks to people like

00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:17,250
the guidelines are not enforced so

00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:19,350
something but you know you can sort of

00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:20,850
acknowledge let's talk offline if you

00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:23,460
feel differently about it but you know

00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:25,860
we'll have here's what the guideline is

00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:27,690
I think sometimes it's a judgment call

00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:31,200
and always make the right one Matthew

00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:32,490
what do you think yeah I think you kind

00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,990
of come around to it what I would say

00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:38,250
that sometimes it's not

00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:39,780
I used that we're responding up kind of

00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:41,700
thing on unlist all right I don't

00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:43,140
directly respond but I try and model

00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:45,180
what I would have said instead or

00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:47,570
another way to do it and then also I

00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:51,090
send a message to the person saying hey

00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:53,790
that really wasn't cool in a more

00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:56,400
personal thing so I don't call them out

00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:58,050
publicly but I also let them know that I

00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,060
saw their message it wasn't that I

00:46:58,050 --> 00:47:02,110
missed their message and just responded

00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:04,280
without noticing

00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:05,750
yeah it's a really good technique the

00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:07,070
other thing you can do is you can say if

00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:09,410
we're talking about behavior stuff you

00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:11,030
can say you know reminder to everybody

00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:13,070
we have behavior guidelines here's what

00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:17,080
they are and then maybe you address the

00:47:13,070 --> 00:47:17,080
specifics off list over here

00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:46,850
okay so what to do when the concept of

00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:49,640
friends becomes I backup my friends who

00:47:46,850 --> 00:47:51,350
behave poorly it's a good question we do

00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:52,940
see that a lot in communities right

00:47:51,350 --> 00:47:55,220
especially if it's people who are

00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:56,900
long-standing contributors sometimes we

00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:59,300
give them a pass on things that other

00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:01,670
people couldn't get away with sometimes

00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:03,260
we even support what they're doing and I

00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:05,840
will say - this can take other forms

00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:07,940
this can be the I just pop popcorn when

00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:09,560
I see bad things happening right that is

00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:10,790
kind of egging on negative behavior

00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:13,040
whether we want to acknowledge it or not

00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:14,300
it's funny it's cute but you know if

00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,710
you're popping popcorn cuz people are

00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:20,720
yelling at each other and they're going

00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:23,570
getting out line maybe not but yeah it's

00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:25,250
a tough one I guess that's where some of

00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:28,640
the Community Guidelines can be helpful

00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:31,820
is to be able to say you know at the end

00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:33,170
of the day I get that we all want to be

00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:34,520
able to cooperate here we want to be

00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:35,930
able to work together and we have

00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:37,400
guidelines and it seems like you're

00:48:35,930 --> 00:48:40,010
backing up this person versed stepping

00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:44,500
up all of them I find that hard to

00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:44,500
understand over here

00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:58,280
Civil War politics a way of it yeah I

00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:00,799
think some of it to is deciding you know

00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:02,750
is this is there a path I can escalate

00:49:00,799 --> 00:49:04,339
this through is it worth doing that

00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:06,910
should I just kind of drop it and let it

00:49:04,339 --> 00:49:09,920
go I think it's very hard to give a

00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:11,630
catch-all always correct answer for some

00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:13,549
of these things I don't know you might

00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:16,640
also talk to the person off list right a

00:49:13,549 --> 00:49:20,510
person who is backing that person up and

00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:22,130
say hey you're doing this let's talk

00:49:20,510 --> 00:49:23,780
about the impact it has on me as a

00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:25,760
person right like I know maybe you feel

00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:28,940
like I was attacking your friend or you

00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:30,349
feel like I'm out of line but the end of

00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:31,700
the day stuff like this makes me feel

00:49:30,349 --> 00:49:33,589
like I'm not welcome to contribute here

00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:35,059
and I don't think that's what you're

00:49:33,589 --> 00:49:39,500
trying to do what are you trying to do

00:49:35,059 --> 00:49:41,680
here all right question all the way in

00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,680
the back

00:49:54,110 --> 00:49:57,230
okay so the question was communities

00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,970
generally springing up around

00:49:57,230 --> 00:50:00,710
technologies that people have built and

00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:02,120
the people who built the technologies

00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:03,860
may not feel as beholden to the

00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:06,050
community as people who join later how

00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:10,820
do you deal with that that is a really

00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:13,970
deep question anybody else in the room

00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:15,680
want to take that one I can think of a

00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:17,270
couple specific examples but I think

00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:28,330
Mike mcgrath next to you has an answer

00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:28,330
for you what would you say the lesson is

00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:45,320
it's so hard Mike oh they said it's okay

00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:46,400
if somebody on the internet is wrong you

00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:48,230
don't necessarily have to argue with

00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:51,560
them to which I said yeah but it's

00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:52,640
really hard not to other questions on my

00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:53,830
side stuff that went I don't have a good

00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,880
answer for that one

00:50:53,830 --> 00:50:57,830
wait we're at 10 o'clock we don't have

00:50:55,880 --> 00:51:00,260
time for any other questions all right

00:50:57,830 --> 00:51:02,810
the wrap-up Q takeaways so if you

00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:04,340
remember just one thing today for the

00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:05,780
specific scenario you encounter here's

00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:08,450
what I would suggest right when you have

00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:09,910
an idea and you need to help show how

00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:12,820
you're listening other people's feedback

00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:15,080
when something is horribly broken

00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:17,840
approach the issue with curiosity

00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:20,720
instead of judgment and when somebody is

00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:25,120
behaving badly call the personnel don't

00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:31,260
call them out thank you

00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:31,260
