Talk: The power of one: For the good of the community
Presenters: Rebecca Fernandez

Description: We all have moments in our communities and projects where we wish that we could change something for the better.

How many times have you thought: "If I were in charge, things would be different..."?

But leadership is not something we are appointed to. It's finding the courage and having the skills, in difficult moments, to use our voices and our actions for the good of others.

Learn how to help your community overcome resistance to new ideas; bring calmness, reason, and respect back into heated discussions; and protect yourselves from bad actors and destructive behaviours.

Stop wishing for change. Start recognizing and using the power that you already have... and make a difference.
