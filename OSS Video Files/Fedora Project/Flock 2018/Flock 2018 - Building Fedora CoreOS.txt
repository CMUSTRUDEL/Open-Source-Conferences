Talk: Building Fedora CoreOS
Presenters: Dusty Mabe, Benjamin Gilbert

Description: Fedora CoreOS is a future Fedora edition drawing from the best of Fedora Atomic Host and CoreOS Container Linux. We'll look at the structure and key design choices of those two operating systems, what's worked and what hasn't, and where we think Fedora CoreOS should go as a result. We'll conclude with an update on the state of Fedora CoreOS development.
