	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,470
I will go ahead and start off with the

00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,889
intro I know we have a couple people

00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:13,200
that will be back in a second but I

00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:18,869
think they already know the first part

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:21,930
of what I'm going to say anyway so so

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:24,570
does everyone okay who here knows what

00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:31,920
mine share the new the mind share

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:34,380
committee is okay one does not okay them

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,840
so the mind share as as it says up there

00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,480
the fedora mind share can represents the

00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:45,350
outreach leadership in fedora which

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:49,680
includes Docs websites ambassadors

00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:54,090
design marketing am I forgetting

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:59,960
anything else Brian what I was in in

00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:59,960
mind share everything that's not yeah

00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,489
Oh

00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:22,560
oh yeah that picture

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:33,030
yes so everything over on that right

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:38,549
side from here over is part of mine

00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:41,130
share and so the idea is to hopefully

00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:45,780
get us to coordinate with the other

00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:49,590
teams and it all mine share is also

00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:54,869
replacing what replacing fans go for the

00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:59,849
ambassadors and so that's a little brief

00:01:54,869 --> 00:02:08,119
overview does anyone have any any

00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:08,119
questions or comments yeah so

00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:22,239
and I do not see sumantra

00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:26,370
I thought he would be giving an overview

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,370
of the new proposals

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,680
yes

00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:44,700
I will we will go back to that topic

00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:46,500
later because since he's writing coming

00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,500
up with the drafts of the new proposals

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:54,690
I think I think he would be the best one

00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:57,330
to talk about it so also the budget is

00:02:54,690 --> 00:03:00,030
being restructured what used to be the

00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:03,780
regional budgets so that it is all

00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:05,910
allocated to mine share and mine share

00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:09,630
will be the one approving event

00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:11,580
proposals which I guess are we

00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:15,959
effectively there now because the

00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:18,810
regions are basically out of money yeah

00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,970
because I think I was looking at the

00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:24,510
budgets I was looking at the budgets I

00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:27,959
and so what we had done was go ahead and

00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:30,840
give a 4th of the budget to the regions

00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:33,209
like what we've done before but it

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:38,100
appears roughly from the budget site

00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:40,700
that the regions are pretty much out of

00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:44,120
the budget any out of that budget anyway

00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:47,400
so even though we haven't really updated

00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:50,370
some of the documentation yet future

00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:53,459
requests will pretty much have we're

00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:56,910
just going to direct those to mindshare

00:03:53,459 --> 00:04:00,570
anyway because we're not going to push

00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:06,150
it out another quarter and change the

00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:10,860
budget again and our idea is to try to

00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:13,200
make it a I mean not a big long

00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:17,000
bureaucratic process especially if

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,000
someone is wanting a smaller event

00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:23,010
especially we're trying to promote

00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:25,500
release parties and you can get a

00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:29,160
hundred dollar budget for a release

00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:32,630
party and only a certain amount of it is

00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:35,490
supposed to go for food pretty much by

00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:36,300
having a decent proposal and asking for

00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:39,330
it

00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:42,570
not requiring a bunch of meetings and

00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:45,870
everything and we want it for people to

00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:50,910
get stuff done because if you make the

00:04:45,870 --> 00:05:03,720
process really hard then people will be

00:04:50,910 --> 00:05:09,360
less likely to do it well cilantro is

00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:11,010
writing them so Beck's can bring them up

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:32,040
on the screen if you want to show

00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:36,240
something okay so to start with I'm

00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:38,850
shimanto and here is what we have so we

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,850
wanted to create a process which is less

00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:43,980
frictionless in terms of budget and it's

00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:47,070
very accessible to everyone who wants to

00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:49,560
play kind of promote fedora and talk

00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:52,290
about Federer but not in terms of just

00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,540
talking they have to be some sort of

00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:57,600
longtime or a decent contributor in

00:05:54,540 --> 00:06:00,450
terms of the project so we came out with

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,520
a way by which we could achieve this and

00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:05,250
that is by this program called advocate

00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,380
so where we go ahead and we say hey if

00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:09,090
you are a longtime contributor and you

00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:11,790
want to spread the knowledge about what

00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:13,440
you are contributing exactly to so let's

00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:16,140
say I am a QA guy and if I want to

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,150
spread knowledge about how I do the QA

00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:21,600
process and onboard the community with

00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:24,900
me this is exactly what I can do

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,850
now since advil since ambassadors we're

00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:29,370
primarily responsible for outreach

00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:31,560
events we kind of created a template by

00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:34,530
which advocates can go ahead request for

00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:37,520
such budgets and activities like envy

00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:39,510
said you can go hold release parties

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,550
requesting for one hundred dollar budget

00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:44,910
and there will be no question asked and

00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:47,330
you it would be approved so by virtue of

00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:49,780
your work you become an advocate

00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:51,820
when you are ready to kind of take more

00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:54,320
responsibilities towards your goals

00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:56,900
representing your region you kind of

00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:59,480
move towards more of like the Ambassador

00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:02,900
Program which is currently designed to

00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:04,790
like handle more of regional

00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,800
responsibilities but if you want to be a

00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:09,920
face of phaidor in your area

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,020
I think advocate is the best way to go

00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:15,160
now most of the people who are

00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:18,110
ambassador's right now

00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:20,720
some of them due to work pressure and

00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:23,380
timings they kind of miss out on this

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:27,200
opportunity of mentoring new people and

00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:30,800
since we want that I mean we don't want

00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:34,640
that we kind of new people tend to come

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:37,610
in and they move towards the very known

00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:40,670
name of the names from the area and

00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:43,070
let's say if he if envy is a known name

00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:46,400
and everyone goes to him and he cannot

00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:49,010
give time most of the like attention

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,380
kind of gets divided and finally people

00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:53,150
lose interest so we can enough went

00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:55,550
ahead and said hey there there is

00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:58,520
something called we are always grateful

00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:00,890
to whatever in like envy or the

00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:04,130
ambassador has done but we are going to

00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:05,930
move them to MIT ambi status which

00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:07,850
basically emeritus status which would

00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:10,730
basically say we are grateful that you

00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:15,050
have helped for so long and so so much

00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:17,270
but since you cannot like you know you

00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:20,870
cannot direct everyone guide everyone

00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:22,880
now you can like take a step back and

00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:24,950
then whenever you feel you are ready to

00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,420
go again just send us a request and we

00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:29,140
will resume your sponsorship to

00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,140
ambassador's program

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:36,469
so that's that's mostly what emeritus

00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:39,169
and ambassadors have been like situation

00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:43,490
for now and I think we would have a

00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:46,190
process around it very soon and so this

00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:50,740
session was mostly to have a update on

00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:50,740
whatever we are doing right Thanks

00:08:52,010 --> 00:09:05,810
oh yes feedbacks yeah my plan for this

00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:08,360
session was just kind of to give a

00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:15,320
little descent to give a little update

00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:18,980
on what we've been doing back ok

00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:23,090
back in March I believe it was we had

00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:26,030
the mindshare committee fad and I think

00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:28,600
we made a lot of progress and then a lot

00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:32,390
of the time here I want to spend just

00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:34,220
discussing ideas what people think about

00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:39,980
the things we're working on currently

00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:42,730
and so on did you have anything else to

00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,730
say about the

00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:00,570
okay yeah that's pretty much everything

00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:04,800
I had on the staff I just wanted to talk

00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:07,470
about so now I think does anyone have

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,990
any comments or questions about the

00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:12,110
things we've mentioned so far I want to

00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:15,600
spend most of the time here

00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:19,830
brainstorming working on making plans

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,270
for what mindshare should do I was

00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:23,730
hoping to have more of our committee

00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:39,150
here but quite a few people several

00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:42,000
people couldn't be here I think to be

00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:44,090
honest for me this looks like what we

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,600
intended with the ambassadors maybe

00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:51,930
eight years ago then when it's when the

00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,910
ambassador's project or sub project or

00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:59,850
whatever we want to call it start

00:10:53,910 --> 00:11:07,170
growing most people in where CLA plus

00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:12,050
five CLA plus ten and there were people

00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:16,149
were doing and bastard stuff beside

00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:19,750
the did regular contributions to adora

00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:26,779
intermedius looks likely we want to have

00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:30,980
the kind of a super ambassador and kind

00:11:26,779 --> 00:11:33,649
of make it hard for people who just want

00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:37,029
to tell people about fedora and are not

00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:44,360
so much engaged in this whole ecosystem

00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:49,339
right I think the idea behind it is

00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:51,709
pretty much the actual ambassador group

00:11:49,339 --> 00:11:55,750
is not we're not really proposing

00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:58,040
changing becoming being an ambassador

00:11:55,750 --> 00:12:03,200
but we're wanting to make it easy for

00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:05,870
people okay say you're say

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:10,160
hypothetically I mean you're someone who

00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:13,010
works in engineering or something or you

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:17,839
and you just want to have a release

00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:19,430
party where wherever you live and that

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:22,370
way we're wanting to make it easy for

00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:26,560
people to do small events without having

00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:28,910
to actually join the ambassador's team

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,010
yeah we're wanting to make it we're

00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:32,779
wanting to make it easier for people to

00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:34,160
do stuff and it can I can I can

00:12:32,779 --> 00:12:35,660
summarize I think I think there's

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,760
there's four main points I think that

00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:39,290
summarize it I think it's we want to

00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,110
reduce the friction for things like

00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:43,579
release parties or small events so that

00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:45,350
it's not a lot of bureaucracy to try to

00:12:43,579 --> 00:12:48,100
get through so that that's that's step

00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:50,570
number one step number two is an

00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,490
advocates program that's that's easier

00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:55,459
to get into the ambassador then the

00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:58,880
ambassador's program is a little less

00:12:55,459 --> 00:13:01,010
less work a little less less rigmarole

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,200
easier easier for people who aren't

00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:04,910
already engaged in other other things in

00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,990
Fedora to get in and and share what

00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:10,910
they've learned so far and then in then

00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:13,070
my fourth point was for people who have

00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:14,420
been an ambassador but have kind of

00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:16,880
stepped away from doing that and are

00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:18,770
focused on other things set them as that

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,329
emeritus ambassador so they still get

00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:21,860
that recognition for the great work that

00:13:20,329 --> 00:13:23,570
they did but then it's easier for us to

00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,800
tell ok who's actively engaged as an

00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:26,240
ambassador Anu

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,089
has been ambassador but has stepped away

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:33,850
I think it's really those four main

00:13:29,089 --> 00:13:33,850
points that does that help clarify the

00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:43,730
another theme that we can we get when

00:13:39,709 --> 00:13:45,589
we've made the fad the is that normally

00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:49,579
people think that they need to be an

00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:51,980
ambassador to attend event so with the

00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:54,380
applique program like it's not like we

00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:56,600
want to have a super ambassador that

00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:59,779
would be developing sis at meeting and

00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:03,350
then he will being ambassador but to let

00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:05,690
him have a way to go through the budget

00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:08,750
process easily and do a conference

00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:11,600
representing fedora yeah I don't know if

00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:16,430
I explained a little bit but the idea is

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,810
the there was kind of if you are no

00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:19,519
goddamn bastard you should not be

00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:21,260
organizing events and that's what we

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,660
want to change that that kind of

00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:26,570
thinking if you want to organizing a

00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:28,490
small event or attend to an event and

00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:31,370
giving a speech talking about by the no

00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:33,350
federal modularity or Fedora CI or or

00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:35,480
atomic working group you don't need to

00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:37,700
be actually an ambassador because the

00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,829
advocate program is an easy to enter

00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:43,690
program and you can get funding to

00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:43,690
attend to an event right

00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:52,670
just hold a even that's it just hold any

00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:52,670
event that's it

00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:23,970
but that so so as a member of a team any

00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:26,699
team I'm able to I'm able to ask the

00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:28,829
Advocate program for for the cash I

00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:31,290
would need to do some sort of an event

00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:36,300
right of a sort of a size that I

00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:42,180
determined that's penny okay are there

00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:46,010
any plans to have a program where we're

00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:52,529
identifying people who are specifically

00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:54,839
ready for public speaking okay so here's

00:15:52,529 --> 00:15:58,260
the thing that is exactly what the point

00:15:54,839 --> 00:16:05,220
of advocates was it was designed for

00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:10,860
people who by virtue of their work so

00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:12,959
for example if he is from marketing yeah

00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:16,170
so if he is from marketing and he wants

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:19,290
to speak about how to get started with

00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:21,779
marketing but he needs the event and he

00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:24,120
has a release party he can go ahead

00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:26,540
speak and get more contributors to help

00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:29,310
him out and that's exactly improvers

00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:30,959
improves his situation and for

00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:33,209
specifically public speaking there is

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,699
nothing but yes we would love to have

00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:38,730
something on those lines so we can

00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:40,529
address let's say you know if I am NOT a

00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:42,959
public speaker but I am a regular

00:16:40,529 --> 00:16:44,880
contributor to the project here are a

00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:47,100
couple of like videos or some kind of

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,500
master class which I can attend and then

00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:52,730
I can be a better public speaker in

00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,730
those lines like

00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:05,069
like understanding very directly the key

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:08,549
talking points for example one that Matt

00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:10,829
pointed out and the keynote was was

00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:13,169
bleeding edge versus leading edge yes

00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:15,539
and talking about fedora and in the

00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:20,220
terms that we want people to identify

00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:23,059
and and yes so this is exactly another

00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:27,030
thing that I mean visited advocates as

00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:29,820
advised and which is you they better

00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:32,640
work with an ambassador so every one of

00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:35,250
us tells the same story in the same

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,440
manner and we do not compete I mean we

00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:40,559
do not come communicate any discrepancy

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,929
that way we kind of reduce as as much as

00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:45,090
difference of opinion that we can have

00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:47,669
so that you know it's easier for

00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:50,970
everyone to use a single templated out

00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:53,640
stuff and roll it wherever iterated as

00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:55,559
many times as they want and still still

00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,929
be corrected I think that's something

00:17:55,559 --> 00:18:01,799
that possibly the marketing team could

00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:05,940
work on is coming up with things like

00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:09,270
what David was saying about Mike that

00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:12,000
we're not bleeding edge things to

00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:15,840
talking points to help people we know

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,640
how to read two common questions you

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,700
might get because I know I've heard that

00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:22,950
at events to about like well fedoras

00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:26,010
like the bleeding edge and I don't want

00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:29,010
my computer to bleed yeah well actually

00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:33,240
that's one of the key points of the talk

00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:34,860
tomorrow in marketing is that we get

00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,110
completely disconnected from the bustle

00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,850
program but like completely disconnected

00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:41,549
we are collecting part in post and

00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:45,750
ambassador are not using it so one of

00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:48,630
the key points of of the marketing plan

00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:51,179
for the next six months to one year will

00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:54,210
be to recover this connection and tell

00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:57,580
them you know this is what we need to do

00:18:54,210 --> 00:19:00,100
to talk please try to avoid too

00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:01,510
to say things if and if you have a doubt

00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,340
please come to us or come to the

00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:07,240
counselor or whatever you need to talk

00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:08,860
to ask but we need to reconnect the

00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,150
ambassador's with a messaging that is

00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:12,460
coming from the counsel through the

00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:17,530
marketing team so that's one of the

00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:19,840
things we need to achieve I see it

00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:21,820
completely the opposite way I think the

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,490
ambassadors need to feed their feedback

00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:26,920
into marketing and marketing has to

00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:28,540
follow the input from the ambassadors

00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,250
because they are the people who are out

00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:38,680
there and speaking to the TV to the

00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:40,930
people you certainly need to close the

00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:43,270
loop right the feedback loop definitely

00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:45,160
needs to be closed but there need to be

00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:47,890
answers that are very clear and concise

00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:53,290
for advocates to understand in the first

00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:56,620
place for example for example when

00:19:53,290 --> 00:20:00,100
someone asks what happens if I get sued

00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:01,630
for using fedora right that's not

00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:04,450
something you want to close the feedback

00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:06,340
loop on from the from the ambassador's

00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:08,230
feed from the ambassador's response

00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:09,640
first you want to make sure that you

00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:15,280
have an active answer for that in the

00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:17,020
first place also we come to realize

00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:21,310
because the marketing team was reduced

00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:23,830
to me and another guy that is really

00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:26,650
hard to work in messaging if we are just

00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:30,580
two persons so now we divide the

00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:32,890
functions of marketing if it was not

00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:34,810
published yet still in the mailing list

00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:37,900
because we need to focus before

00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:41,200
ambassadors but the messaging is going

00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:43,750
through my shirt and marketing will be

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,700
the execution in part only that's the

00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:48,070
way we want to close that gap with

00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:49,540
ambassadors but this is its planet and

00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:51,790
it's blocked because we need to figure

00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:53,830
out this first Rufus dress is all the

00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:56,710
feedback document everything and then go

00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:58,950
through other plans but definitely is on

00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:58,950
the way

00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:12,440
any other question or follow-up yeah I

00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:15,980
have a question if you can elaborate a

00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:17,960
bit more about how budgets and the

00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:19,659
payment process will look like in the

00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:28,279
future

00:21:19,659 --> 00:21:31,100
we have Brian there may be also a remark

00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:34,340
I think it's good that you have some

00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:36,590
kind of commission by default for low

00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:38,480
amounts that is what you try to achieve

00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:41,270
for the Advocate I think that's a good

00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,100
idea and I'm not a big fan of looking

00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:46,070
backwards but we had this in the

00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:50,270
beginning that a proven ambassador was

00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:53,450
able to just use an amount of money but

00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:56,210
of course it's not it's it's redheads

00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:58,100
money so I think there needs some kind

00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:59,690
of a control instance for that but I

00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:03,230
think it's a step in the right direction

00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:05,570
but I because I'm concerned directly

00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:08,149
with doing the payments I would like to

00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:11,240
know how it will be handled in the

00:22:08,149 --> 00:22:13,940
future so do we handle then the payments

00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:16,990
also for India as example which I would

00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:19,580
like to do so that's what I like to hear

00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:21,260
I'm gonna rudely make you repeat your

00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:23,240
last sentence because there was a

00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:25,159
scheduling emergency that flashed on my

00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,360
screen and I'm very sorry but I stopped

00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:28,399
listening to you because could you

00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:30,590
repeat just the last sentence I had

00:22:28,399 --> 00:22:33,230
everything up until then yeah I I just

00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:35,299
wanted to know how payments in the

00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:39,559
future will be processed and handled

00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:42,200
because regional - I think a global

00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:47,120
budget this also reflects on the credit

00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:50,059
card holders so okay I'm happy to handle

00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:53,059
payments also for other regions in the

00:22:50,059 --> 00:22:56,179
world but if yes how this will be

00:22:53,059 --> 00:22:59,029
handled so kind of a couple things to

00:22:56,179 --> 00:23:01,490
update for reasons completely unrelated

00:22:59,029 --> 00:23:03,230
to the individuals in those regions we

00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:05,630
currently don't have working credit

00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:08,029
cards in a pack and item and that's

00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:09,639
that's a thing that has we've been

00:23:08,029 --> 00:23:11,179
trying to figure out how to resolve this

00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:12,710
there have been some technical

00:23:11,179 --> 00:23:15,409
challenges there

00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:17,470
so we definitely need to move to having

00:23:15,409 --> 00:23:19,879
the individuals who do have the

00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:21,470
community cards able to pay across

00:23:19,879 --> 00:23:23,809
regions and able to do it in an

00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:25,850
effective way one of the blocks that

00:23:23,809 --> 00:23:27,950
we've had right now has been that if

00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:30,019
you're in region a it's hard to get

00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:31,759
visibility into what's going on in

00:23:30,019 --> 00:23:34,100
region B because they often have

00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:35,659
completely different processes for what

00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:38,960
the ticket status is whether it's

00:23:35,659 --> 00:23:40,580
private or not how do you know when a

00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,259
ticket is actually ready to be

00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,850
reimbursed is there supposed to be an

00:23:42,259 --> 00:23:45,679
event URL in there is it there's

00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:47,629
something there's a there's a companion

00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,820
ticket somewhere else like every regions

00:23:47,629 --> 00:23:53,570
done it differently and if the mindshare

00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:55,759
fad we came up with the idea of some

00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:58,909
terribly named finance team because it

00:23:55,759 --> 00:24:02,360
had the word Becks in cake in it but I

00:23:58,909 --> 00:24:04,820
think it was the cake warriors so we're

00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,320
not going to do that but what we did

00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:08,149
come up with was this idea that we

00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,440
should ask the card holders if they're

00:24:08,149 --> 00:24:11,059
willing and the treasures if they're

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,860
willing to work across the regions and

00:24:11,059 --> 00:24:14,809
because everything was going to funnel

00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:17,179
through a single process that we're

00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:20,929
gonna explicate here then it would be

00:24:17,179 --> 00:24:22,759
very easy for these folks to know from a

00:24:20,929 --> 00:24:24,110
reimbursements perspective we've been

00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:25,909
doing a lot of experimentation with

00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:28,759
alternative ways of getting money to

00:24:25,909 --> 00:24:30,320
people so that we can also return money

00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:32,809
to contributors in ways that make more

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,789
sense traditionally the project had

00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:37,070
always returned money to contributors in

00:24:34,789 --> 00:24:40,070
the form of US dollars via PayPal and

00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:41,990
that was inconvenient for the vast

00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:44,659
majority of our actual contributors

00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:46,340
because they don't use the US dollar as

00:24:44,659 --> 00:24:48,230
their functional currency and in several

00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:50,720
countries of the world PayPal is not an

00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:52,249
acceptable form of payment because even

00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,789
if they can receive it in some countries

00:24:52,249 --> 00:24:57,139
you can never withdraw the cash so we've

00:24:55,789 --> 00:24:58,970
been looking at trying to do that as

00:24:57,139 --> 00:25:00,619
well we've been using transfer wise to a

00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:03,139
great effect and then we've also been

00:25:00,619 --> 00:25:05,360
relaxing the currency rule so like if

00:25:03,139 --> 00:25:08,059
you spent your money in euros you get

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,110
euros back because that's how much

00:25:08,059 --> 00:25:11,749
that's what you have to pay your credit

00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:14,119
card billing so those two things I think

00:25:11,749 --> 00:25:16,399
are answers to your question and I think

00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:18,879
the idea of trying to pick a committee

00:25:16,399 --> 00:25:22,340
of people who can really help us process

00:25:18,879 --> 00:25:26,300
transactions would be very useful here

00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:29,720
so I suppose that for the details

00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:32,240
written down this is what you're working

00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:36,110
on right now because then I need to

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:38,480
access other pad guru or beggar or

00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:41,480
however you want so that sessions or

00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:44,120
systems instances so what we've been

00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:46,190
looking at is potentially the idea of

00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:48,200
asking the mind share committees details

00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:49,640
to be focused much like this document

00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,590
here by the way this is a pull request

00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:55,220
in the mind share packer if you want to

00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:58,100
read it on your own screen this doesn't

00:25:55,220 --> 00:26:01,700
tell you how to get your money back it

00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:03,830
tells you what you're allowed to do the

00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:06,740
how you get your money back in this

00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:09,590
lives in the budget repository okay that

00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:12,290
way we can have a single uniform set of

00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:14,420
rules for how the project manages its

00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:16,550
money so that you don't have different

00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:18,260
rules based on the day of the week the

00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:20,690
person you talked to the region you're

00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:23,300
in and I think that that's gonna help a

00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:26,450
lot here because then we might have card

00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:28,250
holders who are not ambassador's they're

00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:30,050
just people who that's the form of

00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:31,730
contribution they want to make maybe

00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:33,680
they're actually accountants and they

00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:35,780
that is how they wish to participate in

00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:37,910
the project um and then they can get

00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:40,640
access to the budget repo where it will

00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:43,160
be clear this is what i reimburse this

00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,810
is not ready for reimbursement um so

00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:46,970
that's that's how I think we're hoping

00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:50,540
to do that one thing that we we talked

00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:52,880
about a lot at the fad was the current

00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:55,430
situation we're in is caused partially

00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:59,500
by there being so many undocumented

00:26:55,430 --> 00:27:02,870
rules so can we simplify the rules and

00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:04,970
document them all of the weird ugly hard

00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:06,890
bids and like give it to a team that's

00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:09,140
dedicated to that form of weird ugly

00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:11,260
hard bit where it becomes simple for

00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,260
them

00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:26,799
and in more simple terms the way we we

00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:31,309
try to manage this is to release the

00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:34,539
task of handle morning from ambassadors

00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:37,850
to mine sure and then allow people that

00:27:34,539 --> 00:27:39,889
handle money as a job maybe or they want

00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:41,029
to contribute only in that way do not

00:27:39,889 --> 00:27:43,070
require to pass through the hole

00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:45,289
ambassador process to get into the

00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:48,830
project to help so that's that's the

00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:52,220
main goal here and make the Ambassador

00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:53,630
focus in their in their definition they

00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:57,110
need to be the face of fedora they don't

00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:59,480
need to be concerned about how the money

00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:01,549
is being wasted you just he just need to

00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,289
go to event organize events and speak to

00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:06,080
people because there are people people

00:28:03,289 --> 00:28:08,809
in the in the description okay so this

00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:12,590
will also mean that future credit card

00:28:08,809 --> 00:28:15,320
holders will not have any longer the

00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:17,510
right to make any judgment decisions as

00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:20,659
we have at the moment because at the

00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:24,380
moment we had this kind of rule that we

00:28:20,659 --> 00:28:27,679
can approve until four hundred euros or

00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:31,309
five hundred US dollars if it's urgent

00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:34,279
and if a judgement a decision is needed

00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:38,080
and enough yeah yeah exactly

00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:41,149
the it was written down i made a the old

00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:44,059
payment process maybe you remember the

00:28:41,149 --> 00:28:47,450
world graphics that i have done which

00:28:44,059 --> 00:28:50,600
nope nobody understood but yeah so but

00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:56,000
for these people maybe also then we have

00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:58,250
other rules then that's a person so in

00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,320
it the fad what we talked about was the

00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:03,320
idea of administrative versus

00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:05,659
ministerial so ministerial is an action

00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:07,970
that you you will perform it when all of

00:29:05,659 --> 00:29:09,559
the check boxes are checked yes and an

00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:11,960
administrative action is one where you

00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:14,210
have to make a decision and the goal was

00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:16,970
to try and push the administrative

00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:19,100
decision earlier in the process so that

00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:21,200
we have things like the you're doing a

00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:23,779
release party we're done here your

00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,549
administrative lea proved these are the

00:29:23,779 --> 00:29:26,040
specific checkboxes you must take in

00:29:25,549 --> 00:29:29,400
order to be

00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:32,100
reimbursed we're done um and then the

00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:35,040
the card holders can go the three check

00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:38,060
boxes are checked reimburse we expect

00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:41,220
the card holders to still be fiduciary

00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:44,220
appropriate so you know if it comes in

00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:46,020
on the receipt and it says I don't know

00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:47,960
they bought seven thousand dollars worth

00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:49,770
of computing on a one hundred dollar

00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,600
authorization for food

00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:53,760
we expect you to throw up a flag and not

00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,350
just to prove the charge you know if

00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:58,260
there's questions we expect people to

00:29:55,350 --> 00:30:00,570
look at it but the hope is that we won't

00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:02,820
need the emergency release of a

00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:05,940
treasurer making decisions about

00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:07,530
approving events because the community

00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:09,480
will actually be able to function and

00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:11,010
act and approve those and you could

00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,020
argue that the work that you all have

00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:15,630
been doing in the regions where that

00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:17,430
rule exists has been critical because

00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:20,750
the community there hasn't been able to

00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:26,400
effectively make those decisions

00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:27,930
we also discussed they I don't remember

00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:31,230
what we were just throwing around

00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:34,080
numbers but anything up to a couple

00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:36,480
hundred dollars or something one member

00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:40,440
of the mindshare committee could just

00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:43,050
say this sounds good do it and it not

00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:45,870
not every decision even if it's not a

00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:47,700
release party not necessarily every

00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:51,210
decision will require a vote of the

00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:53,070
committee just one member saying kind of

00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:56,580
basically kind of like the card holders

00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:58,230
now where you can say this they can make

00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:00,830
it to judgments which decision that we

00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:00,830
do yes

00:31:01,049 --> 00:31:07,860
I think there's two important points

00:31:05,249 --> 00:31:09,389
there one oh that it doesn't require the

00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:12,389
whole committee to wait till their next

00:31:09,389 --> 00:31:14,340
meeting to make a decision and two it's

00:31:12,389 --> 00:31:16,200
it's you know make that public so people

00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:18,360
have a chance to you know a comment

00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:20,460
period so you know maybe one person on

00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:22,200
the committee plus waiting 24 hours or

00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:23,279
48 hours so that people have a chance to

00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,960
say oh that doesn't sound right

00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,340
you know before it's approved but but

00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,259
process down to where you can have a

00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:31,559
decision in two or three days not two or

00:31:28,259 --> 00:31:35,159
three weeks or two or three months yeah

00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:37,619
in North America we've made it so pretty

00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:40,970
much everything is approved by our

00:31:37,619 --> 00:31:45,600
meetings or well it used to be at least

00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:48,509
but certain things andrew would just pay

00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:51,720
like if I needed shipping supplies we

00:31:48,509 --> 00:31:53,669
didn't vote on it I just ordered them

00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:59,279
and send them the receipt if I needed

00:31:53,669 --> 00:32:00,480
boxes or we use UPS for shipping and I'm

00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:03,059
gonna interrupt this and ask a question

00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,590
of the audience because we're all the

00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:07,190
audience and we're all the speakers I

00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:09,299
I'm hearing a lot of people in agreement

00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:11,190
expressing the same ideas with different

00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:13,009
words and so I'm kind of curious is

00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:14,970
there anyone who actually disagrees

00:32:13,009 --> 00:32:17,309
fundamentally or partially with what

00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:20,039
they're hearing about we're going to

00:32:17,309 --> 00:32:22,080
make small dollar amounts easy to get to

00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:24,330
we're basically erring on trusting

00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,070
people and we're gonna make larger

00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:27,539
dollar amounts be approved through this

00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:30,690
other process that may have multiple

00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:32,220
tiers of ways of making decisions so

00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:35,159
that we can hopefully get to decisions

00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:37,169
faster and more uniformly in regions and

00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:39,899
then we're going to use a centralized

00:32:37,169 --> 00:32:41,730
set of the same processes to reimburse

00:32:39,899 --> 00:32:43,590
people across the project without

00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:46,289
regards to whether it was say a release

00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:49,259
party an ambassador event or a fedora

00:32:46,289 --> 00:32:53,029
Women's Day is there anybody who has

00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:53,029
like a fundamental objection to that

00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:04,600
are you going to hundley our request

00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:07,870
home there the word like all you I think

00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:09,670
you will be the bottleneck no mine sure

00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:11,770
committee will I am not going to be a

00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:13,570
bottleneck here I do not want to be the

00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:15,400
sole responsible person and the world

00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:20,590
should not stop if I get sick or go on

00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:23,400
vacation I I have no disagreement but

00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:27,910
maybe a wish for the future my chair so

00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:30,280
that what I see is that maybe at the

00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:36,430
moment it's necessary but that's very

00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:41,620
focused inside our own community and I

00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:44,320
think we should much much more look into

00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:47,980
how we get a message out what is our

00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:51,070
goal with mine chair do we focus on

00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:55,120
users that become contributors one day

00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:58,000
how we do that I have good experiences

00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:01,240
going to universities and teaching there

00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:04,330
but there need to be some enablement for

00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:07,860
that then also some kind of some

00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:11,950
controversial things like going to

00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:16,770
regions where maybe people are poor and

00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:21,310
under represented and maybe also also

00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:25,060
political issues evolved to support this

00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:28,240
communities and I think that's a wish

00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:32,140
that mine share would focus on giving a

00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:35,310
more clear vision what ambassadors

00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:38,500
marketing how they can feed each other

00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:40,810
feedbacks and how they go out and spread

00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:43,480
a message instead of focus too much

00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:46,060
inwards I understand that you are at the

00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:48,130
moment in a state where you need to do

00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:50,410
that because if you are not structured

00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:53,200
you will not get through to the next

00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:56,800
step you hit the nail on the head as the

00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:58,240
idiom goes that is actually almost a

00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,010
hundred percent of what we tried to

00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:03,710
consume ourselves with at the mind your

00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:07,640
fat is this the mechanic

00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:10,190
of reimbursement or the mechanics of I

00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:12,559
don't know becoming an ambassador had

00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:15,020
consumed a hundred percent of the

00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:18,050
conversation space within the project in

00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:22,579
most regions and the actual act of going

00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:25,220
to the university was a distant 1% and

00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:27,140
so we want to flip that around and that

00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:29,660
actually comes kind of to the second

00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:32,750
part of of what we talked about which

00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:35,950
was Seoul has asked that we try to focus

00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:39,349
on the additions and the objectives as

00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:41,329
those are our desired target audiences

00:35:39,349 --> 00:35:43,790
this is not to say we shouldn't go

00:35:41,329 --> 00:35:45,650
anywhere else or do anything else but

00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:47,930
like when people come to us if they go I

00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:49,369
want to spend you know ten thousand

00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:53,329
dollars to hold an event to get to a

00:35:49,369 --> 00:35:55,099
bowl all of whom are Python developers

00:35:53,329 --> 00:35:56,720
and therefore they're going to use

00:35:55,099 --> 00:35:58,160
workstation they're going to use server

00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,920
and they're going to use the Python

00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,630
classroom lab versus I want to spend ten

00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:06,220
thousand dollars to get to a thousand

00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:10,040
people all of whom are llama farmers and

00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:12,559
they might choose to install Fedora on

00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:14,660
their home PCs to watch movies because

00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:17,470
we don't currently have any llama

00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:20,000
specific spins remixes or software that

00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:22,579
allows mindshare to make a decision

00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,890
about the value of those to $10,000

00:36:22,579 --> 00:36:26,119
spins but I think you're a hundred

00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:28,670
percent right that the real question is

00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:30,859
how do we feed back that loop of the

00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:33,680
ambassador's were in the streets so to

00:36:30,859 --> 00:36:36,799
speak and everybody went we have no idea

00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:39,230
what modularity is and so how do we

00:36:36,799 --> 00:36:43,690
better tell that story or do we want to

00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:47,180
tell the story of modularity and

00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:54,440
actually there's other several problems

00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:56,809
for example even if you can show the the

00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:59,349
graphic when there is all the teams in

00:36:56,809 --> 00:36:59,349
fedora

00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:10,080
that one there is a lot of disconnection

00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:12,420
between for example or even in the

00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:15,480
objective of each working group on

00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:19,700
easting for example come ups have this

00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:22,770
problem marketing have this problem

00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:25,620
first up there a specific example that

00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:28,890
people was using outdated design

00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:32,910
material and there is a tons of prevent

00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:36,210
and come to be solve by mention in the

00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:37,950
time but the the we focus primarily in

00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:40,650
solve the buzzer problem but we are

00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:44,070
really aware that is another stuff to

00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:46,860
work on and we are trying to split the

00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:48,450
time to work on several things but our

00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:52,440
main focus was on this because it was a

00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:54,810
harder problem to work on and the most

00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:56,940
big audience to reach because there is

00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:59,450
four regions to reach with among

00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,450
ambassadors

00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:18,480
I think we shall try new ways to speak

00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:21,390
to the people like YouTube videos that

00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:24,600
not necessary if we have to spend money

00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:27,210
or something we record the video ones

00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:30,840
and the video will be maybe forever

00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:32,820
online or something so I'm gonna call

00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:35,970
you out a little bit can you make that

00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:37,560
video like and the reason I bring this

00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:39,420
up is one of the things that took so

00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:42,600
long to get the invited the advocates

00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:45,150
piece written was we fell victim to our

00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:47,300
own problem of we have lots of ideas and

00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:51,860
no one put it together in the doc and

00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:56,220
honestly it was it was sitting down him

00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:58,350
stop that it was him sitting down and

00:38:56,220 --> 00:39:00,660
just banging out a document and then we

00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:03,030
dedicated an hour to like everybody

00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:05,430
pushing on it to get it to this polished

00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:08,340
form so I think that we need to stop

00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:10,530
asking for permission and just start

00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:11,970
doing and that's the whole thing we're

00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:13,860
doing with advocates the whole thing

00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:15,360
we're doing with release parties I think

00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:17,190
you're a hundred percent right that in

00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:19,280
some places in the world we need to be

00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:22,050
using social media or YouTube etc

00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:24,630
differently it may be that it has a

00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:25,680
massive impact in Brazil and a terrible

00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:29,430
impact in France

00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:31,110
I don't know but what's stopping you

00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:33,360
from producing that to be successful

00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:35,160
what's stopping you from getting to the

00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,960
University what's stopping you from

00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,860
going to an event and talking about

00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,610
modularity

00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:43,920
let's unblock that rather than say we

00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:47,310
should do X but then no one wants to do

00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:51,240
it although I want to encourage all of

00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:56,310
you and to reach the marketing mailing

00:39:51,240 --> 00:40:01,500
list and reach the IRC marketing with

00:39:56,310 --> 00:40:05,040
your ideas we need ideas because of not

00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:06,780
all there is no universal strategy that

00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:09,830
is going to work everywhere in the world

00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:13,620
so right now I'm pushing the podcast I

00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:16,380
have a well it was original method

00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:18,450
YouTube channel to make other videos

00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:21,150
that different the flock dolls

00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:26,579
you go through the channel you only want

00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:30,089
to find flock talks and I seen we I have

00:40:26,579 --> 00:40:31,680
a plan for use the Instagram account we

00:40:30,089 --> 00:40:35,010
have a social media team that works on

00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:36,750
Twitter so do you know your region

00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:38,700
because it's your region you know your

00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:41,130
country if you have an idea how to reach

00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:42,690
your people come here tell me I want to

00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:44,790
do that and you need what you need to do

00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:46,320
it do you need permission did you two

00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:47,849
ever camera can do it do you need

00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:49,260
permission in the social media maybe I

00:40:47,849 --> 00:40:52,500
cannot do it but I can't reach they want

00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:57,270
who is going to help you but try to get

00:40:52,500 --> 00:41:09,210
the ideas out to us to see how can help

00:40:57,270 --> 00:41:10,650
you to make that idea happens so what

00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:14,420
time is it because I think we have our

00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:14,420
two blocks sessions

00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:25,810
yeah well

00:41:54,680 --> 00:42:00,089
so one of the things I wanted to cover

00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:01,710
from given some in the context of mine

00:42:00,089 --> 00:42:03,839
hair being focused on the other outreach

00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:06,210
teams this is a recent experience that I

00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:09,269
had trying to organize an event in North

00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:10,650
America but I'm trying really like I was

00:42:09,269 --> 00:42:12,900
putting in a lot of effort to try to

00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:14,609
self educate myself on the Fedora

00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:16,650
objectives and to trying to figure out a

00:42:14,609 --> 00:42:18,450
strategy for bringing them to an event

00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:21,749
at a university I was planning to

00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:23,099
organize and so in the effort of trying

00:42:21,749 --> 00:42:25,380
to find like some kind of like talking

00:42:23,099 --> 00:42:26,430
points or like marketable bullet points

00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:28,349
or something I get something I could

00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:29,700
bring to try to help me understand what

00:42:28,349 --> 00:42:34,650
makes sense or what doesn't make sense

00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:36,240
to bring to this event there was in the

00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:37,740
things I could find without asking

00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,420
someone it was not easy for me to find

00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:41,670
resources and then I spent the time like

00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:44,579
I reached out to the points of contact

00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:46,799
for the objectives and I tried to ask

00:42:44,579 --> 00:42:51,210
for where I could find information and I

00:42:46,799 --> 00:42:54,539
had a either no response to some

00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:57,299
response to very engaged and one of the

00:42:54,539 --> 00:43:01,319
things I kind of wanted to pilot or try

00:42:57,299 --> 00:43:03,210
to drive mine share to do is to be the

00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:05,160
connecting piece between the objective

00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:06,809
leads and or not just the leads but the

00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,339
objectives and the people behind the

00:43:06,809 --> 00:43:10,289
objectives with the outreach and

00:43:08,339 --> 00:43:13,009
marketing teams so one of things I only

00:43:10,289 --> 00:43:16,230
wanted to try to propose is if we try to

00:43:13,009 --> 00:43:19,499
work at the council level as mine share

00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:22,049
to make the part of I proposing an

00:43:19,499 --> 00:43:23,609
objective with like in fedora to have an

00:43:22,049 --> 00:43:26,400
objective recognized by the fedora

00:43:23,609 --> 00:43:27,989
council to have a relationship with some

00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,819
of the outreach teams like say marketing

00:43:27,989 --> 00:43:32,099
for édouard I know he's been trying to

00:43:29,819 --> 00:43:34,289
do a lot of these things and he's asking

00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:36,630
for ideas and how to how to find these

00:43:34,289 --> 00:43:38,369
things to promote and share and like I

00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:39,749
think of like from having taken the time

00:43:38,369 --> 00:43:41,880
to lead marketing team like I think of

00:43:39,749 --> 00:43:44,309
the talking points that we did for

00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,900
releases like that format was invaluable

00:43:44,309 --> 00:43:48,150
like to me like when I was going to an

00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:50,519
event those talking points were like my

00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:52,109
Bible for what I would I would refer to

00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:54,660
like to freshen up on something before I

00:43:52,109 --> 00:43:57,720
refer the last release as I go to this

00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:59,700
event and they had mixed they had mixed

00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:01,890
reviews about how well used they were

00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:03,210
but that format was invaluable to me and

00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:06,750
I feel like

00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:08,640
having an equivalent format for the

00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:11,310
objectives would be an extremely

00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:13,500
valuable resource for ambassadors and

00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:16,500
for marketing so that's what I kind of

00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:19,080
wanted to just open a topic for

00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:22,530
discussion is better integration of the

00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:28,830
Fedora via via mindshare to the outreach

00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:30,660
teams and weather like and if there's

00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:34,020
not know if it this all makes sense then

00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:36,000
like I think that should we try to drive

00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:38,640
a relationship there and to try to work

00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,359
at a council level as I feel like it's

00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:44,099
very critical to make this relationship

00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:46,200
stronger because I I've had a very I've

00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:48,930
had to work really hard to find this

00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:50,280
information for this event and if I've

00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:53,460
been involved in the project for three

00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:55,710
years and I'm having to go through three

00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:57,030
different legs of email chains just to

00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:58,470
get an answer of like what is our

00:44:57,030 --> 00:45:00,690
objective what do we talk about our

00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:01,980
objective at the Fedora event I know

00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:04,349
there's gonna be very few people they're

00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:07,020
going to do that work to get that

00:45:04,349 --> 00:45:08,730
information so to me I the problem I'm

00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:11,250
trying to solve or I'm trying to solve

00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:13,200
in my head is how do we unearth the

00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:14,430
information from the engineering teams

00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:17,220
like from the engineering side of the

00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:19,619
project to the outreach teams i I think

00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:22,020
it would be good I think it's a good

00:45:19,619 --> 00:45:27,420
idea I think it would be nice if all of

00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:32,990
the objectives would just give us some

00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:36,000
little notes on a basic of what is this

00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:39,650
what should what are some things talking

00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:43,680
points that we should talk about I think

00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:47,240
maybe I'm horribly wrong please correct

00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:50,670
me if I'm wrong but I think that the

00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:53,970
problem you are addressing is hard to

00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:56,460
work on because objective is the future

00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:59,190
in the project not the now in the

00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:00,720
project so how can you reach people if

00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:03,380
this something that is being developed

00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,380
yet

00:46:06,059 --> 00:46:14,680
but mother letter they have three years

00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:20,559
in the main so is the answer that we

00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:24,489
don't talk about our objectives at

00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:29,140
Fedora events like we're so then if if

00:46:24,489 --> 00:46:30,640
these objectives aren't in a place to to

00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:32,859
share or to talk about it they're the

00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:34,239
future then what do our ambassadors what

00:46:32,859 --> 00:46:35,950
is the content we're asking our

00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:39,339
ambassadors to go out and represent and

00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:42,099
advocate for yeah I mean I get your idea

00:46:39,339 --> 00:46:44,950
but at least for me it will always be

00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:47,650
depending on your audience but for

00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:50,049
example for a new comer to go even if

00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:51,999
it's a really good developer just go

00:46:50,049 --> 00:46:55,720
through the whole modularity developing

00:46:51,999 --> 00:46:59,289
it would be really hard so I'm not sure

00:46:55,720 --> 00:47:03,789
it's I'm not saying don't talk about it

00:46:59,289 --> 00:47:06,160
but having keynotes or for real facts of

00:47:03,789 --> 00:47:07,420
what they are doing will be hard if they

00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:10,180
are still working on it

00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:13,809
for example the IOT is still is not a

00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:17,589
siik yet even so they are rather than I

00:47:13,809 --> 00:47:19,359
think that both of you are right I think

00:47:17,589 --> 00:47:20,799
some of our objectives have reached a

00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:22,779
point in their life cycle where they are

00:47:20,799 --> 00:47:24,579
mature enough that there is a message we

00:47:22,779 --> 00:47:26,589
need to convey and you're right that

00:47:24,579 --> 00:47:28,089
other of our objectives are still in the

00:47:26,589 --> 00:47:30,190
development phase and there's not an

00:47:28,089 --> 00:47:33,190
outward bound messaging I think what I

00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:35,410
heard Justin say was for the ones where

00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:37,719
we're supposed to have a message we

00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:39,640
don't know what that message is and we

00:47:37,719 --> 00:47:42,309
need a mechanism by which we discover

00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:45,640
that message so the mindshare committee

00:47:42,309 --> 00:47:47,259
has a representative on council that

00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:50,920
position is currently held by somebody

00:47:47,259 --> 00:47:52,630
who's away so perhaps we should consider

00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:54,579
filling that position with someone else

00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:57,309
for a while and I've already talked to

00:47:54,579 --> 00:47:59,920
the person who's away on so he would be

00:47:57,309 --> 00:48:04,089
okay with it and that would give us a

00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:05,859
platform to bring up during the council

00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:09,069
meetings especially when we're doing

00:48:05,859 --> 00:48:11,380
objective reports for us to look

00:48:09,069 --> 00:48:13,299
somebody like I'll pick on Peter to look

00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:15,960
Peter Robinson in the facing go you just

00:48:13,299 --> 00:48:19,260
gave an objective report on IOT are we

00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:21,960
ready to talk about this or not is there

00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:24,510
a thing here and like last month Peters

00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:26,520
response would have been no we do not

00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:27,960
have a clean build if you go out and

00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:30,450
talk there's literally nothing for

00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:32,430
somewhere to touch I believe next month

00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:34,260
Peters response would be yes there is

00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:36,210
now a thing and it runs on these

00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:38,099
particular boards and this is what we

00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:40,170
could talk about but we can use our

00:48:38,099 --> 00:48:42,660
representative to council to ask those

00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:44,700
questions right now I can ask those

00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:47,280
questions on chair and I've taken a note

00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:49,080
to do so and I think we can frankly open

00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:51,780
a council ticket to request that data

00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:53,700
where it's appropriate because both of

00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:55,260
you are right we want to talk about

00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:56,400
objectives but we don't want to talk

00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:58,760
about the ones that aren't ready to be

00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,760
talked about

00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:19,420
so you can open a ticket in the council

00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:21,730
to require the objective leader to

00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:24,760
inform when they are ready to go out so

00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:27,220
I would say two things the first is the

00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:29,680
objective leads and and the additions do

00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:32,349
present regular reports to council so to

00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:33,760
some degree these teams we all need to

00:49:32,349 --> 00:49:35,410
be willing to listen to the report

00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:37,270
they're producing not demand that they

00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:41,230
reproduce the report in a format we like

00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:43,900
better so we should 100% be paying

00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:45,280
attention to those things and in fact I

00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:47,319
would even challenge this group in

00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:49,510
particular further by saying if you look

00:49:47,319 --> 00:49:51,520
back at the previous council reports

00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:53,800
some of the sub-project reports are

00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:56,349
amazingly good material for things like

00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:58,300
just outright advertising the project in

00:49:56,349 --> 00:49:59,859
gaining mindshare the one that comes to

00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:03,040
my mind most recently is the one on the

00:49:59,859 --> 00:50:06,819
Fedora red team like that was just a

00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:08,290
really good report or the one on the the

00:50:06,819 --> 00:50:09,819
disk thing which I can't remember the

00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:11,290
name of at the moment it was a really

00:50:09,819 --> 00:50:14,230
good report like it's worthy of

00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:16,720
packaging on its own but I think we need

00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:17,970
to listen and not demand the other is

00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:20,410
that I think it's extraordinarily

00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:22,440
reasonable for us to ask Council to do

00:50:20,410 --> 00:50:25,329
something like what documentation did

00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:28,270
documentation asked the program manager

00:50:25,329 --> 00:50:30,730
to modify the change process so that

00:50:28,270 --> 00:50:33,400
release notes are a required part of the

00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:36,010
deliverable so that there's a process

00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:37,480
that recognized the balance between the

00:50:36,010 --> 00:50:39,609
number of contributors we have in

00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:41,920
documentation and the number of change

00:50:39,609 --> 00:50:43,810
makers we had and made it so that Doc's

00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:45,849
could actually integrate to to hopefully

00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:49,030
produce proper release notes with each

00:50:45,849 --> 00:50:51,069
release that's in progress if we have

00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:53,500
something similar we should definitely

00:50:51,069 --> 00:50:57,010
ask for counsel to say hey like you know

00:50:53,500 --> 00:51:00,069
as a part of the objective reports we

00:50:57,010 --> 00:51:01,540
would like to see a summary in there

00:51:00,069 --> 00:51:02,920
that says these are the things we're

00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:05,200
ready to go talk to the world about

00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:07,270
that's one slide that's one set of

00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:09,250
statements whatever that's I think a

00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:10,780
great way for us to both listen and then

00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:12,220
ask for things in a better format

00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:14,980
because if you ask me to give a

00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:16,329
presentation on modularity but you don't

00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:17,859
tell me that's what's important to you I

00:51:16,329 --> 00:51:20,400
may not include it but if you tell me

00:51:17,859 --> 00:51:23,349
what's that's important to you that's a

00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,010
very small incremental level of extra

00:51:23,349 --> 00:51:26,380
work for me

00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:29,680
so we can just be upfront about those

00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:31,359
kinds of asks as well yeah I told him

00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:37,030
for example and I'm going to put myself

00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:42,220
as example in the last the last flea

00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:44,590
sold is the Latin America interns fest

00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:47,320
we hold in whole Latin America I talk

00:51:44,590 --> 00:51:49,210
about modularity but this was me who was

00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:51,430
reaching the information I talked with

00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:53,590
land on top with that and I put all day

00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:57,310
just like they have together and produce

00:51:53,590 --> 00:51:59,619
a slide set for myself but I agree with

00:51:57,310 --> 00:52:04,050
you there should be a place when I can

00:51:59,619 --> 00:52:06,010
just have the keynote to be able to

00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:08,770
understand all this material and put it

00:52:06,010 --> 00:52:10,930
out to the world but for example the

00:52:08,770 --> 00:52:13,390
other example is how can you talk about

00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:15,190
IOT for the riot if you don't have

00:52:13,390 --> 00:52:17,050
anything yet and it's occurring

00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:20,350
objective so do we not we need to have

00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:22,510
this balance and I think we are using

00:52:20,350 --> 00:52:26,290
the council it will be the best thing to

00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:32,140
do using our representative thing in the

00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:33,790
council so couple of months back in

00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:35,590
India we had something in Whipple's

00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:39,400
college it was called the install fest

00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:41,440
slash hackfest so we're shy and gave a

00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:43,660
talk on infrastructure and there was a

00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:45,609
install fest which was going on so what

00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:48,550
we created out of it we created a kind

00:52:45,609 --> 00:52:50,619
of a template of installing Fedora in

00:52:48,550 --> 00:52:52,930
any kind of environment built on bare

00:52:50,619 --> 00:52:55,510
metal virtualization hypervisor server

00:52:52,930 --> 00:52:58,630
cloud workstation whatever that we could

00:52:55,510 --> 00:53:01,450
on a single block of text with links and

00:52:58,630 --> 00:53:03,130
that acted kind of like a template for

00:53:01,450 --> 00:53:06,250
most of the people who wanted to do

00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:08,290
install fest type of events wherever

00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:10,480
they wanted to reproduce then we had to

00:53:08,290 --> 00:53:12,250
do for every release so let's say it was

00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,780
done in twenty seven someone wants to do

00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:16,720
it in twenty eight we just had to update

00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:19,510
the links and it would act like a bare

00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:21,490
minimum Euler plate so let's say if I

00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:23,890
say I want to do a install first I can

00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:26,500
be pointed to one wiki which has all the

00:53:23,890 --> 00:53:28,900
prerequisites whatever that I was what

00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:31,390
I'm supposed to do in that event and how

00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:33,520
and what are kind of an examples as in

00:53:31,390 --> 00:53:36,369
the reports in the blog post of this is

00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:37,359
exactly how people did it they can be

00:53:36,369 --> 00:53:40,089
YouTube videos

00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:42,039
there can be presentation links which

00:53:40,089 --> 00:53:44,619
can be reused over and over again like

00:53:42,039 --> 00:53:47,559
let's say you made a modularity slide I

00:53:44,619 --> 00:53:49,059
can I want to do a modularity event but

00:53:47,559 --> 00:53:51,670
I have no clue what it is

00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:53,769
so probably there can be one template

00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:56,799
which talks about this is even by which

00:53:53,769 --> 00:53:59,710
you reach out to audience if you are

00:53:56,799 --> 00:54:01,839
talking about modularity this has five

00:53:59,710 --> 00:54:05,019
resources one of the resources is your

00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:07,390
slides and I know okay you presented it

00:54:05,019 --> 00:54:10,150
so if I talk to you it's easier for me

00:54:07,390 --> 00:54:12,489
to understand how you reached out what

00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:14,200
your problems were and if I have a

00:54:12,489 --> 00:54:17,170
better solution I can probably implement

00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:19,200
it and when I am done I am supposed to

00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:21,460
share my experiences on the same

00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:24,130
boilerplate template which can be then

00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:25,839
reused and by any other ambassador so

00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:27,970
this is one of the things which I

00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:30,190
learned from Mozilla because they have

00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:31,960
been doing something like this for years

00:54:30,190 --> 00:54:33,430
now so they have something called 12

00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:35,650
reps program which is similar to our

00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:37,269
ambassadors program and they have

00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:40,239
something called assets dot Mozilla a

00:54:37,269 --> 00:54:42,910
talk which has almost all slides shows

00:54:40,239 --> 00:54:44,619
all videos and they have literally even

00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:47,319
templates for all kinds of events that

00:54:44,619 --> 00:54:49,599
they do so if someone comes up with a

00:54:47,319 --> 00:54:51,670
mixed even template they can even create

00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:53,559
their own event template out there and

00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:55,779
say hey you know what we want to do this

00:54:53,559 --> 00:54:58,210
kind of an event and this is how it

00:54:55,779 --> 00:54:59,769
should look like and if let's say they

00:54:58,210 --> 00:55:01,900
run it and then that becomes successful

00:54:59,769 --> 00:55:03,970
we go ahead run it in all other places

00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:07,059
of the world whoever is willing to run

00:55:03,970 --> 00:55:09,700
it that way right and that gives us more

00:55:07,059 --> 00:55:12,519
room to explore because we right now

00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:14,109
have release parties fads hackfest those

00:55:12,519 --> 00:55:16,839
are the only three type of events that

00:55:14,109 --> 00:55:19,059
we generally do and install fest a

00:55:16,839 --> 00:55:21,640
couple of times but we don't have any

00:55:19,059 --> 00:55:24,130
other things like a specific track of

00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:26,259
how things would look like if we have a

00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:28,539
one-day session on let's him what

00:55:26,259 --> 00:55:30,849
modularity is building modules and

00:55:28,539 --> 00:55:32,619
pushing them we probably do not have any

00:55:30,849 --> 00:55:34,869
template or guideline or anything for

00:55:32,619 --> 00:55:37,180
that matter to see how it can be done so

00:55:34,869 --> 00:55:39,400
if that can be put out somewhere it's

00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:41,400
easier for almost all the advocates and

00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:44,060
ambassador's to refer that as a

00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:46,520
permanent boilerplate

00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:48,860
unless I mean you know always approved

00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:51,050
by council as a source of document which

00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:53,840
can be referred to and then if something

00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:56,090
changes we changed that and anyone can

00:55:53,840 --> 00:56:06,230
repeat Andrey execute at any part of the

00:55:56,090 --> 00:56:09,530
world in actually just thinking and top

00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:11,600
of my head an object lived probably is

00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:15,050
going to say you the documentation is

00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:18,260
there you know the if you go through

00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:20,270
them through the council documentation

00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:21,680
there is a part of talking about the

00:56:20,270 --> 00:56:26,720
adjective maybe it's just one paragraph

00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:28,550
but yeah but I worry they're going to

00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:31,160
say this is the key point of the

00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:32,960
objective if you want to be deeper than

00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:37,820
that go to a meeting or something I

00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:39,830
don't know I mean I'm just making an

00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:41,300
assumption that if they don't willing to

00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:45,790
help bad that I don't know they it's not

00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:45,790
that way but the information is there I

00:56:49,690 --> 00:56:54,410
just want to confirm that because I'm I

00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:57,700
think I'm the worst packager in the

00:56:54,410 --> 00:57:00,170
world but even I got it done to teach

00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:04,790
packaging with the documentation that we

00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:07,610
have in fedora and go to your places and

00:57:04,790 --> 00:57:10,130
teach people how to stop packaging and I

00:57:07,610 --> 00:57:13,250
think that can also be done with new

00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:18,250
stuff but it's right the documentation

00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:22,730
maybe needs to be updated for new stuff

00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:25,190
if it's specific specifically for the

00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:26,840
objective documentation I find that that

00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:30,280
documentation is written for a very

00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:34,220
technical audience not the audience of

00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:37,370
ambassadors or outreach teams so finding

00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:38,960
a bridge there is I guess why I'm a

00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:40,190
little bit mix that's of just like kind

00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,690
of like chalking it up that if the

00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:43,370
information is there you have to just go

00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:45,770
and dig for it and find it because it's

00:57:43,370 --> 00:57:47,810
like if the answer is like to watch a 60

00:57:45,770 --> 00:57:50,900
minute video to find the five minute

00:57:47,810 --> 00:57:52,640
piece that I'm really looking for I have

00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:53,900
to summarize how I want to relay that

00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:56,210
information and

00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:57,619
I got an event am I really understanding

00:57:56,210 --> 00:58:00,920
that or am I just like repeating this

00:57:57,619 --> 00:58:02,750
five minutes piece that was like seemed

00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:05,839
it relevant for me like I don't know I

00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:08,109
get it's I think I think you you've

00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:10,730
you've touched on it there which is

00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:13,130
there are talks I will not give about

00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:14,750
fedora because I am not and this is not

00:58:13,130 --> 00:58:16,789
impostor syndrome but I am just not

00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:19,609
technically competent in that area I

00:58:16,789 --> 00:58:22,369
have a package that I maintain I would

00:58:19,609 --> 00:58:24,529
never lead a packaging workshop because

00:58:22,369 --> 00:58:26,109
I've literally done my one package I

00:58:24,529 --> 00:58:28,369
can't tell you any of the other

00:58:26,109 --> 00:58:30,680
idiosyncrasies that occur in packaging

00:58:28,369 --> 00:58:31,880
other things on the other hand and I'm

00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:34,220
picking on Jared because he's not

00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:37,299
looking at me I expect Jared could leave

00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:41,000
a packaging workshop literally right now

00:58:37,299 --> 00:58:43,220
because he's done so much packaging and

00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:45,049
so I guess I would turn that around by

00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:47,329
saying one of the things that the

00:58:45,049 --> 00:58:48,980
advocate program emphasized was the idea

00:58:47,329 --> 00:58:50,960
that you should be an existing

00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:52,700
contributor in an area of the project

00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:56,180
one of the things that I heard you say

00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:59,089
was that the original ambassador cadre

00:58:56,180 --> 00:59:01,400
in Fedora were all like CLA plus ten

00:58:59,089 --> 00:59:04,279
because they were extraordinarily active

00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:05,990
people in the project as we bring on

00:59:04,279 --> 00:59:09,020
people in the project whose first

00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:10,549
objective is advocacy I think that

00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:13,730
they're going to need to make decisions

00:59:10,549 --> 00:59:16,190
about what they're competent as well as

00:59:13,730 --> 00:59:18,079
comfortable to speak about and in some

00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:20,960
cases the challenge you're running into

00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:23,270
is that objective X did a crappy job of

00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:24,920
conveying their information and in some

00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:27,170
cases what you may be running into is

00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:28,880
that you are not able to present on

00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:31,039
objective X because you don't have time

00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:32,930
to delve into it and learn it even if

00:59:31,039 --> 00:59:35,420
you potentially have those skills and

00:59:32,930 --> 00:59:36,950
then I guarantee that we could sit down

00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:39,549
and come up with an objective that

00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:42,289
neither of us will ever understand

00:59:39,549 --> 00:59:44,529
because it's just in an area of math or

00:59:42,289 --> 00:59:47,390
science or something that we don't have

00:59:44,529 --> 00:59:49,309
so like I don't want ambassadors to ever

00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:51,260
at least personal opinion here not FK

00:59:49,309 --> 00:59:52,940
but personal opinion I don't want an

00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:54,829
ambassador to feel compelled to give a

00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:56,900
talk on a topic they don't understand

00:59:54,829 --> 00:59:58,460
I don't want an ambassador to ever feel

00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:59,720
compelled to give a talk on the topic

00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:01,160
they don't agree with or don't care

00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:03,380
about

01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:05,329
but I do want somebody to be able to go

01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:06,920
you know my heart and soul is in acts

01:00:05,329 --> 01:00:08,960
and I'm gonna go out and talk about it

01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:11,359
and then the committee can you know the

01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:12,349
project the committee the project can

01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:14,630
make the decision about how much

01:00:12,349 --> 01:00:16,460
financial resource we wish to commit to

01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:18,950
that message but we're not gonna block

01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:20,210
you um and if you're having trouble

01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:21,140
finding the information on the objective

01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:22,730
we need to figure out which of those

01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:24,680
three it is and if it's just crappy

01:00:22,730 --> 01:00:26,420
information dispersal let's go back to

01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:28,789
those guys if it's they're not ready yet

01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:30,680
let's understand that yeah and if it's

01:00:28,789 --> 01:00:32,480
you're not ready yet let's also be

01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:33,829
willing to look you in the face and go I

01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:35,780
don't know that you're ready to take

01:00:33,829 --> 01:00:40,549
this to that audience is it really the

01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:43,760
right audience for this message because

01:00:40,549 --> 01:00:46,220
even even if you have a slideshow like

01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:50,299
if we do have some sort of pre-made

01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:53,089
slideshow for modularity and you have no

01:00:50,299 --> 01:00:55,490
idea what the heck modularity is you're

01:00:53,089 --> 01:00:57,170
gonna be standing up you might be

01:00:55,490 --> 01:01:00,740
standing up there looking at me like

01:00:57,170 --> 01:01:08,270
well this says we have this thing called

01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:10,640
modularity and it is good and so I think

01:01:08,270 --> 01:01:13,010
I think having pre-made resources is a

01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:16,279
very good thing because it can help you

01:01:13,010 --> 01:01:19,640
like okay I know a little of what

01:01:16,279 --> 01:01:22,760
modularity is and I might would be able

01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:26,210
to talk about it if I had some more

01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:28,369
resources because all I know really is

01:01:26,210 --> 01:01:31,970
what it is and it lets you install

01:01:28,369 --> 01:01:35,630
different versions of package packages

01:01:31,970 --> 01:01:37,640
or I guess they call them streams but I

01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:39,799
don't really know enough that I could

01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:42,410
just say I'm gonna go talk about

01:01:39,799 --> 01:01:46,160
modularity but with resources probably

01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:49,480
good but like Max was saying sometimes I

01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:53,990
think you just have to go based on what

01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:57,049
you're familiar with too and with regard

01:01:53,990 --> 01:02:00,980
to events there's also trying to recruit

01:01:57,049 --> 01:02:04,640
people to come to the event like last

01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:06,730
year I was planning Lisa which I forgot

01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:09,799
what it started sans for large

01:02:06,730 --> 01:02:15,469
installation system administration

01:02:09,799 --> 01:02:18,349
I think and so I were trying to plan it

01:02:15,469 --> 01:02:21,890
and I was like well this conference is

01:02:18,349 --> 01:02:25,839
about systems administration why don't I

01:02:21,890 --> 01:02:29,089
get someone from Fedora in front to come

01:02:25,839 --> 01:02:33,259
be it to come help but that event

01:02:29,089 --> 01:02:34,969
so Ricky Elrod who is an ambassador but

01:02:33,259 --> 01:02:36,859
it doesn't do a whole lot with

01:02:34,969 --> 01:02:40,609
ambassadors I got ahold of him and he

01:02:36,859 --> 01:02:43,729
said yeah sure he would come and so it

01:02:40,609 --> 01:02:47,150
works sometimes it can be useful to get

01:02:43,729 --> 01:02:52,029
people with certain knowledge depending

01:02:47,150 --> 01:02:52,029
on what the target of the event is

01:02:52,359 --> 01:02:57,829
actually that's one of the other points

01:02:55,039 --> 01:03:00,799
I want to heat in the ambassador's

01:02:57,829 --> 01:03:03,439
ground is that maybe you are willing to

01:03:00,799 --> 01:03:06,079
talk and you want to organize event but

01:03:03,439 --> 01:03:07,969
you is it's impossible that you are the

01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:10,400
one that know everything in the project

01:03:07,969 --> 01:03:12,499
every objective every Python see every

01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:15,140
working group but you need to be able to

01:03:12,499 --> 01:03:16,819
know how to reach them and if you don't

01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:18,469
know at least just you should be able to

01:03:16,819 --> 01:03:20,170
go to the joystick that's supposed to

01:03:18,469 --> 01:03:24,259
have these objectives to lead people

01:03:20,170 --> 01:03:25,759
into the right groups and then they can

01:03:24,259 --> 01:03:28,369
teach you you know what you need to talk

01:03:25,759 --> 01:03:30,859
to with this guy and we also possibly

01:03:28,369 --> 01:03:35,410
could make some sort of wiki page or

01:03:30,859 --> 01:03:39,519
something of who might be interested in

01:03:35,410 --> 01:03:42,140
talking speaking about X Y Z

01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:43,999
yeah maybe why not maybe just do a list

01:03:42,140 --> 01:03:47,119
you know while we are looking for people

01:03:43,999 --> 01:03:49,009
that is willing to help me in a talk if

01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:50,989
you have a topic just period yourself in

01:03:49,009 --> 01:03:53,499
there yeah that's a good idea

01:03:50,989 --> 01:03:56,719
it doesn't have to be them committing to

01:03:53,499 --> 01:03:59,599
doing it anytime someone asks but just a

01:03:56,719 --> 01:04:02,779
list of hey I might be interested in

01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:05,959
doing this so a list of people to

01:04:02,779 --> 01:04:08,989
contact and say hey I'm thinking about

01:04:05,959 --> 01:04:13,069
that we should do whatever would you be

01:04:08,989 --> 01:04:15,619
interested in coming speaking here or

01:04:13,069 --> 01:04:18,739
even like we didn't have a talk at Lisa

01:04:15,619 --> 01:04:19,940
but we focused on fedora server at our

01:04:18,739 --> 01:04:23,390
table

01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:25,480
so um personal preference I prefer to do

01:04:23,390 --> 01:04:28,339
things rather than build infrastructure

01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:30,619
I did an event last year in Lithuania

01:04:28,339 --> 01:04:33,980
it wasn't funded from Fedor's money but

01:04:30,619 --> 01:04:35,780
it was for fedora and I literally sent

01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:37,430
an email out to the bail list and I said

01:04:35,780 --> 01:04:39,950
hey we're going to this event these are

01:04:37,430 --> 01:04:41,900
the topics we want to hit to people I

01:04:39,950 --> 01:04:43,760
had never met the Fedora community came

01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:45,349
forward and said hey we can do this this

01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:46,700
is our bona fides this is why we're

01:04:45,349 --> 01:04:47,710
qualified to talk to this particular

01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:50,270
audience

01:04:47,710 --> 01:04:52,700
we all went to Lithuania we had a

01:04:50,270 --> 01:04:54,770
fantastic booth talking to a bunch of

01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:56,480
generally closed-source developers who

01:04:54,770 --> 01:04:59,839
were terribly interested in what we had

01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:01,490
to say but I didn't know who like I I

01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:03,260
didn't know who to go to in our

01:05:01,490 --> 01:05:05,780
community to find out who has a

01:05:03,260 --> 01:05:08,030
background working with dotnet or or

01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:10,220
working in closed source c-sharp shop

01:05:08,030 --> 01:05:12,109
but instead I asked to set a questions

01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:13,789
over to fellows like let's use the

01:05:12,109 --> 01:05:16,520
resources we already have we have this

01:05:13,789 --> 01:05:18,650
amazing community if the Ambassador

01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:21,020
generates the event put it out there I

01:05:18,650 --> 01:05:22,430
know you I saw some of your emails and

01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:23,869
so I don't want to I don't want to anger

01:05:22,430 --> 01:05:25,730
you by making it sound stupidly easy

01:05:23,869 --> 01:05:26,930
because I watched you struggle and I

01:05:25,730 --> 01:05:29,599
wasn't just watching you struggle with

01:05:26,930 --> 01:05:31,190
amusement but like I did watch you

01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:33,109
struggle to try and gather the right

01:05:31,190 --> 01:05:34,609
kind of information and what that really

01:05:33,109 --> 01:05:36,140
felt more like to me was we as a

01:05:34,609 --> 01:05:38,599
community weren't ready to address a

01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:40,339
college audience and that's something

01:05:38,599 --> 01:05:41,720
that I would much prefer us say hey it's

01:05:40,339 --> 01:05:43,279
mine share we think that's important

01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:45,309
we're gonna raise an objective around

01:05:43,279 --> 01:05:49,220
that mm-hmm

01:05:45,309 --> 01:05:51,289
so one other thing I wanted to just say

01:05:49,220 --> 01:05:54,799
we have about five minutes left

01:05:51,289 --> 01:05:56,420
yeah so I was going to mention like even

01:05:54,799 --> 01:05:58,010
though I know I brought that up but we

01:05:56,420 --> 01:05:59,470
don't have a ticketed item for that I

01:05:58,010 --> 01:06:02,119
was also one thing I wanted to try to

01:05:59,470 --> 01:06:04,730
fit in for this session was to talk

01:06:02,119 --> 01:06:05,930
about our workflow as mindshare

01:06:04,730 --> 01:06:08,390
Committee because I've noticed that

01:06:05,930 --> 01:06:09,650
we've kind of had and I've just been

01:06:08,390 --> 01:06:10,910
like the recent last few months but I

01:06:09,650 --> 01:06:14,240
feel like we've kind of stagnated with

01:06:10,910 --> 01:06:15,950
some of our our response time for

01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:18,140
tickets and other items on our own

01:06:15,950 --> 01:06:20,000
personal agenda so I was wanting to try

01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:21,589
to find some room for discussion of ways

01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,640
of our own workflow and like as I was

01:06:21,589 --> 01:06:25,480
looking at the ticket queue and there's

01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:27,799
a lot of tickets that that we still have

01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:29,299
haven't been responded to or we haven't

01:06:27,799 --> 01:06:31,400
had a chance to revisit or go back to

01:06:29,299 --> 01:06:33,140
and it's like I know why we're doing

01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:33,380
this reminds me of our fad and we had a

01:06:33,140 --> 01:06:36,860
lot of

01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:39,110
really strong great ideas and we we left

01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:41,360
the fad with those and we were we note

01:06:39,110 --> 01:06:43,100
but we weren't able to keep that

01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:45,710
momentum rolling after the fad as much

01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:48,170
so I was just trying to think of ways we

01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:50,380
could try to streamline that and make

01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:53,150
some of our own work more visible and

01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:55,550
now I just wanted to kind of open that

01:06:53,150 --> 01:06:58,670
topic I think I just need to pay

01:06:55,550 --> 01:07:00,260
attention to Packer more I mean but I

01:06:58,670 --> 01:07:08,500
don't know if that's individually a

01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:10,640
single person yeah thank oh our meeting

01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:12,140
so I think there's a couple of things

01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:13,580
there now that you've opened that open

01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:16,880
the proverbial can of worms I'm gonna

01:07:13,580 --> 01:07:18,410
I'm gonna wiggle a little bit number one

01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:20,690
is we've got to have people show up to

01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:22,370
meetings and find a meeting time that

01:07:20,690 --> 01:07:24,140
works so if you're on mind chair and you

01:07:22,370 --> 01:07:26,180
have not filled this out yet get it

01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:28,250
filled out hopefully everybody in the

01:07:26,180 --> 01:07:36,339
room has do we have any times that work

01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:39,849
for everyone right

01:07:36,339 --> 01:07:39,849
right the sec

01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:49,140
right that's the second thing I was

01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:51,690
going to point out is is we need to be

01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:53,220
better at responding to email to each

01:07:51,690 --> 01:07:55,230
other on that on the on the mailing list

01:07:53,220 --> 01:07:57,270
and third we need to be better about

01:07:55,230 --> 01:07:58,590
reporting what we're doing if it's not

01:07:57,270 --> 01:07:59,940
monthly at least every other month have

01:07:58,590 --> 01:08:07,440
a report say hey this is what my teacher

01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:08,730
is doing we've done since we

01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:10,560
consistently have a difficult time with

01:08:08,730 --> 01:08:12,210
scheduling a meeting and trying to drive

01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:14,330
our work through meetings and especially

01:08:12,210 --> 01:08:17,280
since this group is trying to do this

01:08:14,330 --> 01:08:19,950
internet international representation of

01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:23,190
the entire world this is why I'm trying

01:08:19,950 --> 01:08:25,650
to figure out like does a meeting driven

01:08:23,190 --> 01:08:28,050
body make sense for this group if we

01:08:25,650 --> 01:08:30,120
have a difficult time finding a single

01:08:28,050 --> 01:08:32,010
hour or even in 30 minutes for us all to

01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:33,810
be sitting down at the keyboard does it

01:08:32,010 --> 01:08:35,700
make sense for us to try to experiment

01:08:33,810 --> 01:08:37,350
with a different like we're using a

01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:40,160
ticket driven workflow but can we do

01:08:37,350 --> 01:08:40,160
that asynchronously

01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:56,550
that's back on I'm I'm I'm I'm happy to

01:08:54,420 --> 01:09:01,410
experiment on on asynchronous workflows

01:08:56,550 --> 01:09:02,880
I am concerned that that it's only gonna

01:09:01,410 --> 01:09:06,180
make things worse rather than make

01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:08,960
things better but the outlets let's

01:09:06,180 --> 01:09:08,960
