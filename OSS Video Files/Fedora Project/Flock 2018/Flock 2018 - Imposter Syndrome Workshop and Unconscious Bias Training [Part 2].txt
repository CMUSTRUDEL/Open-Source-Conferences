Talk: Imposter Syndrome Workshop and Unconscious Bias Training
Presenters: Jona Azizaj, Justin W. Flory, Bee Padalkar, Amita Sharma

Description: This session will involve a one hour Imposter Syndrome workshop followed by an hour long Unconscious Bias training.

What is Imposter Syndrome and why we need to discuss it?
Impostor Syndrome is the feeling that you aren’t actually qualified for the work you are doing and will be discovered as a fraud. It is prevalent amongst a lot of members of open tech/culture, especially people from underrepresented backgrounds, many of whom have been socialised to value other’s opinion of their work above their own, and to do things “by the book.”

What to expect from attending the Imposter Syndrome workshop?
The workshop will enable attendees to understand, identify and talk about impostor syndrome and provide some guidelines on managing it during our day-to-day life.

What to expect from Unconscious Bias training and why is it relevant?
People make, and sometimes act on, snap judgments based on the other person’s race, without any conscious intention. The training will begin with demonstrations of how the mind operates in such ways that are outside of conscious awareness or control. We will then move on to enable attendees to understand and identify such interactions in their daily life and will provide suggestions on how to be more inclusive in such collaborative environments. I feel that in a diverse and collaborative community like Fedora, it is important for us to be able to learn to identify our implicit biases in order to have effective and inclusive communication.

Further notes:

The Imposter Syndrome Workshop and Unconscious Bias Training will be adapted from training resources and guidelines from Ada Initiative and Google from Fedora community and my prior experience in this area. I am welcome to suggestions about more resources.

This session is a part of Diversity and Inclusion Team activities and we feel that conducting this workshop and training at FLOCK will allow us to have a wider and better impact on Fedora community in these directions.

Attendees are welcome to attend either of the sessions individually i.e. You can join/leave at the one hour mark when the second session begins. The first session will be Imposter Syndrome workshop. The second session will be Unconscious Bias training.

all right so I think we'll go ahead and

00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:04,950
get started with the second half of this

00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:07,259
session for the unconscious bias

00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,580
training workshop so the way this will

00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:10,950
be structures will spend a little bit of

00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:15,630
time to explain what is unconscious bias

00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:17,670
and then we're going to do a short game

00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,920
that'll be most of the of the workshop

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,240
so what I'm going to kind of get us all

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,939
on the same page so this will be pretty

00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:27,960
quick for what we cover the unconscious

00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:31,380
bias so what is unconscious bias it's

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,540
this idea that so this I think is a

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,550
great way to start by explaining this so

00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:41,149
approximately every day we receive 40

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:46,289
million bits of information 99.999% of

00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:48,120
what we can process is in the or we

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:49,620
receive like the glacier is like 40

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,719
million bits of information we receive

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:55,050
in a day but in reality we're only able

00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,280
to actually process 40 bits at a time so

00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,600
you can kind of see like what is

00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,850
represented here is that you're only

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,979
able to actively understand to see

00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:10,580
hardly less than 1% of the information

00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:13,920
you receive like the things you were

00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:16,470
stand-in or information you see in a day

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,960
so the idea of unconscious bias is that

00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,490
everyone has their own different biases

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,840
or perspectives their own different

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,720
experiences that they've had in their

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:30,030
life that skew the way that they see

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:31,530
things as what someone else might see so

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,570
this one is kind of getting at it that

00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,549
we all kind of bring our own

00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:38,850
perspectives our own experiences into

00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:41,990
the workplace into collaborating with

00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:44,640
other people and those biases can

00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:46,350
influence us for how we work with other

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,240
people the way that we work with other

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,549
people the way we make other people feel

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,000
when we're working together with them

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:56,520
and the idea of unconscious bias is it

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,140
just like how 99% of the information we

00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,600
receive in a day we we don't really

00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:03,960
process a lot of times the biases that

00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:06,149
we're bringing in we don't really notice

00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,220
or understand ourselves so the idea of

00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:10,860
an unconscious bias training is to help

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:13,260
bring awareness to some of the our own

00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,860
biases or our own perspectives of things

00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,200
that we bring

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:20,010
into a collaborating with other people

00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,660
or working with others and so this one

00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:23,190
is kind of getting at the idea that when

00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,840
we are aware of those biases we

00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,340
understand these different perspectives

00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,560
that other people are bringing in to a

00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:31,860
project or a team an open source

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,780
community we are able to take the best

00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,160
pieces that everyone is offering and

00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,200
what everyone is bringing to the table

00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,350
when we can work together with other

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:43,680
people to collaborate and appreciate the

00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:45,450
diversity of thought and what everyone

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,560
is bringing to the table when we take a

00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:51,960
moment to realize that not everyone has

00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,420
gone through the same experiences that

00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,290
we've had to to get to the table not

00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,360
everyone has gone through the same

00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:01,410
things to be here in this room right now

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,720
it can help us understand be more

00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:07,770
empathetic for other people and

00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,790
understand that have some more empathy

00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,530
for what they're bringing to the table

00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,430
and have a chance to listen to them just

00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,850
like in the keynote we heard this

00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:17,490
morning taking the time to listen before

00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:20,850
you speak and understand what other

00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:24,980
people are bringing to the conversation

00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:26,610
to the project to the community so now

00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:29,070
no more talking

00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:31,530
we're gonna play a game and everyone's

00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:33,390
going to have to stand up and the way

00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:36,690
this is going to work everyone will come

00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:38,250
over to the right side of the room and

00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:41,040
we're all going you everyone's going to

00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:43,530
start in the same place in a straight

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,140
line by the chair that's facing

00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:47,880
backwards and so I want to do a

00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:50,670
disclaimer in the beginning this is a

00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:53,100
game where there is no winner and no

00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:56,970
loser so there's no prize for this game

00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:59,220
but it's just one that it's more of an

00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:01,650
experience than it is a winning a losing

00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:03,120
game so everyone can stand up and you

00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:05,280
can come over to the side of the room

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,420
and I'm sorry for the recording but

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,320
we're probably not going to be able use

00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,320
the microphone as much

00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:20,090
this game is I'm going to read a series

00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:22,300
of state and depending on the response

00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:24,650
you're going to take one step forward

00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:28,310
what you're going to take one step

00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:30,950
backward in a minute so everyone will

00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:48,050
start a straight line and equal distance

00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:51,010
here facing this direction so one step

00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:51,010
is going to be

00:04:59,769 --> 00:05:02,769
yeah

00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:14,630
so you cannot like line up against

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:18,020
missed you so one step be one step it's

00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:22,970
not not not Elite a leapfrog step but

00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:24,680
just a a small step and so I'm gonna

00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:27,370
read a series of these statements from

00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,370
the front pony

00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:35,250
and and this is also going to be a while

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,219
we're playing the game it's going to be

00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,900
a more reflective silent activity for

00:05:38,219 --> 00:05:42,000
you to think about while we're going

00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:44,129
through it so I will read the statements

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,080
aloud so please take one step forward or

00:05:44,129 --> 00:05:47,370
backward if a statement applies to you

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,830
if you don't feel comfortable

00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:52,169
acknowledging a statement that applies

00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:54,870
to you you don't have to move when it's

00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:57,210
read no one else will know whether it

00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,289
applies to you or not so there'll be a

00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:00,270
little bit of a chance for you to think

00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:02,280
out each statement if you don't feel

00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:09,330
comfortable you don't have to take a

00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:12,479
step I will say you there take a step

00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:17,009
forward or a step back I'll say it in

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:21,469
each each question all right so if you

00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:21,469
are right-handed take one step forward

00:06:22,219 --> 00:06:30,599
if English is your first language take

00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:33,539
one step forward if one or both of your

00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:37,379
parents have a university degree take

00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:40,560
one step forward if you can find

00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:43,409
bandages or band-aids at a mainstream

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:47,759
store that match or blend in with your

00:06:43,409 --> 00:06:49,589
skin tone take one step forward if you

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,050
can find like a bandage or some kind of

00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:53,759
like band-aid that matches your skin

00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:58,080
tone or blends in with your skin tone

00:06:53,759 --> 00:07:01,080
take one step forward if you rely or

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:05,419
have relied on primarily public

00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,419
transportation take one step back

00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:11,780
if you have attended previous schools

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,330
with people or if you have worked in

00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:17,060
offices or workplaces with people you

00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:21,919
felt were like yourself take one step

00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:23,990
forward if you have attended a school or

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,569
university or if you have worked in an

00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:29,030
office or workplace with people you felt

00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:33,650
like we're like you that you identified

00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:35,840
with take one step forward if you

00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:40,970
constantly feel unsafe walking alone at

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:43,539
night take one step back if your

00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:47,300

00:07:43,539 --> 00:07:51,949
servants gardeners or cleaners take one

00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:54,500
step forward if you are able to move

00:07:51,949 --> 00:08:00,979
through the world without fear of sexual

00:07:54,500 --> 00:08:02,900
assault take one step forward if you

00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:06,080
studied the culture of your ancestors in

00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:11,330
grade school or elementary school take

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:13,159
one step forward if you often felt

00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:15,590
growing up that your parents were too

00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:20,780
busy to spend time with you take one

00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:23,389
step back if you were ever made fun of

00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:26,360
or bullied for something you could not

00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:29,110
change or was beyond your control take

00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,110

if your family has ever left your

00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:36,000

calling the police when trouble occurs

00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:56,100

00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:05,820
able to play a significant role in a

00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:07,710
project or an activity because of a

00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:13,800
skill or something you learned

00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:16,500
previously take one step forward yeah so

00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,610
significant role in a project or

00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:25,740
activity because of a talent you gained

00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:27,360
previously take one step forward if you

00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,030

ridicule or violence take one step

or we're hungry because there was not

00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:48,960
enough money to buy food take one step

00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:54,410
back if you feel respected for your

00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:54,410
career performance take one step forward

00:09:54,500 --> 00:10:02,220
if you have a physically visible

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:04,670
disability take one step back if you

00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:08,420
have an invisible illness or disability

00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,420
take one step back

00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:15,009
if you were ever discouraged from an

00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:19,089
activity because of race class ethnicity

00:10:15,009 --> 00:10:24,740
gender disability or sexual orientation

00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:27,850
take one step back if you ever tried to

00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:31,699
change your appearance mannerisms or

00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:36,500
behavior to fit in more take one step

00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:41,689
back if you've ever been profiled

00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:47,389
by someone else using stereotypes take

00:10:41,689 --> 00:10:49,600
one step back if you feel good about how

00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:56,860
your identity is portrayed in the media

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:56,860
news social media take one step forward

00:10:57,819 --> 00:11:03,379
if you were ever accepted for something

00:11:00,589 --> 00:11:05,389
you applied to only because of your

00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:11,899
association with a friend or family

00:11:05,389 --> 00:11:13,370
member take one step forward if you're

00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:18,769
all of your family has health insurance

00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:20,630
take one step forward if you have ever

00:11:18,769 --> 00:11:22,720
been spoken over because you could not

00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:26,560
articulate your thoughts fast enough

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,560
take one step back

00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:33,860
if someone has ever spoken for you when

00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:38,540
you did not want them to do so take one

00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:40,850
step back if there was ever substance

00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:45,320
abuse in your household take one step

00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:50,750
back if you come from a single-parent

00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:53,170
household take one step back if you live

00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:58,490
in an area with crime and drug activity

00:11:53,170 --> 00:12:00,680
take one step back if someone in your

00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:06,260
household suffered or suffers from

00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:08,930
mental illness take one step back if you

00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:15,500
have been or have known a victim of

00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:17,360
sexual harassment take one step back if

00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:20,360
you were ever uncomfortable about a joke

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:24,440
related to your race religion ethnicity

00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:26,990
gender disability or sexual orientation

00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:32,450
but felt unsafe to confront the

00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:34,610
situation take one step back if you are

00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:36,860
never asked to speak on behalf of a

00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:43,250
group of people who share an identity as

00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:45,530
you take one step forward if you can

00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:49,370
make mistakes and not have people

00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:52,430
attribute your behavior to flaws in your

00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:54,100
racial or gender group take one step

00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:56,810
forward

00:12:54,100 --> 00:13:02,060
if you always assumed you'd go to

00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:03,650
college take one step forward if you

00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:07,870
have more than 50 books in your

00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:07,870
household take one step forward

00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:12,339
if your parents told you growing up that

00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:18,980
you could be anything you want it to be

00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:21,440
take one step forward so go ahead and

00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:24,889
take a moment to look around you and

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:28,519
where you are in the room and where

00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:31,970
other people in the room are as well and

00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:34,910
just take a quiet moment just to think

00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:37,550
and think about some of the questions

00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:40,540
that were asked and you know what's

00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,540
going through your mind right now

00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:00,420
and so the rest of this workshop will be

00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:02,100
kind of like a roundtable discussion so

00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:04,980
we can all just kind of sit at this

00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,899
group of chairs and have a quick

00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:10,589
conversation and ask some questions so

00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:12,180
one thing about these questions you

00:14:10,589 --> 00:14:13,560
don't have to respond no one has to

00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:16,199
answer for any of these if you do not

00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:19,310
feel comfortable answering but if you

00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:22,740
want to share or add a perspective

00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:24,449
you're welcome to answer now I want this

00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:27,149
to be I don't want to be up here talking

00:14:24,449 --> 00:14:29,550
at a podium talking at you but I want to

00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:32,459
be happy I want to have an honest

00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:36,569
conversation talk person-to-person with

00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:39,209
this so they don't have a feeling of

00:14:36,569 --> 00:14:42,899
what it feel like to be in the front of

00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:45,410
the group or to be in the middle or to

00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:45,410
be in the back

00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,870
the no one has to answer you just want

00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:02,540
to

00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:04,779
think about the question in your own

00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,779
head

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,950
so to me I

00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,950
No

00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:27,280
not important that someone happened

00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:45,029
the gender difference

00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:17,580
over some of the factors that never

00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:19,590
thought about before before doing this

00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:23,360
exercise things

00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:26,440
really consider thought about or

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,440
but watching here

00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:07,810
probably

00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,360
I think what makes

00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:59,740
so they're all related

00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:20,600
the next question I had was if there was

00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:23,539
a moment when you were standing next to

00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:26,179
someone and you broke your position in

00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:29,380
line either forward or backward how did

00:20:26,179 --> 00:20:29,380
you feel in that moment

00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:49,650
even even when uber says it's worth any

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,650
other

00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:55,619
it metrical it

00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,240
I have that

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,619
really so

00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:09,450
but which of the statements made you

00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:13,760
think the most and you could navigate to

00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:13,760
add a question what statement

00:23:49,169 --> 00:23:52,169
and

00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:31,350
are the way they are losing is

00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:58,159
I think it

00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:23,410
nice

00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:41,050
boys

00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,080
in whatever way

00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:39,190
one of the other questions I had was

00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:42,450
what do you wish people knew about one

00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:45,370
of the identities situations or

00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:48,090
disadvantages that caused you to take a

00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:48,090
step backwards

00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,450
well in

00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:11,860
the question is what do you wish people

00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:15,470
knew about one of the identities

00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:19,060
situations or disadvantages that caused

00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:19,060
you to take a step backwards

00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:26,300
and then

00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:27,980
anyone can always go back and answer any

00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:29,840
of the other questions but the last one

00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:32,210
I had and this was one I kind of want to

00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:34,880
hear from everyone that participated

00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:38,980
with this but was how can your

00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:41,330
understanding of your privileges or your

00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:43,430
marginalization z' improve your

00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:45,970
relationships with yourself and with

00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:45,970
other people

00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:03,950
but we might have in the back of our

00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:07,399
minds to get to really see and actually

00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:09,139
visualize that so this is kind of what I

00:32:07,399 --> 00:32:13,100
want to hear or prepare at one's

00:32:09,139 --> 00:32:15,110
perspective on how you feel like this

00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:18,289
might change the how you work with other

00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:20,629
people or there's something that you

00:32:18,289 --> 00:32:22,100
haven't thought about before meeting

00:32:20,629 --> 00:32:25,999
like an open source project Ecuador oh

00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:27,590
and you're personalizing it from here if

00:32:25,999 --> 00:32:28,999
this is something that you found value

00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:33,519
or you're staying

00:32:28,999 --> 00:32:33,519
like change the way you think about

00:32:35,419 --> 00:32:42,570
what things you felt like you please

00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:44,990
your big takeaway you're big you're big

00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:44,990
things

00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:59,610
we are all the same

00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:22,120
somebody else works harder together

00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:22,120
didn't what's the other

00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:46,480
yeah

00:33:49,669 --> 00:33:52,669
morons

00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:06,210
working with people especially

00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:07,860
especially I think it's really known

00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:09,659
that an open source and they have so

00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:12,810
many of us will do our interaction with

00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:17,129
each other is text I are singing there

00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:18,710
your tickets panelists and that a very

00:34:17,129 --> 00:34:24,050
interpersonal

00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:24,050
very asynchronous

00:34:28,669 --> 00:34:33,940
that I love like convert to that block

00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:33,940
and we have somebody

00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:40,980
but a background respect

00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:45,399
or partner be here

00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,570
yes

00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:06,810
their background

00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:18,790
I think about these things and I have

00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:23,490
basement head-on

00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:25,470
these letters

00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:45,690
I

00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:02,429
[Music]

00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:15,400
these

00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,700
makes it

00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:39,460
yes

00:37:54,500 --> 00:38:00,510
Yago wake up i slather somebody sleeping

00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:00,510
yes

00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:08,970
you

00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:18,450
I said

00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,450
see

00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:49,020
within this

00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:52,819
the minimum vehicle things to be in that

00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:52,819
space and

00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:19,150
like my first one and so I really never

00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:22,420
invest with the idea of everything

00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:22,420
this activity

00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:29,170
so actually I think we should realize

00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:31,450
I'm kinetic towards the

00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:34,059
so like I really got

00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:36,809
and real meaning of fishery - definitely

00:39:34,059 --> 00:39:36,809
not happy like

00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:40,750
like that

00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:59,020
I think that's actually all that we had

00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:00,810
left oh there was a quick do you want to

00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:03,550
cover this one B or do you want me to

00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:06,340
okay so these were just some kind of

00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:09,730
takeaways for how you can actually work

00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:12,460
with your unconscious bias so the four

00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:14,980
tips and this comes from a really great

00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:16,960
workshop that Google has put together

00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:18,730
for unconscious bias as well they have a

00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,320
free like all these resources for

00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:22,600
organizing and running your own workshop

00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:24,190
we didn't do with that workshop but this

00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:27,760
is one kind of takeaway that we borrowed

00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:29,290
from their their program but how you can

00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,210
work for hi can work with your

00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:34,770
unconscious bias commit to one of these

00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:37,480
actions for structuring for success so

00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:40,870
this can be like a process for

00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:44,250
onboarding new people into a project or

00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:47,080
a community or some other or even like a

00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:50,160
new a new person in your workplace or

00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:53,380
someone who is just getting started out

00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:55,870
and also try to just how you were able

00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:57,880
to see and visualize some of the

00:43:55,870 --> 00:44:01,210
different biases and backgrounds that we

00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:02,710
share maybe be a little bit more aware

00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:04,060
of some of those things when you talk to

00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:06,340
people who are newcomers or new

00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:09,520
contributors or are becoming more

00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:11,740
involved with the community yeah we are

00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:13,330
at time so we'll wrap this up Preppers

00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:16,150
make this really quick last one was just

00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:17,830
measuring results so like especially

00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:19,180
like an open source or projects or

00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:21,940
communities looking at things like

00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:25,570
diversity metrics are looking at like

00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:26,500
community like this is one things that

00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:28,120
we like we've been trying to do with the

00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,620
Fedora diversity and inclusion team too

00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:31,180
is to have a demographic survey to

00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:32,560
understand the different like all the

00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:34,870
different kinds of people who are in the

00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:36,730
Fedora community but it can also be at

00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:37,990
an individual level to like for all of

00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:41,080
us in different sub projects say

00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:43,180
ambassadors design comm ups have you

00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:45,610
noticed any changes in your own team or

00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:49,030
has there been more or less engagement

00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:52,060
by newcomers recognize and evaluate

00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:54,700
subtle messages so you might not realize

00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:57,160
that you're being very blunt or very

00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:58,300
honest and sometimes just that

00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:59,490
intersecting was actually explained

00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:02,980
really well in the keynote this morning

00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:05,349
with how we communicate with other

00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:08,349
people at an interpersonal level

00:45:05,349 --> 00:45:11,710
and in the same way that Rebecca this

00:45:08,349 --> 00:45:14,200
morning talked about thinking about the

00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:15,880
way that we phrase things the way that

00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:17,529
we present things to others we can try

00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:19,450
to be more considerate of the challenges

00:45:17,529 --> 00:45:22,239
faced by other people try to be more

00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:23,950
encouraging or provide different kinds

00:45:22,239 --> 00:45:26,499
of solutions or ideas instead of saying

00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:28,660
this doesn't work or this is this is

00:45:26,499 --> 00:45:32,140
wrong and try to add explain why or give

00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:33,579
a give a more reason for them for why

00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:36,309
they can or how they can identify

00:45:33,579 --> 00:45:37,720
something for themselves next time and

00:45:36,309 --> 00:45:39,640
the last part and this is I think is a

00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:42,640
really big one hold everyone accountable

00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:45,460
to so question your first impressions

00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:48,069
justify your decisions and ask for

00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:49,869
feedback try to empower others and your

00:45:48,069 --> 00:45:52,450
team's your projects in your personal

00:45:49,869 --> 00:45:55,359
life too then just call out unconscious

00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:57,309
bias but just to be aware of it just how

00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:58,720
like for a lot of us like like for me

00:45:57,309 --> 00:46:00,539
when I did this like it was just an

00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:02,799
eye-opening experience just to realize

00:46:00,539 --> 00:46:03,970
that all these different people have

00:46:02,799 --> 00:46:05,589
different perspectives I've gone through

00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:08,890
different things to be in this room I

00:46:05,589 --> 00:46:12,430
think just being aware of that is a huge

00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:14,319
part of of calling it out even if it's

00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:17,200
not explicit just trying to build that

00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:19,809
understanding and share that with other

00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:21,549
people is is really important too and

00:46:19,809 --> 00:46:23,410
then creating our kind of feeds into

00:46:21,549 --> 00:46:25,960
this but creating a culture of calling

00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:27,729
out unconscious bias to help encourage

00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:30,400
others to justify decisions and to make

00:46:27,729 --> 00:46:32,710
decisions collectively so these are just

00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,630
kind of for like quick takeaways and you

00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:36,460
can structure this I was kind of skewing

00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:39,039
this to fedora context but I think you

00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:40,539
can really take these for any context

00:46:39,039 --> 00:46:43,809
whether it's in your workplace whether

00:46:40,539 --> 00:46:44,950
it's and your in your degree in your

00:46:43,809 --> 00:46:47,920
going for your degree and your

00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:50,920
university teams or projects you work

00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:53,969
with in your personal life with

00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:58,119
relationships you have with other people

00:46:53,969 --> 00:46:59,079
and I think that's really all that we

00:46:58,119 --> 00:47:01,509
had if you want to look at any of these

00:46:59,079 --> 00:47:05,410
resources that we use today these were

00:47:01,509 --> 00:47:07,359
really a lot of what were used for

00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:09,759
across building this workshop so feel

00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:14,979
free to grab a picture and look at some

00:47:09,759 --> 00:47:16,810
of these especially the the second one

00:47:14,979 --> 00:47:19,000
the

00:47:16,810 --> 00:47:21,610
priviledge walk lesson that was a really

00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,980
great we adapted most we use that as a

00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:25,480
base but we made some adaptions for her

00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:27,160
flock for the people who would be here

00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:29,920
but that was a really great resource for

00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:32,620
the unconscious bias privilege walk and

00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:37,660
even the debug guides by Google have a

00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:40,060
lot of like nice resources to to improve

00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:44,110
like inclusion in your workspace so you

00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:47,140
can also take a look there and just we

00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:49,750
wanted to we are doing this workshop for

00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:51,670
the first time at Flo so we wanted to

00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:53,230
know if you have any feedback or like

00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:55,900
what you thought about the whole

00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:59,800
workshop maybe we want it to be shorter

00:47:55,900 --> 00:48:02,260
or maybe like some questions we're a

00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:04,780
little bit uncomfortable or any if you

00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:08,650
