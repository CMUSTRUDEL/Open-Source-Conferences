Talk: Git Your Distribution
Presenters: Jim Perrin, Matthew Miller

Description: Itâ€™s been almost five years since CentOS officially joined the Red Hat family. CentOS builds packages from RPMs which have source in Git trees, just like Fedora. This is an obvious point of potential collaboration, and we have a proposal for merging our Git trees into a shared one. This has a number of benefits for packagers and for the distribution as a whole, especially as we look at modularity and stream branching.
