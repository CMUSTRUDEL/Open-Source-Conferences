Talk: Git Your Distribution
Presenters: Jim Perrin, Matthew Miller

Description: Itâ€™s been almost five years since CentOS officially joined the Red Hat family. CentOS builds packages from RPMs which have source in Git trees, just like Fedora. This is an obvious point of potential collaboration, and we have a proposal for merging our Git trees into a shared one. This has a number of benefits for packagers and for the distribution as a whole, especially as we look at modularity and stream branching.

	00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:07,830
okay we're going to start talking now so

00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,690
people who want to pay attention should

00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,250
start paying attention and people who

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:15,330
don't want to pay attention should go to

00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:19,080
a different room so that that's how it

00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:22,980
goes here this is the Jim and Matthew

00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:25,500
show it's part of our series of talks

00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:29,369
about things that we want to do they're

00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:31,500
different this one is very specific and

00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:35,370
less hand-wavy still we're kind of like

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:37,649
a funnel with specificity and right

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:42,510
that's right it is that an actual word

00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:47,459
yes you play Scrabble a lot not to win

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:50,159
though anyway this is a very specific

00:00:47,459 --> 00:00:55,309
proposal with a pretty concrete thing

00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:55,309
which is also a big exciting change so

00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:06,840
will that work oh goodness

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,329
this operating system is terrible what

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,740
operating system really okay what

00:01:09,329 --> 00:01:14,909
operating system is this running Fedora

00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:23,490
you walked into that one

00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:28,439
it's pretty true so anyway just get disk

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:30,659
it yes how many people in this room need

00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:32,100
a background on what disk it is or are

00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:34,770
we all in this room because we know what

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,969
disk it is background and diskette

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,609
awesome

00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:41,429
so disk it is basically our shared

00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:44,579
repository for rpm spec file build

00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:47,159
information and so both sent to us and

00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:48,630
fedora use get to keep our spec files we

00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:50,460
use them slightly differently which i

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,960
think is in further slides but we

00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,819
basically keep our spec files and

00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,499
patches at rpms are built in in this

00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:58,109
system called dist kit

00:01:55,499 --> 00:02:03,060
I forget exactly what the disk stands

00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:05,189
for but basically it spot distribution

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,200
not distributed right it's a bunch of

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:10,560
repository so each package has its own

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,480
repository in this gigantic 20,000

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:18,170
repository thing

00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:21,110
what right so I click the button and it

00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:25,069
works now okay awesome are we going to

00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:27,769
the next slide we did yeah so right both

00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:29,330
sent to us and Fedora have these we are

00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:32,420
talking about ways that which we could

00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:37,640
collaborate better and this one jumped

00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:40,340
out at us as hugely obvious because it

00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:44,230
turns out that we both have repositories

00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:48,890
named things like httpd and grub2 and

00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:51,099
call it a at least the what 67 hundred

00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:53,690
packages that are in the base

00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:57,470
distribution that makes up a pretty

00:02:53,690 --> 00:03:00,079
decent subset of the 21,000 or whatever

00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:02,209
we made up whatever number that was so

00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:03,590
not only are they overlapping they're

00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:05,629
actually things with a direct

00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:08,810
descendants II so that's pretty awesome

00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:11,750
and so not only can we combine and share

00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:14,209
resources and combined effort but it can

00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:16,970
enable a lot of interesting things like

00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:19,340
actually compare it using git to compare

00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:22,609
between branches across fedora and son

00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:23,870
to us a lot of possible things that can

00:03:22,609 --> 00:03:26,480
be enabled which we are going to talk

00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:29,569
about further um after a bunch of

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,150
brainstorming between Matthew and I over

00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:34,849
several drinks we came up with this idea

00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:38,989
entirely on our own without talking to

00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:42,560
anybody from the community at all right

00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:44,329
so that that was a lie a lot of people

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,790
think this is a good idea

00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:50,389
I don't think Kevin is here which is a

00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:52,669
shame this is something that was on the

00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:55,099
Fedora touvell mailing list kind of a

00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:57,530
sort of independent of us talking about

00:03:55,099 --> 00:04:00,410
our you know the infrastructure things I

00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:03,680
know Peter Robinson also talked had this

00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:05,540
idea it's a it's kind of an in the air

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,400
kind of thing but it is a very big

00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:10,660
change so we wanted to actually make a

00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:13,700
presentation of it that's all so as

00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:15,950
Matthew brought up a lot of us have the

00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:19,450
same packages there's a descendancy set

00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:24,229
up we've talked or we heard earlier from

00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:25,670
Brendan and Josh about how the waterfall

00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:27,680
method kind of

00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:28,760
pickles down we saw the the packages

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,630
coming from Fedora

00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:34,580
into rel and and we decided to take a

00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:36,830
step back and not look at system

00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:40,820
specific but just how the packages work

00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:42,380
and so if if we take the Fedora instance

00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,940
when we start with the rawhide packages

00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:46,460
and you get the absolute latest and

00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:47,870
greatest this is the stuff and I'll use

00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:52,870
the phrase that Matthew hates and say

00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:52,870
the bleeding-edge packages rides okay

00:04:53,260 --> 00:05:00,080
Kevin says no if you guys don't know me

00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:01,970
I enjoy trolling my own co-workers and

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:07,160
the people on my team about this so it's

00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:10,340
a lot of fun to just poke and then so

00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:13,430
from ride we branch into Fodor releases

00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:15,230
and we branch a given time so I'm not

00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:17,770
putting numbers on these dots it could

00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:20,300
be Fedora 27 it could be Fedora it

00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:22,460
doesn't matter this is the typical flow

00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,990
for how it works and of course some

00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,760
people have their own different package

00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,350
cherry-picking patches back and forth so

00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,570
there should be a whole crazy network of

00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:34,490
line but I was going for the simplified

00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:37,040
model and then occasionally out of this

00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:39,410
we have the the Red Hat model or the rel

00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,660
model where Red Hat looks at a

00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:44,780
particular release they branch off of

00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:47,180
that rel comes out of that and then at

00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:50,330
some point down the road in the case of

00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:53,920
what is this 7-3 I think there was a new

00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:57,020
rebase in rel of the the gnome modules

00:05:53,920 --> 00:06:01,730
so periodically they'll pull again from

00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:03,230
fedora and dump that back into a later y

00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:05,390
stream release I'm using the right

00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,920
terminology for that but yeah as

00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:09,320
previously noted in talks like that

00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:12,020
happens very infrequently and like the

00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,370
last time was 2014 that the big thing

00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,860
happened and then it some stuff

00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:17,630
basically basically pulled from there

00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,430
and I was gonna say cherry picked but I

00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:21,500
want to be very clear actually in this

00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:23,180
case it can't be cherry picked because

00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,640
they're just copied over two completely

00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:27,620
different repos and so from the rel

00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,210
release we have this sent off base and

00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,820
the updates are built and that's

00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:34,930
basically how the package set flows at a

00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,930
simplified level

00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:43,539
and I look at this as the waterfall

00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:45,819
because you're coming from Fedora from

00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:48,009
rawhide into the Fedora release into the

00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:50,709
rail release into the CentOS release and

00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:53,649
there's that that just direct descendant

00:06:50,709 --> 00:06:55,389
and I hate the waterfall model we we

00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:57,189
have definitely moved beyond it it's

00:06:55,389 --> 00:07:00,550
done great things for us and it's time

00:06:57,189 --> 00:07:02,649
to let it go so we need a way to show

00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:05,229
some feedback in this we need a way to

00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:06,819
show what what Brendon and Josh pitched

00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:10,479
in their slides we need a way to get

00:07:06,819 --> 00:07:12,909
this moving and so what I came up with

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,569
where we came up with as part of this

00:07:12,909 --> 00:07:18,669
discussion

00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:20,830
was yellow dots I feel like yellow dots

00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:22,869
just bring everything out here and

00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:24,849
essentially what this is and I don't

00:07:22,869 --> 00:07:26,830
have a full dots because I couldn't come

00:07:24,849 --> 00:07:29,259
up with a decent working example for

00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:31,929
this but it is something that we want to

00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:33,849
get to so right right here for the

00:07:31,929 --> 00:07:38,079
yellow dots in this case we have patches

00:07:33,849 --> 00:07:40,930
from CentOS going back up into the rel

00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:42,849
fixes whether or not CentOS accepts them

00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:46,289
on the mailing list right now we have

00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:49,930
people about call it twice a week

00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:51,430
sending patches into the CentOS devel

00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:52,839
mailing list for various things that are

00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,969
in the base distribution that we've

00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:56,199
never fixed we've always looked at it

00:07:54,969 --> 00:07:58,329
said that's a real problem file that

00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:01,809
upstream and they keep sending us

00:07:58,329 --> 00:08:03,490
patches if we're doing this right this

00:08:01,809 --> 00:08:06,789
gives us a way to actually give some

00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:09,009
feedback and we we can look at get and

00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:12,459
look at a pull request model and say all

00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:14,649
right fine submit this Red Hat can at

00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:16,599
least acknowledge that a patch exists

00:08:14,649 --> 00:08:18,009
and they they have told me that they

00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:21,069
will at least acknowledge that a patch

00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:22,419
exists they may not accept the patch but

00:08:21,069 --> 00:08:25,269
they will at least pretend that it's

00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:26,709
there and so I've tried to show that in

00:08:25,269 --> 00:08:29,499
the diagram where some patches get

00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:31,059
merged but not all of them so there may

00:08:29,499 --> 00:08:34,240
be some things that Red Hat looks at

00:08:31,059 --> 00:08:37,180
says yes we need to solve that but we're

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,560
not going to do it that way so if that

00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:41,289
involves sent to us than carrying

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:44,470
patches that are not in rel in some

00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:46,990
instances that could be a possibility in

00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:51,430
some cases we may drop that patch later

00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:54,130
on in the arms side right now we do

00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:56,500
carry patches that are not in rel anyhow

00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:58,300
so we we are maintaining some branches

00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:01,089
that have patches that are not upstream

00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:11,949
or not in the rel as an upstream you've

00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:13,240
made Josh put his hand up oh it was it

00:09:11,949 --> 00:09:19,689
was the thing I was thinking about that

00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:22,059
I thought I would prompt Jim on so so in

00:09:19,689 --> 00:09:23,709
that very very simple diagram I want to

00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:26,079
highlight just how simple that is

00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:28,750
because I ignored all of the stream

00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:30,790
branching I ignored EPEL and how that

00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:32,920
feeds in I ignored all of the layered

00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:36,399
projects that we deal with for our do

00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:38,709
for over for cluster all of that stuff I

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,439
left off because in the initial attempts

00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:43,149
at packaging those diagrams into that

00:09:41,439 --> 00:09:44,769
thing it looked like a big web of

00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:47,410
spaghetti and it just it was too

00:09:44,769 --> 00:09:50,620
confusing so I'm I understand that is a

00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:51,610
really simplified diagram and these are

00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:54,670
some of the most exciting things

00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:56,890
actually though so you know problem

00:09:54,670 --> 00:10:00,770
diagrams

00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:02,950
so turns out Fedora actually has two

00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:06,620
different instances of get right now

00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:10,580
there's Peggotty oh and then there's

00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:12,470
source stuff Fedora project org and that

00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:14,870
is entirely different from how CentOS

00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:16,220
uses git and so Matthew and I tried to

00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:18,080
highlight some of the differences that

00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:21,230
we have here I can't read them because

00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:22,910
yes I I have designed an eye chart for

00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:26,060
this and I probably should not have done

00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:28,100
it with Packers traditionally where the

00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:30,080
the fess code tickets live it's where

00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:32,420
the council make some decisions where

00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:37,640
the infrastructure team has a lot of

00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:39,830
their tasks and issues assigned there's

00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,690
not a whole lot of source code there

00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:43,640
that is specific to the distribution

00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:45,260
packages itself you might find some

00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,360
strips for infra you might find some

00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:50,210
Relan stuff but you're not gonna go to

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,940
peg or do and find a patchy source code

00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:57,830
for 24.9 or whatever it's just not gonna

00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:59,690
be there so this gets to be a little

00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:01,550
tricky for how we can actually combine

00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:05,300
this stuff when we use git in different

00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:09,380
ways and so Matthew actually came up

00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:13,220
with the button the button stopped make

00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:15,320
the button go Matthew there we go all

00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:18,050
right so if we look at the common uses

00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,820
for what we actually can combine it

00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:21,800
turns out we accidentally named things

00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,750
kind of similarly because we were

00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,540
solving the same problem just slightly

00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:29,210
slower and at a different scale and

00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:33,190
level so we both use slash rpm slash

00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:35,600
source RPM name as the title for it

00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:37,520
synthesis primarily ignored the master

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,460
branch we just don't use it we branch

00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:43,850
for el7 we branch for el6 we have that

00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:48,530
sort of stuff in place so that lines up

00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:51,200
with the current f27 f28 f29 and we can

00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:53,900
either continue to let rawhide be master

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,300
branch or we can put a document in there

00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,680
that actually describes what the hell

00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,390
we're doing with all of this and where

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,520
you find different things this kind of

00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:03,410
hurts me conceptually because I don't

00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,120
like it when get branches have meanings

00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:06,790
other than this is a branch of the code

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,980
and what people use like a Docs

00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:11,950
to put their docks in oh it drives me

00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:13,990
crazy so using master branch to document

00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:17,140
things kind of hurts from that point of

00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:19,120
view on the other hand from a like a

00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:21,490
workflow point of view it makes a lot of

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,200
sense particularly because the way pegar

00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,310
works where it presents the readme and

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,760
everything like that's what you see

00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:29,320
first is the master branch so making the

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,000
master branch explain what's going on at

00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,920
the package and you as a package or can

00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,890
you talk about your package and the what

00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,910
the way things work there and or you

00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:38,710
know if we've got different people

00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:40,540
working on different branches there if

00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:44,260
they're Stream branches and things like

00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:45,970
having the master described that might

00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:49,090
be actually useful so I might be able to

00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:51,340
live with my shutter reaction for that

00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:53,530
reason know that decision is there there

00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:55,000
isn't an actual decision here for that

00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:58,420
these are just the ideas that we are

00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,490
kicking around and some of the problems

00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,870
out of this once we started talking

00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:04,720
about this then we started looking at

00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:06,370
wait okay so do we use the Fedora gate

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,620
for this because that'll anger the sent

00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:10,180
outside well no we should use the census

00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:12,460
get for this but that'll anger the

00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:14,320
fedoras all right you know it's good

00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:16,300
it's on disk it doesn't matter we can

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,970
mirror this stuff between both of them

00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:20,110
so now we have to figure out how to do

00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,400
that and now we've been looking at the

00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,870
tooling for doing that and I've been

00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,010
harassing Patrick about looking at the

00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:26,980
tooling for doing that and it's been

00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:31,270
fantastic for interesting definitions of

00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:32,920
fantastic turns out that permissions

00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:36,460
become kind of a big deal with that

00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:38,950
because on the Fedora side we really

00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:40,840
don't want people from the sensoth

00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:43,750
community just arbitrarily rewriting

00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:45,400
stuff which dora has acted and then we

00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:49,930
decided we didn't need ackles

00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:51,250
so joke's on us maybe we still don't but

00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:53,110
we we need to make sure that doesn't

00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:55,330
happen in some way and still maybe a

00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:57,340
social problem on the other side on the

00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:59,620
reverse we have to make sure because

00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:01,930
it's it's Red Hat specifically pushing

00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:04,000
the code in to get dot CentOS and that

00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:05,530
cannot change right so you have to make

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,790
sure this is maybe getting ahead of our

00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:09,630
slides because we didn't actually write

00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:12,430
this down so the actual proposal here is

00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:14,890
right now there's get dot sent to us

00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:17,170
where Red Hat dumps code and that's

00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:18,850
where that and then then sent to us

00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:20,920
works from there so

00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:24,160
this proposal would be for Red Hat to

00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:27,579
dump code into the fedora to the new

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:29,949
shared get instruct which is a big

00:14:27,579 --> 00:14:32,410
difference because right now we as

00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:33,790
Fedora own everything in get there and

00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:35,560
there aren't any things which were not

00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:37,750
supposed to mess with this would at

00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,490
least have the starts of branches that

00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:42,639
are basically pushed from an external

00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:44,740
thing that makes me a little bit

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:47,500
squeamish because I I don't want to go

00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:50,319
to the Red Hat as if there are Red Hat

00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:51,970
special branches here but I think we

00:14:50,319 --> 00:14:54,310
think of this as just a special source

00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:57,430
and it's I think the advantages of it

00:14:54,310 --> 00:15:00,339
are worth that and that kind of touches

00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:02,350
on the the last bullet with there are

00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:03,819
going to be things that if we move

00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:05,440
forward with this there will be things

00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:07,690
that get pushed in to get that Fedora

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,190
doesn't necessarily like some of the

00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:11,019
software collections some of the things

00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:13,149
that land in rel that fedora hasn't

00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:15,190
necessarily gone along with yet it

00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:17,050
doesn't have to be there but just

00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:19,149
because it's ink it doesn't necessarily

00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:21,370
mean it has to get built or approved it

00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:24,810
just means it's in git which could be

00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:24,810
the case today anyways Josh

00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:33,430
[Music]

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,430
but if you're doing here

00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,120
right there yes yes so the question is

00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:47,129
can we mirror it so that they're always

00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,939
forced pushed from what whatever

00:15:47,129 --> 00:15:52,769
internal or whatever or have get hooks

00:15:50,939 --> 00:15:54,899
that enforce that and the answer is yes

00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:57,810
we can definitely do that it's it's more

00:15:54,899 --> 00:16:01,110
of a policy shock thing than a thing

00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:03,110
that we can it's it's trying to avoid

00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:06,389
having somebody with a Fedora project

00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:08,519
account try to push something into an l7

00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:10,259
branch thinking that it's Apple when

00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:21,509
it's not and making sure that they

00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:22,920
cannot do that yeah the point is we

00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:27,180
don't really need Ackles to solve this

00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:29,600
particular problem too much talking all

00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,600
right fine

00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:45,720
thank you you're welcome

00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:48,320
yeah is that everything I can cannot

00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,320
read the slide

00:16:55,280 --> 00:17:02,700
alright so for all of this as we've had

00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:04,500
these crazy ideas I've been relying

00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:10,699
heavily on Fabian who's in the back

00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:12,930
hiding basically explaining what I want

00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:14,370
reinforcing him that I swear I haven't

00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:16,770
started drinking that early in the

00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:19,290
morning and then asking him to start

00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:20,910
testing at a significant level whether

00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:22,380
or not this is possible and he has gone

00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:26,940
back and forth with the teams with

00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:28,620
Patrick with pingu trying to keep me

00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:31,020
honest about what is and is not possible

00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:32,760
with this try and keep Patrick honest

00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:35,070
about what is and is not possible with

00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:39,020
repost banner we've gone back and forth

00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:41,550
on this a lot so this this isn't just a

00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:43,890
wild idea in presentation we've actually

00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:46,110
got a little bit of code behind this to

00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:48,980
test stuff out and I have to say thank

00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:52,770
you to Fabian for what he's been doing

00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:55,710
and I want to reinforce that this is an

00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:58,770
initial step there there are a lot of

00:17:55,710 --> 00:18:00,030
things that we can do as we attempt to

00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:02,400
collaborate between the two

00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:08,250
distributions and sharing a little bit

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:10,260
of get initially is one of them we would

00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:13,410
like to get to a place where we're doing

00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:15,960
more than just copying and syncing repos

00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:19,290
back and forth we we're able to get that

00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:21,810
but once we are a little further down

00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:23,460
the road with a common authentication

00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:26,400
scheme that allows for Federation

00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:28,170
between fedora and CentOS that opens up

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,200
the ability to share a bit more and we

00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:35,250
can start moving forward a bit down the

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:38,160
road for sharing other things where it

00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:41,310
makes a little bit of sense so allowing

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,770
for authentication into the CI platform

00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:45,720
across both that isn't requiring an

00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:47,250
additional account or an additional

00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,080
account type or anything else like that

00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,520
we can just start using groups and say

00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:53,130
ok you're in the CI group for this

00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:56,460
particular project use this go do

00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:58,080
something we can start sharing tests

00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,780
back and forth because it turns out a

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:03,990
lot of the tests for simple things like

00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:05,760
HTTP D are fairly consistent between the

00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:07,740
two projects and what we have in one we

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,690
have in the other and again that goes

00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:12,780
back to a thank you to Patrick and

00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:15,960
Fabian for the the secure boot testing

00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:17,520
for shims which is making Peter to a

00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:21,570
happy dance off in the corner which is

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:23,310
always fun to say so it's it's stuff

00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:25,650
like that that's already starting to

00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:27,360
show a little bit of fruit for sharing

00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:30,480
between the distributions we don't have

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:35,340
to do this in as much isolation as we

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:37,050
have in the past so the the branching of

00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:40,440
get the sharing of git is just kind of

00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:42,000
an initial step to see what we can do

00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,490
and where we can go for the

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,380
accomplishment and now because there are

00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:52,700
some fairly opinionated people in the

00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:52,700
room Peter

00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:56,279
[Music]

00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:00,820
master not be rawhide is thick

00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:18,230
all right so you're in favor of this

00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:22,270
okay Peter is in favor of not using

00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:22,270
master for a ride Alexandra

00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:49,890
yes so the question is what is the point

00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:51,900
of having this all set up on the git

00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:55,050
remotes when you could as a package or

00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:56,610
set up different get remotes and do

00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:59,940
cherry-picking back and forth between

00:20:56,610 --> 00:21:01,770
those things people don't do that right

00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,450
now I think that's the other thing so I

00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:05,250
think having this way encourages

00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:08,280
collaboration and it makes it the

00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:10,320
default that packages can have kind of a

00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,540
co-ownership between the fedora and

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:15,180
Santo s communities and it sort of

00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:18,510
enforces that if there is a relationship

00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:21,870
between the two if I can slander

00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:26,190
humanity as a whole people are

00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:28,140
inherently lazy the more you make a road

00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:30,840
block or the more challenge you put in

00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:32,970
doing something like that the less

00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:35,700
frequently people will do it and you can

00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:36,780
absolutely do that right now but to do

00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,730
that you have to go to two different

00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:41,250
systems with two different accounts to

00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:43,260
do different things and it's a little

00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:44,910
more complicated we do have people who

00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:49,230
are actively doing that in both

00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:51,000
communities and they hate it this is

00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:52,560
trying to make their lives easy we we

00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,420
want to give people who are doing this

00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,790
in multiple places across multiple

00:21:54,420 --> 00:22:00,920
distributions one single point to go for

00:21:56,790 --> 00:22:00,920
everything Josh have a come on a matter

00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:19,769
so if you had to share it across the

00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,769
whole project

00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,309
[Music]

00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:34,660
so it's not just about sewing individual

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:48,000
yeah mm-hmm

00:22:44,399 --> 00:22:48,000
dusty do you

00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:01,330
like

00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:17,180
last wait yeah question was having

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,430
basically two front ends to it and doing

00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:21,260
a mirror is what is that being too

00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:24,140
sensitive what's the benefit of that why

00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:29,750
bother why not just subsumed sent to us

00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:34,850
into Fedora that last part I added damn

00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:37,930
it Matthew so to some extent it is being

00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:41,000
conscious that the communities are very

00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:43,850
separate in some instances and very

00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,040
opinionated the other benefit that it

00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:49,270
gives us is across a couple of

00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:52,040
implementation details right now the CI

00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:54,890
instance as it's primarily stood up

00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:58,700
we forklifted the the Fodor what is a

00:23:54,890 --> 00:24:01,370
Fedora apps or Fedora project apps CI

00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:03,380
that was Jenkins that Fedora was running

00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:05,840
that's that's dead that's gone we

00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:09,890
forklifted all of that into the cent all

00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:12,790
CI environment fedoras data centers

00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:15,560
primarily stood up in the Phoenix area

00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:17,300
CentOS is primarily based in Raleigh so

00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:19,940
one of the benefits that we get for

00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:23,360
doing this is actually geo separation

00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:25,910
and we can use the repositories as we

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:28,310
sync them for more localized testing

00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:30,560
that don't necessarily impact the other

00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:32,840
things that Fedora is doing as far as

00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,190
release generation or anything else when

00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:36,230
we're done with this whole mess

00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:38,390
hopefully it will just be one system but

00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:40,490
then we've got some built-in redundancy

00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:42,680
so it's not just Oh Phoenix is offline

00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:44,480
we're down we're screwed we can't do

00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,740
anything it's Phoenix is offline great

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,240
I'll hit the other one because it's

00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:51,170
still up it's still there I can still

00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:52,940
get data I can still do my job wait I

00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:55,850
want to add something in that we haven't

00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:57,410
talked about yet which is great it's

00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:59,180
well we went by it in the slide with the

00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:00,830
stream stream branching so and this is

00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:03,290
the the slide I said was interesting but

00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:06,530
we didn't put on the chart and that is

00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:10,580
in addition to the release name branches

00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:13,700
for modules and for also for sent OS

00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:16,289
cigs there's plenty of reason to have

00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:18,210
branches that are named other thing

00:25:16,289 --> 00:25:21,090
we would be previously called arbitrary

00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:26,010
branching but a stream branching or L

00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:28,980
and those can be built into modules for

00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:30,860
fedora hopefully for Apple coming soon

00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:33,929
and those can be built into CentOS

00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:35,429
sake packages so I think that the

00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:38,850
opportunity for sharing in the

00:25:35,429 --> 00:25:40,530
non-default named branches is really

00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:42,120
significant and I think that's where a

00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:44,610
lot of the interest and excitement will

00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,570
come out of this as well yeah so to

00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:49,549
answer your question there are

00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:56,250
implementation reasons why not - it

00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:59,220
helps some of the interest in keeping it

00:25:56,250 --> 00:26:01,409
kind of separate initially gives us some

00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:03,510
short-term benefit that we can roll into

00:26:01,409 --> 00:26:08,220
longer benefit once we get a few other

00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:08,610
pieces in place so mine you had a

00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:12,860
question

00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:12,860
oh sorry Laura's been

00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:20,170
it's going to be healthy

00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,830
how

00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:33,559
we're not talking about merging the

00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:37,130
build systems yet this is just get so it

00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:39,470
shouldn't impact the build system setup

00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:42,380
it Fedora's koji instance will still

00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:44,390
point to source stop Fedora project org

00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:45,679
it's still Packer it still pulls the

00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:49,610
code from the same place that that

00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:51,919
doesn't change yeah you could try to Fed

00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:56,059
package build CentOS packages on fedora

00:26:51,919 --> 00:27:10,690
now they won't land anywhere unless we

00:26:56,059 --> 00:27:10,690
configure something to happen so yeah as

00:27:12,399 --> 00:27:16,549
this is a down in the weeds

00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:21,020
implementation detail I don't want to

00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:23,779
get into why or why not yet we have

00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:26,360
reasons for why we are not using koji to

00:27:23,779 --> 00:27:28,820
build CentOS as it exists currently I

00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:31,340
would like to get Koji to a place where

00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:32,929
we can use it to build the system but

00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:36,590
that has to happen before we can make

00:27:32,929 --> 00:27:39,710
that leap so right now we cannot share

00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:41,539
build systems we need a common

00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:44,330
authentication setup in place which

00:27:41,539 --> 00:27:46,250
Patrick is working on I keep throwing

00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:48,440
arbitrary dates at them and see if I can

00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:50,510
make him twitch and try to get him to

00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:52,640
you know work on a little quicker or

00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:54,529
just to toy with them because it's fun

00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,120
to poke Patrick from time to time Laura

00:27:54,529 --> 00:27:58,270
had a quest Laura had a question for

00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,270
long

00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:08,130
perhaps maybe even finder's fee

00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:13,300
where you say

00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:16,650
the branch with you to create

00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:16,650
infringement anger

00:28:22,649 --> 00:28:28,509
the question is whether Ackles could

00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:32,019
keep you from accidentally creating get

00:28:28,509 --> 00:28:33,789
branches you didn't mean to someone who

00:28:32,019 --> 00:28:35,590
knows more about get will have to answer

00:28:33,789 --> 00:28:38,320
that I'm sure there's some way to keep

00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:40,960
you from pushing those things that yeah

00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:44,710
that does actually bring up an

00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:48,669
interesting point in that as we move to

00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:51,220
a place where RedHat can push code into

00:28:48,669 --> 00:28:54,340
an instance that is shared by both

00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:57,879
fedora and cent we're going to need a

00:28:54,340 --> 00:29:00,610
consistent naming convention one so that

00:28:57,879 --> 00:29:03,490
we have a thing that red hat doesn't

00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:06,850
stomp on and two so that we know what

00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:08,350
those branches are so that has to be

00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:10,990
something that we'll need to have in

00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:13,539
place if we're doing ackles in a way

00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:15,999
that scent can't stop on fedora and

00:29:13,539 --> 00:29:19,389
Fedora can't stomp on scent in theory we

00:29:15,999 --> 00:29:21,610
could solve that but again I would have

00:29:19,389 --> 00:29:23,169
to harass Kevin or some of the other

00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:25,960
folks on the infor team and make sure

00:29:23,169 --> 00:29:29,700
that that's true

00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:29,700
there was yes

00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:42,000
they keep that the same package in two

00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:42,000
different branches you keep like

00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:47,950
currently as it exists right now they

00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,350
stay in the two different branches there

00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:52,180
there isn't necessarily merging back and

00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:54,700
forth although we would be able to

00:29:52,180 --> 00:30:06,450
cherry-pick from one to another and vice

00:29:54,700 --> 00:30:12,480
versa so if there's a common Josh okay

00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:16,120
so the versions in el7 for example are

00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,830
significantly older version locked and

00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:23,230
patched for what is different than

00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:24,880
what's in Fedora 28 so they will stay in

00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:27,550
their their own respective branches

00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,410
there might be some fixes that cross

00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:31,780
pollinate between them but those

00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:34,990
branches will stay there there won't be

00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:37,060
a merge back into one or the other in

00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:38,860
the traditional branch sense app stream

00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:40,720
that may be different we may both be

00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:43,690
building from the same app stream or

00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:46,360
same modular content and that just is

00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:48,100
how it is Josh if you have more than 30

00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:50,820
seconds come up and use the mic because

00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,820
I don't want to repeat

00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:23,630
Yeah right

00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,630
said Josh's

00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:37,400
this this is not necessarily code

00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:40,070
development get use this is distant you

00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:42,140
specifically so there there is a bit of

00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:45,440
difference between code development get

00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:47,960
and just get distribution style yes

00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:50,690
you're absolutely correct and Josh's

00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:52,190
explanation for that is that we've been

00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:57,680
doing this for a long time and it used

00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:59,750
to be dis CVS and that yeah also that it

00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:02,120
is very oriented around the release

00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:04,010
model rather than about package names

00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:07,510
let's yes I'm from over there the

00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:07,510
gentleman with the Red Hat tattoo

00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:25,570
anyway with an arbitrary branching these

00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:31,240
are very enriching with a big push big

00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:31,240
consolation last block serious but

00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:38,369
the question is have we talked to the

00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,719
fitter the factory 2.0 team and about

00:32:38,369 --> 00:32:43,710
how this would intersect with arbitrary

00:32:39,719 --> 00:32:46,460
branching I am just assuming that

00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:50,219
arbitrary branching is an imp like is

00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:51,960
from the fedora side of things all we're

00:32:50,219 --> 00:32:54,029
doing is adding several more arbitrary

00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:56,849
branches that happen to have sent to us

00:32:54,029 --> 00:32:58,830
and whatever labels on them so I don't

00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:59,869
see an issue is there something I'm

00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:05,070
missing

00:32:59,869 --> 00:33:10,769
okay so arbitrary branching can't be

00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:13,080
that arbitrary but yes it should work

00:33:10,769 --> 00:33:15,799
with within some basic I we call it

00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,799
stream branch

00:33:19,909 --> 00:33:26,669
yes yes someone has asked Ralph if this

00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:29,269
is going to work what's the Peter you've

00:33:26,669 --> 00:33:29,269
had your hand up again

00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:46,390
if you've got a second

00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:52,090
every time you do

00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:54,710
who's all visible and that

00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:57,259
so Peter has a technical comment

00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:59,119
basically that it's much faster if you

00:33:57,259 --> 00:34:02,470
have one shared get repo order than two

00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:02,470
your remotes if there's a lot of files

00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:13,190
I was something the three

00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:26,740
yes

00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:44,230
so that is that is one of the problems

00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:47,050
that we are hoping to attempt to address

00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:49,810
with this I am told that I cannot make

00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:51,940
promises for addressing this and I feel

00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:54,970
like that's accurate but redhead is at

00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:57,190
least willing to allow me to promise

00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:59,349
that they will review the stuff that

00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:01,270
lands there they may not accept it but

00:34:59,349 --> 00:35:03,670
they will at least look at okay we have

00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:07,420
this fix this fix came with tests it

00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:09,520
passes community CI that that gets it a

00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:12,070
little more than I through some random

00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:14,340
stuff in a Bugzilla and we'll see what

00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:18,090
happens a year and a half down the road

00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:18,090
josh am i overstepping

00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:28,290
the conversation that was had

00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:46,349
yes yes mm-hmm so to some extent we are

00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:49,079
attempting to already use sends us as a

00:35:46,349 --> 00:35:52,470
testbed for some packages that is kind

00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:55,019
of the point for like the are do sig is

00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:57,029
an upstream for the the Red Hat

00:35:55,019 --> 00:36:00,720
OpenStack up Josh and Brendan had that

00:35:57,029 --> 00:36:05,880
in their slides earlier we have in

00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:07,680
CentOS released a yum for packaged as an

00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:10,069
additional repository that can be added

00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:13,079
that basically brings DNF functionality

00:36:10,069 --> 00:36:15,900
into CentOS so people can play around

00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:19,559
with DNF and whatever the alias was to

00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:22,260
use it as yum to try and get some

00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:25,799
feedback that we could bring into the

00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:27,299
the rel business side for whoever it was

00:36:25,799 --> 00:36:28,950
that was responsible from that they put

00:36:27,299 --> 00:36:30,539
out a questionnaire on the the CentOS

00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:32,819
mailing list hey please come check this

00:36:30,539 --> 00:36:35,490
out please use this so we are actively

00:36:32,819 --> 00:36:37,109
trying to do some of this it's just a

00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:40,670
question of how much we can do and how

00:36:37,109 --> 00:36:40,670
successful we can be with it

00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:48,769
now advance for everybody's question do

00:36:47,059 --> 00:36:50,450
we do we have any other outraged yelling

00:36:48,769 --> 00:36:54,619
really I thought this would be slightly

00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:56,480
more dramatic than this yes the

00:36:54,619 --> 00:36:59,299
gentleman with the tattoo again in the

00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:02,230
in the what what is the a logo I'm not

00:36:59,299 --> 00:37:02,230
familiar with that project

00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:24,029
to Adam Reed Adam returns the ribbing by

00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:26,520
asking what the timeline is on sent to

00:37:24,029 --> 00:37:28,440
us finally just becoming Fedora LTS am I

00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:33,809
allowed to just like drop this on his

00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:40,770
behalf didn't I already make that joke

00:37:33,809 --> 00:37:43,319
once in this talk no so I think in

00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:45,329
seriousness there are both pretty strong

00:37:43,319 --> 00:37:48,059
community brands here that mean a lot to

00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:49,740
a lot of people so it's something we

00:37:48,059 --> 00:37:51,329
want to be careful with and that's again

00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:53,490
one of the reasons we want to proceed

00:37:51,329 --> 00:37:55,260
carefully and have you know front ends

00:37:53,490 --> 00:38:02,190
that kind of look like they belong in

00:37:55,260 --> 00:38:04,410
each community so what's our timeline

00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:06,770
for this now that we don't have outreach

00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:09,210
yelling tomorrow could we turn it on

00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:15,720
fabulous our timeline for this you're

00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:20,670
the one building it soon the famous

00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:22,819
deadline I will translate soon as when

00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:26,180
it's ready

00:38:22,819 --> 00:38:28,740
I am hoping we can have something in

00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:32,849
beta form the community can play around

00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:34,260
with hopefully around November I am

00:38:32,849 --> 00:38:36,720
hoping that we're able to pull that off

00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:38,880
for a get instance that we can at least

00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,829
show to the community and say look here

00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,930
this is the thing I I want to wrap this

00:38:40,829 --> 00:38:45,710
up as kind of an early Christmas present

00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:45,710
and say here you go

00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:52,759
yeah but before that would be good for

00:38:53,869 --> 00:39:16,940
just saying six weeks yes there that was

00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,940
the right answer

00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:33,839
you you sold yourself on the deadline I

00:39:31,499 --> 00:39:41,910
was pushing for later I'm not

00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:45,140
responsible for this anymore Adam yes

00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:45,140
why does Josh want it sooner

00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:54,700
you don't really get beat that body

00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,700
until

00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:02,800
yeah Josh would like it before the

00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:05,050
holidays basically because the holidays

00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:07,590
are down time as we saw from Mike graphs

00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:07,590
earlier

00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:16,339
yeah holidays Devcon no one gets

00:40:14,509 --> 00:40:17,990
anything done that liner ribbing and you

00:40:16,339 --> 00:40:27,019
think I'm gonna call on you again

00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:31,150
I already did I called him already Adam

00:40:27,019 --> 00:40:31,150
is trying to walk back his

00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:42,540
he changed from the joke into a

00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:43,770
compliment so we'll take it you should

00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:51,090
have stuck with the original man the

00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:53,390
original is fantastic well thank you

00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:53,390
everybody

00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:59,979
