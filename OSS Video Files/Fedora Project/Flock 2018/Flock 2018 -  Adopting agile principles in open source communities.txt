Talk: Adopting agile principles in open source communities
Presenters: Adam Samalik

Description: Many of us working in open source communities are used to issue trackers of various sorts. We use them for many different things: user feedback (bugs, RFEs), tracking new features, ideas, etc. This results in 10s or 100s of issues that might be hard to navigate through, because they are so different, yet mixed together.

I feel there is a big difference between user feedback (something anyone can submit), a key feature to be developed (something the core team defines based on user needs), and a unit of work (an actionable item leading to a new feature being developed).

Could we adopt some of the existing agile principles to solve this problem? Can we do it in a way suitable for open source communities where people often contribute irregularly, in their spare time?

I believe we can! And I will demonstrate how we use Kanban for the Antora for Docs project, bringing a new documentation site to Fedora. Using this, we’ve been able to:

* articulate the key features we want to deliver including their definitions of done (i.e. translations, initial web UI, PR build automation, client tooling, etc.)
* specifying actionable items leading to a feature competition (i.e. write a specific script, open a ticket to the Fedora Design team asking for a new design, reach out to a specific group and help them move to Antora, etc.)
* accept feedback from users (i.e. a bug about a certain CSS error, an RFE about a new ‘edit’ button on each page)
* identify priorities — so anyone can pick up a task and help us

I believe adopting similar principles could bring some additional clarity to your open source project — mostly about about it’s future, user feedback, upcoming features, and the work that needs to be done, potentially scaling your community.

	00:00:08,929 --> 00:00:16,710
so hi everyone my name is Natasha Malik

00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:18,720
and super you need to head to our

00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,150
contributor and I just wanna tell you

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,029
something about agile but before I start

00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:26,580
I have asked portion I'm an engineer so

00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:29,070
like whatever I say it might not be the

00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,910
truth but this will be useful things or

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:35,790
at least things I think are useful and

00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:43,890
that's basically it so let's let's start

00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:45,539
so there is the so what is agile it's

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:49,500
it's mostly compared to a traditional

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:51,809
approach and the traditional approach is

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,719
basically like a software development

00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:56,010
right you would have some requirements

00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:58,530
you will do the design implementation

00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:00,719
testing deployment will be some

00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,809
consequences like maintenance and stuff

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:08,240
like this differences and you just like

00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:11,939
do it in one go and then it's done and

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:15,000
what these agile is basically about is

00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:16,770
that you do iteration so you try you

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,240
feedback and felt write a vector file

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:22,830
and you do these reviews and basically

00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,780
you somehow iterate at the right place

00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:29,780
and it's much easier to plan must be

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:33,780
much easier to to manage basically so

00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:34,890
how the work is defined in in the

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,520
traditional service if you give a

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:40,539
specification as it go

00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:41,979
and you just do it or you could have an

00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:43,149
issue tracker if you're an open-source

00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:46,299
community and I would just like

00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:48,549
everything you want to do but what I see

00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:50,229
in agile and I don't know if that's true

00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:53,469
but basically what I see is these three

00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:56,020
things so there are goals actions and

00:01:53,469 --> 00:01:57,909
feedback and the goals would be things

00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:00,250
that you want to produce so this is like

00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:03,429
the end result right so whenever I doing

00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:06,729
the documentation we have things like

00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:08,769
translation build pipeline information

00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:11,799
architecture and then we have some

00:02:08,769 --> 00:02:14,650
actions which are basically units of

00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:16,510
work how to get to that cause so here we

00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:18,280
just like push this into this get people

00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:20,230
write this script and you would somehow

00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,470
get closer and then there is the third

00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:27,459
thing which is feedback and this book

00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:29,680
just comes from your users and they are

00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:33,640
represented in these things so the goals

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:36,190
are named epics or usually code epics

00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,049
at least that's how I use them actions

00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:40,569
could be represented as a cards and

00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:42,280
issues a feedback is the issue so that's

00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:44,109
what you get for example in your issue

00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:47,170
tracker right and I think these are

00:02:44,109 --> 00:02:48,970
three separate things and some open

00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:52,209
source project would only use the issue

00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:54,190
tracker which is I think fine but it

00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:56,829
might be harder at least from my

00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:58,420
perspective for onboarding new people

00:02:56,829 --> 00:03:00,489
understanding of what's going on because

00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:02,980
it would be messy right you would have

00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:05,260
your user feedback there even if you're

00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:08,410
RTS you will have things that you need

00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:12,430
to do various sizes or the goals and it

00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:15,670
is somehow way raised again probably

00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:18,370
good management times but I think having

00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:21,370
having these three groups of things can

00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:23,980
really help and it would looks like look

00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:28,840
like this if you structure it so you

00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:30,849
could have things as the goals and they

00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,849
we're taught to get closer to the cold

00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:40,680
rain and then the issues from from

00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:42,640
amusing and there are basic with two

00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,730
methodologies in the world where I have

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:50,200
experience with how you can approach

00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:54,940
working on those for those tasks and

00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:58,300
goals so scrum and Kanban the difference

00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:59,739
is that scrum is about Sprint's I say is

00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,019
our planning and commitment and

00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:05,500
iteration so what that means you would

00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:07,870
basically choose cards that you want to

00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:10,030
make and there would be a time period

00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:12,280
like two weeks I will do like two week

00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:15,190
cycle for example and it would come in

00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:17,739
to do this this set of set of issues and

00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:19,450
in the end you would see the end result

00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:21,280
and then you could decide is that enough

00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:23,530
or do we need another or is it just like

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:28,030
a complete different parts right so this

00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:30,430
is more about those cycles and Grandpa

00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:33,640
on the other hand is being continuous

00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:37,300
prioritizing so you would have a list of

00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:40,150
those cars and use prioritize them in

00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:42,190
the way in a certain way and they would

00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:44,260
just say either one point one which is

00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:46,810
like slowly progressing there wouldn't

00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:49,510
be any cycles any planning and they were

00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:54,010
just like slowly go through them like

00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:56,080
human advertising on the way so these

00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:59,400
are the two main approaches and I'll

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,830
just explain them a little bit more with

00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:05,410
activities so what do you do if if you

00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:06,910
want to do this or if these what we that

00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:10,950
would really into teams that we work

00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:13,080
with so I think there

00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:14,850
major five different activities so

00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,370
something is called grooming and it's

00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:20,670
planning stand-up its respective and

00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:26,130
demo and I know there may be some new

00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:28,560
words and also not all apply to all to

00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:30,990
those two principles so for example

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,280
scrum uses basically all of them but

00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:34,680
come about just some of them

00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:37,950
so let's let's have a look at what that

00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:40,560
is so grooming is basically about

00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:43,170
creating defining clarifying and

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,900
prioritizing those cards so this is

00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:49,140
where your team or group of people can

00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:52,110
st. and basically define what they want

00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:54,510
to do so we could define the epics or

00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:56,100
our problems as I said for example for

00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:58,500
the documentation position or something

00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:01,140
and then you can see the cards which

00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:06,540
could be the work you want to do to get

00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:09,300
closer and having this sculpt like in

00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:12,810
these small pieces it's much much easier

00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:15,000
for you I guess to to focus on like the

00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:17,310
separate bar right and you can see like

00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,270
it could be even reviews of what you've

00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:22,920
already done and basically make like

00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:24,870
organize your board with these things

00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:27,360
and by the way I will be showing a life

00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:32,190
developed at the end of how we use it in

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,870
the docs project I have but that's

00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,580
basically grooming making sense in the

00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:38,090
cards and making sure it's updated and

00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:40,350
it makes sense that there's everything

00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:42,510
then you could do planning but this is

00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:45,960
just in describe as I said scrum is

00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:48,630
doing like cycles for example two-week

00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:50,760
cycles and you need to plan what you

00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:52,890
want to comment for those cycles so you

00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:55,500
for example you say you're gonna

00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:56,900
complain these 10 cards and then you

00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,970
just do your work

00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,680
karma doesn't have it because there's no

00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:04,040
fine there's no cycles you just like go

00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:06,830
through these so that's one activity

00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,510
I knew mostly work we're not only on

00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:12,919
those cards were just completing what

00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:15,590
you plant one of the nice things about

00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:17,389
this is daily stand-ups oh this is okay

00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:20,690
it doesn't need to be telling but we

00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:23,120
used usually dipped any and it was just

00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:24,650
like a sing between the people what we

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:29,210
did it what we're trying to do this day

00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:31,250
today and just to make sure we are not

00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:34,130
conflicting with each other and not

00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:37,220
stepping on each other's toes or just

00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:43,310
giving it giving it update again both

00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:46,970
scrum and Kanban then demo I have scrum

00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:48,979
and Kanban with with a question mark so

00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:51,530
if you do scrum with you do those

00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:53,690
circles it's very useful to demo in the

00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:56,960
end where you can just present the work

00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:58,760
you did try to select to even if you're

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,500
in a company to your product on there or

00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,750
if you're in a community maybe to

00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:06,590
yourself or just like see what basically

00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:08,600
happens in Kanban this can be done and I

00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:10,940
think it's encouraged but you wouldn't

00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:13,010
be like probably oh no scheduler to do

00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:16,300
it like anytime you think it makes sense

00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:21,800
for example so I think it's you know I

00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:24,140
think it's up to you and then the

00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,360
research perspective and this is

00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:29,990
basically talking about the way you work

00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:34,150
but it's not about what you did how you

00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:36,349
write I don't know like what you did how

00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:38,240
it's not about the thing you're

00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:41,000
producing is about the way you work so

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,039
for example how will you do the

00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,250
stand-ups and how you do and I think

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,440
it's mostly able to process

00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:48,390
just like think about how we could

00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:53,190
improve and you can also do it

00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:55,320
periodically and this helps the team be

00:08:53,190 --> 00:09:00,990
more effective or just people natural in

00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:03,810
the processes and excitement then I have

00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:05,640
a section if you can do this in open

00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:08,190
source communities because I was talking

00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,960
about cycles and committing work and it

00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:12,000
sounds it was pressuring and I only have

00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:14,460
one slide but basically teams of

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,860
employees versus teams of volunteers and

00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:19,170
this doesn't need to be employees it

00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,090
could be like people that are probably

00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:24,270
paid for their work and just like doing

00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:26,070
this full-time versus team of volunteers

00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:30,630
that just doing it whatever they have

00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:33,000
time great and what I personally see it

00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:38,070
might be difficult to do scrum with the

00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,420
cycles with communities because people

00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:41,430
would be doing it just like on just

00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:44,580
occasional right like whether they want

00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:48,000
and I personally think it's Kanban is

00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:49,500
the way to go that's what we did and

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,839
that's what I want to show you as well

00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:55,200
but this is the thing to consider right

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:57,350
if you also Google scrap or combat is

00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:04,740
what we mostly apply to like the

00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:08,430
professional teams that just this is a

00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:10,380
thing in DC I think keep in mind but let

00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:12,780
me show you the federal documentation

00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,379
example so we need published a new

00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:16,979
favorite

00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:19,169
last week and I think we were using

00:10:16,979 --> 00:10:21,209
something like come on to organize the

00:10:19,169 --> 00:10:23,970
work and just figuring out what

00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:31,349
development don't want to do and I have

00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:40,889
a board I would walk you through my

00:10:31,349 --> 00:10:43,229
quirks so this is Pedro taiga and I hope

00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:47,399
you can see it well I can try to make it

00:10:43,229 --> 00:10:49,709
a little bit bigger and that's what we

00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:52,649
used for planning and tracking the work

00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:55,379
and it's also important to point out

00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:56,939
that this like group of people I think

00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:59,729
there are three people working on this

00:10:56,939 --> 00:11:02,249
if you if you're an individual

00:10:59,729 --> 00:11:04,289
contributor you have your own project is

00:11:02,249 --> 00:11:05,549
might this might not be that important

00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:07,470
because you could just like work on your

00:11:05,549 --> 00:11:08,879
sub just know about everything but this

00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:13,559
is very important for communication

00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:16,769
between people so I have a few views

00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:21,199
here and I think ethics is epics and

00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:24,239
Kanban are the most two most important -

00:11:21,199 --> 00:11:27,439
so epics these are the goals we have and

00:11:24,239 --> 00:11:29,970
then combined is the place we use for

00:11:27,439 --> 00:11:31,739
useful work so happy we will use to

00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:35,699
planning and prioritizing and maybe the

00:11:31,739 --> 00:11:41,999
grooming and this is what we use for for

00:11:35,699 --> 00:11:44,549
actual work and in the epics we have

00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:46,229
defined some goals so for example the

00:11:44,549 --> 00:11:49,049
very first goal I define here was

00:11:46,229 --> 00:11:50,819
translations and then we have dogs for

00:11:49,049 --> 00:11:53,850
the dogs like a documentation about the

00:11:50,819 --> 00:11:55,529
documentation the web UI information

00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:59,249
architecture and things like this

00:11:55,529 --> 00:12:04,229
so if I for example opened the

00:11:59,249 --> 00:12:06,569
translations there is a description that

00:12:04,229 --> 00:12:10,919
basically describes the end result so

00:12:06,569 --> 00:12:14,429
what we want to do in one state we need

00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:15,010
to be for this to be finished for Easter

00:12:14,429 --> 00:12:17,680
because

00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:19,330
finished right and they saw things like

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,780
me to be able to submit the original

00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:24,850
content modulation probably build the

00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:26,920
site with the translation and things

00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:29,050
like this and I also have an out of

00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,790
scope here that we don't need ultimate

00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,990
is built by client with this because

00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:34,780
that would be too much

00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:38,350
so this somehow sets the expectations

00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:40,930
and if you know this even maybe a new

00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:42,580
team member looking at this and maybe

00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:44,380
the actual state would figure it out

00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:46,840
like what to do because they don't have

00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:48,700
to think about the whole whole picture

00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:51,760
and we have some cards here

00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:53,800
I like developer scripts to love the

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,020
English language to the translation team

00:12:53,800 --> 00:13:00,000
just like a script that takes it out and

00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:03,310
you are to switch switch the website and

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,890
these are actions that are just getting

00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:08,620
us closer to this goal and we don't have

00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:11,140
to define everything we can just define

00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:12,060
something do it and then see what's

00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:14,920
gonna happen

00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:18,130
also one nice thing here is that you

00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:20,680
don't need to have only cars with like

00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:23,440
the produce work but you can also have

00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:25,630
so-called bikes which I like and

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,090
research parts so for example I don't

00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:30,520
know how this translation engine works

00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:32,140
so how can I even plan my work but

00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:35,170
that's not the problem I have this and I

00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:37,840
have my goal so I can create a color for

00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:41,200
example about figuring out how this

00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:43,600
translation engine works and documenting

00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:48,730
it and based on this you can create work

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:50,890
arts and this is just one thing and this

00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:52,330
is the one goal with those cars and you

00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:57,580
can basically it's ready to get to that

00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:59,860
close I don't know one one more example

00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:04,000
would be for example onboarding existing

00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:06,610
contributors I think one of the first

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,530
card here would not really be figure out

00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:10,649
who these people are but we knew so we

00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:15,240
just created a car for you

00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:18,569
and then we can track like who else and

00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:21,990
again this is the definition what does

00:14:18,569 --> 00:14:23,550
it mean that they know so we can decide

00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:27,179
at some point that this has been done

00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:31,290
enough no other work needs to be so this

00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:33,869
is when we define our goals and also

00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:38,189
define some actions that needs to be

00:14:33,869 --> 00:14:39,929
taken to get closer to the goal I was

00:14:38,189 --> 00:14:41,459
also thinking about issue and we have a

00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:45,259
separate issue tracker that is available

00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:48,529
for everyone so they can submit feedback

00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:50,730
bugs and whatever it's a separate thing

00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:53,429
and I think it would be nice to be

00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:55,860
somehow included in here like integrated

00:14:53,429 --> 00:14:58,589
with for example tiger which is a it

00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:01,980
with issue for Agra we use but I think

00:14:58,589 --> 00:15:03,899
that's one of yours and so this was the

00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:07,170
planning phase and just like figuring

00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:09,779
out what we want to do and if we found

00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:13,579
no work on something I can do

00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:13,579
yeah this question

00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:24,340
oh that's a very good that's a very good

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:29,050
question so the question was who is

00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:30,790
creating the cards or these epics so it

00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:34,090
depends in which environment you work on

00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:37,330
for example I work in team with Red Hat

00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:40,660
at what we would do is that these epics

00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:42,280
would be created out of our requirements

00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:44,530
for example from product management so

00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,700
they would say that they need a web UI

00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:47,980
or they will say the English

00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:50,080
translations and they will specify what

00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:52,150
that probably means right and then the

00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:55,150
implementation team could just approach

00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:57,640
this and say oh and I can by the way

00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:59,620
just like view it like like this but

00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,330
probably to achieve translations we need

00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:04,150
to develop the script and we need to

00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:07,840
develop this another script and the UI

00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:10,810
so this is a way how your product owner

00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:13,360
can tell you not what to do but what to

00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:14,890
achieve and it's up to you to figure out

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,660
what you need to do to get to that goal

00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:23,080
which i think is very important

00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:25,390
distinction so yeah good thank you so

00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:27,880
when you know this you can go to the

00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:29,950
camera view at least here in taiga and

00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:32,380
you can use any tool you want

00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:35,290
actually I'm trying to just present the

00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:38,170
concepts and like what we do but in

00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:40,060
taiga is this kind of view and we have

00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:43,390
these columns and these are basically

00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:47,380
different states for the cards and right

00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:49,840
now we have something called backlog to

00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:53,650
do in progress

00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:58,410
testing the block or waiting done and

00:16:53,650 --> 00:17:01,510
there is archives and these states are

00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:03,260
in this case define bar up by us because

00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:07,340
that's how we can organize

00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:09,590
most effectively so what's this backlog

00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:14,000
and to do so in backlog there are all

00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:16,400
the cards we basically have and we treat

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,270
it in a way that anyone can create a

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:23,330
card and then the team can just go

00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:25,400
through the card and this while that's

00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:28,160
the scorn of the looming and for example

00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,840
clarify what does it means maybe tweak

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,240
it a little bit and make sure that

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,280
everyone understands and then you can

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,020
move it to the to do which means that

00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,400
yeah you as a team agree that you want

00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:39,200
to do it and I scheduled for doing

00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,720
anything you could just pick it other go

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,690
so that's what the to do is there's the

00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:46,670
column you can just go and take some

00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:48,350
work so I could say I just want to

00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:50,120
figure out where to publish some of you

00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:51,740
might know if I don't know why you just

00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,750
go to the details that's not important

00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:56,480
and if I wanna work on it I would just

00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:58,490
move it to in progress this is important

00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,110
in teams that have like many people

00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:02,270
because that's the way you can

00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:06,950
communicate what you're doing and you're

00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:09,980
just stepping on each other's toes if I

00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:12,650
need testing I can have testing and this

00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:17,390
basically the distinction here is that I

00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:21,020
can see what's done but no plate ready

00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:22,610
to be used and you don't need to have

00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:25,490
this testing column I think I have

00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:27,470
created it like last week just for the

00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:30,170
deployment and might get rid of it again

00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:32,420
I don't know but this is completely up

00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:34,490
to you we have blocked waiting so for

00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:37,310
example I need to validate a design with

00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:40,340
the design team because I have created

00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:42,950
the home page that looked like in semi

00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:45,200
horrible way and I need someone from the

00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:48,590
design to say either is okay or just

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:51,580
tweak it and say it's nice so this is

00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:56,510
not a very good question yeah how do we

00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:58,820
prioritize much testing tasks for that

00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,300
student asks oh that's an excellent

00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,490
question

00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,930
how do we prioritize yeah so what let me

00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:03,380
finish explaining this column and I'll

00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:06,200
just

00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:08,690
okay yeah so yeah the block is basically

00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:12,560
work that's being done but not by us and

00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:15,110
in Kanban this might be useful so you

00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,490
can see like who's good time and not

00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:18,800
because for example I'm not doing any

00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:20,510
work for this but it's being worked on

00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:24,430
by someone else so I just like track it

00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:27,920
here and I'm responsible for delivering

00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:31,280
how do I know that was the question how

00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:32,840
do I know what to pick so that's one of

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,180
those things and thank you have it was a

00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:37,880
good question like basically miss miss

00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:40,460
that before during the grooming session

00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:42,110
you would normally with your team go

00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:44,720
through these to do cars you would

00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:46,340
somehow prioritize them so for example

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,920
if I think that this is much more

00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:51,110
important that this I can just move it

00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:54,590
up and I think it's even true so I'll

00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:56,600
just do it and you don't have to always

00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:58,280
pick the top one it's up to you because

00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,960
you're like until your person you just

00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:03,320
don't know what you want to do you know

00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:05,570
what but you should know that like that

00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:07,700
this is how we work that never took

00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:12,020
other most priority once and just near

00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:16,160
the body this is just the guideline and

00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:18,020
it's again whatever you decide what we

00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:23,540
weren't even trying to do would be like

00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:26,330
a first column with like a priority task

00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:29,600
so we have many things we could do right

00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:32,150
and not everything was needed for the

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,520
deployment that we did last week so you

00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:36,440
would have a another column with things

00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,600
that needs to be done before we can

00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:41,360
deploy so I could just like create a new

00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:43,250
column just use it for a week or so or

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,080
just a month it was actually several

00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:48,460
months and then you can just remove it

00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,460
it's very flexible

00:20:49,800 --> 00:21:00,150
yeah very good question without the

00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:01,530
advantages yeah so if I could the

00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:05,040
question was if I could do it with

00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:08,100
pecker issues or in Bugzilla or there's

00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:09,780
even board somewhere else so I think

00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:13,890
you're good and this is not meant to be

00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:16,530
saying that use Tiger which is the agile

00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:18,630
tool that's definitely true but what I

00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:20,940
see that it's important that this for my

00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:24,080
perspective to separate the issues which

00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:27,450
are different from your users from the

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:31,080
tasks and goals you actually find

00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:33,660
yourself because all in this world is

00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:36,150
created by the team no one else so we

00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:40,410
knows in there and we can write it in a

00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:43,170
way in kind of consistent way so we make

00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:45,750
these cars like maybe similar sizes or

00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:48,150
just in a way that we understand and we

00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:50,370
know it's actionable and as a end result

00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:53,580
on the other hand if you have issues

00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:55,410
they are submitted by users that are not

00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:57,210
part of your team maybe and they can

00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:59,400
submit anything it could be just like

00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:01,320
this is broken could you do this or can

00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,110
we discuss this now it's very

00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:07,890
constructive information so what I think

00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:10,380
would like the most if I would have this

00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:14,880
I should recollect separately and then

00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:17,790
maybe either pulling issues from it or a

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:21,300
great new task in here it's mostly

00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:23,520
conceptual but yeah you could definitely

00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:25,440
use any tool short ago you could use any

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:30,240
tool but I think separating those three

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:33,920
things those goals cards and that issues

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,920
is is useful

00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:46,730
I don't really you get issue you need to

00:22:43,809 --> 00:22:59,160
create an epic for it

00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:59,160
[Music]

00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:30,780
yeah so the question was that if I for

00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,250
example get an issue if I need to create

00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,900
an that big and a card for it and

00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:36,900
definitely no this is just a tool for

00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:38,820
communicating if you can work like with

00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,800
this and for example with your issues

00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:46,140
record fine just just continue doing it

00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:48,510
as absolutely fine I mean you also don't

00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:51,630
have to have all your cards under and I

00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:55,320
think that's I think there is a filter

00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:57,090
which works yeah I can filter by epic

00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:02,520
and there is not an epic and we have

00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:04,110
some like this yeah so we have some cars

00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,880
that are not in an epic because these

00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:08,130
are just like random things we need to

00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:10,440
do and maybe they are not like a

00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:12,510
completion like go or they are but they

00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:15,600
are not big enough that we need to

00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:21,720
figure out and make it complicated this

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:24,390
is also not meant to mental document

00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:26,309
everything you do in a huge detail this

00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:29,250
is meant to help you as a communication

00:24:26,309 --> 00:24:31,920
tool so like if you can do without this

00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:33,330
is absolutely great baby like one person

00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,230
who just don't need to do is if you have

00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:37,260
a good

00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:38,520
imagination right but whatever works so

00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:42,570
you're gonna even need to use those

00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:45,740
epics but for me personally it helped me

00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:48,179
with organizing the work and focusing on

00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:50,760
all those separate things and defining

00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:52,770
need to create like more work I can say

00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:54,690
yeah I need to prioritize relations so I

00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:56,429
can look this and now I have this called

00:24:54,690 --> 00:25:00,590
just this context of translations and I

00:24:56,429 --> 00:25:00,590
can focus about whatever works

00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:18,390
[Music]

00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:20,970
so the question is basically if there is

00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:23,790
a convention for the scholars and I

00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:26,100
think there are three basic columns that

00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:29,910
most project will use and it's like to

00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:31,290
do in progress and done but you

00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:33,720
basically do whatever works for your

00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:35,460
team right if I have just a few issues I

00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,560
don't think I would have to distinguish

00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:40,140
me to come back up and to do all right

00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:42,570
good because we have so much stuff and I

00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:44,310
sometimes just thinking about us

00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:46,140
I still use those translations but I

00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:48,090
think about translation just like I have

00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:49,710
an idea oh I need to do this so I can

00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:51,300
just create a car but it doesn't meet

00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:53,250
someone needs to work on it I just worry

00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:56,550
about it so that's why if we're in a

00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:58,260
backlog I'm also testing some work

00:25:56,550 --> 00:26:01,560
doesn't require this thing for example

00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:03,510
we did without testing like a month or

00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:06,180
two but when we were converting the

00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:07,740
content from the old way to the new way

00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:09,510
we actually had to test it so I just

00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:11,040
created the color but I'm pretty

00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:14,160
confident I can just delete it right now

00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:17,820
so I think whatever works for the team

00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:20,960
or whatever states you need to do also

00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:25,020
if you have like an infrastructure board

00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:27,060
you could have even connected with like

00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:29,730
that issues as I ascribe to the way that

00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:31,590
all the user requests issues or whatever

00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:33,840
would just end up in one call the

00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:35,730
commitment before this and it will be

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,710
them prioritizing and planning Network

00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:41,700
whatever like you can basically do

00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:47,610
whatever works for you - oh that's a

00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:49,080
good question it wasn't too fuzzy right

00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:52,440
I think I was describing the combs

00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:55,020
before we study the questions and I

00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:57,630
think I ended here but yeah not waiting

00:26:55,020 --> 00:27:02,160
it's work that's being done but not by

00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:04,350
me and this is done work that's done you

00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,350
can see faces here in names so these are

00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:08,200
the assignees

00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:10,840
card and these are not necessarily

00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:12,460
people who are doing the work but these

00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,110
are people who are responsible for the

00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:17,679
work and that's a very different

00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:20,890
distinction so for example Brian here is

00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:23,080
probably responsible for CI for stage

00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:25,270
and it doesn't mean he needs to do it

00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:27,309
but if someone else does it

00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:29,950
why needs to just like you're poking

00:27:27,309 --> 00:27:32,230
image it's right also if you have people

00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:34,030
with multiple team other services for

00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:36,460
people teams apart it could be a per

00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:37,929
which is a very definition of team you

00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:40,360
can have five people working on a car

00:27:37,929 --> 00:27:42,610
but there will be only one owner so they

00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:44,860
just look like arguing or just like it's

00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:46,929
you always have one person despite

00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:48,850
responsible for for example updating the

00:27:46,929 --> 00:27:50,640
car and making sure work is being done

00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:56,460
at the right point does it make sense

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:56,460
like the people who work versus owners

00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:03,010
[Music]

00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:06,640
so backlog here doesn't have assigned

00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:09,909
people so what would usually happen is

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:12,190
that in progress everything needs to

00:28:09,909 --> 00:28:15,669
have an assigned people from here to the

00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:17,559
back to the right like it must right in

00:28:15,669 --> 00:28:19,270
to do and backlog you don't have to have

00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:21,850
assigned people that means like anyone

00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:24,429
can pick it up but I can also see that

00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:26,169
for example this will be wearing that

00:28:24,429 --> 00:28:29,500
only I can do so I can just assign

00:28:26,169 --> 00:28:31,179
myself and I can somehow I can even do

00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,809
it right now because that's following me

00:28:31,179 --> 00:28:35,440
doing it

00:28:31,809 --> 00:28:37,210
and now anyone else on the team can see

00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,590
that oh this is a science so I don't

00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:39,669
even have to worry about it but this is

00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:42,240
free so I can take it

00:28:39,669 --> 00:28:42,240
right

00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:50,129
nice thing on finish with Demerol

00:28:56,519 --> 00:29:03,509
cool yeah yeah just one so one one thing

00:29:00,929 --> 00:29:06,089
that I guess from my observations of

00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:08,459
watching this process at work and then

00:29:06,089 --> 00:29:10,320
also having seen how the community

00:29:08,459 --> 00:29:11,849
people's work and I think probably many

00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,669
people here have experienced the same

00:29:11,849 --> 00:29:18,209
thing which is often you get issues that

00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:20,369
you don't know what to do or it's maybe

00:29:18,209 --> 00:29:22,080
it asks for one thing but really what

00:29:20,369 --> 00:29:24,179
that represents is a much bigger thing

00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,369
underneath you and so one of the most

00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:29,849
powerful things I think that this method

00:29:26,369 --> 00:29:33,719
gives you is in creating that backlog

00:29:29,849 --> 00:29:37,409
because the movement from backlog to do

00:29:33,719 --> 00:29:38,849
means something it means we're not sure

00:29:37,409 --> 00:29:40,619
what this represents you and we're not

00:29:38,849 --> 00:29:42,659
sure again we agree what it means or

00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:44,999
what work needs to be done they're

00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:47,729
moving from that such a new means now

00:29:44,999 --> 00:29:50,190
everybody understands everything needs

00:29:47,729 --> 00:29:51,479
to be done now you now you actually have

00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:54,419
something that's actionable and that's

00:29:51,479 --> 00:29:56,519
almost like in itself even if nothing

00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:59,700
else worked right that in itself would

00:29:56,519 --> 00:30:02,809
be amazing a lot of a lot of different

00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:04,919
teams because we have many times these

00:30:02,809 --> 00:30:07,379
discussions ended we have a general

00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:09,239
consensus but no one writes it down or

00:30:07,379 --> 00:30:10,799
we agree on a way to go but there was

00:30:09,239 --> 00:30:15,179
one person who didn't get to weigh in

00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:17,359
and say having met having that step it

00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:20,639
kind of enforces clarity without

00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:23,369
enforcing in a bad way is it a good way

00:30:20,639 --> 00:30:27,929
that everybody can benefit from yeah

00:30:23,369 --> 00:30:30,059
so yeah no that was that if we have this

00:30:27,929 --> 00:30:31,799
called the back folk and the end of to

00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:34,289
do but sometimes we give you the shoes

00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:36,809
that are too ambiguous so we are not

00:30:34,289 --> 00:30:38,309
sure what to do with these so the move

00:30:36,809 --> 00:30:40,360
from back up to to do where we can

00:30:38,309 --> 00:30:43,270
clarify and just make sure that we

00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:45,250
to do is somehow Europe and I think I do

00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:48,670
it with my personal task management so

00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:51,010
for example I have an inbox for like

00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:52,570
random thoughts and I just like gonna

00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:54,309
think about something about me is like

00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:57,070
write it down can be complete nonsense

00:30:54,309 --> 00:30:59,110
and then I would do my personal grooming

00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:00,700
and I would go through these just like

00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:02,650
oh so what did I mean by this

00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:05,350
oh it means I need to do this or I mean

00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:06,520
I you've achieved this or I can do this

00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:08,620
in like two minutes

00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:10,030
I'll just do it right now and I think

00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:14,790
yeah that's a very important distinction

00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:14,790
between just like

00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:47,559
[Music]

00:31:54,910 --> 00:32:01,030
at Mossad you know contributor I won't

00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:02,850
have time in my day job to go do this

00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:10,450
but we were able to make this happen

00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:13,150
from a very community perspective yeah

00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:14,530
that was written by Brian so yeah yeah

00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:16,360
the way we have it set up so you have

00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:18,820
like those epics and the cars it's good

00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:20,710
if you for example go out for a while

00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:22,450
and come back and you don't talk to

00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:23,920
people from the team but you kind of

00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:26,080
know what needs to be done

00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:28,210
so it's organized and I would add to

00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:30,790
this that if you for example onboard a

00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:32,320
new person or actually in the open

00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:35,680
source world that was just like person

00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:37,600
who wants to discover what's not in this

00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:39,250
project they can just see the epics and

00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,960
oh they're trying to do everywhere it is

00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:41,650
amazing all we are trying to do

00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,420
translation

00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:45,550
great so I can just have a look what's

00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:48,700
needs to be done in the translation so I

00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:50,410
can see like the definition so yeah I

00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:52,240
think I could achieve that I can see

00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:54,010
these actions I can do one other just

00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,560
create one I think it's much easier to

00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:59,860
invert or just like for people that are

00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:01,750
not 100% following the project all the

00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:03,840
time I think it's very easy to just like

00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:07,030
we keep and then just continue the work

00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:09,340
yeah I think we should finish so let me

00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:12,280
just close with this is just agile is

00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:14,140
not like the agile I don't think you can

00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:16,510
get certified and agile I don't think

00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:19,690
you can do a jille but you can adopt

00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:21,640
agile principles to your way of work so

00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:24,850
you can iterate so you can just like do

00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:26,560
smaller circles and I think it's

00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:29,080
important to distinguish between those

00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:30,550
three with me your goals between your

00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,530
own actions that get you closer to the

00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:37,770
goals between issues that are just user

00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:37,770
feedback and with this thank you

00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:43,499
