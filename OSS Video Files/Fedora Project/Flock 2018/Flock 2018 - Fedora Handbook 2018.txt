Talk: Fedora Handbook 2018
Presenters: Jiri Eischmann

Description: It's time to issue an updated version of our printed Fedora User Guide, so that it's ready for the fall season of conferences and the new year at universities.
This session will be focused on updating and perhaps extending the asciidoc content, refreshing the cover, discussing how to integrate the project into the Fedora docs.

so it's five people yeah that is exactly

00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:13,830
five more than last year so welcome to

00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,590
my talk again about federal extinction

00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,050
is this guy now my name is city ash man

00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:23,020
if you don't know me

00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:29,320
ya know can you hear me but okay

00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:33,239
oh yeah so I've been fellow ambassador

00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:36,489
for the last seven years and I've been

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:38,379
victimized reading this project that

00:00:36,489 --> 00:00:40,449
purchases the federal work station use

00:00:38,379 --> 00:00:45,780
this guide even though I'm not

00:00:40,449 --> 00:00:48,970
thoroughly dorks specialist basically

00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:51,250
the history of that is that it was

00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:54,220
originally written in check by lukashka

00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:59,589
tag one of the the community members in

00:00:54,220 --> 00:01:02,680
the Czech Republic the years ago we at

00:00:59,589 --> 00:01:06,549
that time we're discontinuing the the

00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:09,250
DVDs which were like a typical handout

00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:11,890
to or give away to people like at

00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:15,040
conferences it's a sort of incentive

00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:18,430
that would make them look into fedora

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:26,710
once they get home but you know nowadays

00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:29,859
no one else has DVD Drive and USB flash

00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:33,369
drives are still too expensive to to

00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:36,329
give away in larger quantities so we

00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:40,119
came up with with something like this

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:45,219
it was first as a pilot released in

00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:46,990
September of 2015 in Czech so firstly we

00:01:45,219 --> 00:01:49,719
wanted to tell how it's gonna work in

00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:54,189
the like a smaller Czech community and

00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:57,210
then if Italy has positive feedback then

00:01:54,189 --> 00:02:00,490
we would translate it into English which

00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:05,649
we did in the end the English then

00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:09,660
became the the new origin last year in

00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:14,520
March we moved to Peshawar from from get

00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:18,060
github we changed binding to Fedora

00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:21,190
workstation originally it was gen

00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,020
generic book lie about Federer even

00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:25,030
though the content was basically about

00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:28,060
about federal work station what matthew

00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:31,690
Miller wanted us to to bandidas federal

00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:34,600
work station book the first english

00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:36,670
release was in july 2017

00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:40,800
and then we produce the books these

00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:40,800
books in September 2017

00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:55,370
so the goal as I as I mentioned is a

00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:57,620
giveaway and it should help people learn

00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:01,670
about federal work station installation

00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:04,430
started using it so basically the the

00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:08,510
scope is from knowing nothing about

00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:10,760
where we are very where to get it how to

00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:14,420
insulate how to start using it how to

00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:18,290
get familiar with with the West so the

00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:20,299
book is great inquire in a generic way

00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:25,970
so it doesn't have to be able to updated

00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:31,129
any a very very release its teaches the

00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:34,549
the user or the person or potentially

00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:38,780
user about the values of headwear how it

00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:45,739
get installed how the way to find

00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:47,780
applications at Saturn so how we how it

00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:53,980
actually works it's it's still not part

00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:59,120
of fedora dorks for various reasons I

00:03:53,980 --> 00:04:02,060
I'm hoping that it it gets adopted in

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:05,180
some way but I haven't really had time

00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:08,239
to talk about that with the federal

00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:11,060
works people so as I said it's hosted on

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:14,000
page or we've got Bay all right now

00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:16,549
we've got two benches so master that's

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,849
the that's where we work on the at the

00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:24,169
next version and then once we are happy

00:04:19,849 --> 00:04:27,979
with the next version which we ideally

00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:31,039
we like to release one version a year at

00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:34,220
least for it the origin then we bench it

00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:38,060
to a stable bench called

00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:41,260
by that year so we've got right now 2017

00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:46,060
ones 2018 is finished and we relocate

00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:49,610
2018 the sources are in in ASCII dog

00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:54,320
escapes that we have they're like simple

00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:58,099
escapes generate a dog book HTML PDF the

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,569
PDF is just for the PD purposes and then

00:04:58,099 --> 00:05:04,819
we have one volunteer

00:04:59,569 --> 00:05:09,110
in in Brno office a lot into taken later

00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:14,360
and he then he spends a few days on that

00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:16,729
and produces a paint quality PDF as you

00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:20,169
can look at it the the typesetting is

00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:27,619
aspecting eyes in done in light tech

00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:30,939
let's I think the the most painful part

00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:34,729
of the process because that can tele be

00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:37,759
automated to to generate early nice

00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:40,219
results and that person says he can do

00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:42,860
it for English in check because he knows

00:05:40,219 --> 00:05:46,039
that the typesetting goes etcetera but

00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:48,889
he can't really do it for LA or any

00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:53,209
other language

00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:57,110
so basically when if people produce like

00:05:53,209 --> 00:05:59,809
the the digital very versions in their

00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:02,929
language translated then there still

00:05:59,809 --> 00:06:05,689
needs to be someone who does the autumn

00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:08,209
the manual typesetting in latex produces

00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:10,969
the paint quality PDF and then finds

00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:13,399
like a painter where you can rent where

00:06:10,969 --> 00:06:15,229
you can paint it so basically these days

00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:16,939
and why we have only produced the

00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:18,889
chicken English version even though

00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:22,419
right now we've got missing I think

00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:22,419
translation to Spanish

00:06:22,459 --> 00:06:30,909
actually this Devan Azul in that's you

00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:35,360
okay great thanks for translations but I

00:06:30,909 --> 00:06:38,149
I would I would like to hear if they if

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:42,079
there's any way how actually to to small

00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:45,349
stain line this process I even offered

00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:48,229
that we have we have a good relationship

00:06:45,349 --> 00:06:51,949
with one painting agency actually the

00:06:48,229 --> 00:06:54,919
owner is a big fan of big Linux fan and

00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:57,079
user and even gives us a like a tactic

00:06:54,919 --> 00:07:00,649
good buyers like to pay to paint this

00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:03,649
book it's about fifty fifty dollar sense

00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:08,709
which i think is spy defined because for

00:07:03,649 --> 00:07:08,709
example at the DVD was like 35 40

00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:16,940
do log sense while if you wanna produce

00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:22,520
with simply USB flashdisk that's like at

00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:26,419
least two three four dollars and none of

00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:30,070
them are very very reliable so basically

00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:33,310
those are I'm not sure if you can see it

00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:33,310
yeah but

00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:48,159
you can find it on page sure it's in the

00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:56,499
The Ambassadors guru project and the

00:07:48,159 --> 00:08:01,629
project is called Fedora handbook we

00:07:56,499 --> 00:08:06,159
haven't all integrated with any with any

00:08:01,629 --> 00:08:09,629
translation system and originally it was

00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:14,680
not very open to that for one lesson

00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:18,669
visually those those systems are more

00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:22,560
designed for translating software and

00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:28,180
they usually bake the the text into

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:30,580
stinks or paragraphs and so the

00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:33,070
translators don't le usually see the

00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:35,649
whole text and only see parts of it and

00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:40,260
once they translated by paragraphs that

00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:44,800
usually the result is not that good so

00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:48,490
originally I was I was quite against

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:50,620
that and I I the way I wanted the

00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:59,410
transistors to work on it is basically

00:08:50,620 --> 00:09:01,600
just work the dipole create folder or

00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:04,660
directory that is named after the code

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:07,660
of the language copy did the English

00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:16,209
content there and made 'basic translate

00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:19,750
the the content of ASCII files if if any

00:09:16,209 --> 00:09:22,810
like if if someone comes up and says

00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:25,810
like let's let's for example integrated

00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:29,140
with with Sonata and totally against

00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:31,510
that anymore if it's tames line and

00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:34,889
streamlines the process and makes it

00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:39,940
easier for people because as I said like

00:09:34,889 --> 00:09:42,430
this way like it was basically proved

00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:46,380
that it doesn't fly very well getting

00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:46,380
just one one translation

00:09:50,290 --> 00:10:00,350
and that's this basically of all from

00:09:56,359 --> 00:10:05,239
what I wanted to say and the reason why

00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:07,249
ice Purple's this talk is more about

00:10:05,239 --> 00:10:09,889
getting feedback and maybe talking about

00:10:07,249 --> 00:10:16,459
how to how to do it better because as I

00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:19,279
said it's basically I as a project

00:10:16,459 --> 00:10:22,069
leader of this came out of necessity

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:24,589
that it came from the ambassador's

00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:28,850
project but none of the original people

00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:31,069
in that dorks people so maybe we are

00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:34,489
doing something clearly wrong dead or

00:10:31,069 --> 00:10:37,489
stuff that can be improved either in the

00:10:34,489 --> 00:10:40,100
process how its how its produced or even

00:10:37,489 --> 00:10:42,169
the content itself it's another thing

00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:44,779
I'd like to for example here a feedback

00:10:42,169 --> 00:10:47,869
from you if there is anything you deli

00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:51,100
really miss it's the the goal or scope

00:10:47,869 --> 00:10:55,009
of it shouldn't only be like a complete

00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:57,589
user guide to fatwa but it daily it

00:10:55,009 --> 00:11:00,470
should really cover the the journey from

00:10:57,589 --> 00:11:02,329
hearing about failure for the first time

00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:04,669
and installing it and getting familiar

00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:08,149
with that so it shouldn't be really like

00:11:04,669 --> 00:11:08,629
a complete guide where to set things at

00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:11,299
cetera

00:11:08,629 --> 00:11:14,239
basically just you know to get the user

00:11:11,299 --> 00:11:17,149
to the point where he's sort of familiar

00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:20,480
with with the system also we want to

00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:25,009
make it to watch let's say I think right

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:28,759
now it's about 33 pages so it could be a

00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:31,399
bit longer but then it if it gets over

00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:35,379
for example 50 pages then it gets also

00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:35,379
more expensive to paint

00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:52,860
so when I think so it's on pager and if

00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:57,120
you look for for example fedora -

00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:57,120
handbook it should get

00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,800
yep

00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:22,960
at first I was very excited to have a

00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:26,890
handbook because it's really useful for

00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:31,170
for newcomers to have a guy that teach

00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:33,630
them how to go through the system but

00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:36,670
you know I was working in the

00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:39,280
translation but I stopped it because the

00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:40,780
English translation wasn't ready so it's

00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:45,040
ready now to start working against

00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:49,240
translations and the other thing I want

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,750
to ask is I know Sonata is a great

00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,940
project

00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:55,930
translation but I think it's not the

00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:57,760
best way to apply here because there is

00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:58,510
no way that senator will produce an

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,300
ASCII dog

00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:03,220
output so you will be able to translate

00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:06,400
every paragraph but you are going to

00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:08,530
receive an HTML file I think not know

00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:11,850
dang asciidoc file so you are now be

00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:14,500
able to test the PDF printing from the

00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:17,320
senator that's why you understand maybe

00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:20,710
I'm wrong but because I have a project

00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:25,030
insalata but I went to the HTML file and

00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:27,010
it works for me so the question is the

00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:29,350
English translation is ready to be

00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:31,720
translated to another languages because

00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:33,520
when the tanga stop the Spanish

00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,710
translation was because of that because

00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:38,160
it's not ready to start the English

00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:38,160
version

00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:53,650
so I like I'd like to have the English

00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:57,760
done for this year in a month or two so

00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:59,410
once once we are fine okay with the the

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,010
English version we will just make did

00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:04,480
the bench again right now there I I

00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:08,980
haven't even pushed the changes I made

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:11,020
into into the repository yet basically I

00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:14,290
was waiting for this before this meeting

00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:22,960
I gave like people look at and I threw

00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:31,170
the book like you wanna take a look for

00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:31,170
