Talk: Fedora Handbook 2018
Presenters: Jiri Eischmann

Description: It's time to issue an updated version of our printed Fedora User Guide, so that it's ready for the fall season of conferences and the new year at universities.
This session will be focused on updating and perhaps extending the asciidoc content, refreshing the cover, discussing how to integrate the project into the Fedora docs.
