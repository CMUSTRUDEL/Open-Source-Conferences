Talk: State of Fedora Server Edition and
Too Fast/Too Slow: When does Modularity make sense?
Presenters: Stephen Gallagher, Langdon White

Description: 
This will be the annual status and plenary session for the Fedora Server Edition. It will be a two-part session, the first 15-20 minutes will be a report on the current status of the Fedora Server Edition and the new features that were implemented over the last year.

Modularity is the Next Big Thing in Fedora, but is it the right hammer for your particular bolt?

This talk will walk through the benefits and drawbacks to converting your project from a traditional RPM to a Fedora Module. It will discuss how to analyze the cost-benefit ratio of maintainer effort vs. end-user utility as well as comparing and contrasting some of the alternative tools to accomplish similar tasks (such as Software Collections, Docker Containers and Amazon Linux Extras).
