Presenters: Huzaifa Sidhpurwala

Description: Fedora Security Team exists but is not really active. This talk is an attempt to:

Look at the state of Fedora Security
Security Teams which other distributions have.
Current state of Fedora Security Team and problems we are facing.
Attempt to reboot the team.
Stuff which Red Hat Product Security does, which we may want to do with Fedora Security.
How you as a Fedora contributor can make a difference here!
