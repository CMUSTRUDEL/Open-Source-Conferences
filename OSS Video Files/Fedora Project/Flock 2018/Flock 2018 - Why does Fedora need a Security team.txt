Talk: Why does Fedora need a Security team
Presenters: Huzaifa Sidhpurwala

Description: Fedora Security Team exists but is not really active. This talk is an attempt to:

Look at the state of Fedora Security
Security Teams which other distributions have.
Current state of Fedora Security Team and problems we are facing.
Attempt to reboot the team.
Stuff which Red Hat Product Security does, which we may want to do with Fedora Security.
How you as a Fedora contributor can make a difference here!

	00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:16,139
so we talked a little bit about why

00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:18,210
Fedora needs a security my name is

00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:21,869
zephyr i am a principal software

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:24,720
engineer with that hat I am a part that

00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:26,910
had direct security which was all

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,880
formerly known as Security Response Team

00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,890
and now we are known as we are we are

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,690
responsible for the product for the

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,670
security of products which you get

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,309
higher sense which includes things like

00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:41,370
you know they NJ both and stuff like

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:43,170
that I am a part of various upstream

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:47,219
security teams I have been involved with

00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:50,700
Mozilla LibreOffice PHP Python sambar X

00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:53,640
or Archie open SSL I have been involved

00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,680
with the different security groups and

00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,559
security teams these upstream projects

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,050
have in various capacities I have been

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,550
contributing to fedora in various ways I

00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,189
used to do something infrastructure work

00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:07,280
long time back I maintained around 28

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:08,490
security packages in Syria right now

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,979
[Music]

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:16,470
I speak a lot about open source and

00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:19,950
security at conferences so how many

00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:21,659
people have seen seen this news I think

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,600
this is like two weeks that what really

00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:27,840
this back recently Arch Linux was

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,790
compromised one of the user accounts was

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,900
hacked and it seems that the attacker

00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:36,450
was able to commit to the repository and

00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,990
he was able to add a backdoor to the

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:41,640
accurate package which they have and

00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:42,930
luckily it seems it did not spread a lot

00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,300
some someone

00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,830
what is that you know the checksum is a

00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:49,830
little bit different

00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:52,200
the back door was the back door was not

00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:55,080
very intelligent what a magma basically

00:01:52,200 --> 00:02:02,900
did was we tried to collect machinery

00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:06,900
information like you name and the but

00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:09,450
basically bad things could happen so I

00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:11,280
spoke little word of my colleagues and

00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:16,410
what he has done is he has made a

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:19,530
document which lists all the media's all

00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:21,239
the various disclose which have all the

00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:23,430
material disclose which have been

00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:26,310
compromised in the last ten years and

00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:28,320
the document contains like 50 or 60

00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:30,209
different incidents and it basically

00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,220
take tells us that you know just because

00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:34,830
we have an open source distribution it

00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:38,070
does not mean you are immune to these

00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:39,780
kind of six your treatments so that's

00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:43,560
great that brings me back to the

00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:46,320
question which I which I had why does

00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,030
fedora need a security team and a lot of

00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,370
people would say that doesn't Fred Fred

00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:52,440
knows already have a security team so if

00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:55,019
you if you if you click on these links I

00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,880
think around five or six years back a

00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:58,920
couple of my colleagues and some of the

00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:02,010
contributors they decided to form a

00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:04,590
security team and if you read what one

00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:06,900
of these VK PPP is I think about 15 odd

00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:10,110
people signed signed up which included

00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:13,220
my myself and out of that I think three

00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:15,630
or four decided to the ah-1 contributed

00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:20,040
the kind of contribution which these

00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:22,799
guys normally did was ping package

00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,450
maintainer on IRC or chill email or you

00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:26,970
know some some kind of thing and ask

00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:29,519
them to patch six security bugs right

00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:31,410
and a lot of times package maintainer

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,600
said yet you know I am busy today I do

00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:35,819
it tomorrow you know this this week I

00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,200
have some project I'm working on

00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:38,939
I won't be able to do it are you know

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,219
probably I do it next month or I do it

00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:43,200
month after that and this is really a

00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:45,239
tankless job because we like to know if

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,890
you are a technical contributor all you

00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:48,719
all you are doing is you are pinging

00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:52,230
people and you are asking them to pass

00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:54,900
your packages so it started a bit it

00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:57,659
started with a lot of enthusiasm they

00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,900
had writing weekly meetings if I am NOT

00:03:57,659 --> 00:03:59,609
wrong

00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,400
they had weekly meetings for a couple of

00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:05,310
years and then people started backing

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:09,000
out because it was not really exciting

00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:11,129
thing to do the current state is it's

00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,010
not really a functional team they only

00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:16,289
exist on the wiki they don't have

00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:18,449
meetings for the last one year or one

00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:21,449
and a half year if I remember correctly

00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:23,310
I think Jared was in waddlesworth they

00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:25,500
don't have a meeting they did not have

00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:29,280
meetings at all and I am not sure if

00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:32,070
anybody is really fun functional what I

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:35,759
really want to do is I want to ZZ boot

00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:37,169
the Fedora security team when I say the

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,120
boot it doesn't mean that like you know

00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:41,220
we we do what we previously previously

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,590
used to do I I don't want to do that

00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,960
that double job of you know pinging

00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:48,830
people on IRC and getting them that way

00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:53,840
why don't you pass CCV so-and-so because

00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:57,930
people don't normally do in this point

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:59,760
yeah so as I said contributors quickly

00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,380
lost it lost interest because they were

00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,479
a lot of technical people on the team

00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:07,710
and you know technical people are not

00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:10,110
really good with people skills so the

00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:14,520
kind of stress is slightly distressing

00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:18,210
I I think yesterday I that I read a

00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:20,669
report on Fedora book Mozilla it is

00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:22,949
on the the CB buzz which are open

00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:27,810
against federal but bugzilla and I think

00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:30,500
I saw 993 so the current version of it

00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:33,720
Fedora which you have some suffers from

00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:36,419
993 six security philosophy and I think

00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:39,600
out of that thirteen of routine are

00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:42,000
against it image magic so the this

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,370
strength the the state right now is a

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,979
little bit distressing I am sure at

00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:49,289
least ten or twenty percent of those CV

00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:51,660
if not a not be fixed or you know it was

00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:54,389
already fixed because we leave you the

00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:56,340
practical but the package maintainer was

00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:59,009
probably too lazy or if he did not have

00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:00,539
any time to probably close the CPE or

00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:04,080
whatever so we have we have had

00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:08,340
currently we have 993 CV flaws which are

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:10,650
open against packages in fedora so what

00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:12,720
what my sense of sedation is and what I

00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:14,370
really want to do at this point is do

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,169
some something which is more exciting

00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:18,120
than you know as I said pinging people

00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:20,729
on our see the first thing which I want

00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:24,000
to do is securities can package it

00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:26,340
package packages on entry right so we we

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,449
currently have we currently have a solid

00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:32,190
packages of you process and when I talk

00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:34,169
with my colleagues at that hat and

00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:36,900
hovering to tell tell them that you know

00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:38,789
that hat has got or not to learn from

00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:41,729
the packages of you process which finola

00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:45,659
has like you know our processes is not

00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:47,430
even 10% of the package review process

00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:48,990
which we don't address so we have an

00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:51,300
excellent package is even the new

00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:54,090
process what is missing though he'll try

00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:58,380
to see if we can integrate some kind of

00:06:54,090 --> 00:07:00,509
automated security scan on the federal

00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:02,490
faculty review project and I'm going to

00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:04,110
talk a little about that because we we

00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:07,800
are doing some work on this and to the

00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:09,720
deadhead as well one more thing which I

00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,490
proposed to fresco whiting a couple of

00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,250
weeks back and they are near sendest

00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:17,069
is trying to figure out if they can be a

00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:18,840
package exit process as well and I'm

00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:19,800
going to talk a little bit about that as

00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,050
well

00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:25,110
third thing is try to have a mechanism

00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:28,620
to see if it is possible to scan come

00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:31,319
commits so why pointing very difficult a

00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:33,150
fedora is to get a new package inside

00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:35,789
the distribution right because you need

00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:39,810
to go through process and things like

00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:41,970
that but like like my colleagues in six

00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:43,949
security now normally say we are hard on

00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:46,800
the outside but we are soft and mushy on

00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:49,319
the inside what it basically means that

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,380
once you get a package inside the fedora

00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:55,440
once I have commit access if I have

00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:57,630
proven packager then I I basically have

00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,270
access to any of the packages right I

00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:03,389
can it is very easy for me to if you use

00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:05,789
a back door so I I went to one of these

00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:08,310
security conferences at Ignacio on your

00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:10,860
way home before dad and I spoke with

00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:12,720
this purpose person and I told him that

00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:15,090
you know I am a federal country butyl

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,370
and he asked me for help if I ask he

00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:20,849
asked me if I have one package Alexis

00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:24,240
and I told him that I I do have and then

00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:26,909
he tells me that would I be willing to

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,070
would I be willing to introduce a

00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:32,099
backdoor in some of the federal packages

00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:33,930
because I have to do our taxes so it is

00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:36,270
not impossible it may be a little bit

00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:39,329
difficult so it may not be impossible

00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:40,979
they are a lot of companies so I talk

00:08:39,329 --> 00:08:41,849
with a lot of Google security

00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,890
researchers

00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:46,260
Google has this mechanism in which

00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:48,120
whatever commit you make to the chromium

00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,760
is a positive there is a heuristic

00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,910
script which is honest as at the backend

00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:56,190
probably as one of the great books and

00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:58,050
heuristics script tries to figure out if

00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:00,240
you are doing something malicious or not

00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:02,040
so I don't have access to the word which

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,290
actually that does it but it may of the

00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,470
hopefully looking at key keywords or you

00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:09,740
know your your code right

00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:11,180
or whatever so these are these are the

00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:15,620
three things which I really want to

00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:18,410
introduce now so so that had basically

00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:20,300
uses the Fedora package is a view

00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:22,280
project internally so this is a project

00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:25,340
which I started around two or three

00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:27,620
months back we use the we have

00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:30,680
the federal up package either via

00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:33,170
process internally we do a lot of

00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:36,020
security scanning with a fedora

00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:38,390
packaging video project we have still

00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:40,340
writing a lot of code the code is not

00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:42,440
good enough to be sent back to upstream

00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:44,840
but we are still working on it

00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,880
what I really want to do is probably six

00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:49,310
months down the line make sure the code

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,560
is good enough and try to send it

00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:54,230
upstream to Fedora project Fedora

00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:56,540
package is a new blog project there are

00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:58,880
lot of things which you can do for free

00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:01,070
right the first thing which you can do

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,460
is you can scan the niños de c.v

00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:07,430
depository so NISD maintains depository

00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:09,950
of all the CVE issue a CVS which it

00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:11,990
which it has assigned so if a person

00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:14,780
wants to introduce and you produce a

00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:16,520
package in fedora what you can do is you

00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,950
can take the package name and you can do

00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,720
a grab against the XML you wish they

00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:22,820
have and see if there are any CDs which

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,070
are open if there are any series which

00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:28,490
are open to the package maintainer is

00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:30,110
required to fix those CVS first before

00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:32,780
we actually go and introduce that

00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:35,390
package in fedora you can run a lot of

00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:37,070
static analyzers which are available in

00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:39,380
a free of cost and they are open source

00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:43,640
it can be done for free as well you can

00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:46,220
use that had XML RPC infrastructure 220

00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:49,160
if there are any open bugs against that

00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:50,900
particular package in say in that hat or

00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,880
you know if there are any open bugs in

00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,950
Debian or if they are only open but

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,390
again you pursue solutions this is

00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:58,730
something which is that hat product

00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:01,190
security does internally so when we have

00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:04,160
a new package we check if the Debian

00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:06,920
bugzilla openSUSE bugzilla if any of

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,079
these distribution bugs ITA's has any

00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,910
per security issues and if they are

00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:12,920
anything we have the containers to fix

00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:15,649
them first so there are a lot of things

00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,929
which you can do one thing very

00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:20,089
important over here is not all packages

00:11:17,929 --> 00:11:22,459
reviewers are technical enough to know

00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:25,279
security so we want to ensure that you

00:11:22,459 --> 00:11:28,040
know this can be automated and when use

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,569
underfed over the packages view to the

00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,949
to a tape tells you that you know this

00:11:29,569 --> 00:11:33,199
particular package which you are trying

00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:35,149
to review has got three CVS which are

00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:37,399
open against it cv so and so so and so

00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:40,249
and this is the link to where you can

00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:42,709
sign up that matches and please ask the

00:11:40,249 --> 00:11:44,929
person who wants to introduce this

00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:46,939
package to first fix all of these cv

00:11:44,929 --> 00:11:49,699
issues right so this is one thing which

00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:51,290
is missing a lot i I have noticed a

00:11:49,699 --> 00:11:53,209
couple of packages which were introduced

00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:55,449
and they had open security issues which

00:11:53,209 --> 00:11:59,359
is really really bad

00:11:55,449 --> 00:12:00,949
so like like I said if any open security

00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:03,319
issues are found then we are the

00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:05,509
maintainer to fix them first before we

00:12:03,319 --> 00:12:07,359
are able to introduce that package in

00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:10,939
Fedora

00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:16,040
package exit this is this is the darling

00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:17,389
of the faithful schoo proposal which I

00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,489
introduced the has been a lot of

00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:22,339
discussion on video guard David as well

00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:24,439
a lot of people have made me personally

00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:27,169
as well some of these people are

00:12:24,439 --> 00:12:31,939
offensive offensive as well I am not

00:12:27,169 --> 00:12:34,519
sure why so I wrote that I am disturbed

00:12:31,939 --> 00:12:36,889
by the large amount of packages which

00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:38,660
Fedora has I think the last talk which

00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:41,360
are you going to Paul just said that we

00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:44,179
we have 21,000 plus packages and free

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,160
surface and this guy made me buy back

00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:49,069
saying that why are you not disturbed

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:52,429
about absolute versions of PHP and bash

00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:54,049
and stuff that you have in this so there

00:12:52,429 --> 00:12:58,489
are a few people which are offensive as

00:12:54,049 --> 00:12:59,640
well but basically what I want to do is

00:12:58,489 --> 00:13:01,769
I find out

00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:04,200
package maintainers our package

00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:06,690
maintenance in a few Dora because they

00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,610
have a university project to do or you

00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:10,920
know they have interest in astronomy or

00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:12,630
they have interest in some something and

00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:16,200
you know they they want to introduce

00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:18,360
that del package into fedora and a lot

00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:21,029
of these package maintainer sleeve say

00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,740
in six months or one year or two years

00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:24,420
or something like that because their

00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:26,880
project is done or you know they are no

00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:29,430
longer interested or the day job

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,260
pressure is too too much so a lot of

00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:33,450
package maintainers leave and I have

00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:35,970
noticed that the package will keep on

00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:39,089
building in the next versions of it all

00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:42,000
right so I mean they were automated in

00:13:39,089 --> 00:13:44,970
these we built against f27 and f28 and

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,610
f29 and so on and so forth though the

00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:49,350
package maintainer is probably is no

00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:51,959
longer a contributor or you know he's

00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:53,640
probably dead or whatever so that that

00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:56,070
keeps on happening or not and what

00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:57,600
basically happens is then the CD issues

00:13:56,070 --> 00:14:00,899
which were filed against that particular

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,089
pattern package some some time back then

00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:05,399
used to be closed because the difficult

00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:07,050
decision is end of life they are no note

00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:10,050
no longer closed now they are carried

00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:13,170
over to the next super version of fedora

00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:15,120
but in the end we end up with a lot of

00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:17,279
severe issues against a particular

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,320
application so Nair has been a lot of

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,930
discussion only others my initial

00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:24,209
proposal was to wait for to the lease

00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:26,310
site cycles thank you know if they are

00:14:24,209 --> 00:14:29,310
not of CV against fedora eggs

00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:31,529
we wait till Fedora X plus two we

00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:32,940
probably try to have a have a way in

00:14:31,529 --> 00:14:35,250
which we can ping the maintainer

00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:37,199
probably do it in an automated way and

00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:39,230
if the maintainer does not respond then

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:43,339
we try to exit the package by using

00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:46,220
if TBS right so us it's similar process

00:14:43,339 --> 00:14:48,470
to what if TBS earth as the maintainer

00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,970
can always be introduced a package back

00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,709
like you know if you are on some

00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:53,870
vacation for one one year or something

00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:55,610
like that when you are back you see that

00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:57,440
your package has been removed you can

00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:01,760
always try to fix these issues and get

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:04,070
the package back my proposal also

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,620
included are having a list of critical

00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:09,440
rpms which cannot be in the mood let you

00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:10,579
know probably have rpm or DNA for one of

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,380
these binbin

00:15:10,579 --> 00:15:14,329
duties or you know these rpms which are

00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:16,100
really essential to the distribution

00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:18,980
that gives you the modem from the

00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:21,230
distribution that would build so have a

00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:24,920
list of critical rpms which can not be

00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:26,690
the mood I was thinking thinking about

00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,579
you know what to do babies rpms like

00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:29,630
Nikki miss magic right so I think not

00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:32,839
side-chick imagemagick

00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:35,389
had some 53 security issues out of that

00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:38,269
I think only 12 were currently open but

00:15:35,389 --> 00:15:40,220
the imagemagick is usually a package in

00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:43,310
which has got a hundred CVS in a year or

00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:45,380
something like that and a lot of people

00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:48,949
like interface we do not surprisingly

00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:50,990
use image magic and not right so we can

00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:52,579
probably have a grey list of rpms which

00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:54,829
like you know which cannot be removed

00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:56,449
because people use it a lot but we

00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:58,040
published early

00:15:56,449 --> 00:16:00,890
raelia sort of icky saying that these

00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:02,630
rpms has not a lot of security issues so

00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:04,699
you know we have not the good terms of

00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:07,149
Amadora but if you really want to use it

00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:11,209
then you know please use it on your own

00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:13,399
and you have already noting I have

00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:15,050
anything more so those other things

00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:16,790
which I really wanted to talk talk about

00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:18,680
or not none of these things are in the

00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:23,019
slide right now that you know the first

00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:23,019
test for ticket yes

00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:34,670
email of March of this year and I think

00:16:33,139 --> 00:16:37,940
it was a year before that was the last

00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:39,889
email and it's it's not happening I

00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,690
think I think everything you're bringing

00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:43,610
up here's some great ideas but there's

00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:46,730
perhaps in ways we can take it further

00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:49,399
if we decide to really reboot the door

00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:52,250
security to be what it should be if

00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:53,449
these are all great right but I don't I

00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:56,240
wouldn't change any of them I think

00:16:53,449 --> 00:16:58,220
they're great but we also have the way

00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,750
that this kid is right now in inpatient

00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:03,649
we have the ability to instead of

00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:06,709
harassing somebody and saying hey fix

00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:08,480
your CV I mean they should just see the

00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:10,400
bug and fix it that's not happening

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,839
instead of harassing them we could

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,000
actually just do a pull request in their

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,770
package we file a pull request and then

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,569
you could actually even then have an

00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:21,169
automated script that goes through and

00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:23,839
checks all all pull requests and if it's

00:17:21,169 --> 00:17:26,120
not merged within a week two weeks

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,380
whatever then equipment package

00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,390
architects are just going to do the

00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,309
merge themselves and rebuilding get rid

00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:34,820
of that issue now you still have the

00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:37,309
issue of of package where the maintainer

00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:39,340
is gone right and it's kind of a feuless

00:17:37,309 --> 00:17:41,480
type of routine package or having to

00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:43,520
continuously basically they're taking a

00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,110
main maintenance on that product so

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,870
there would be a way to report you know

00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:51,620
if the version is completely out of date

00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:55,480
right we've got package X version and Y

00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:58,190
and they're on version disease whatever

00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:01,100
upstream that sector would call that's a

00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:03,260
problem right so maybe we do want to

00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:04,820
drop the package but it's a way that we

00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:09,500
could hopefully close a lot of those

00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:10,590
security bugs without you know with the

00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:13,620
maintainers who are not willing

00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:16,049
the work themselves right i I think the

00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:20,460
big big chunk of problem over here is so

00:18:16,049 --> 00:18:23,070
a lot of dcv issues are related not only

00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:24,870
I mean it's a lot of these deviations

00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:29,070
don't have patches which are directly

00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:31,620
applicable I think the ones which is the

00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:34,080
993 issues which we which I was I was

00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:36,210
talking about a lot of them are little

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,710
bit more complicated than trying to back

00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:40,559
code the patch from off-screen Mozilla

00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:42,749
tries to debase a package a lot of this

00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:46,019
PHP package is false for example in the

00:18:42,749 --> 00:18:47,580
sub packages which PHP Ruby gems they

00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:50,669
required a little bit of more technical

00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:52,830
and component know how to try to figure

00:18:50,669 --> 00:18:56,309
out if this CV issue does really affect

00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:58,049
the way PHP works in control of the VHP

00:18:56,309 --> 00:19:00,029
works or the way Ruby gems work since we

00:18:58,049 --> 00:19:02,549
do not because what product security

00:19:00,029 --> 00:19:04,740
basically does is we find a mark against

00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:06,509
you know number I am not sure if they

00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:09,330
have enough time to you know probably

00:19:06,509 --> 00:19:11,249
look at how the version of PHP is fade

00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:14,190
or I am different from you know it is

00:19:11,249 --> 00:19:15,749
this one was the early effect or not the

00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:20,730
kernel side we get the same thing we did

00:19:15,749 --> 00:19:23,580
in fact there is one today there was it

00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:25,799
was fixed in 4.14 today we fixed a long

00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,450
time ago that's great I saw other get

00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:28,559
stratification and work and say yes were

00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:32,009
covered they're not

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:34,440
notification at all but I mean they've

00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:37,440
put a once that can be so let's say we

00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,700
get rid of 300 of those 900 something I

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,879
mean that still puts us in a better

00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:44,070
position right definitely

00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:45,690
though I I think the big is is that you

00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:48,090
know it's the responsibility of the

00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:49,590
package maintainer the security flaws

00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:51,749
probably you know if the package

00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:53,580
maintainer is away on vacation or you

00:19:51,749 --> 00:19:55,559
know he's talking not whether is too

00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:59,190
busy then you know we can probably try

00:19:55,559 --> 00:20:01,110
try doing that but in my opinion it

00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:04,529
should not it should not give our faults

00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:06,419
it should not give a false things you

00:20:04,529 --> 00:20:10,289
know if you don't fix your security

00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:12,210
flaws we we will do it yeah like so

00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:16,259
which is very important in in my opinion

00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:18,059
oh yeah I mean just plus if the package

00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:20,519
is really really important that you know

00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:22,919
effect if it is all open SSL or if it is

00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:24,690
a glutinous or something like that which

00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:26,580
is a really really important package and

00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,749
you know it really needs the basics then

00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:29,730
you know we can have some money from

00:20:27,749 --> 00:20:32,190
through one package is it but I I have

00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:40,379
seen a lot of these CDs which are open

00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:42,419
again the games which we have would it

00:20:40,379 --> 00:20:44,549
make sense to somehow label packages

00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:46,590
with open and known CVS in Bugzilla

00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:49,320
in software management tools such as

00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:51,059
software or DNA or something so you

00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,950
you're trying to update system and it

00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:54,299
tells you you have those packages on

00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:57,419
your system installed and they are known

00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:59,100
series for them yeah just to create a

00:20:57,419 --> 00:21:01,289
pressure for the package maintainer or

00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:04,679
just that people actually see that this

00:21:01,289 --> 00:21:08,009
package is so broken in my opinion that

00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:09,480
probably needs a lot of work so I I was

00:21:08,009 --> 00:21:11,580
thinking of doing some something like

00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,440
this for the great release packages

00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:15,269
which I was talking about like image

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,800
magic and stuff like that which has a

00:21:15,269 --> 00:21:19,800
lot of seniors open but we

00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:21,930
still lose it or not so robbery it would

00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,430
be easier to list those packages under

00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:25,650
we keep saying that you know this is the

00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:28,590
list of unsafe or I think secure

00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:31,140
packages but nobody reads that yeah

00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:33,180
definitely but what what what if we did

00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:38,580
it so I mean it's a simple query in

00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:40,050
Bugzilla to to find the tv-tv is pretty

00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:42,720
close there they're all kind of security

00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:47,160
right it's a fairly simple query what

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:49,230
about publishing that list or a package

00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:52,920
owner and package and you public settle

00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:54,030
is to say once a month yes because to

00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,370
pin or to bail

00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:59,040
yeah but they look like that and that

00:21:56,370 --> 00:22:00,480
way people can see and hopefully there's

00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:02,850
a little bit of public shaming there to

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,380
the point of if your name if your name

00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:07,890
and those CVEs have been on that list

00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:09,210
for five or six months you know people

00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:10,470
might start to give you a hard time -

00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:12,360
and there's some peer pressure there

00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:14,100
it could be I mean that that could be

00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:18,660
automated where now you just run this

00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:20,400
script and send me off so why do I do

00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:21,960
much more sub-project which I don't want

00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,850
wanted to do is we have this internal

00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,410
dashboard in product security which we

00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:27,420
use we should enter tell me you know

00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:29,580
what are the different bugs which I have

00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:31,230
in like you so what one interesting

00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:32,760
which I have wanted to do is what to

00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:35,340
have a dashboard kind of thing which

00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:37,200
fees it's the data found opens it up

00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:40,260
quick quick query right in a dashboard

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,000
it tells you that against which against

00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:44,490
which in distribution you have how many

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,640
critical important moderate and those

00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:49,590
non which are open right that's not not

00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,060
only going to put pressure on the

00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:53,400
maintainer but it's going to put a

00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:55,390
pressure on people up also accomplished

00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:59,140
let's go you know

00:22:55,390 --> 00:23:00,640
Fedora 28 has got say five critical and

00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:03,340
20 ad important issues and you know

00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,840
people start asking questions like you

00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,370
know why why these issues are not being

00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,020
fixed and then when you click on the

00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:10,570
graph it will tell tell you against

00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:12,190
which component it copied it goes to a

00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:14,790
sub page it tells you against which

00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:17,560
component how many issues are open and

00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:20,230
which you may make maintainer have the

00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:22,300
worst record of crying to a Disick

00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:23,950
security flaw so you know probably did

00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,720
this is so either the sub sub project

00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:27,430
widget which I wanted to do but I did

00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:30,430
not bring up over here because it was

00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:32,110
not that big enough and it's not very

00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:33,910
difficult right I mean you you need data

00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:40,870
for Mozilla and your path also time you

00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:43,210
know you it's not very difficult I mean

00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:46,120
there's so there is a community aspect

00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:48,310
and you know people don't want to to be

00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:51,940
seen as the guy who doesn't address

00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:55,480
security and package maintainer sure was

00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:56,380
showing up in a no monthly email to and

00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,690
I don't think it needs to be more

00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:01,480
frequently than possible but people are

00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:11,230
showing up there consistently maybe

00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:14,370
they'll get some peer pressure because

00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:14,370
I've seen

00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:21,860
for ten years Seabees

00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:27,000
[Music]

00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:30,660
over perfectly of course you can but you

00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:33,000
will not do not normally be in my tree

00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:34,980
well why should I maintain a package

00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,200
business upstream that's been there for

00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:39,690
ten years and then security issues well

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:44,010
what's the value is per se first the

00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:47,309
answer I got was because only using they

00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:53,669
should be the policy of the door remove

00:24:47,309 --> 00:24:56,190
this bucket is a process and that's what

00:24:53,669 --> 00:24:57,840
it did yes so that's what the fresco

00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:59,549
heard about the best coach ticket ask

00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,960
but you know part of it is if I'm gonna

00:24:59,549 --> 00:25:03,900
maintainer of this package to carry

00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,330
better than not I should if nobody else

00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:08,250
is going to fix it I mean clearly

00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:11,160
somebody published a CBE right so

00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:14,299
there's somebody's researching it it

00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:18,109
should be able to write I go fix

00:25:14,299 --> 00:25:20,089
and might mark because you might close

00:25:18,109 --> 00:25:21,919
the bug as won't fix and here's one

00:25:20,089 --> 00:25:24,799
right I mean I've got a list of kernel

00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:26,299
bugs right now that because first thing

00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:27,889
I do every morning is check the kernel

00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:30,649
CDs it's also the last thing I do for

00:25:27,889 --> 00:25:32,269
you there's 20 someone booked right now

00:25:30,649 --> 00:25:34,729
there's one researcher who's been going

00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:37,099
through and they're all a crafted file

00:25:34,729 --> 00:25:38,629
system of this if you mind it will toss

00:25:37,099 --> 00:25:40,099
that kind of well either you've got

00:25:38,629 --> 00:25:41,779
route where you've got visible access

00:25:40,099 --> 00:25:43,879
for USB so there are really low priority

00:25:41,779 --> 00:25:45,499
issues and the one that mean all the

00:25:43,879 --> 00:25:47,149
major processor must have been fixed but

00:25:45,499 --> 00:25:49,849
there's like a chapathis there's the

00:25:47,149 --> 00:25:51,469
best things like that but when somebody

00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:53,389
gets do them then I'll push them in but

00:25:51,469 --> 00:25:55,369
if someone was to ask me the set of the

00:25:53,389 --> 00:25:58,519
CD I can tell them to send us that CD

00:25:55,369 --> 00:26:01,579
right and if this the CD is right you

00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:02,899
know not a huge deal then the maintainer

00:26:01,579 --> 00:26:04,969
of this old package should be able to

00:26:02,899 --> 00:26:07,399
say well I can't fix this

00:26:04,969 --> 00:26:09,829
but I can tell you it's not a huge deal

00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:11,899
and perhaps market as such as a bug and

00:26:09,829 --> 00:26:14,869
closes won't fix and at least then if

00:26:11,899 --> 00:26:16,579
somebody is looking they can see re this

00:26:14,869 --> 00:26:17,869
CD was here this is the package

00:26:16,579 --> 00:26:19,219
maintainers response and it's been

00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:22,119
pasted on the picture at least we know

00:26:19,219 --> 00:26:27,259
it's been seen and addressed in some of

00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:29,509
them the 993 series which I looked at I

00:26:27,259 --> 00:26:33,019
think any person of them were already

00:26:29,509 --> 00:26:34,700
address but they were not closed I don't

00:26:33,019 --> 00:26:36,799
know why they were not use twenty

00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:38,419
percent of them were CVS which cannot be

00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:42,019
addressed like there is the upstream

00:26:38,419 --> 00:26:44,029
patch or the patch is too inclusive or

00:26:42,019 --> 00:26:46,129
like you know somehow some of these

00:26:44,029 --> 00:26:48,739
these are so all I asked for every

00:26:46,129 --> 00:26:50,719
container is to update the bug saying

00:26:48,739 --> 00:26:52,820
that you know this is the reason widest

00:26:50,719 --> 00:26:55,679
but particularly

00:26:52,820 --> 00:27:01,140
close as won't fix or conflicts or

00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:02,910
whatever like plus the policy proposal

00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:04,980
which I have basically has got different

00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:07,169
criteria for different security levels

00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:09,059
of the book so if you have a critical

00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:11,070
path which is open against your package

00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:12,900
put on for the last three months you

00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:15,240
probably you know they move it in X plus

00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:16,980
one if you have a no priority above if

00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,350
you have twenty bucks then you know you

00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:21,240
keep keep it for X X plus two budget if

00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:23,130
you have four for 40 bucks then you

00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:25,710
probably wonder if you care to what is

00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:27,240
happening so it is it's not the problem

00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:30,450
the father and I were a different policy

00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:32,580
for different number of bugs and you

00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:34,890
know it's probably open for for

00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:36,480
discussion it may also depend on the

00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:39,030
package which we really want to talk

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,010
about like and if it's open SSL probably

00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:42,990
a moderate level flaw is something we

00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:44,580
should usually we have to fix but if it

00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:46,590
is like PHP or something like that

00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:48,960
because something is if it's if it's a

00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:50,730
game then probably a moderate level flow

00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,049
is something which we may want to hang

00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:56,820
around for for for one release cycle or

00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:58,320
something like that it makes the the

00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:59,640
policies make sense to me but I

00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:03,090
definitely wouldn't remove anything

00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:04,710
automatically adjust well compose like

00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:07,350
you messed up candidates and bring it to

00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:10,669
pass code yeah and I think you just like

00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:13,440
company unresponsive maintainer process

00:28:10,669 --> 00:28:15,750
similar to them whereas you file the

00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,660
bugs there's been no response then you

00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:19,919
follow a request remove there's no

00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:21,290
response from the maintainer in any

00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:25,460
ghost of pesco burning

00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:27,170
but it takes too long that's okay let it

00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:28,850
go it's better than Maui yeah let it let

00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:31,190
it take long because some of these

00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:36,950
factors in singer for six years right if

00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:38,390
it takes a month that's fine and does

00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:39,830
not need to the view in Nugent

00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:42,230
I can your engine so you think I don't

00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:44,780
wait for no but there are certain

00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:47,090
packages that have open series for for

00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:50,390
ages and we still cannot remove them

00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:52,580
because just how important they are so

00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:54,410
those who would be a part of the

00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:56,390
critical packet is sent like you know

00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:58,700
which gate can be not been in good but

00:28:56,390 --> 00:29:02,270
if the fact if the CVS Libre critics of

00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:03,410
yeah the CDs every six sitting on it for

00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:04,970
so long

00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:07,550
growling it does make sense for the

00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:10,030
package maintainer to command widest CV

00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:13,130
and not been fixed though you know why

00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:15,440
that's that's what the public shaming

00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:17,840
email comes with and then hopefully they

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,720
come in if they can't be big that's

00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,980
sometimes that's acceptable you it can't

00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,220
be fixed for this reason and clothes

00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:30,460
won't fit so then it no longer shows up

00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:34,430
there's an open CV but it's a human

00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:36,410
mentioned exploit or the exploit vector

00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:38,000
warrior is not strong enough net initial

00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:39,200
which is really need us the access of

00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,150
physical access to a machine

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,580
you know actually I explained up exploit

00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:45,410
which is actually difficult to pull then

00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:46,940
you know it may be some something which

00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:49,610
we really don't want to think so you

00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:51,650
know the work of operating system orders

00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:53,420
which we have right now is not not

00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:56,680
mazing ability at you know like you know

00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:59,000
maybe maybe we had made out inspector

00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:00,170
there was a lot of those are not a lot

00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,150
of human cry

00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:04,820
but then when the next version of

00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:08,090
Spectre kick him out like we expected to

00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:10,100
or Spectre shiden people were not that

00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:11,690
interested because by that time they

00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,400
theorized that is not something which

00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:16,309
can be remotely exploited or something

00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:18,140
like that why do they work exploit

00:30:16,309 --> 00:30:20,809
really it's that mean it's worthless so

00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:24,230
we obviously closing those as quickly as

00:30:20,809 --> 00:30:25,910
we as we can but they're not really

00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:27,590
concerned with the Fedora user because

00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:30,980
of what's required to set up that attack

00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:32,179
you have to be a serious target serious

00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:41,410
targets are running Braille they're not

00:30:32,179 --> 00:30:41,410
my Fedora oh he's still closing

00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:59,800
well on Monday anything we decided to to

00:30:53,650 --> 00:31:01,630
discuss it here the only one so maybe

00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:10,150
maybe at the roundtable discussions I

00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:12,190
think this is a one thing but what is

00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:15,030
with things like you should the

00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:18,340
configuration file that maybe has some

00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:21,100
wrong things

00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:25,210
maybe you label some pilots in the wrong

00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:27,820
way or put it wrong access rights into

00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:32,770
the wrong directory this is not reviewed

00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:36,280
at the moment by the package to figure

00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:39,100
out if ya reviews more like the

00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:41,410
functional thing in like non-functional

00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:42,850
things like are you thinking it ensure

00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:44,290
that a packaging standards are being

00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:46,990
being followed right I mean if you if

00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:49,120
you install a file it if they install

00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:51,670
the file in the wrong place then I I

00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,870
think the packaging does tell you that

00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:54,790
you know this file is being installed

00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:58,030
well you know the file system

00:31:54,790 --> 00:32:01,210
permissions are wrong with that is not

00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:02,290
managed to cover this yeah but there is

00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:04,450
a good point I mean if somebody

00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:06,670
introduces a package that lets say it's

00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:10,630
running a listener service of some sort

00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:12,480
and that's like could we expose the

00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:14,560
route by the default config or something

00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,990
there's there's nothing in the package

00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:19,330
of you process its point to say that so

00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:22,390
how do we have on it how do we audit

00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:24,700
fedora and bring up suggested changes so

00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:27,390
this isn't a CD is just a suggesting can

00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,390
be a chain

00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:34,330
question I don't have the answer to

00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:37,460
everything but it's about the question

00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:39,680
yes we see this a lot with proper

00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:42,140
containers at the moment where we say

00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:45,230
okay we don't build a double container

00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:47,060
on our own and we be sure that all the

00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:49,190
communication that is going out and in

00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:51,200
from the container is really as it

00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:55,730
should be so it's the same thing

00:32:51,200 --> 00:33:00,020
actually so even if the software is free

00:32:55,730 --> 00:33:02,090
of any known flaws maybe the one who

00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:05,450
composed the container of the package

00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:08,270
make some kind of mistake can happen to

00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:11,870
every one of us here that we process

00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:14,390
would be very valuable we have a new

00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:16,970
process for packages yes but if it was

00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:19,280
one functional level well serious you

00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:21,140
trust the packager but the reality

00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:24,800
behind it is it's a lot of times the

00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:26,570
packager is a packager and not a you

00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,490
know they're they're interested in

00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:30,440
actually pushing it out there with their

00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:31,730
their a packager and they're not really

00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:35,390
a developer on it so they don't

00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:36,650
understand what they've they've done and

00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:39,590
there's nothing wrong with that other

00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:45,410
than if we have weight on it here you go

00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:47,750
Peter yes introducing securities if used

00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:49,280
in the package or edit tool I wanted to

00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:52,010
ensure that you know most of it is that

00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:54,650
people an automated way because security

00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:57,500
is hard right and we always probably

00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:59,300
don't understand security where so like

00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:03,380
you know probably try to do it I try to

00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:04,520
automate as much as the the tool can and

00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:06,350
you have a point of patches and stuff

00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:09,020
like pepper pens did the thing was

00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:10,710
because you mentioned two thing you do

00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:14,520
the back draw on your own

00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:17,910
matured into the package this must not

00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:20,130
be or cannot be must not be related to a

00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:22,860
CV or something like that maybe it's

00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:24,900
just kind of a small pecker that you

00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:28,320
write into your throat and that's maybe

00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:31,160
yeah would become of them well it might

00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:35,250
be good to write a basic tool that would

00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:38,280
scan scan open ports as a result of the

00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:40,650
package so you know it spins it up in a

00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:45,350
VM and once it started is it explosive

00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:50,130
example eject for city ID said unity

00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:52,440
things like that and just visit it's

00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:54,380
kind of like the right now when you

00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:57,210
enter our Hamlet it spits out a bunch of

00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:59,160
warnings and then airs right well this

00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:01,050
just fits out there's just kind of a

00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:04,410
warning hey this is opening up this port

00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:06,210
or this has these ladies said GID and

00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:09,030
it's part of it as part of the review

00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:11,220
process yeah you you can say well

00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:11,970
they're just warnings and here's why

00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,800
they're there

00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:15,000
you'd explain why they're there or you

00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:18,660
don't because maybe they're just

00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,870
completely unaware at the moment of

00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,870
something

00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:39,080
if you do I think this sandboxing

00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:41,930
approach I think it's a good good idea

00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:43,760
because then you don't have to analyze

00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:46,490
this static code or something like that

00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:48,740
so you have just your back box and you

00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:51,740
see what is the back box doing I think

00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:55,400
that's the fast way to find out is there

00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:59,480
something which does not behave compared

00:35:55,400 --> 00:36:02,540
to the last test I'm not sure this is

00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:08,359
doable and how you do it within weather

00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:10,040
if you have something like this is a

00:36:08,359 --> 00:36:13,849
little bit more complicated because a

00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:16,760
lot of times we read code I mean if

00:36:13,849 --> 00:36:18,890
there is an important package which we

00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:20,720
need to introduce and it's a demon and

00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:24,020
it's probably running as root or you

00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:25,880
know some other user then the review

00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:28,730
process includes you know trying to Z

00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:32,210
through each line of code and you know

00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:34,520
trying to see if something malicious is

00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:36,830
being done or you know son of father or

00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:38,839
something like that um doubt but this

00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:40,730
process is really difficult to do it

00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:43,430
Fedora because like because none of

00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:46,099
packages which we have the second thing

00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:47,780
is each package is the viewer may not be

00:36:46,099 --> 00:36:49,640
that technical enough to you know try to

00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:51,950
understand the nuances of the language

00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:53,000
like you know how big it entails and you

00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:54,770
know what would happen if there's an

00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,109
integer overflow and if there are

00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:58,849
potential he performed over so you know

00:36:57,109 --> 00:37:00,740
all of the delivers may not be technical

00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:02,480
enough they may not have enough time

00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:04,580
event you know to try to go to each

00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,530
other so we need to we need to ensure

00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:08,900
that at least the basic set of function

00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:11,170
functions of the performance right and

00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:14,240
most of those functionalities are

00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:17,300
automated and of all warnings which it

00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:19,220
gives out are you know probably they are

00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:21,020
in plain English so that you know the

00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:23,930
fact is if you're they understand

00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:28,609
because there is a place that actually

00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:29,930
we can do a lot of this so the CI

00:37:28,609 --> 00:37:31,849
process the one that's supposed to be

00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:33,890
gating everything is turned off now but

00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:35,570
little bits would be turned back on the

00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:38,630
CI process could actually run a basic

00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:41,359
script because it is installing and

00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:43,010
testing that that RPM when it's built so

00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,480
he could run the script and say all

00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:48,349
right well then rpm has opened these

00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:49,880
ports and you know it's got these it

00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:52,700
does the check and it just dumps it into

00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:55,070
it it doesn't check as far as installing

00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:57,440
the RPM it doesn't neccessarily started

00:37:55,070 --> 00:38:07,640
David well it should

00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:11,119
I mean but that's why you have each

00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:18,950
package has its own tests once once

00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:21,200
people know she has one can begin a

00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:23,180
request I think we have some people who

00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:28,520
are very interested in writing tests and

00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:29,690
putting over question for those so if

00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,970
it's not any effort

00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:34,960
other than click the button pick them up

00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:34,960
then hopefully

00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:46,809
I guess it isn't that should do I had

00:38:42,509 --> 00:38:48,309
guys I don't know if you guys already

00:38:46,809 --> 00:38:50,289
talked about this but my tonight two

00:38:48,309 --> 00:38:52,329
comments are not I'll see these are

00:38:50,289 --> 00:38:54,430
created equal and some are obviously

00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:57,670
were more important to fix than others

00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:59,980
I would like like from a festival

00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:01,990
perspective or my own personal take that

00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:04,930
I think that's what you do

00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:08,349
yes I would love them to see what are

00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:09,670
they top 10 or top 20 packages

00:39:08,349 --> 00:39:13,690
especially those that are a critical

00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:15,309
path to have higher critical CDs and and

00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:18,490
have less start from from from the

00:39:15,309 --> 00:39:20,440
festive side pushing at they mean it's a

00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:22,299
top 10 to begin with let's go through

00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,559
those and try to get those picks up its

00:39:22,299 --> 00:39:25,720
the things like image magic you know

00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:31,150
that need a little love there's probably

00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:32,859
others in there and then okay we're down

00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:34,450
a path from the top all the developers

00:39:32,859 --> 00:39:41,710
we get to developers better tools to

00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:43,720
work out to develop once a month as well

00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:45,700
with Peter detectors with open TVs and

00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,839
that way when the same ones keeps

00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,880
showing up month after month maybe

00:39:46,839 --> 00:39:52,200
they'll get some pure breath and can you

00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:55,299
make sure that those are sorted by yes

00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:57,029
no reason not to now make sure I get my

00:39:55,299 --> 00:40:01,509
clean up I don't know about anybody else

00:39:57,029 --> 00:40:08,289
but one other question I did have so you

00:40:01,509 --> 00:40:10,239
talked about basically winter what

00:40:08,289 --> 00:40:11,950
what's the process for actually bringing

00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:13,509
this you've got great ideas that you

00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:14,099
want to implement but as for me there's

00:40:13,509 --> 00:40:15,569
a

00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:17,519
hasn't been used in a month we prefer

00:40:15,569 --> 00:40:20,970
that back up or we're going to go back

00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:23,220
to meetings what was the next step yeah

00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:25,650
so when are these these three projects

00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:27,119
which I just described I want to use

00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:31,440
their mailing list to actually talk

00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:33,450
about those projects and see if anybody

00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,640
is kind of interested that you know

00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:37,950
other than the ideas which you said like

00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:40,349
you know me we kind of send our watch in

00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:42,119
a marsh a willingness to say throw our

00:40:40,349 --> 00:40:43,739
Devon or you know we walk on this

00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:47,130
dashboard thing which I was trying to

00:40:43,739 --> 00:40:50,789
talk about so I want to use the Bolinas

00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:52,920
as you know discuss things so so the

00:40:50,789 --> 00:40:55,289
basic concept is to do do things which

00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:56,819
are which are more interesting that then

00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:59,339
you know trying to be maintained you

00:40:56,819 --> 00:41:01,079
know trying to patch book trying to

00:40:59,339 --> 00:41:02,579
backward patches and stuff like that to

00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:04,769
do it I think which a little bit more

00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:07,259
interesting I obviously wait we're

00:41:04,769 --> 00:41:09,210
eating a flower face for Frisco to try

00:41:07,259 --> 00:41:12,569
to figure out if you really want to

00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:13,950
implement the process you know if

00:41:12,569 --> 00:41:16,140
there's something else which we really

00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:19,589
want to know but then there really needs

00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:21,509
to be a way of trying to try to work

00:41:19,589 --> 00:41:23,519
with these packages which have like you

00:41:21,509 --> 00:41:24,630
know CD is open for five years or six

00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:26,819
years or something like that

00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:28,650
probably because upstream is dead or you

00:41:26,819 --> 00:41:30,150
know the maintainer is no longer number

00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:34,499
active or something like that

00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:37,650
I want wanted to do a distribution

00:41:34,499 --> 00:41:39,509
comparison as well so I III don't have

00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:40,680
the figures i right now what I was able

00:41:39,509 --> 00:41:42,350
to only finish

00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:45,410
Fedora Debian

00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:47,600
and I think once through there and I

00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:51,410
found that debate have got at least

00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:54,860
number of open CDs which open and when

00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:58,220
you loser is probably Fedora is probably

00:41:54,860 --> 00:42:00,070
one of the half times what we have is so

00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:04,160
but Debian has won the early good

00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:06,440
security process and I am not sure what

00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:07,790
they do with packages which are which we

00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:10,250
shall open series but you know they

00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:11,930
really they are even probably in some

00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:14,180
way they are is really able to address

00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:16,700
the see the issues or you know or close

00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:18,770
the bugs which make you not papers so I

00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:21,530
want to use the mailing list to start

00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:24,230
our discussion on you know what and once

00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:26,380
we have the packages which we can which

00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:29,690
products security gets sent back to

00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:32,000
upstream we want to see if these systems

00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:34,340
can be increased can be punched into

00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,410
fedora in this view and you know if

00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:38,540
package reviews can start using the new

00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:40,610
package of module of the view to see if

00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:44,210
you know because you can do security

00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:47,780
scans as well so that's that's what plus

00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:49,760
I I want to remove nails from the the

00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:51,650
website for being people who are

00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:54,110
probably no longer interested you know

00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:56,480
certain item right now he also 15 names

00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:57,950
or 20 names last I checked none of these

00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,500
guys up top

00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:03,200
interested so maybe maybe sure the blue

00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:05,180
games into it that's another great topic

00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:07,339
for the mailing list and just say any

00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:17,630
people who are energetic yeah reply to

00:43:07,339 --> 00:43:19,700
this mailing list us are we are so

00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:23,750
internally trying to have a mechanism in

00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:27,560
which embargoed security information can

00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:30,680
be transmitted confidentially to

00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:32,720
probably one or two members I think I'm

00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:34,520
not sure if it is supposed to include a

00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,869
fresco member but you know probably we

00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:38,420
are trying to see if we can like UI

00:43:35,869 --> 00:43:40,099
itself but saying after next week there

00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:43,369
is going to be a big issue so you know

00:43:40,099 --> 00:43:45,320
you make make sure that your billions of

00:43:43,369 --> 00:43:47,000
structure is okay so so that because

00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:49,609
either we need to build a package in a

00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:52,700
few hours and make sure it is pushed to

00:43:49,609 --> 00:43:55,550
the repositories so a previous instances

00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:58,820
I think during hardly no change in shop

00:43:55,550 --> 00:44:00,740
I had to paint anymore and I had to take

00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:02,869
it out you know there's this new open

00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:05,599
SSL package which is going to come in

00:44:02,869 --> 00:44:08,180
next five hours and make sure it goes to

00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:09,650
all the mirrors in the next to us and he

00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:13,369
used to tell the tech me that this is

00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:15,770
not nearly how middle button is work so

00:44:13,369 --> 00:44:17,930
you know he probably didn't wear that

00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:19,280
you know he started to push yes we

00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:19,490
started the Singh script and things like

00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,500
that

00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:23,690
but that's really a big problem right

00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:26,450
because and we had instances in which

00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:29,200
current we used to do it for CentOS much

00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:31,490
faster than you know be used to do it

00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:33,650
because the way our infrastructure is

00:44:31,490 --> 00:44:35,450
you know then first so so we are going

00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:37,010
to soon have a mechanism encourage we

00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:38,750
can use this information and you know

00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:40,760
under some kind of

00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:41,870
non-disclosure agreement

00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:44,330
you know make sure that the

00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:45,770
infrastructure is ready for the packages

00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:48,920
to be building deployment stuff matter

00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:50,420
so there are a lot more smallest things

00:44:48,920 --> 00:45:16,280
which are happening in the back packet

00:44:50,420 --> 00:45:17,800
is that box or whatever we simply also

00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:19,710
see

00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:24,810
[Music]

00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:27,000
I think that's a great idea as long as

00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:29,790
we you know filter over CDs and say if

00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,680
they're a higher critical if we get a

00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:33,750
trivial CD unit nobodies well it's not

00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:36,180
exploitable in its very low residence

00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:38,160
some it brings up the interesting point

00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:39,810
though of the packages where the

00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:41,460
maintainer has been gone for years right

00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:43,349
there is no maintainer anymore the

00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:45,839
packages been abandoned it just wasn't

00:45:43,349 --> 00:45:49,109
formally invented so if we have that

00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:51,660
sort of a process say at branch point or

00:45:49,109 --> 00:45:55,470
in right before break 1 or whatever and

00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:56,940
say give us a response you do have the

00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:58,230
issue of you can't just pull packages

00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:59,849
that have better depths for other

00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:02,849
packets right it has to be elite not it

00:45:59,849 --> 00:46:04,290
can't be critical but but that would at

00:46:02,849 --> 00:46:07,109
least give us a point to do pink

00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:10,109
maintainer and say hey respond to this

00:46:07,109 --> 00:46:12,750
and it doesn't it won't get branch right

00:46:10,109 --> 00:46:15,420
or if you don't respond it won't your

00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:17,880
branch now they can annually go create a

00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:20,430
branch well sure but there be some sort

00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:22,589
of positive now another hey I'm

00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:24,720
maintaining this package great and

00:46:22,589 --> 00:46:26,640
that's great you can actually even in

00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:28,500
the email get the instructions on how to

00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,730
manually create the branch if if they

00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:33,510
missed it because people do go on

00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:36,030
vacation or whatever but that would be a

00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:39,810
great way to automatically weed out some

00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:41,790
things so that's that's part of the

00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:44,760
holidays in that you know we want to do

00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:46,380
it from x plus too late if they show is

00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:49,430
open again Fedora X we probably

00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:49,430
depending on ID act

00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:25,399
[Music]

00:47:33,859 --> 00:47:38,839
the most important factors are the ones

00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:43,160
you actually probably have maintainer

00:47:38,839 --> 00:47:49,890
they're just not addressing the CDs

00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:51,450
right right so that be the public

00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:53,700
shaming bit there will hopefully help

00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:55,760
with that it's at woo in those cases the

00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:58,260
maintainer is typically still there

00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:01,230
right there's still updating pad

00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:05,750
they just some reason aren't addressing

00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:05,750
bugs which happens

00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:18,230
maybe but I think there's no teeth to it

00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:26,000
because you can't actually remove it if

00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:28,520
he doesn't just like we have a policy

00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,070
that rügen us turn off the the I 686

00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:33,500
kernel if there were build issues and

00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:35,410
the state didn't fix them and as soon as

00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:39,320
we did we realized that we've broken

00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:41,900
bullying anything so we had to work

00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:45,020
around that and you did yeah there's

00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:50,600
there's no teeth to it now that we we

00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:53,710
set pretty fertile headers but basically

00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:53,710
that's something like

00:48:56,790 --> 00:49:00,040
[Music]

00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:11,260
same thing or so semental committed

00:49:09,369 --> 00:49:14,140
under FIFRA Scott ticket saying that you

00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:16,150
know we use that fdbs process well in

00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:18,790
our process similar to that to try to

00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:20,680
boot up a package because you had a dad

00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:22,420
what kind of Sena made to the maintainer

00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:24,250
as we're saying that you know we are we

00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:26,319
are going to do the package or something

00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:28,150
like that that would probably be much

00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:29,980
more easier than to have some other

00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:32,230
mechanism to try try to remove the

00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:34,890
package so probably is some something

00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:34,890
similar to

00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:46,070
