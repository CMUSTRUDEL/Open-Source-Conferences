Talk: Marketing execution plan for next Q and beyond
Presenters: Eduard Lucena

Description: Now that we have the Mindshare Committee taking care of the strategic part of marketing [1], we have to focus our actions in a new way to work, propose new ideas and impulse the team to a new era. Some of the main ideas are rounding the streaming media like YouTube and the Fedora Podcast. Hopefully we can get more people involved and propose new ideas on how to reach big players in the news media, that is a lost land right now.
