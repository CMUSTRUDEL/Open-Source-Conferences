Talk: Marketing execution plan for next Q and beyond
Presenters: Eduard Lucena

Description: Now that we have the Mindshare Committee taking care of the strategic part of marketing [1], we have to focus our actions in a new way to work, propose new ideas and impulse the team to a new era. Some of the main ideas are rounding the streaming media like YouTube and the Fedora Podcast. Hopefully we can get more people involved and propose new ideas on how to reach big players in the news media, that is a lost land right now.

	00:00:01,909 --> 00:00:08,820
so let's start

00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:12,139
hi Amador lucena I'm I'm going to talk

00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:15,420
about the marketing execution team plan

00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:25,019
for the next six months to one year or

00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:26,609
so let's see how k we do so in the end

00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:28,619
that we have just a quick introduction

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:31,890
I'm going to talk about what the

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:34,860
marketing is doing and the other three

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:37,559
points today is how we can work in

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,360
making a strategy plan to work marketing

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:43,379
so our first point is identify our

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:47,010
audiences so the next part is making

00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:50,030
strategies plans or tasks to attack

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:53,100
those targets we are targeting and then

00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:57,500
what content we are going to do to reach

00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,500
that those audiences

00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:05,449
so me so I'm evolution I'm from

00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:08,180
Venezuela I live in Chile I started

00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:13,490
working in in the federal project like

00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:16,750
three years ago and for some weird

00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:19,190
reason I still don't know how I end up

00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:23,690
being responsible for the marketing team

00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:26,119
I started helping I start like as an

00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:29,149
ambassador as you can see with my son we

00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:34,690
heard we were giving swag to the people

00:01:29,149 --> 00:01:37,039
in one event and I start using fedora

00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:39,259
mostly because of the community most

00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:41,780
than any technical reason I could have

00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:43,460
to use it I use it because the community

00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:47,119
is here is really strong it's really

00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:51,159
friendly you can get help from anyone

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:54,289
and the key point for me was to have

00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:56,149
things that I did that you can see

00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:57,380
reflected in other people not

00:01:56,149 --> 00:02:01,119
necessarily in the in the federal

00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:01,119
distribution buddying other people

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:11,490
so marketing really the recent marketing

00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:14,350
thing in Florida so yes we are here and

00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:17,230
the federal marketing team having a

00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:18,910
specific objective that is to develop

00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:21,760
and execute marketing strategy to

00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:25,270
promote they use a support of the fedora

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:28,360
worldwide what this means this means

00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:29,920
that we need to find a way to meet two

00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,870
people to meet further and not just

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,730
because it's a Linux distribution but

00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:36,940
specifically because what knowledge is

00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:38,740
we are shipping and explain how these

00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:45,490
technologies that we are shipping with

00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:50,110
fedora are useful for is use case so I

00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:54,010
want current tasks I don't know it's tax

00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:55,450
no tax sorry is the collecting the

00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:57,940
talking points the talking points are

00:02:55,450 --> 00:03:01,150
supposed to be the list of a list of key

00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:02,980
points that is release have the hell

00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:06,220
ambassadors to talk to them

00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:09,370
inning event okay so if there is a new

00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:12,640
genome version we are shipping the new I

00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:15,880
don't know the modularity version we are

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,340
shipping a new kernel the latest kernel

00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:21,610
or we are switching from I don't know to

00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:24,540
from system D to the next thing we are

00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:27,940
going so this is the talking points and

00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:31,180
it looks trivial but is really hard to

00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:34,360
do because not all the things are too

00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:38,110
responsive and the other problem is that

00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:42,209
we try to have a talking points for all

00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:46,060
the additions and their spins so

00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:49,690
basically the next the last two releases

00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:55,140
have talking points because Alberta that

00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:55,140
is from Mexico and me where we were

00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:01,330
interrupting all the things meetings say

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,070
a here

00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:05,020
do we need a talking post what is new

00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:06,190
with you because we don't know what

00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:10,980
you're doing you need to tell me what

00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:14,410
are you doing for me to day to East and

00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:17,889
it was starting to be a little hard but

00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:20,709
we are completing the glass Italy

00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:22,870
in a really good manner the new releases

00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:27,610
screen shows it was also being done by

00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:30,460
us and without that we are repeating

00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:33,039
work with the screenshots because one

00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:39,039
thing that the website team required to

00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:41,800
which a spin seek and working group is

00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:46,210
to take to have high definition screen

00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:48,400
chests of their desktop so we need to

00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:50,830
figure out a new way to make this the

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,650
other thing I'm doing and is the federal

00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:55,210
podcast for a podcast easily this is not

00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:59,169
like a little experiment right now is a

00:04:55,210 --> 00:05:02,020
proper project of risk that obvious that

00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:05,680
use podcast to get news so the first

00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:08,050
part of the federal podcast is some

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,479
interviews with different team members

00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:13,750
of different teams and present what the

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:16,289
team do how you can join to that team

00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:20,169
how you can work with them and

00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:24,690
explaining a little bit the new stuff in

00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:28,629
each team the release announcement is a

00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:31,060
two-part task the first part is the vet

00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:33,339
announcement that is done by me it's

00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:35,069
just a quick introduction of why we have

00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:39,669
we're shipping in the next version and

00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:41,289
really the they GA release that is made

00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:44,860
by the federal project leader and now

00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:47,229
it's doing by Matthew we try to align

00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:52,139
this the to rule announcements in the

00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:54,699
same way and we are publishing it in the

00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:58,960
announcements list in and in the federal

00:05:54,699 --> 00:06:00,909
magazine and the other task we have now

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:05,529
is do we have a social network team that

00:06:00,909 --> 00:06:09,610
is not part of marketing was related

00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:12,029
with marketing and I think this one of

00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:14,319
the great job they do we are have a

00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:16,659
Google+ channel we have a Twitter

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,639
frederik official account we have a

00:06:16,659 --> 00:06:22,389
YouTube channel we have a Instagram

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:26,080
official account so the social network

00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:27,610
thing is working right now in a

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,399
different mailing list that the

00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:31,420
marketing team but we try to be at least

00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,860
in communicate

00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:41,130
young of what the things are doing in

00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:43,630
each social network we have so the next

00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:46,510
slide is we need to identify our

00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:49,000
audience and to identify where the

00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:52,590
audience is not like we were talking

00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:57,400
before in with the council and with my

00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:58,900
committee that we need to separate every

00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:02,200
kind of audience if we are going to

00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:04,270
reach developers or if we are reaching

00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:08,110
developer maybe Python developers Ruby

00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:11,440
developers dotnet developers but most in

00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:14,890
the marketing part I mean trying to

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:17,020
identify where people is looking for

00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:19,620
content and what type of content they

00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:26,940
are looking for so it's not only about

00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:30,910
what they are doing but how to reach

00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:33,550
that users for example the people in

00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:38,410
YouTube normally look for a screencast

00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:40,990
of doing things maybe some people refer

00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:44,110
to look for video tutorials that is not

00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:47,740
the same thing and maybe some people

00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:50,320
just prefer to look for a slideshow in a

00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:53,200
video and it's not as the same theme but

00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:57,970
it's the same channel so we need to

00:07:53,200 --> 00:08:01,330
identify how - what is the people

00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:04,750
looking for in coming in terms of

00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:07,530
content and that's where I mean about

00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:10,030
audience not necessarily if there is a

00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:13,110
server people or technical people or

00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:15,820
developer or a student because that

00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:18,970
differentiation is done or is supposed

00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:22,990
to be done by the manager committee plus

00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:24,970
council because we have a really really

00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:29,560
long discussion before about if we want

00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:33,640
to reach that we normally call end-users

00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:36,830
and the big answer is no we don't but it

00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:40,640
was is that the list can be

00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:43,729
or to a specific or not a specific at

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:45,950
all and that's a problem that in mérida

00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:50,029
marketing we are not going to solve in

00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:53,870
my case I will say audience in the in

00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:57,560
terms of what kind of content consumer

00:08:53,870 --> 00:09:00,620
we are looking for okay and and then we

00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:06,260
have a podcast audience that is reaching

00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:08,440
700 downloads per week that is pretty

00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,440
decent

00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:14,930
when I figured out about the federal

00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:17,600
podcast is that we have a lot of users

00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:19,760
that listen podcast here in Germany so

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,920
I'm looking for the next interview to do

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,269
it with a German guy

00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:26,779
I don't know if you understand that

00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:29,540
makes sense a little bit because it's

00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:30,320
like like to motivate people to listen

00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:32,810
okay

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,160
the other day that's the second big day

00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:37,450
second-biggest out in the first because

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,450
how this is the u.s.

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:52,959
so strategies plans or tasks

00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:56,379
what doesn't mean we live in a social

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:58,959
media world right now in different paces

00:09:56,379 --> 00:10:01,779
and we need to have different strategies

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:04,899
for each audience okay so it's not the

00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:07,509
same people that goes to to Facebook

00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:08,889
looking for for content it's not the

00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:10,350
same people that look in YouTube it's

00:10:08,889 --> 00:10:15,369
not the same people that look in Flickr

00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:18,100
so every how this we can identify need a

00:10:15,369 --> 00:10:19,569
different strategy and no and sometimes

00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,919
it's not even a strategy is just a list

00:10:19,569 --> 00:10:23,949
of stuff you need to complete to reach

00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:26,709
this adult audience and that's where I

00:10:23,949 --> 00:10:29,169
want to you have a better connection

00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:32,230
with the social networking because they

00:10:29,169 --> 00:10:37,600
will be in charge of publishing the

00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:41,619
content so there is a three part trip

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:44,139
artists work people making content we as

00:10:41,619 --> 00:10:46,360
marketing team look for where where the

00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:49,239
consumer of this content are and the

00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:51,279
social network the social network team

00:10:49,239 --> 00:10:55,480
the social media team to publish that

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:57,790
content so it's a three parties job but

00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,869
it should be that difficult if we can

00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,869
have the content

00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:11,630
so they're content like I was saying we

00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:13,670
need to generate content for each kind

00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:18,110
of audience we are going to try to reach

00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:19,910
and the problem is not only having

00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:23,060
content but relating the content of the

00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:25,760
what we want to do in the project if we

00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:31,550
have a we already have a mission

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:33,860
statement that is kind of broad but the

00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:38,450
other since that that are happening that

00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:40,130
we need to address is what things are we

00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:42,950
want to publish that are ready to

00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:47,360
publish we were talking in the mnsure

00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:51,590
committee yesterday that we have three

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:53,480
objective right and but not the three

00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:55,640
objects are ready to publish content to

00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,600
the world because for example the

00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:01,940
federal tea

00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:06,410
team is just forming now so we need to

00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:08,630
connect the technical power and the

00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:10,580
council mission with the content we are

00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:14,960
going to generate to reach the people

00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:16,640
and here is when this become real

00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,880
because we have a were station we have a

00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:21,350
spin we have some teams that want to be

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:24,560
publish it because they want to reach

00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:26,990
more audience and we they want to make

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:30,170
people understand that they are doing

00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:34,550
the work for the project that is not

00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:36,890
necessarily technical related but they

00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:38,240
can hit the needs of the people the

00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:42,080
first the biggest sample is the

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,550
diversity team they have they are doing

00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:46,310
an amazing job for example with the

00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:48,440
fedora woman day and the fedora woman

00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:51,260
day is reaching out this says that

00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:53,330
normally we don't we don't try to reach

00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:55,700
they find that place and they say oh

00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:58,490
this is here so we want to make content

00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:00,710
for that thing in that place and the

00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:04,220
flora millar the adjective that is Adam

00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:05,900
is here thank you for coming they are

00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,760
doing a great job in the fedora m'lady

00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:09,890
and we need to make content that two

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,590
people know the federal modularity we

00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:15,290
already have one video publish it and

00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:17,920
one more to come in the YouTube channel

00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,920
for further

00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:27,279
yeah and that's the kind of thing we

00:13:22,779 --> 00:13:32,680
need to do we need to to reach different

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:35,680
audiences right now and I think because

00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:38,769
I'm the only one working in in marketing

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:44,410
well that's not true we are the only two

00:13:38,769 --> 00:13:47,920
guys working marketing and we cannot do

00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:51,160
everything that that's what I'm trying

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,839
to say is just come and help us there is

00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,550
not only 30 it's not only content

00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:57,459
generation is there is a log of word

00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:59,079
that require help we can make the

00:13:57,459 --> 00:14:03,790
connection with the technical teams we

00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:07,660
can make the we can do content we can do

00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:10,540
the connections we can do understanding

00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:11,999
the new needs of the new people so if

00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:14,740
you have an idea

00:14:11,999 --> 00:14:20,199
just come here and tell us and we can

00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:24,309
make things work and I'm going to do an

00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:27,879
example it was the last video we

00:14:24,309 --> 00:14:30,220
published from pure modularity Alan come

00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:33,910
and say hey I have a video here that it

00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:35,050
can be useful for people and say ok send

00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,309
the video to me and we are going to

00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:40,089
publish in the YouTube channel that make

00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:42,550
all the social network publishing and

00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:45,129
was publish it in in Twitter it was

00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:46,990
published at in in Google+ it was polish

00:14:45,129 --> 00:14:50,559
it in Facebook

00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:54,399
I mean the first we will reach 2,000

00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:56,620
views it may be sound that big for you

00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:59,110
too but for us was a win because it

00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:02,620
wasn't published anywhere so 2,000

00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:04,209
people is really nice so that's what we

00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:08,170
are going to we want to encourage people

00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:09,970
to make the content and reach us and we

00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:14,559
can figure out where the discounted feed

00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:18,850
and then travel out of the world so what

00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:20,550
I want to say is we are here to help to

00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:24,610
help you to make your content put a

00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:28,320
beauty in the world we are here to try

00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:32,970
to making the people know flora

00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:35,040
but not only bye-bye

00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:37,230
why the Linux distribution is but

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,540
targeting the right people for each

00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:42,330
content classifying our content

00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:46,260
identifying our audiences it will be the

00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:51,260
best thing we can do and in doing that

00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:51,260
and in the right way will allow us to

00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:57,660
make a real impact in the people because

00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:59,400
if the Audion is there for the specific

00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,120
content and you publish the right

00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,250
content to them

00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,990
they're going to feel connected with us

00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:16,650
and that's the idea we want to attract

00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:19,410
more people a any questions so I mean I

00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:21,750
know that we we have more users than we

00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:23,610
do customers but do we have some sort of

00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:26,930
an outreach program that we're thinking

00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:30,300
about doing in terms of determining what

00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:37,200
users are doing effectively and then

00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:40,320
highlighting that well actually no but

00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:42,180
the answer is no because like I was

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,420
saying they were only two guys working

00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:48,210
marketing and there is too much job fair

00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:53,640
release and there is too much job about

00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:56,040
content and the last is going to say

00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:57,960
six-month maybe I was working with the

00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:00,770
podcast so that consumed a lot of time

00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:03,990
because it required recording editing

00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:06,030
publishing and it became a little hard

00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:10,740
at work dealing with with that kind of

00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:12,390
strategy to have this knowledge to what

00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:14,100
people is used doing with the

00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:17,250
distribution how many user we are having

00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:20,120
but there definitely we need to work in

00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,120
stuff like that

00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:31,620
in either case I assume do we kind of

00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:35,970
try to okay is there a specific reason

00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:37,399
for marketing and social network to be

00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:41,610
different teams

00:17:37,399 --> 00:17:44,730
is it possible to the teams I think it

00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:49,130
would make more sense and maybe you

00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:52,529
won't be that alone in the marketing

00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:55,470
actually I don't know why when I came

00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:58,620
into the marketing team it was already a

00:17:55,470 --> 00:18:00,510
splitted in in utterly in three

00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,710
different teams there is the social

00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:03,240
network team that is the Federal

00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:06,360
magazine team and it's a marketing team

00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:08,940
that had three different teams as you

00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:11,399
say I understand it's partially for

00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:13,710
those exact reasons that the social

00:18:11,399 --> 00:18:16,230
networking team is kind of a the people

00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:19,860
who have access to the various social

00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:22,169
networks accounts that we have but they

00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:24,029
all show up with a different agenda so

00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:26,220
they want to make sure that either comm

00:18:24,029 --> 00:18:27,690
blog or magazine or whatever it gets

00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,610
done and then there's a few people who

00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:31,649
show up and go I want to you know I

00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:33,419
don't retweet cool things that I see

00:18:31,649 --> 00:18:36,960
around fedora but there's not

00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:39,240
consistency there in that sense it would

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,250
be cool if as part of our marketing

00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,840
strategy we kind of defined what we

00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,340
wanted to do with each of those media

00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:47,279
channels and what they were designed to

00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:48,929
reach I would want to make sure at least

00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:50,909
this is my personal opinion we don't

00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:52,830
want to explode the number of media

00:18:50,909 --> 00:18:55,200
channels I think that would be very very

00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:57,899
bad if we suddenly went okay we now have

00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,640
you know nine different Twitter accounts

00:18:57,899 --> 00:19:03,779
for each flavor of what we think people

00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:06,659
in humanity are but I think that that's

00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:07,649
the challenge there and one of the

00:19:06,659 --> 00:19:09,720
things that I think we need to be

00:19:07,649 --> 00:19:11,700
cognizant of is that even if we say that

00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,980
you know we want to go after llama

00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:16,649
herders as our primary marketing target

00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:18,450
that doesn't mean that fedora magazine

00:19:16,649 --> 00:19:20,370
is necessarily going to switch all of

00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:23,010
its content do you know discussions of

00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:23,460
yak combing or whatever it is that llama

00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:30,360
orders

00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:35,820
- I totally this driver you are an

00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:38,760
interesting solution because we are we

00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:45,779
have official accounts are losing every

00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:48,899
social media in existence and the social

00:19:45,779 --> 00:19:50,340
network team have access to this account

00:19:48,899 --> 00:19:53,309
but they don't necessarily generate

00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:54,779
contact except for Instagram there's no

00:19:53,309 --> 00:19:57,059
point in having an Instagram account

00:19:54,779 --> 00:19:59,309
without maybe a Content generation

00:19:57,059 --> 00:20:02,669
because you just take the picture and is

00:19:59,309 --> 00:20:05,010
up there but for example for YouTube I

00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:08,970
was included in the list of people that

00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:12,779
have access like I don't know maybe 3 to

00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:17,250
6 months ago and I only all loved one

00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:20,010
video and I was saying you know god this

00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:21,809
this channel only have talked flocks

00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:23,880
recording there is nothing there and

00:20:21,809 --> 00:20:25,860
there is a lot of thing that can be done

00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:28,679
in the YouTube right now the people is

00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:31,010
is looking for that kind of content like

00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:34,770
I say there is different different

00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:36,659
content that can be in in YouTube like a

00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:39,600
slide shows like screencasts like

00:20:36,659 --> 00:20:41,909
interviews like Jews people making a

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,750
statement where we have a plan right now

00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:49,200
that it was

00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:51,000
it's supposed to be driven by our Korean

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,409
federal program manager I think we are

00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,390
not going to do it with him anymore

00:20:52,409 --> 00:20:58,070
because he will be working other stuff

00:20:54,390 --> 00:21:02,130
but the plan was to make short videos of

00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:03,899
federal contributors saying why they use

00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:05,820
fedora why the love it we just short

00:21:03,899 --> 00:21:08,940
with your like one minute videos I'm

00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:11,909
finishing with a with the phrase I love

00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:15,059
Fedora or I am Fedora like we are Fedora

00:21:11,909 --> 00:21:19,799
hashtag we are using we will be using in

00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:22,620
the federal preciate coming they I don't

00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:24,799
remember what they did for appreciation

00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:28,380
week

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:30,090
okay it will be in November so we are

00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:31,710
trying to make this kind of strategies

00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:33,360
to reach people that's this short video

00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:35,250
there are people that really consume

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:39,200
that kind of videos and it makes sense

00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:39,200
for us to reach that kind of audiences

00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:50,340
do we try to the numbers of for example

00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:52,919
on YouTube do we try to track the

00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:54,919
numbers of view we have because I know

00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:58,380
that in the magazine is something that

00:21:54,919 --> 00:22:00,929
we don't really look at we kind of tried

00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:03,059
to set our self objectives in the team

00:22:00,929 --> 00:22:05,490
so last year we wanted to do three

00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:07,799
millions views so we would say okay

00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:09,390
let's try to do for millions I don't

00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:11,820
think we do for minions but at least we

00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:16,049
got some kind of objective I think it's

00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:18,960
it helps driving the team and when weeks

00:22:16,049 --> 00:22:21,630
would not have too much content okay we

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:25,590
need to try to even let to do a quick

00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:27,390
quick article that is doesn't require

00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:31,049
too much work but at least we it would

00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:34,260
generate some views so I think that's

00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:36,330
that was my main thinking of trying to

00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:39,059
have a same team like between marketing

00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:46,110
and those and the social media icons is

00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:49,049
to kind of being able to have to try to

00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:51,390
set some like goals or objectives to try

00:22:49,049 --> 00:22:52,169
to challenge the team and like get some

00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:58,140
motivation

00:22:52,169 --> 00:23:02,010
I told yes and it's not because I'm a

00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:04,080
real beautiful consumer I use YouTube a

00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:07,620
lot and not only for viewing just

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:10,649
researching and I have a plan that I

00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:12,570
will be trying to drive if I need

00:23:10,649 --> 00:23:16,770
somebody to help me to make the content

00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:20,610
but yes we have a target for example

00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:22,850
base it and the videos of other

00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:27,529
communities and

00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:31,279
making percentages with how many photos

00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:34,490
we have the our YouTube account we are

00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:37,220
trying to make some kind of challenge to

00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:42,409
reach but to do that we need the content

00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:46,250
so also a normal YouTube channels that

00:23:42,409 --> 00:23:50,299
have several thousands of people follow

00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:53,659
following them they I just a strategy in

00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:56,539
that in indigo nor in advance so if

00:23:53,659 --> 00:23:58,669
they'll start polishing for example I

00:23:56,539 --> 00:24:00,169
don't know we where start publishing a

00:23:58,669 --> 00:24:02,090
screencast but the people is not looking

00:24:00,169 --> 00:24:04,370
at that we can drop it them focusing

00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:06,649
other things you know so it's not like

00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:09,169
we are going to make a plan for one year

00:24:06,649 --> 00:24:13,340
for the older videos we are going to to

00:24:09,169 --> 00:24:15,379
have there but at least a have several

00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:19,039
start annex and making songs per image

00:24:15,379 --> 00:24:21,169
and then adjust the strategy in looking

00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:32,779
at the numbers we are generating mostly

00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:35,419
how we do in the magazines right now so

00:24:32,779 --> 00:24:38,360
I quite like YouTube or so and I think

00:24:35,419 --> 00:24:38,960
we really need some more stuff on on

00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:42,409
YouTube

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,750
and I was thinking that related to the

00:24:42,409 --> 00:24:47,419
new dogs and the quick dogs I think that

00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:51,230
would be a great great content just

00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:53,269
someone who goes for like one one of the

00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:56,690
quick dogs how to set up I don't know

00:24:53,269 --> 00:24:59,269
Apache web server and just like do a

00:24:56,690 --> 00:25:02,029
screencast of that and that could be

00:24:59,269 --> 00:25:03,980
because I think more and more there are

00:25:02,029 --> 00:25:05,629
people that actually enjoy raining dogs

00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:10,399
and there are people that enjoy watching

00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:14,780
tutorials or like on YouTube in it that

00:25:10,399 --> 00:25:22,100
would be another way to

00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:25,220
to offer the duck content and Leticia

00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:28,190
also we so in the magazine we we from

00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:30,710
time to time we also have articles just

00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:33,170
for example when there is a conference I

00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:34,910
think I heard we just have like oh five

00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:37,220
five videos on

00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:39,350
I don't know Federer modularity or five

00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:42,410
videos on thing I got so we could also

00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:45,560
use the magazine to promote the YouTube

00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:49,010
channel and get some some more traction

00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:53,120
in there actually

00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:55,460
he we think it in bad words we were

00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:59,560
thinking in used the magazine articles

00:25:55,460 --> 00:26:02,150
to make YouTube content for example a I

00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:13,030
don't know there was an article on how

00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:13,030
to use I was me me me maneuver a the

00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:19,280
Covenant a nur and they say okay there

00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:20,630
is a the what the comments are how do

00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:26,630
you do it how do you configure it we can

00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:29,300
do a screen cut about it so they there

00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:32,450
are some style things we need to make

00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:36,490
for example a we try to make the

00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:39,020
screencast in a clean installation too

00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:41,690
mostly because we don't have we don't

00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:43,970
want to have these all customized things

00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:47,300
that people maybe is going to ask well

00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:50,600
this is this shell is not bash or how do

00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:53,360
color colorize the your your prompt or

00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:55,400
what is the background or what how do

00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,110
you make the terminal transparent and

00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,960
write the description of way for the

00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:02,470
real content you'll also use a clean

00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:05,720
installation of reg installation and

00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:07,670
that kind of little details really make

00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:09,020
a difference because if you really want

00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:10,790
to make the people committed with your

00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:12,680
content you need to make the people

00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:14,960
focusing the content and not distract

00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:17,210
them with anything else and one thing I

00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,700
learned from the podcast for example I

00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:22,100
left I love to hear music all the time

00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:24,630
even when people is talking to me or

00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:27,990
whether even when I'm reading I'll

00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:32,220
- I love to help music but other people

00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:35,240
done and there is a episode of the

00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:38,910
podcast had a background track and

00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:41,310
they've very first ten comments I have

00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:44,550
was removed the track because it's too

00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:47,520
distracting I say what I love the track

00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:51,030
also it was an open source track you may

00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:54,570
bring a friend by a friend so okay

00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:56,490
that's that kind of things made me

00:27:54,570 --> 00:28:00,260
realize that people want to focus in the

00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:02,790
content if you put something things that

00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:05,190
distract people you can not get the

00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:09,360
attention you want and that that will be

00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:13,230
a Horford for your objective to attract

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:15,770
more people because one powerful things

00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:19,470
in in social network is their retaining

00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:21,930
call it the three tweeting reposting I

00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:24,390
don't remember how he's calling Google+

00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:26,670
is has another name but that kind of

00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:28,140
things is that make the social network

00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:32,790
powerfullest you can each people can

00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:34,580
reach her do your content so they you

00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:38,760
are going to gain more more and more

00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:41,970
followers or then angel they using in

00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:45,210
each social network but I will be done

00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:46,470
if the people is really glad with the

00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:48,240
company she's happy with the content

00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:54,050
they really like the content they're

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:56,850
going to share also they think with a

00:28:54,050 --> 00:29:01,160
with a youtube channel right now it's

00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:04,590
not only about doing quick dogs I was

00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:07,140
some people was asking me for the day

00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:09,140
podcast interviews in YouTube that

00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:15,890
that's awful because I do it remotely

00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:15,890
but maybe some people talking videos

00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:37,790
in terms not of Internet of recording

00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:39,890
words of our talks or even but people

00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:42,680
talking directly to the audience you

00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:47,900
know like normal channels now that I'd

00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:52,400
not comedy or music is people that is

00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:54,410
the target in the the audience is

00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:56,840
directly there's like there the content

00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:57,410
is for those people in the other part of

00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:01,430
the screen

00:29:57,410 --> 00:30:03,110
so not just recording of interviews or

00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:06,070
anything but people that is making the

00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:08,960
content by talking to the audience I

00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:11,210
don't know if you have another idea for

00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:14,830
YouTube content that can be used maybe

00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:14,830
for Instagram content

00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:26,840
I'm not going to mention Twitter and

00:30:24,049 --> 00:30:28,460
face because it was really good it

00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:32,390
working really good right now so we

00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:36,830
don't want to read them but what other

00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:40,159
media do you think working no necessary

00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:43,700
social network but I don't know news

00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:45,620
boards or blogs or where do you think

00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:48,409
people is coming to consume content for

00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:51,289
me is due to bang instrument or the most

00:30:48,409 --> 00:30:53,289
biggest right now but it's not the only

00:30:51,289 --> 00:30:57,340
places we can look for content so

00:30:53,289 --> 00:30:57,340
whether you think about it

00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:07,429
so opinion is is that I feel like we

00:31:04,309 --> 00:31:11,260
should ensure that we're publishing to

00:31:07,429 --> 00:31:15,110
our own content networks and then

00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:18,740
syndicating to to wherever else we need

00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:22,789
to go so definitely want to have a

00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:25,280
strong hold on the content and then move

00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:32,390
that out into the other networks as we

00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:35,659
as we can sure I agree with that 100% so

00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:38,380
be more focus it in the content not in

00:31:35,659 --> 00:31:41,929
the internet we want to reach proof

00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:44,950
primarily have what kind of contact we

00:31:41,929 --> 00:31:47,840
want to to put out and then syndicate to

00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:50,059
Twitter Facebook Instagram or whatever

00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:54,710
we want to use that makes sense for me

00:31:50,059 --> 00:31:58,760
so yeah for sure also if if you have any

00:31:54,710 --> 00:32:00,880
idea of content or or anything I really

00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:04,880
encourage you to go to the our pal guru

00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:07,850
for the federal marketing but your that

00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:10,159
I used last fedora - marketing impede

00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:14,179
you write the other even if you already

00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:16,250
have content you can't just say I have

00:32:14,179 --> 00:32:18,559
this content just you think it can fit

00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:23,169
anywhere and we can have some feedback

00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:23,169
and then get them published

00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:30,560
I think it would be nice to because for

00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:32,780
example I'm really interested in doing

00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:35,000
like screencast or like maybe

00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:41,990
development focus or things like that

00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:45,050
but I never I never really started to do

00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:49,250
it because I need to research which

00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:51,290
software I need to use you know I want

00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:54,700
to it takes quite some time to do I

00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:57,050
don't want to have to try to do it once

00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:59,780
give you the content and say oh yeah

00:32:57,050 --> 00:33:01,190
this is not very good quality so it

00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:03,890
would be nice to try to have a bit like

00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:07,220
getting started now you can start to to

00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:11,140
create content for and maybe the best

00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:13,580
practice and figure out because it's

00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:15,530
it's not something straightforward then

00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:17,870
I think they are like few tips of you

00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:24,200
have a few things that that should be

00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:25,850
useful and yeah and then with what I was

00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:28,670
about to say it would be a good like

00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:34,760
magazine article or even a YouTube video

00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:37,460
or something but because I think with

00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:40,250
video content is for example if if I

00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:43,910
want to write a magazine article I can

00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:47,600
make a draft then I get feedbacks and

00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:51,050
you it's it's much easier to work like

00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:55,490
multiple times on on text where video

00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:59,390
it's it would be it takes much more time

00:33:55,490 --> 00:34:02,150
to eat and anything so it's it would be

00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:04,010
good to give like the like a good

00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:07,970
starting point for people to create the

00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:11,830
content and not spend like 10 days be

00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:11,830
doing things and again and again

00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:23,470
one of the so in terms of building

00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:26,140
contents but it seems to me like we

00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:28,240
really need to define very clearly what

00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:30,190
those channels are and what the target

00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:32,770
audience is for each one of those and

00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:36,520
that one of the other things I was

00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:43,860
thinking is that both Instagram and

00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:47,980
Flickr seem to to lend themselves to

00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:49,660
sketch diagrams very easily and I think

00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:52,360
that one of the things that might be

00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:55,360
very helpful is sketch diagrams or

00:34:52,360 --> 00:35:00,630
visual visualized notes that are

00:34:55,360 --> 00:35:00,630
associated with specific success story

00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:17,850
II I don't um so when I'm thinking about

00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:19,950
what to create for content kind of hard

00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:22,860
to think about like create a user video

00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:26,160
about fedora right it's too big but if

00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:27,540
we get some I don't know you have the

00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,190
talking point but if we have like a

00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:32,940
goals we want to achieve with these

00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:35,310
videos like make further attractive for

00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:39,570
server admins and then it's maybe easier

00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:42,300
to like go towards that or I don't know

00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:44,310
something for graphic designers or like

00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:46,140
having specific areas or goals you want

00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:49,170
to achieve with this with the content

00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:51,060
will make it much easier for thinking

00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:57,930
about create like what what content to

00:35:51,060 --> 00:36:01,170
create is make sense this is a somewhat

00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:03,240
of a non sequitur neurologist it just

00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:05,310
don't - because you were speaking you've

00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,900
made a lot of content for modularity I

00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:09,240
don't know how much of its actually made

00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:11,220
it to our YouTube channel and I'm

00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:13,380
wondering if part of what we as a team

00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:15,660
could start with like I don't use either

00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:18,480
of those social networks so I can't tell

00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:20,160
you what's gonna work there but I wonder

00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,640
if we as a team actually should start

00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:24,990
with because we have limited people

00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:27,180
going out and actually just getting the

00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:30,810
stuff we're already making and getting

00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:33,690
it to this place an example of that is

00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:36,000
that the council does approximately once

00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:38,330
a month a video meeting right now those

00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,920
are not published to our YouTube channel

00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:43,470
most of them not necessarily gonna be

00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:46,440
great you know heavy-hitting you know

00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:50,010
Hollywood dramas but several of them

00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:51,660
have been extraordinarily good and the

00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:54,150
council would definitely be open to

00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:55,860
trying to structure the meeting in such

00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:58,020
a way that there was a chunk of content

00:36:55,860 --> 00:37:00,720
in the middle that would be very

00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:02,760
repurpose a bowl so that like we ran a

00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,470
presentation without any interruptions

00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,900
or something so that you could have a

00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:09,840
here's what a red team is and why it's

00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:12,560
important to Fedora video come out of a

00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,560
council meeting

00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:21,930
kind of one thing that came to mind for

00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:23,339
me too with after items coming was a lot

00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:25,950
of the labs extend themselves pretty

00:37:23,339 --> 00:37:27,660
easily for reaching out to a defined

00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:28,980
target audience so I was always one

00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:31,079
thing I always had wanted to try to

00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:33,380
drive towards was I when it comes to

00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:35,339
defining an audience like the labs are

00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:37,020
they already have a lot of custom

00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:40,319
content that appealed to a specific

00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:41,640
niche of the Fedora user base that was

00:37:40,319 --> 00:37:44,099
always something that I had wanted to

00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:45,450
try to and also helps to promote the

00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:47,549
labs as well because I feel like those

00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:49,859
can kind of get buried and lost and to

00:37:47,549 --> 00:37:51,210
me they're more exciting because they're

00:37:49,859 --> 00:37:52,530
as I understand they're easier to

00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:58,109
maintain because it's more of a

00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:59,460
collection of packages and it's I feel

00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:01,650
like there's a lot of value because like

00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:03,869
those are my target audiences that have

00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:06,690
been identified with like a slightly

00:38:03,869 --> 00:38:08,849
customized pre-installation of packages

00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:09,900
of fedora so I was always one thing I

00:38:08,849 --> 00:38:11,250
just wanted to late mention that could

00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,240
be a good place to try to look at for

00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,589
instead of trying to think like what

00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,059
about what target audiences we want to

00:38:13,589 --> 00:38:17,309
reach out to I was like some of that

00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:19,049
work has been done and then also kind of

00:38:17,309 --> 00:38:21,450
I think building off of like with the

00:38:19,049 --> 00:38:23,520
existing content as well like that would

00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:25,500
also be a good area to focus on is I

00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:28,829
feel like the content is there it's just

00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:30,480
trying to bring it in to the places that

00:38:28,829 --> 00:38:34,680
we're trying to promote it on the

00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:37,619
platform yeah that director makes a lot

00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:40,079
of sense I was talking a little bit

00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:43,140
before that I know there is content

00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:47,640
there like librarian say but it's hard

00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:50,010
for for a few people to reach all the

00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:54,839
teams and just in the whole emails and

00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:56,609
see where everybody is is coming it's

00:38:54,839 --> 00:39:00,150
not like a colonel I don't make all

00:38:56,609 --> 00:39:03,690
people come to me you know but is

00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:06,890
impossible for two three people to go to

00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:06,890
everywhere as well

00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,430
very

00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:55,750
there's not even trying to figure out

00:40:06,309 --> 00:40:13,599
what everyone on édouard in Alberto for

00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,599
rounding up

00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,320
I

00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:28,760
just for the recording and then go to

00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:32,960
pass the microphone to you and then to

00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:37,010
Adam the comment was that instead of

00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:38,330
trying to do all the work make

00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:40,790
communication channels with different

00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:43,730
teams and different objectives and have

00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:47,510
an is it as least that newcomers can go

00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:49,730
and and start creating content or

00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:51,230
working with the thing and not drive

00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:52,880
only they're calling member of the

00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:57,890
marketing team because it's a few people

00:40:52,880 --> 00:41:00,650
and then to try to figure out how to

00:40:57,890 --> 00:41:02,660
make things work between all teams and

00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:04,520
marketing team and that's what I'm

00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:09,500
trying to figure out a little bit with

00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:12,410
my ship so let's see how it works so

00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:14,210
clearly clearly this this topic is is in

00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:18,140
the air because I was feeling it too so

00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:21,140
but in my in and my understanding I

00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:25,220
would want my marketing group to focus

00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:28,910
the content and identify the key areas

00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:32,780
that we want to highlight and then tell

00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:36,200
people and then deliver the request for

00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:41,180
that specific content and then guide

00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:44,330
that to those channels so so I think I

00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:49,960
think the the the serious task here is

00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:52,550
finding a way to narrow the content

00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:56,089
requirements and identify the ones they

00:41:52,550 --> 00:42:00,619
the key areas that we want to guide

00:41:56,089 --> 00:42:05,480
people to do to make this content yeah

00:42:00,619 --> 00:42:10,640
also an idea that I I stole from a

00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:14,050
magazine request and because it's doing

00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:18,290
I think is by the open source comm

00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:22,220
community is that they try to drive the

00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:24,680
content in a specific topic by month and

00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:26,720
it's not realistic for us to make it it

00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:28,099
by month but for example this month we

00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:30,710
are going to talk about design like what

00:42:28,099 --> 00:42:31,609
that was other was talking about this

00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:33,349
month we are going to talk about

00:42:31,609 --> 00:42:34,880
containers this month we are going to

00:42:33,349 --> 00:42:38,930
talk about

00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:41,240
I don't know a Python developer ik you

00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:43,730
know so having this specific areas

00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:47,540
targeted in time frames that are

00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:49,460
realistic for us to work on maybe will

00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:51,460
be helpful for what are you talking

00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:56,980
about

00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:56,980
sorry yes

00:42:59,829 --> 00:43:06,380
it's one of the things I like on like

00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:08,089
doing software and programming for

00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:10,219
example when I started I don't know in

00:43:08,089 --> 00:43:11,930
high school or in the university was I

00:43:10,219 --> 00:43:13,789
had this big advantage I could

00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:16,849
contribute to open source projects and

00:43:13,789 --> 00:43:20,329
get like experience free and just make

00:43:16,849 --> 00:43:23,119
something nice and also people I know

00:43:20,329 --> 00:43:25,700
for example from marketing or other

00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:27,140
areas didn't have these opportunities it

00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:29,119
looked like they didn't have these

00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:32,630
opportunities but it looks like they

00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:35,329
might have now so somehow and I don't

00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:39,259
know how but building an environment for

00:43:35,329 --> 00:43:41,660
them to build experience and just like

00:43:39,259 --> 00:43:45,979
practice and do something like as a

00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:47,150
volunteer might be good idea but yeah we

00:43:45,979 --> 00:43:53,680
would need to figure out how to do that

00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:57,319
have a message to the people I thought

00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:59,059
it will depend specifically of what you

00:43:57,319 --> 00:44:01,999
want to achieve or what kind of content

00:43:59,059 --> 00:44:05,690
you are going to deliver but for example

00:44:01,999 --> 00:44:10,099
I was trying things called

00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:13,460
open broadcast system or OBS I still

00:44:10,099 --> 00:44:15,789
open broadcast studio it's a it's free

00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:19,430
software Bergy use license and codecs

00:44:15,789 --> 00:44:22,670
but it's so easy to configure just to

00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:24,950
grab it a video recorded and you can

00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:30,170
keep putting a background track if you

00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:32,690
want to put some music file open

00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:34,640
licenses content in terms of audio is

00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:37,309
not that hard and it's impressive how

00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:40,460
many people just trying I don't know

00:44:37,309 --> 00:44:44,719
maybe DJ things or try to promote their

00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:46,969
own music in SoundCloud or everywhere so

00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:49,130
it's not that hard to make content if

00:44:46,969 --> 00:44:53,059
you want to but you need to me to tell

00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:55,640
the people that how it is a is there and

00:44:53,059 --> 00:44:58,269
how use it and then is is you required

00:44:55,640 --> 00:45:02,469
like three clicks to record screen cuts

00:44:58,269 --> 00:45:02,469
just let me just

00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:08,050
so like kind of reflecting back on my

00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:10,310
experience from when I was trying to

00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:13,310
like drive the focus of what marketing

00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:15,190
was going I really think David was like

00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:18,110
really hitting it on the head was that

00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:20,060
like it's there's a lot of different

00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:22,010
ways you can you can go and I think just

00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:24,710
being explicit and focusing on like a

00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:26,780
specific area is fine like for me like I

00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:27,980
think like it would've just I think one

00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:30,740
of the hardest things was just trying to

00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:32,000
figure out like wow what do we want to

00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:33,860
focus on what we want to do but I think

00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,540
like my like my advice would it be in

00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:37,850
whatever I think I wish I had just done

00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:40,370
before what have been is to be like okay

00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:42,290
the next three months this is it you

00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:44,060
know because I think I think it's the

00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:46,190
marketing team that needs to be explicit

00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:48,260
and to be bold and just say like this is

00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:50,300
what we're going to focus on this is

00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:52,610
what we're going to do and then try to

00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:53,780
work or with the other groups with the

00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:55,700
other teams and even the user

00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:58,040
communities like this is another one

00:45:55,700 --> 00:46:00,110
that I want to had wanted to do but say

00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:02,410
like like with social media trying to

00:46:00,110 --> 00:46:04,760
bring in user contributions like saying

00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:06,350
you're focusing on containers for three

00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:08,780
months so you're trying to generate like

00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:11,120
container content and we can retweet

00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:13,460
reshare people's content that they've

00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:15,260
already created say like you know on

00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:18,440
their own personal blog setting up a

00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:20,870
next cloud server in KU burn or in an

00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:22,700
open shift cluster in the docker

00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:23,720
container and you know it's not in the

00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:25,100
fedora magazine it's not in the

00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:26,690
community blog but it's floating out

00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:30,020
there on someone's personal blog they

00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:32,210
did on Fedora 28 and if we're trying to

00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:33,380
focus on a specific area say like cuz

00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:35,480
I'm going on the contain like three

00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:37,130
months or we're focusing on containers

00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:40,220
that's what our focus is for these next

00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:42,890
three months it becomes easier for you

00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:45,590
as the marketing team to do that

00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:47,810
outreach and to know who and what groups

00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:49,580
what teams what people to try to build a

00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:53,060
relationship with for that three-month

00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:54,680
focus and then like I think the thing

00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:56,390
I'd always wanted to do is try to bring

00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:57,890
in that user-generated content like

00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:58,970
you're in the fedora telegram group too

00:46:57,890 --> 00:47:00,860
and like that's where I see all this

00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:02,330
content all the time or people will

00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:03,890
share these tweets of people who have

00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:05,390
written these blog posts or written this

00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:07,490
content generated this content already

00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:10,370
so think that would that was kind of my

00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:11,810
next step was like get content from

00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:14,610
within the community from the core

00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:16,560
contributor community and

00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:19,170
once you have that baseline then you can

00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:22,260
also try to build a more interactive a

00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:26,040
more engaging social media presence by

00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:27,720
trying to include user content on the

00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:30,870
official platforms and channels as well

00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:32,370
but like my big piece of advice was like

00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:34,560
for me like it was always really hard to

00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:36,990
just be bold and it be like this is what

00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:39,090
we're going to do and I think like you

00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:40,860
and Alberto and the and the rest of the

00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:43,560
team need to say this is what we're

00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:45,060
going to do and just be just do it and

00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:48,390
be explicit I don't think you have to

00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:49,950
try to you know go around the you know

00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:51,450
the community or groan the Fedora

00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:53,940
Council to figure out what that is I

00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:56,430
think it's the core group of marketing

00:47:53,940 --> 00:48:00,420
contributors that needs to just be bold

00:47:56,430 --> 00:48:04,260
and and make that decision yeah that was

00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:05,760
a of one of my first life was a we as a

00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:10,170
marketing think we need to identify the

00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:12,930
audience we want to reach and I think I

00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:15,360
want to talk personal experience I had

00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:16,770
with the podcast because is one of the

00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:19,350
biggest thing I'm doing with marketing

00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:22,320
right now and it makes a lot of sense

00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:24,750
what you're talking to because for the

00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:29,360
podcast you say I want to say I want to

00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:32,250
do podcast there is yeah it's already an

00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:36,450
audience and in the podcast I want to do

00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:38,790
interviews with members of each of

00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:40,670
different teams to let people know what

00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:45,660
teams are and what they are doing so

00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:49,140
narrow they they work more you know so

00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:52,230
when we hit that specific thing we will

00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:54,210
when we get really good results so what

00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:56,600
we're taking to make sense because it's

00:48:54,210 --> 00:48:59,550
doing the same but for difference

00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:01,680
media's do name for example for videos

00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:03,690
we're going to make a video for

00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:05,460
containers you're narrowing doing a

00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:07,860
specific thing and people can contribute

00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:10,050
because it's easier because you're

00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:12,690
already half of a key point more a point

00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:15,050
to talk about so just actually that's a

00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:15,050
great idea

00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:25,910
I think we need to be careful not to now

00:49:23,930 --> 00:49:28,940
Oh too much preservation in the

00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:32,329
situation we have we are now that we

00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:34,339
don't have much content so if I was I

00:49:32,329 --> 00:49:35,930
wanted to contribute and I was told by

00:49:34,339 --> 00:49:38,240
all know for the next women's with the

00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:41,660
only con container but I wanted to do a

00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:47,000
video but the new to do application in

00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:48,710
in in federal right I don't think we

00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,569
really in a position to actually have

00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:53,119
like very specific goal and we should be

00:49:50,569 --> 00:49:56,599
like trying to make it easier to people

00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:59,390
to give that content and try to publish

00:49:56,599 --> 00:50:01,400
for example if you search in YouTube

00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:03,650
fado are the first few video that car

00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,670
coming is like five reason why I prefer

00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:06,559
the Fedora store

00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:09,230
I think this is this should be like

00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:13,430
really come easy content to do like five

00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:16,609
reason why you should use fedora fedora

00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:18,289
28 workstation install and review this

00:50:16,609 --> 00:50:20,809
is some stuff week we could do also I

00:50:18,289 --> 00:50:27,680
think in like very generic very easy

00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:29,390
like like not too specific on but I

00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:32,750
don't know I think we should try to

00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:35,089
maybe get more new people in the

00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:36,859
community and not try to focus on stuff

00:50:35,089 --> 00:50:39,529
we are already doing but like more like

00:50:36,859 --> 00:50:41,809
oh why you should use fedora why why

00:50:39,529 --> 00:50:45,230
does it make sense if you doing Python

00:50:41,809 --> 00:50:46,880
to install Fedora and do your Python

00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:51,559
development in fedora

00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:53,480
easy easy larger audience topic I'm

00:50:51,559 --> 00:50:55,039
gonna push back slightly on that and the

00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:56,359
only pushback I'm gonna give you is the

00:50:55,039 --> 00:50:59,359
one I think that's a perfectly valid

00:50:56,359 --> 00:51:00,670
target for the first in months let's use

00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:03,349
three because that's what Justin said

00:51:00,670 --> 00:51:04,819
but I think that the that we should

00:51:03,349 --> 00:51:06,710
treat this kind of like the way we would

00:51:04,819 --> 00:51:08,990
treat say an open source code project in

00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:10,549
the sense that we have a set of things

00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:13,339
that we'd like to see accomplished and

00:51:10,549 --> 00:51:15,440
we wrote our easy fix task list you know

00:51:13,339 --> 00:51:18,529
bug suggestion list for starting people

00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:20,990
around the the areas of feature set we

00:51:18,529 --> 00:51:22,970
want to develop so if we say it's New

00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:26,420
Year's our onboarding our containers all

00:51:22,970 --> 00:51:28,609
of the suggested pitches for content are

00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:30,830
around that but if you show up with

00:51:28,609 --> 00:51:33,170
something amazing on a web server

00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:34,610
take it you know like if somebody shows

00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:36,110
up with a feature you didn't plan to

00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:40,070
ship in the first three months but its

00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:41,780
feature ready except that patch and I

00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:43,340
think that that may lead to occasionally

00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:45,470
where you're looking and you're like on

00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:47,750
message on message on message whoa what

00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:49,580
is this but especially with the nature

00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:52,310
of things like YouTube where I suspect

00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:54,590
again not a user but I suspect people

00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:56,330
very rarely sit down and watch a channel

00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:58,760
in chronological order when it's a

00:51:56,330 --> 00:52:00,860
channel like this one I don't think that

00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:07,640
content is gonna either get lost or look

00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:10,760
weird I totally know and like I say and

00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:16,640
I really heavy-duty consumer a Content

00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:18,830
consumer and I think we can all I'm

00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:20,080
focusing a little and a much too much in

00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:25,790
YouTube because we are talking about

00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:29,060
videos but I just people look in channel

00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:33,020
4 chronological order videos and if the

00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:38,270
YouTube channel have a piece of

00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:40,400
publication a consistent ask extra for

00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:42,890
example like we try to do with a

00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:45,650
magazine we have Monday Wednesday and

00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:47,600
Friday publications every week so we can

00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:50,030
say on Mondays we are going to make

00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:53,330
light videos like reviews like instant

00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:55,970
loss of 5 reasons I'm Friday on

00:52:53,330 --> 00:52:58,190
Wednesday we are going short videos

00:52:55,970 --> 00:53:00,200
about people in the community saying why

00:52:58,190 --> 00:53:02,540
they use Federer how they start in the

00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:05,030
community like that we are further

00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:07,580
videos on Fridays we are going to focus

00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:10,490
3 months on Friday videos about

00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:13,910
containers so I think if we have enough

00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:19,790
content and we can set for YouTube

00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:23,240
specifically one day of the way to reach

00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:26,120
the three different approaches we are

00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:28,670
talking to and it makes sense and the

00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:30,970
people is look YouTube like it was at

00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:34,730
television it was television you know

00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:38,450
this program this series public 8 a

00:53:34,730 --> 00:53:40,760
publishing episode every Friday like all

00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:42,260
fashion television and people is

00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:44,780
watching YouTube that way right now

00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:46,940
because I do I'm doing it actually and I

00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:49,190
know the people do and and it makes

00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:51,880
sense to generate content in that way

00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:54,500
because it's happening now we are not a

00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:57,530
reinventing the wheel it's happening in

00:53:54,500 --> 00:54:03,050
that way and we can just follow the the

00:53:57,530 --> 00:54:05,930
way that way yeah so I think that having

00:54:03,050 --> 00:54:09,260
these more specific topics might help

00:54:05,930 --> 00:54:11,960
not just like to consume the content but

00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:14,210
also to create it and if I think about

00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:16,730
adding a crazy example right like I just

00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:18,410
say tell you tell me a good story and it

00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:20,330
would be like what about what they'll be

00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:21,860
thinking about what if I tell you tell

00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:23,810
me a story about being elephant and

00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:25,550
eating ice cream I'll be much easier for

00:54:23,810 --> 00:54:30,260
you to come up with like many funny

00:54:25,550 --> 00:54:31,940
scenarios right and I think we are

00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:34,280
open-source community right we are not

00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:36,860
like professional production company

00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:39,380
with paid team of people that can do

00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:40,970
anything so I think we need to target

00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:43,130
both the audience to make it may the

00:54:40,970 --> 00:54:45,620
strategy work for the consumers but also

00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:48,200
for the people who will be creating the

00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:51,170
content so it's easier for them to come

00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:57,820
up with the topic and that's what I like

00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:57,820
the more narrow areas and yeah basically

00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:03,500
they're actually more or less I was

00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:05,450
going to say too but I was just going to

00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:06,950
kind of give a reaffirmation for that

00:55:05,450 --> 00:55:08,540
approach to like just like how in the

00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:12,380
magazine there's a series of starter

00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:14,210
pitches that are suggested articles to

00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:16,900
begin writing and we've tried to focus

00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:20,090
those around certain areas of content I

00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:22,580
think that until we start getting a

00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:24,350
regular flow of content like for me like

00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:25,760
my experience was like I was trying to

00:55:24,350 --> 00:55:27,380
come up with these like trying to build

00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:29,510
like a pipeline for receiving and

00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:31,970
working with content but the problem was

00:55:29,510 --> 00:55:36,490
that we've kind of built this pipeline

00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:40,580
without having any like no input no out

00:55:36,490 --> 00:55:43,510
so for me I really feel like for the

00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:46,940
size of where this team is right now and

00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:49,070
we're in the shortest amount of time

00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:53,180
this team could start to try to produce

00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:55,370
meaningful content and well not not

00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:58,400
produce but also is like accumulate and

00:55:55,370 --> 00:56:01,940
gather this content I do think it's

00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:03,320
there it's just crafting it for the

00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:05,330
right audience like taking what's

00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:10,220
already there and just modifying it

00:56:05,330 --> 00:56:12,650
modifying me the message just a little

00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:14,330
bit for your audience I think by

00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:18,140
focusing on a specific group by a

00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:20,240
specific content or type of content that

00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:22,670
will really be the most helpful for this

00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:24,020
group of people to accomplish the goal

00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:32,840
you're trying to set out to do for the

00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:35,240
next few months so yeah we can both we

00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:37,970
can do both things or continue or coffee

00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:39,620
break but I think we the discussion is

00:56:37,970 --> 00:56:41,600
good right now I don't want to display

00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:46,120
this so let's continue and take the

00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:46,120
coffee break a little bit later sorry

00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:51,080
yeah so that was awesome and I just

00:56:49,790 --> 00:56:52,820
think that like for this team like that

00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:55,280
is a very like that's the thing that I

00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:57,140
think I wish I had I wish I had done two

00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:59,990
years back like I wish I would have just

00:56:57,140 --> 00:57:02,690
said you know we're gonna focus on we're

00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:04,070
going to focus on modularity content for

00:57:02,690 --> 00:57:06,650
this next three months because that

00:57:04,070 --> 00:57:08,690
would have made my my efforts of trying

00:57:06,650 --> 00:57:12,740
to find this content and accumulate this

00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:15,920
content it would have made it less of

00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:17,900
like a a Wild West rodeo show of just

00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:19,370
like throwing things out - mailing lists

00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:21,410
of difference and just hoping you get

00:57:19,370 --> 00:57:23,210
something back so like like that was

00:57:21,410 --> 00:57:24,920
really like I think from my experience

00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:26,770
doing this that's like the thing I wish

00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:30,020
I had done like I wish I had just been

00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:31,070
explicit and said this is what we're

00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:33,410
going to do for the next three months

00:57:31,070 --> 00:57:35,410
and just like you know if you just like

00:57:33,410 --> 00:57:38,090
Brian said like if good content comes in

00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:40,549
then you can take it to just like an

00:57:38,090 --> 00:57:44,609
open source project

00:57:40,549 --> 00:57:47,609
um so again if I take the example of the

00:57:44,609 --> 00:57:50,280
magazine for example every release we

00:57:47,609 --> 00:57:54,990
have a set of articles that are very

00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:58,559
popular like what's new in no 29 and

00:57:54,990 --> 00:58:01,230
that's always every if we every is the

00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:03,539
most popular articles and I think that's

00:58:01,230 --> 00:58:07,680
something maybe we need to have also

00:58:03,539 --> 00:58:09,869
like it's those are easy content and

00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:11,670
like it should be easy to say oh every

00:58:09,869 --> 00:58:14,579
dailies we want a YouTube video showing

00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:17,700
like the new things in in Gnome or the

00:58:14,579 --> 00:58:22,309
new things in in modularity or thing

00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:26,880
like that I try to those should be like

00:58:22,309 --> 00:58:28,980
kind of deadlines and like things that

00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:32,579
we should we should target to have at

00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:38,069
least every release that might be like a

00:58:32,579 --> 00:58:39,900
good thing to as an objective for the

00:58:38,069 --> 00:58:43,339
team to say oh yeah we have a new

00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:47,930
release way we want a video on and I

00:58:43,339 --> 00:58:50,130
think we can have the advantage of of of

00:58:47,930 --> 00:58:52,559
being close from the projects so we

00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:54,569
could actually even released this video

00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:57,240
before other people start to do review

00:58:54,569 --> 00:59:01,369
and thing like kind of preview of the

00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:01,369
next video are releasing and finger

00:59:04,919 --> 00:59:12,390
yeah I totally that make sense because

00:59:09,479 --> 00:59:14,669
for example one of the things we were

00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:18,659
doing with a with the released

00:59:14,669 --> 00:59:23,419
screenshots was trying not to let other

00:59:18,659 --> 00:59:26,339
media consumers their media publications

00:59:23,419 --> 00:59:28,319
outside the magazine outside the our

00:59:26,339 --> 00:59:30,179
original source take their whole new

00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:32,549
screenshots because we want to people

00:59:30,179 --> 00:59:34,739
focus on or they think we want to

00:59:32,549 --> 00:59:38,519
highlight and make sense to for example

00:59:34,739 --> 00:59:42,239
may create this release review before

00:59:38,519 --> 00:59:45,749
that is there or at the day they review

00:59:42,239 --> 00:59:47,880
the the new releases publish it you know

00:59:45,749 --> 00:59:51,119
because we're under the consumers to

00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:55,140
focus in what we want them to focus not

00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:57,659
let's explore every single maybe focuses

00:59:55,140 --> 01:00:00,419
or find something that we don't there is

00:59:57,659 --> 01:00:04,279
not the best thing of the of the new

01:00:00,419 --> 01:00:04,279
release so just that makes a lot sense

01:00:11,390 --> 01:00:18,500
so let's do the coffee break and then we

01:00:15,950 --> 01:00:19,790
can go back thanks a lot for for the

01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:23,969
first part of this session

01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:23,969
