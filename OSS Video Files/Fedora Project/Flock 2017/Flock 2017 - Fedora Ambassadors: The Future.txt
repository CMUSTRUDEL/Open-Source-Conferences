Talk: Fedora Ambassadors: The Future
Presenter: Jona Azizaj, Nick Bebout

Description:
There has been much discussion lately about the Fedora Council wanting Ambassadors to look at why we do things, i.e. why we attend certain events, why we spend money on various expenses, and if that is the most efficient use of the budget given to us by Red Hat. I would like for a group of ambassadors from various regions to get together to discuss what we are currently doing, what we can do better, and brainstorm ideas of new things we should do in the future.
