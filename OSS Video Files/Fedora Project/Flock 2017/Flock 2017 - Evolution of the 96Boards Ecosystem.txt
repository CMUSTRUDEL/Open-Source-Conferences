Talk: Evolution of the 96Boards Ecosystem
Presenter: Robert D Wolff

Description:
96Boards is a range of hardware specifications developed by Linaro and the 96Boards member companies to make the latest ARM-based processors available to developers at a reasonable cost, in a standard form factor. Since it's launch in 2015, a strong community has surfaced and fed into our growing ecosystem. This talk will summarize some of 96Boards' greatest milestones and achievements, while focusing on the future growth of our vibrant community. From 96Boards Distribution and Mezzanine enablement to creating and maintaining open support and diverse community outreach channels, 96Boards has always tried to promote a lasting and positive experience for anyone involved.

trouble I'm gonna be talking about the

00:00:01,319 --> 00:00:06,960
evolution of the 96 board's ecosystem

00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:11,480
and future software enable men whose

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,480
you're familiar with the 96 sports brand

00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,859
yeah so we're going to talk just a

00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,539
little bit about them and offer some

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,180
resources and URLs if you want to read

00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:21,960
more about that but a 96 Ford ecosystem

00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,519
here we go

00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,859
me my name is Robert wolf like I just

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,869
said I'm an engineer community manager

00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:30,990
for 96 boards which is a part of manaro

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:33,149
and for those of you who aren't familiar

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,469
with Lonardo there will be a slide here

00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:36,680
with some links as well you can also

00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:39,149
just search when are over to work

00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,829
there's some more kind of just personal

00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:44,070
information about myself University in

00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:45,719
San Diego I flew all the way here to

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,809
talk to you all for 25 minutes

00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,640
so from San Diego please I want this to

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:53,160
be very informal if anyone has questions

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,430
you want to interrupt me please do so

00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:59,340
you know a conversation and then when I

00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:02,100
leave which is tomorrow you can always

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,539
reach me on Twitter Instagram IRC those

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,250
three channels that I'm usually and I'm

00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:08,729
also in the fedora flock channel Ford or

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:10,320
IOT channel I'm in your channel the door

00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:13,020
arm channel I'm in a bunch of fedora

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:17,340
channels as well and then my kid hub is

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:19,860
right there as well you know so today's

00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,840
topics I'm going to talk just a little

00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,369
bit about Bernardo a little bit about 96

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,720
words I'm going to talk about the

00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:26,909
community because I'm the community

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,250
manager for 96 words kind of give you a

00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:31,950
little bit of an insight of kind of what

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:34,350
our reach is what we do in general and

00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,790
then I will talk about or have a

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,439
conversation hopefully with everyone

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:41,729
about the future of the software in a

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:46,250
moment on our 96 boards with fedora so

00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:49,229
what is when our was founded in 2010 and

00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:50,970
the goal is to basically reduce the

00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:54,720
redundancies and fragmentation in the

00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:56,460
arm ecosystem around everything you know

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,079
our ecosystem I guess I should say I

00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,509
want to share a small anecdote I'm not

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,270
sure who's familiar but Softbank did

00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:06,990
recently acquire arm for 32 billion

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:09,000
dollars the CEO must have seen something

00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:13,530
big right to spend that much money on

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,050
our new billion so occur do you have a

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:18,150
hundred billion devices out there

00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,040
running arm okay CEO thinks that that's

00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,629
going to hit up to a trillion even if

00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,510
even if it doesn't reach trillion even

00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:25,890
it only means to have half a trillion

00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,780
500 billion we're still talking about a

00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,239
bunch of devices out there running arm

00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,709
and even in today's keynote I guess in

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,590
the in the morning when Matthew was

00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:36,510
talking about how we're starting to see

00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,680
this plateau and fedora we want to

00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:38,819
increase those numbers right wanna

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,080
increase our contributors want to

00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:43,530
increase these devices that are out

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,000
there cleaning the servers and up just

00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,670
the numbers in general right so I mean

00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,379
this is definitely something that should

00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:51,209
interest everyone here this that's you

00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:52,680
know in the fedora world

00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:54,239
and if you want to learn more of him

00:02:52,680 --> 00:03:00,000
like I say she's feel free to visit

00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:02,519
those websites and 96 boards was founded

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,420
quite later and the goal originally was

00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:09,060
to provide cost-effective or you know

00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:11,819
low-cost Hardware arm hardware for

00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,260
developers like you all to to kind of

00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:17,430
fiddle with and play around with to

00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:20,010
develop arm make it better now since

00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:22,439
then we have pushed out a whole bunch of

00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:23,430
devices we need pair up vendors chip

00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:25,919
vendors we pair them up with

00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,359
manufacturers distributors and try to do

00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,209
our best to make sure that they follow

00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:32,250
this arm specification and right now I

00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:34,530
want to kind of take a little bit of the

00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:36,840
what is it order of operations and break

00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:38,609
down what we consider it the ninety-six

00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,739
board specification it is an open

00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:43,260
hardware specification a lot of people

00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:44,849
think open Hardware comma specification

00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,620
but it's actually an open hardware

00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:48,269
specification which means the

00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,189
specification itself is open not the

00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:54,239
hardware not necessarily all the time

00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:57,090
and so that being said we'll talk about

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,170
this later when it comes to when it

00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:01,540
comes to

00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:04,060
software an ailment this is kind of

00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:07,240
brought in some problems that we're

00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,890
going to try and tackle but yes again

00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,480
there you go there's some more resources

00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,320
around named six boards and for those of

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,630
you who would like to read more that's

00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:16,030
not the whole point of this talk to talk

00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:20,830
about 96 words in this sense so I'm just

00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:22,030
going to leave that there with you now

00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:24,550
talking a little bit more about this

00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:26,200
hardware in the specification you can

00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:28,360
see that we've pushed out various

00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,620
devices and many of you who have said

00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,540
you've heard about 96 words might be

00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,550
familiar more so with the consumer

00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:36,580
edition side of things I know Peter in

00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:38,170
the audience Robin the audience maybe we

00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:41,710
need to been playing around the dragon

00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:45,460
board for Tennessee the Heike and all of

00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:47,950
these are different SOC s that lay on

00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:52,330
the same footprint so this is kind of

00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:54,220
what makes the the 96 forms ecosystem so

00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:55,450
attractive to people who are developing

00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,680
and someone I think in the audience

00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:58,330
during Peter Strahm station was talking

00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,100
about IOT and sensors and all these

00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:01,780
other kind of that this other kind of

00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:05,380
enablement that you might want around

00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:07,120
IOT and with that regards I mean here so

00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:09,970
here we're looking at 96 words the same

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,560
footprint right over here the Enterprise

00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:14,020
Edition right here that you might see

00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,120
the same footprint and then the TV based

00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:18,580
off the Enterprise Edition extended

00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,640
scene edition which should also work

00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:23,380
within the same kind of footprint

00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,580
compounds and then an IOT Edition over

00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,250
here right

00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:28,560
but with

00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:32,490
having the same footprint and having it

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,800
be SOC independent you open up

00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:37,080
opportunities for the market of

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,120
mezzanine what we call mezzanine so with

00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,430
raspberry pi I might call hats and

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,980
Arduinos might call shields we call them

00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:46,620
as an even these boards have been coming

00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:48,570
out of the Woodworks quite literally

00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,280
they just keep coming out I can't even

00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:52,200
keep track of them you know there's

00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,250
there's all sorts of companies that are

00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,780
just coming to come out and release and

00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,820
talk with me about this one right here

00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:59,940
there was a university up in San

00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:01,200
Francisco that needed a camera and they

00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,970
couldn't figure out how to use it on the

00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,800
dragon board for Tennessee so then they

00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:06,900
just developed this board all by

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,400
themselves printed it out and then they

00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,870
started selling it on eBay just popped

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,340
up on eBay one day I was like okay great

00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,920
yeah now we can use cameras on all these

00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:16,050
different six ways they're still working

00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,400
on submitting drivers and doing all

00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,900
sorts of cool stuff with this you can

00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:23,730
literally go to ebay and buy that right

00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:26,190
now why do I say this well because right

00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:29,910
now Fedora really isn't running on our

00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:33,390
devices and if it were people would have

00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:35,070
access standing line get it if it was

00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:36,660
and we're gonna talk about this too but

00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:39,690
if it was and people would have access

00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:42,930
to a plethora of i/o and a plethora of

00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:44,669
or a very vibrant ecosystem that just

00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:47,100
continued to grow in faster than 19 you

00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:49,390
travel so this is the mezzanine page

00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,650
right here and you

00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:54,640
you can read all about all these little

00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:56,190
devices here for the most part any

00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:59,440
questions so far

00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:08,350
96 board the specifications mezzanine no

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:09,370
sir boom that's that's actually one of

00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:10,720
the last slides that we're going to be

00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:13,450
talking about we can talk about it right

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,690
now a little bit Peter you want to yeah

00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:19,570
so one of the roles that I've picked up

00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:22,690
is that I actually sit on the 96 for the

00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:24,640
steering committee and one of the first

00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:30,280
things that I engaged with them about

00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:35,500
was flash onboard for firmware and and

00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:38,620
the intention I understand is that the

00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:42,930
city and other specs to the Jew app

00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:45,130
shortly there will be that requirement

00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:46,930
yeah so Peter does sit on the steering

00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,470
committee on behalf of I believe red hat

00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,750
fedora

00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:53,830
so yeah red hat as a whole but Fedora

00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:56,200
CentOS and and so this is only recently

00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:57,370
that that kind of Peter started sitting

00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,500
on the steering committee we've had

00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:02,170
several meetings and the specification

00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,490
2.0 is in the making right and this will

00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:06,130
of course be proposed the steering

00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:08,410
committee we have meetings I think once

00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:10,750
a month or so and hopefully this will

00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:13,620
move forward and that is particularly

00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,620
something we're trying to address

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:23,639
trying to use any importance getting in

00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:26,040
place so in case either my supervisors

00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:33,630
are watching they're saying SDI flash on

00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:39,390
the specification it's critical to get

00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:47,690
that out of the specifications thank you

00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:50,370
um did you have a question sir yes okay

00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:51,510
so the whole point of me kind of talking

00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,800
a bit about the community first of all

00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,270
obviously I'm the community manager but

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,810
I wanted to kind of give an idea to

00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:59,490
everyone about what our reach is kind of

00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:01,020
what our goals and what our reach is and

00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:04,500
why it's important for Fedora to be a

00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:07,529
part of this as a whole right personally

00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:11,779
I have been trying to create a community

00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:14,279
from I want to almost a scratch to

00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:16,080
that's kind of thanks ourselves on an

00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:18,240
organic growth we have very strong

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,339
engagement from our people I want to

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,130
make sure that anyone who talks to me or

00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:24,240
the you know involved community feels

00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:27,029
that they're being listened to so

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,720
there's an active give-and-take and I

00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:31,830
promise that that is what will happen

00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:34,529
interactive improvement and like I said

00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:36,300
you know this active listening will feed

00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:38,310
into a very interactive improvement

00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:40,650
give-and-take once again we want to make

00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:42,750
sure that we're doing what what is best

00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:45,839
and that it's being pushed forward as a

00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:48,300
community and then of course there's

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,819
always new initiatives and new things

00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,979
that

00:09:48,819 --> 00:09:55,089
floating to my head the community's head

00:09:50,979 --> 00:09:56,739
every now and then and we try to write

00:09:55,089 --> 00:10:00,309
and this will hopefully feed into

00:09:56,739 --> 00:10:03,189
everything that is above what is the

00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:06,220
reach that we have here 96 words we

00:10:03,189 --> 00:10:08,470
participate with many huge companies I

00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:10,959
mean this includes armed Qualcomm Fogg

00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:13,269
way I silicon many distributors arrow

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,399
and the list goes on you want to go to

00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:17,019
the on our website 96 words website you

00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:18,729
can see all of our partners there's a

00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:21,970
lot of people that want to be involved

00:10:18,729 --> 00:10:24,309
with this movement and with that comes a

00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:27,729
lot of visibility we participate in

00:10:24,309 --> 00:10:30,100
hackathons we just recently got accepted

00:10:27,729 --> 00:10:31,739
with Qualcomm into the major league

00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,329
hackathon which is a global initiative

00:10:31,739 --> 00:10:35,769
where ninety six boards will be present

00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:37,660
at every single one of these hackathons

00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:39,309
they will have access to all the

00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:42,100
operating systems that come with these

00:10:39,309 --> 00:10:44,139
96 sports and people kids students all

00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,499
walks of life will be working on these

00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:49,660
boards lots of visibility worldwide

00:10:46,499 --> 00:10:51,279
academics I personally work with several

00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:54,129
universities in the United States in

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:56,619
Brazil in Mexico hopefully soon to be

00:10:54,129 --> 00:10:59,319
China in India and these are all

00:10:56,619 --> 00:11:01,629
professors faculty that we ought to get

00:10:59,319 --> 00:11:04,179
96 boards into the university classrooms

00:11:01,629 --> 00:11:05,949
this is a really big deal and we are

00:11:04,179 --> 00:11:09,909
trying to move forward with this quickly

00:11:05,949 --> 00:11:12,309
and also efficiently conferences and

00:11:09,909 --> 00:11:14,139
workshops you know right here this is an

00:11:12,309 --> 00:11:15,729
example of being at a conference

00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:17,650
hopefully spreading the ninety six

00:11:15,729 --> 00:11:19,870
boards word

00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:22,960
creating evangelists and having fun

00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:24,880
together workshops I've given several

00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:27,040
workshops other people give lots of food

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,660
workshops and yeah it's another good

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,860
reason but yeah the list goes on right

00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,450
when I'll connect for those of you who

00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:34,390
are familiar with our connect these can

00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:36,520
connect the Naaru or you can search for

00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:39,370
that it's a conference that we do twice

00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:42,550
a year you get leading industry

00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:44,410
professionals in this world from all

00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:47,230
over the world that show up in one place

00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:50,170

all the way place what are some of the

00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:08,740
initiatives that I have been working on

00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:11,170
personally right now and this is just to

00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:12,430
kind of build up the reach but open

00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,900

projects pages websites augmentation our

00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:55,870
whole website now is back rendered from

00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:57,760
github so our website our documentation

00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,839
everything this is community driven if

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,510

but everything is interactive now this

00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,240
is just an example of one of the open

00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:12,800
hours episodes here this is a Brazilian

00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,540
partnership that we got involved in

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,220
these are all folks from Brazil they

00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:18,530
went into a hackathon it was an internet

00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:20,630
or in national hackathon in Brazil they

00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:22,130
all won they flew up to San Diego we

00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:25,280
took over the Qualcomm think of it lab

00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:27,260
and we all did a nice show there there's

00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,790
a lot of fun all these folks are from

00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:31,070
different companies all around Brazil

00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:32,630
they all made really cool projects and

00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:35,600
they will all be visible through a

00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:37,880
common 96 words here's another show we

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,700
did with Manero and Cobre if you're not

00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:42,500
familiar with the cryptocurrency monaro

00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:45,560
it's rumoured that and I'm not saying

00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:47,420
that this really happened but the day

00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:50,360
after this show their their whole value

00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:52,460
of Manero went up like 300% it was crazy

00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:56,110
haha I'm not kidding but I've talked

00:13:52,460 --> 00:14:02,690
through the lead depth which is ricardo

00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:09,110
hyc justin he's also involved there the

00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:11,060
show but and then he was talking about

00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:13,130
Vidura and of course as you mentioned

00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:17,090
soon we hooked a fedora running on our

00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:19,700
96 words and it is mostly that if I

00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:23,410
could Bruns with my hockey it's putting

00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,410
college to come to my talk tomorrow and

00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:27,410
some of the projects that people are

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,790
getting involved these are all

00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:31,580
community-driven projects none of these

00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:34,080
were done by people in 96 or as I as far

00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:35,790
as I know none of them almost be

00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,529
they're just projects that are surfacing

00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:40,709
people they're getting involved in this

00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:43,230
ecosystem now let me talk it softer

00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:44,940
enablement so there's a were kind of I'm

00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:48,089
done right this is more of a discussion

00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:49,950
on once I've got two things first is

00:14:48,089 --> 00:14:51,690
early access hardware this is kind of

00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:53,760
the easy part right so I'm dealing with

00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:55,500
all of these companies like I said the

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,730
chip makers that put their chips on the

00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,990
boards they're getting with the

00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,910
manufacturer than they get with the

00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:02,040
distributors and they all send these

00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:04,200
boards I've kind of come across a lot of

00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:06,089
problems here because you the board sell

00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,680
out too quickly in which case the people

00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:10,880
who are supposed to have these boards

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:15,480
don't get their hands on them in time or

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:16,980
they just or yeah that's actually pretty

00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,019
much it it's all it's you really don't

00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:20,130
make enough yeah so early access

00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:21,720
hardware is what I'm trying to work with

00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:23,880
our distributors with they're gonna

00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,920
create pockets boards and so that way I

00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:28,260
can talk with Peter who is kind of

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,790
representing you all here if you need a

00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,589
board if you feel like contributing if

00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:33,300
you feel like being a part of this then

00:15:31,589 --> 00:15:35,790
please contact Peter Peter can reach out

00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,920
to me and we will get this Hardware in

00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:41,700
your hands as quickly as possible okay

00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:46,770
with you Peter yep awesome and in the

00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:48,450
next is standards and compliance what 96

00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:50,550
words does for you to use the 96 board's

00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:54,329
name is your board goes through a series

00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:56,520
of compliance checks now in the past

00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:59,760
it's possible that certain compliance

00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:02,250
has been slightly lenient we plan on

00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:05,130
adjusting these standards and being more

00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:07,470
strict on compliance this will of course

00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:09,209
help anyone who's in the process of

00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:12,209
enabling software anyone who wants to be

00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:16,150
in this ecosystem and work on this type

00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:18,460
of stuff to to you know

00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:21,100
do it easier do it better and that's the

00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:22,510
whole idea now with regards to the

00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,490
standards this is kind of what I'm

00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:26,710
calling the specification what are the

00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:29,410
standards that we need to enforce and

00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:31,780
that is the specification Peter who sits

00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:35,080
on the on the steering committee along

00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:36,820
with many others who are involved in in

00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,620
software in a moment as well I won't

00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:40,900
name any other companies but they also

00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:45,280
I'm sure would love this to happen and

00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:47,740
so you know let's talk about getting the

00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:50,380
SDI flash on there let's talk about you

00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:52,480
know getting the members or the partners

00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:55,450
that are releasing these chips to get to

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,430
focus more on UEFI to focus on you let's

00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:58,720
get these let's get everything more

00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:00,490
unified right and that's kind of the

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,800
goal and so that's that's kind of all I

00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:06,910
have here we're hoping that this will

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:08,680
start to show movement really soon

00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:10,420
within the next few months within the

00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:12,790
next six months we're gonna have some

00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:14,290
big meetings next month and connect in

00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:15,870
San Francisco so I'm sure that we'll

00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:19,050
start seeing a lot of this move forward

00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:19,050
that's it

00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:26,470
any requirements that the vendors

00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:26,470
upstream support that they go

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,600
so

00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:35,110
so the question is is there any spec is

00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:40,419
there anything that forces the vendors

00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:43,990
to submit upstream to so yes I want to

00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:46,929
say yes and no so there's two components

00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:48,610
to that because the standard itself is

00:17:46,929 --> 00:17:50,740
actually a hog waistband it's like he

00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:55,779
doesn't actually cover the software side

00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:59,200
of Italy yeah so while while I would say

00:17:55,779 --> 00:18:01,510
yes and no is only because they don't

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,919
want to release a crappie board no one

00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:05,529
wants to release something that no one's

00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:08,440
when you use at which point manaro and

00:18:05,529 --> 00:18:10,539
ninety six boards offer a big amount of

00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:14,049
guidance right and then we also offer

00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:16,510
various levels of support so for vendors

00:18:14,049 --> 00:18:18,279
or members partners who are interested

00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:20,980
in getting involved in this upstream

00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:22,570
process which in my opinion has a very

00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:25,470
high learning curve and also requires

00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:28,960
certain reputation to get involved you

00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:31,990
can actually work with Lennar oh and do

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,549
and get involved in that however yes

00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:35,740
it's not as enforced this I think I

00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:37,210
would like it to be so this is also one

00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:39,400
of the things that I've also been

00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:42,770
waiting

00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:44,600
but subtly not just me but it like if

00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:45,500
you look at the original hockey when it

00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,780
was released

00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:50,480
there was no source going through an

00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:53,150
upstream if you look at the Heike 960

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,910
it's pretty much live stream already and

00:18:53,150 --> 00:19:00,799
it's only just been out a little while

00:18:55,910 --> 00:19:03,710
sorry the 96 ports guys certainly

00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:05,780
weren't that good to start with but you

00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:09,980
know it's been a lot of income for them

00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:12,740
as well and like the dragon board now is

00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:15,559
pretty much all that stream and we've

00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:18,890
been working with Qualcomm to sort out

00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:23,150
the firmware redistribution issues and a

00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:25,220
bunch of those firmwares landed into the

00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:27,740
Linux firmware stuff now so that's

00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:30,830
starting to become less of a problem and

00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:32,360
Qualcomm is very aware of that and so

00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:36,020
he's dealing with that earlier rather

00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:37,880
than later with their legal teams it's

00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,480
it's a learning curve it's getting

00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:43,059
better

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,059
like with

00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:58,789
two years ago beside if is there much

00:19:55,159 --> 00:20:00,439
required outside of since we're rebasing

00:19:58,789 --> 00:20:03,009
kernels anyway it doesn't that mean that

00:20:00,439 --> 00:20:03,009
eventually

00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:13,370
not in theory 26 should be int but then

00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:16,310
we didn't have to regenerate the images

00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:18,410
and they have to go through QA and I

00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:20,930
personally don't have enough time so I

00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:26,260
didn't mean like a big new image if that

00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:26,260
was just saying yes oh yeah

00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:37,850
say

00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:46,820
here it makes it really hard at the

00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:49,270
developer harms are gonna be able to me

00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,270
like that

00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,980
absolutely did you want to say you do

00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:14,000
that Peter

00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:16,490
no I'm liking that one to you so this is

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,620
a tough one right because like you just

00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:21,680
said it's a specification and in a lot

00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:23,330
of cases we have already seen and again

00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,760
I won't say means but we've seen boards

00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:27,410
come out that just call themselves

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,720
ninety-six boards because they just have

00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:31,610
access to the specification they didn't

00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:33,950
go through any compliance tests they

00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:35,420
didn't contact us in some cases and then

00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:39,410
we now have to reach out and get this

00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:41,270
process rolling right so sometimes it's

00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:43,220
too late and we didn't have an

00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:44,750
opportunity to give them these

00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:46,880
recommendations or push them in this

00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:49,400
direction now can we enforce this to

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:54,430
happen I want to say no I don't think

00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:56,900
that we can absolutely enforce it sorry

00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:58,310
well for that example that I just kind

00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,960
of gave right now so like we can't

00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:02,000
absolutely enforce it but this is

00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,470
something also that maybe Peter and I

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,450
can bring up in a stereo mini meeting

00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:06,470
and start moving forward on right

00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:08,210
because this is a committee it's

00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:13,940
something that's driven by the community

00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:16,220
itself like with Fedora anybody can do

00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:17,780
it or spin if they want to but they

00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:20,300
can't call it Fedora to use our

00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:23,940
trademarks unless it meets certain

00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:28,830
requirements yes so

00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:30,960
yeah nobody I can make a 96 board but I

00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:32,880
can't call it a 96 board unless I've

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,860
gone through this process or I'm opening

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,630
I would assume I mean this is a

00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:38,280
tournament a lawyer no you're right oh

00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:39,750
that's however entirely like you know a

00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:43,170
little bit more legal attention yeah

00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:47,460
yeah I think one of the keys is that

00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:49,680
work I work for Romero so on we are a

00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:51,750
software company we're not trying to be

00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:53,700
a hardware company it's a hardware

00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:56,100
aspect that we've come up with to

00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:59,490
basically support the software community

00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:01,980
so we invest not just Robert but we have

00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:04,110
a lot of our greatest software people

00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:07,250
working with the United States towards

00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:07,250
the private do so

00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,870
so this is a good point gonna lick what

00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,670
I just said right now is that you know

00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:19,690
it's hard for us to enforce all of these

00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:21,610
things because we're not a hardware

00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:24,430
company we are a software company at its

00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:26,710
core right so at the end of the day if a

00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:28,480
board doesn't want to be successful then

00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:30,520
they will probably do those things if a

00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,290
board wants to be successful then they

00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,880
will do the right thing they'll open as

00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:35,410
much as possible and that's something

00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,880
that we can control however we can't

00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:39,670
push our recommendations on them and

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:42,580
we'll try our best but you're going to

00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:44,170
have 96 boards that are more prominent

00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:56,250
in the ecosystem and you're gonna have

00:23:44,170 --> 00:24:01,600
96 words that are less prominent rated

00:23:56,250 --> 00:24:02,590
GPUs and now like from my slide deck for

00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,290
tomorrow

00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:07,990
there's we've got four or five that are

00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:11,050
supported 96 ports case

00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:13,140
dragon board one is probably one of the

00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:15,670
success stories they're thanking wrong

00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:20,160
with regards to the breed Reno you

00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:24,220
driver for certain other major the

00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:27,940
manufacturer that sells display IP that

00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:29,800
they haven't opened up well it's which

00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,820
is shipped on a couple of the other

00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:35,490
ninety-six board

00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:35,490
platforms is

00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,860
I mean ultimately they're getting beaten

00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:42,440
from every side and the agent sauce

00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:45,590
community about it and and Lester and

00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:48,350
there's not a lot unless we get someone

00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:51,529
like Rob that reverse engineers at and

00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:55,039
you know and at the last connect there

00:24:51,529 --> 00:24:57,889
was discussions about that and they're

00:24:55,039 --> 00:25:00,830
closed source blobs are a bit easier to

00:24:57,889 --> 00:25:03,830
use with Weiland which means we can

00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:08,210
probably use them in rpm fusion with

00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:12,769
less stress similar to the Nvidia like

00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:15,350
binary blobs for x86 which is not ideal

00:25:12,769 --> 00:25:17,360
by any stretch of the imagination like I

00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:18,889
would just like another I'd like to find

00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:24,769
Rob three or four times to be able to

00:25:18,889 --> 00:25:26,720
that other problem but but it not not in

00:25:24,769 --> 00:25:29,210
that particular vendors case but there's

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,330
other situations where like that etna

00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:33,799
p.m. and the freed Reno driver

00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:35,629
Broadcom finally got the message with

00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:39,259
the raspberries part of at least a four

00:25:35,629 --> 00:25:43,129
driver so the ecosystem there is slowly

00:25:39,259 --> 00:25:47,299
improving I'm kind of looking on with

00:25:43,129 --> 00:25:51,159
interests from imagination which open

00:25:47,299 --> 00:25:51,159
owns the how are they are

00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:57,270
stuff given that they've now lost Apple

00:25:53,649 --> 00:26:00,250
as a customer and and somewhere you like

00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:03,070
maybe daivam start to care about Linux

00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:04,419
just simply because it then becomes a

00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:07,559
key part of their revenue because they

00:26:04,419 --> 00:26:09,730
don't have the cash card with its Apple

00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:12,460
yeah it's hard

00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:14,440
it hasn't got that it has got better

00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:19,230
except for one or two particular vendors

00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:19,230
where they think decidedly stubborn

00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:27,340
so yes hope you like right bisectors you

00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,340
sir get no you

00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:32,880
he would take the specification down in

00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:35,040
that way because then there would be a

00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,029
lot fewer words that actually were 96

00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,679
points

00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:42,359
we got full respect but you can't

00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:42,359
control of her manufactures do

00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:49,160
yeah and this kind of stuff comes up

00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:50,930
quite often you have to be very delicate

00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,130
with the specification especially

00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:53,900
there's so many people sitting and

00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:55,880
giving their their opinions during these

00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:58,250
meetings right you have to be delegating

00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:00,320
you have to be kind of I don't say

00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:02,360
slow-moving but something that for

00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,280
instance starts off as optional in the

00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:06,110
specification might then become

00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:08,450
recommended in the second one and then

00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:11,540
by the third one it'll be an absolute

00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:14,660
enforced part right so that these boards

00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:17,150
continue to roll out and you keep

00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:18,580
everyone kind of happy so maybe this

00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:20,870
type of thing becomes something that's

00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:23,240
optional right now but recommended in

00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:26,000
the next spec well then in 3.0 it

00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:29,410
becomes absolutely enforced required

00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,410
this way so

00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:33,410
we have years ago when all those Burton

00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:43,760
good good good to hear thank you I mean

00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:46,010
the whole idea just literally came to

00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,780
try to win power our own developers are

00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:49,760
great relationship with honor we

00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:52,760
couldn't get the high power system or

00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,110
that towards ourselves reasonable so

00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,600
that's what came by them just not

00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:58,309
sharing Robert and others have done a

00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:01,640
tremendous job of spreading the word

00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:04,100
yeah lead times a long time ago lead

00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:07,940
times cost is huge I mean now you can

00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:12,590
get your hands on boards for $75 IP 960

00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:14,830
is $259 units cost per the board that's

00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,830
pretty

00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:32,860
that's that's I can see in my price

00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:35,170
range or being more open and I'm stuck

00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:37,480
with two or four gigs of ram quartz all

00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:41,800
around the edges I know how to build a

00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:43,360
computer but where's the where's the

00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,840
interest in making something I can do

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,059
that

00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:48,970
so are you talking about along the lines

00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:50,679
of developing something or you know

00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:51,760
contributing to something like the door

00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:53,470
are you talking about developing a

00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,920
product and actually creating something

00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,920
to sell

00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:13,900
we think is a coupler as a custom form

00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:16,000
factor it's a small system and whatnot

00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:19,770
it's not something bigger like that

00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,770
there like a PCIe amd64

00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,880
so you're talking about anything more

00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:26,710
powerful kind of like a laptop machine

00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,360
something that you can develop on does I

00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:29,410
want to be equivalent to my workstation

00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:52,720
yes

00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:58,240
okay so where's the actual silicon at

00:29:52,720 --> 00:30:01,050
the moment and speeds are going down I

00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,050
don't know

00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:25,510
I suspect yeah and like the 96 Ford II

00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:36,040
has a micro ATX mini ATX option as part

00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:39,180
of the spec yeah so so yeah so all I can

00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:42,280
say with regards to that is stay tuned

00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:43,450
I'm you know like Peter said you might

00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:46,210
see something in the next few months

00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:55,050
it's it's it is definitely a high

00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:56,790
interest so but you know

00:30:55,050 --> 00:31:14,190
the chips are becoming more widely

00:30:56,790 --> 00:31:32,760
available I mean like doing that you

00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:35,730
know I'm sure and give them Aquinas said

00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:42,440
like if I wants to be successful they

00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:46,230
need to the Windows 10 laptop which is a

00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:51,660
Qualcomm I'm 35 is a really really nice

00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:54,410
SOC and I know it runs UEFI out of the

00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:57,720
box but if it's anything like the last

00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:59,820
Microsoft attempt at arm they use secure

00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:02,910
boot to lock it down only both Microsoft

00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:04,590
os's I've been poking around trying to

00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:10,980
get an answer to see whether that would

00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:14,010
be the case this time as well but like

00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:17,360
so the Qualcomm 835 with UEFI would be

00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:17,360
an awesome 96 port

00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:26,380
because you know that that is like no

00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:36,850
equivalent of current gain intel spec

00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:40,380
with really nice graphics and and in

00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:40,380
