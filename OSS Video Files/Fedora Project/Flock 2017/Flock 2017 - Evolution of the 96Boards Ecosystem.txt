Talk: Evolution of the 96Boards Ecosystem
Presenter: Robert D Wolff

Description:
96Boards is a range of hardware specifications developed by Linaro and the 96Boards member companies to make the latest ARM-based processors available to developers at a reasonable cost, in a standard form factor. Since it's launch in 2015, a strong community has surfaced and fed into our growing ecosystem. This talk will summarize some of 96Boards' greatest milestones and achievements, while focusing on the future growth of our vibrant community. From 96Boards Distribution and Mezzanine enablement to creating and maintaining open support and diverse community outreach channels, 96Boards has always tried to promote a lasting and positive experience for anyone involved.
