fields the engineering Fedora

00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:15,059
engineering manager and I'm Rui lunch

00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,220
notably from the Fedora engineering team

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:19,859
also the design team in many other

00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,920
places as well and from the Fedora

00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:24,810
magazine yeah so so we both work on the

00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,920
Fedora magazine and entering the room

00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:29,400
right now - great applause that's

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,020
excellent

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:35,579
this is Justin Florrie who is our hello

00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:37,890
editor-in-chief editor-in-chief of the

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:39,600
magazine so yeah I'm gonna pass this

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,750
over to you but I thought for like maybe

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,489
just for a minute we can describe for

00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:46,200
those who aren't familiar actually is

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:50,520
there anybody here who is not familiar

00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:53,070
with the Fedora magazine ok ok great ok

00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,129
there's a couple people so the Fedora

00:00:53,070 --> 00:01:00,629
magazine is essentially our way of

00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:02,399
producing news and outreach for the vast

00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:07,049
number of people out in the world who

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:09,500
use fedora on a regular basis so it's

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:12,420
not designed specifically for

00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:14,970
contributors there is another magazine

00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,680
like entity the community blog if you

00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:19,580
guys are familiar with that there's

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:23,640
community blog Fedora project org and

00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:24,619
justin also takes a hand in in running

00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,659
that as well

00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:30,090
both of these are WordPress instances

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:34,079
with some custom styling to make them

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:35,520
look very dazzling to the eye and we use

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,380
these magazines to reach different

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,509
audiences the community blog reaches

00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,610
internally to more fedora contributors

00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:44,250
the magazine is designed to reach

00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,810
outward to a lot of users and hopefully

00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,540
some potential contributors as well but

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:51,020
we really concentrate on reaching users

00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:54,479
so we're here to talk a little bit about

00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:56,100
magazine and how to you know what we

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,689
want to do to get people involved and

00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,979
hopefully encourage some ideas and stuff

00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:00,979
so I'm gonna pass this off to you

00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:22,870
so how many of you have written for the

00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:25,390
Fedora magazine at any point if you know

00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:29,230
about it and if you've written for it so

00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:30,940
a couple people cool so there's a

00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:32,350
general process that we recommend people

00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,480
to follow for writing for the Fedora

00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:37,000
magazine and part of this process

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,440
involves you kind of penciling out your

00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,489
ideas in the form of what we call a

00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:44,110
pitch and that's to the benefit of us of

00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:46,900
having a conversation between you the

00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:49,540
writer and us the editor team to kind of

00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,950
have a think about the the topic you're

00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,239
writing for and have a conversation if

00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:54,400
it'll be a good fit for the Fedora

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,270
magazine so that way if it doesn't if

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,500
it's something that might need more

00:02:55,270 --> 00:03:01,300
feedback or or it needs feedback or have

00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,209
something to talk about before you get

00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:06,100
started writing it we can do that before

00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:07,930
you put in two hours or three hours of

00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:10,120
your time writing a really cool article

00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:12,190
that might not just be a good fit for

00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,390
the Fedora magazine audience so the

00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:16,299
benefit of the pitch is that it helps

00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:18,459
you also outline your ideas with Laura

00:03:16,299 --> 00:03:20,500
recommendation is is to write like a two

00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:22,510
to three sentence summary for what your

00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,580
article will be about what the the point

00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:26,620
of it is what you're trying to do to

00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:29,950
teach people and then to have like a

00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:31,420
bullet point list like intro and like a

00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:33,640
couple points like the body of what

00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:35,769
you're trying to cover and then just to

00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,530
kind of like have a an idea of what

00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:40,239
you're trying to do pencil out and write

00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:42,150
so once you do that the next step would

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,430
be to reach out on our mailing list or

00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:46,570
an IRC to let us know that you have the

00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:49,920
pitch ready and that you'd like someone

00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:51,549
to check it out and we meet Thursdays at

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:56,160
5 p.m.

00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:56,160
u.s. Eastern I can't read the UTC time

00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:02,910
yeah 2100 UTC

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,910
but if you can

00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:15,000
so you can't yeah so if you can't make

00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:17,010
the the Fedora magazine meeting time

00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,270
that's fine just as long as we know that

00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,890
you have a pitch that's ready to be

00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:21,630
reviewed we'll always go through those

00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:23,160
at the meeting and we always have them

00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,510
in our meeting minutes and we'll reach

00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,040
out to you if you need extra feet if

00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,690
there's more feedback that we have for

00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,730
you on the pitch but just letting us

00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:31,620
know that you have done it and that

00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:33,570
you're ready for it to be reviewed helps

00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,220
us to so that way in our meeting even if

00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:37,410
you can't make it will at least cover it

00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:40,080
and get some feedback to you or approve

00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:42,480
the pitch for you to I'm sorry a fedora

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,100
- magazine is our IRC channel that maybe

00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:47,070
it might be something worth mentioning -

00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:49,200
if you've been around for a while we've

00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:51,330
separated out from the marketing team a

00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,040
while ago - so if you need to get in

00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:54,990
touch specifically with fedora magazine

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,330
folks the best way is through our own

00:04:54,990 --> 00:05:02,100
mailing list or an IRC at fedora -

00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:04,350
magazine but so like with the pitch

00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,730
process once you have that done we let

00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:08,100
you and we have that conversation the

00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:14,610
next step will be going ahead and moving

00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:16,560
forward with your draft and once you

00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,970
have your draft done again it would just

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,620
be kind of letting us know once you have

00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:22,410
it complete and then we review it an

00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:24,000
editorial meeting and give you some any

00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:26,220
extra feedback or if it's ready to go

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,010
we'll get a featured image for you ready

00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:30,960
to go and get it onto the schedule but

00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:33,360
that's just kind of the rough template a

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,790
rough kind of process for creating and

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,810
writing for the Fedora magazine I just

00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:38,670
think the pitch process is a really

00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,530
great way it sometimes it gets skipped

00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:42,780
over by a lot of people I think it's a

00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:44,730
really great way for you to also for

00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,960
both us the editors and for you the

00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:48,780
writer because it gives you the

00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,520
opportunity to kind of kind of prepare

00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,650
your thoughts about what you're hoping

00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,300
to go forward and try to write through

00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:56,040
it even like for us I think a lot of us

00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,330
also do the same thing like when we're

00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,310
going forward and writing an article

00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,840
will like kind of map out what are the

00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:02,700
big points we want to cover we'll do

00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,230
like the big headers like what are the

00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,700
big things that we want to write in this

00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:07,740
article so it's really something that

00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,120
it's not just that something we throw it

00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,110
to people at the first point where

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,900
they're writing their article I think

00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:14,820
it's something that really as a writer

00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,200
it definitely helps you to kind of have

00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,940
that full idea of

00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,830
you want to write about because I think

00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,480
even all three of us probably have a

00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,830
process similar to that where we're kind

00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:34,170
of mapping out our thoughts before we

00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:36,660
just dive in and go into an article plus

00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:40,940
as a - like plus one minus one type

00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,940
ideas for what we've seen in pitches

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,580
or the pitch

00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:03,740
yeah so once you submit once you've

00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,060
written your draft and you've let us

00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,590
know that you're ready for it like it's

00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,990
ready to be published I'm done writing

00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:10,520
it we'd review it the magazine meeting

00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:11,990
if it looks good then we'll go ahead and

00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,610
start getting it prepped and ready we'll

00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:15,620
get the featured image done and get it

00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:17,150
onto the schedule if we have feedback

00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,770
for you we'll reach out to you if you

00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:21,110
aren't in the meeting or if it's at a

00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:23,450
bad time we'll just reach out to you via

00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:26,260
email instead and kind of get that

00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:26,260
feedback to you

00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:49,700
so three posts is kind of our baseline

00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:53,900
for the week Monday Monday Wednesday and

00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:55,880
Friday sorry time zones oh yeah yeah yes

00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:59,540
I'm on Monday Wednesday and Friday we

00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:07,180
typically try to post it about eight or

00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:13,940
800 UTC which is yeah I know it is about

00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:18,080
4 p.m. but yeah so and then if there's

00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:19,550
if we go above that then yay but yeah so

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,190
typically at the Matt at the meeting

00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:25,550
we'll go through most of the proposed

00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:27,590
and drafts and sort of map out our

00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:28,880
schedule for the week and get those done

00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,490
and then we'll go through the pictures

00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:33,020
towards the end of the meeting so we so

00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:35,540
we pretty much have our schedule mapped

00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:38,229
out on a Friday but for the neck for the

00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:38,229
next week so

00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:49,019
yeah give or take so with well so so

00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:51,480
actually you know thanks to the way that

00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:53,730
the page is designed I think we have

00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,190
something like either nine or twelve

00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:58,829
articles that sit on the actual front

00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:00,510
page at any one time so if you write

00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:02,820
something it will usually be on the

00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:06,449
front page for you know three three

00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:07,740
weeks maybe more right and the only

00:09:06,449 --> 00:09:09,870
exception of the way we do that is when

00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,910
we have something really really

00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:14,220
important something critical like the

00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:17,100
release announcement right Fedor 26 was

00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:19,230
released will pin that post at the very

00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:21,120
first position and it'll stay there

00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:23,070
usually for two to three weeks but that

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,050
doesn't push everything off it just

00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:26,880
simply means that any other articles we

00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:28,980
publish will be they'll start at

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:32,730
position number two but because it's a

00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:34,709
gridview people will see articles for a

00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:37,290
number of weeks so if you if you have

00:09:34,709 --> 00:09:38,370
put work into you know going through you

00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:39,839
know you've pitched the article you've

00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:43,350
drafted you had it reviewed and it's

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,029
gone up it won't fall off like four days

00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:46,740
later or something like that it will it

00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:49,620
will be on the front page for quite a

00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:50,760
while um something else that we do I

00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,680
mean this is kind of behind the scenes

00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,050
maybe more I don't know how how much

00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:59,339
people care about the process but we use

00:09:55,050 --> 00:10:03,389
some plugins in the magazine that allow

00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:04,949
us to optimize for search engines and it

00:10:03,389 --> 00:10:08,730
really has helped us over the last

00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:11,750
couple years promote our content to

00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:16,079
where search engines like Google or

00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:18,750
Yahoo or whatever don't go we use that

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:22,199
or you know they those engines now are

00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:24,149
are bringing that content further up in

00:10:22,199 --> 00:10:27,019
searches like for instance we're we were

00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:29,730
talking today about one of our articles

00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:32,760
about I three write the I three window

00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:34,440
manager if you do a search just a plain

00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:37,529
old Google search for I three window

00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,420
manager on the first page of hits you're

00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:41,670
gonna find the Fodor magazine article on

00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,649
I three even though there are hundreds

00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:45,779
of articles out there about I three and

00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:48,240
how to use it we're on the front page

00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:49,439
for I three hits and I think one of the

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,329
reasons for that well I think there's a

00:10:49,439 --> 00:10:53,340
couple reasons for that one of those one

00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:56,540
of them is was a fantastic order

00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:58,890
I think was at William Moreno wrote that

00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:01,440
fantastic he wrote a fantastic article

00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:03,690
it's got screenshots it's really good

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,700
explanations it's got lots of links it's

00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:08,520
it's something that you know was hasn't

00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:10,170
just has great content but one of the

00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,420
other reasons I think is because you

00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:14,430
know we also as editors you know we take

00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:17,490
a look at things like search engine

00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:20,250
optimization right SEO and we tuned the

00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:22,500
article so that it gets a good score for

00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:24,210
SEO there are tools that let us do that

00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,880
and that way it helps promote that

00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:28,950
article and keep it moving higher in in

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:32,190
Google page rankings so that's another

00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:34,980
way of continuing to drive traffic to

00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:36,750
the fit aware magazine so we hope with

00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,760
that we don't we don't require authors

00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,200
to do any of that we don't require you

00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,390
to know how to do any of that we take

00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,980
care of that on the on the back end now

00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:45,840
we're always happy to teach people about

00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:48,300
it though that's fine we're happy to do

00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:51,830
that as well but we don't require any

00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,830
authors to deal with that stuff

00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:09,339
so well so the question was about

00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,870
critical posts how do we how do we if

00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:12,880
there's a post that needs to go out with

00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:15,010
a deadline well of course we prefer that

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,029
you let us know you know a few weeks

00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:17,560
ahead of time

00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:21,610
right so that we can actually work it

00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:23,649
into our schedule we can do that in a

00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:25,959
number of ways you can do it you know

00:12:23,649 --> 00:12:28,690
again notifying us via IRC a pound

00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:32,170
Fedora magazine on the mailing list

00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:33,459
which is magazine at lists not FPO yeah

00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:35,110
oh you know you can always feel free to

00:12:33,459 --> 00:12:38,139
get and get in touch with us on either

00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:39,880
those places and you know we can publish

00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:41,829
things with deadlines I think one of the

00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,959
important considerations here though is

00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:45,880
again thinking about the focus for the

00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:48,160
magazine right which is not on

00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,680
contributors who typically we might send

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,350
deadlines for right our focus is on more

00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,970
on users and the general public so it's

00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:56,769
I think that's usually that's an unusual

00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:59,050
occurrence for us to have deadlines

00:12:56,769 --> 00:13:02,800
related posts other than maybe you know

00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:05,920
the release announcements or right

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,899
classrooms which are timed events right

00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,089
we've been yeah we've been publishing

00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:11,860
those regularly right anything that's

00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:13,750
that's targeted to users though if it's

00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:16,180
if it's time-sensitive you know we just

00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:18,190
simply asked that you you know let us

00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:20,949
know ahead of time and we'll work it

00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:24,430
into our schedule so as we've done for

00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:25,779
for those series so so let me um I guess

00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,250
let's let's move forward and talk

00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:28,870
because you know we really would do want

00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,880
to motivate this conversation towards

00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:34,230
you know maybe a discussion of some

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:36,970
ideas you know just talking about

00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:39,880
pitches you know that that's really the

00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:43,329
first step one of our goals I think in

00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:46,740
having this session is to invite ideas

00:13:43,329 --> 00:13:49,510
from the folks who are here about

00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:52,510
content that we might want to put

00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:55,269
together for future for future magazine

00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:57,220
articles or series and so before we do

00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:58,899
that you know we were talking at lunch

00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:01,810
today and I thought it might be a good

00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:05,139
idea for us to give a couple examples of

00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:08,860
the kind of the the kind of factors that

00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:11,829
that lead to pitches being approved or

00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:13,269
pitches being turned down by the

00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:16,149
editorial staff because we didn't want

00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:17,319
that to be a confusing issue like how do

00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:17,860
you know if your pitch is going to be

00:14:17,319 --> 00:14:19,630
approved

00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:21,100
hey my pitch was approved or my pitch

00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:24,340
was turned down and this other person's

00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,960
was approved why was that and there's a

00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:28,660
few reasons that we kind of mapped out

00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:31,780
earlier today one of them was scope

00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:34,330
right so what works great for the

00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:35,830
magazine and I think Ryan said something

00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:37,930
about this a few just a few minutes ago

00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:40,870
which is you know you'll focus you know

00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:45,730
focusing the articles on a topic is

00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:49,780
really helpful so for example a pitch on

00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:52,660
let's say a pitch on hey I'm gonna

00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:56,080
explain container technology that is a

00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:58,810
very very broad topic and it's highly

00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:01,000
unlikely that an article that is short

00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:03,070
enough for people to read in a venue

00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,220
like the magazine is actually gonna be

00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:08,020
able to cover that topic right but if

00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:10,270
someone were coming to say hey I'm gonna

00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:13,150
write a post that's gonna teach you how

00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:16,090
to deploy an atomic host where you can

00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:18,070
put your containers right using ansible

00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:19,960
right that was a recent that was a

00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:23,080
recent example of a pitch that we did

00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:24,700
approve that concerned containers so

00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:27,160
that it was very well scoped in other

00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:29,320
words it had a very specific goal and it

00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,850
had a very limited amount of technical

00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:33,070
process that it was going to have to

00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:36,370
cover and so that's short enough for

00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:39,390
people to actually read and digest so

00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:45,130
that one got a plus-one

00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:46,900
that's another one so I think some great

00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:48,610
tips when you're setting out to write

00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,320
your article once you have the pitch

00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:52,360
done like there's always questions I

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,990
always ask myself when I'm going into an

00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:57,400
article and that's thinking about

00:15:54,990 --> 00:16:00,190
who-who am I writing this article for

00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:02,770
Who am I trying who do I want to see my

00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:04,390
article who am I trying to help and then

00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:06,310
another question I'll ask myself will be

00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:08,230
what is the goal what am I trying to

00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:10,600
accomplish what am I trying to teach

00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:12,910
these are all questions that help you

00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:15,280
focus your writing in and make sure that

00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:16,870
you're writing to your target audience

00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,610
when you know who you're writing for

00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,960
when you know the goals of what you're

00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:22,060
trying to write about if you're trying

00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,710
to teach something you're trying to show

00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:25,750
someone how to deploy something or

00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:28,000
inform someone about something happening

00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:29,500
when you can answer those questions and

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,450
think about them when you're writing it

00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,760
help it has a huge impact

00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:35,470
the quality of the writing that you're

00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,000
putting out because when you can think

00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:38,380
about your audience and you can think

00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,380
about those goals of what you're trying

00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:43,900
to do it focuses your writing forward in

00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:45,220
a way that it really I don't know how

00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:48,940
it's the word it other than it really

00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:51,160
does have an impact on you know if you

00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:53,230
can visualize like what your audience

00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:56,200
knows if you know who you're writing for

00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:57,910
you kind of know you have an idea of the

00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:00,520
skills that they have the abilities that

00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:02,470
they have and so you there are certain

00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,600
steps that you're gonna explain fully

00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:05,770
other steps in the process

00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,720
you're going to assume that your

00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:09,280
audience knows because they are your

00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,930
audience you've already visualized who

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,360
they are so you may not have to

00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:15,640
deconstruct every single point in the

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:19,180
process to the extent that you would say

00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:21,940
like if I was going to you know try and

00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:23,740
you know show my son how did how to do a

00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:25,600
process in fedora that would be very

00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:28,330
very different from the process that I

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,070
say that I might show Ryan or or Matt

00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:31,930
out here in the audience right it's

00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:33,340
gonna look very different so I'd write

00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:35,800
two very very different kinds of

00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:37,000
articles so knowing who that person is

00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,040
is gonna be reading and understanding

00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,750
like what their skills and abilities are

00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:50,530
helps you determine where you can

00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:53,050
summarize as opposed to detail out and I

00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:54,340
think also to when it comes to it came

00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:56,980
up earlier about like the length of

00:17:54,340 --> 00:18:01,000
articles I'd say like at a rough

00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:02,980
estimate 300 to 600 words is usually

00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,140
kind of right around like the sweet spot

00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:09,460
for having an article that will keep

00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:11,110
your readers engaged and also generally

00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:12,400
be easier to write I think there's a

00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:14,020
little bit of misconception I think

00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,300
perhaps sometimes where people are

00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:18,070
writing an article and like oh fedora

00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,690
magazine needs to be a formal article I

00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:22,450
need to go in great detail I need to

00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:24,520
have everything planned out and it has

00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:26,770
to be a process and not only is that

00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:29,320
gonna be miserable for you to write but

00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:32,350
it's also not going to engage and click

00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:35,830
well with your readers it's miserable to

00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:39,160
edit too so when you're setting out to

00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:41,320
write that if if it is so going to a

00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:43,870
specific topic and writing to something

00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,740
that really has a spike like the example

00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:46,929
that container

00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:49,540
versus deploying on atomic host with

00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:51,309
ansible completely different scopes but

00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:53,920
at the same time if you are writing to

00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:55,450
something that is really specific and it

00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:57,220
happens to be long

00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:59,530
that's actually not always a bad thing

00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:01,780
so in some cases what we have done there

00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:03,280
has been an article where it is like

00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:05,679
it's a really great article but it's

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:08,020
really long but maybe has two or three

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,700
different pieces in it so what you can

00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:12,400
actually do with that is you can break

00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:14,890
it up into like smaller each individual

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,300
smaller pieces of an article a recent

00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:18,670
example that that was on the magazine a

00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:21,160
few weeks ago was like a introduction to

00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:22,570
kubernetes on fedora talking about like

00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,730
the first one was just introducing it

00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:26,260
like it's available on fedora you can

00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:28,720
install it you can use it and then the

00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:31,990
next article was about using like a

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,780
local virtual machine to test and use it

00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:36,640
on your laptop so that was one idea that

00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:38,950
was actually like a one really long

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,230
article that was that had two very

00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:42,700
specific points but in this case we

00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:45,100
broke it up into smaller pieces that

00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:46,510
were easier to read and we had to end up

00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,040
having more content we were able to

00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:52,030
spread that out over a longer amount of

00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:53,320
time and he engaged a little bit easier

00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:56,290
with the readers because it was just

00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:58,840
less content to eat or digest all at

00:19:56,290 --> 00:20:00,340
once and it also kind of made it each

00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,350
article also kind of had different

00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:04,330
audiences a little bit too in this case

00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:05,920
for like the kubernetes one the intro

00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:07,720
one if you had no idea about any of

00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,190
these things that was helpful for you

00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,110
but like if you had a little bit of an

00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:12,850
idea then you could just look at the the

00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:14,830
local like testing it locally on your

00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:25,990
laptop and you could kind of get a feel

00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:28,240
for diving into it that way so one more

00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:31,120
I guess one more factor is the the

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:34,540
factor of the software that we cover so

00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:37,780
the magazine is is liberal about the

00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:43,929
software that we mentioned we try to

00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:46,720
focus on using fedora whether that is to

00:20:43,929 --> 00:20:49,210
integrate or or interface with services

00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:53,320
that are free or not is that's not

00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:55,270
really our concern we of course we love

00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,919
free software big free software

00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:58,029
proponents but we realize that a lot of

00:20:56,919 --> 00:21:00,309
the services that are

00:20:58,029 --> 00:21:03,519
users care about and use everyday are

00:21:00,309 --> 00:21:05,859
not free so for example we will happily

00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:10,149
publish information about how to use

00:21:05,859 --> 00:21:12,219
let's say 'get hubs hubs CLI command to

00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:15,039
talk to github even though github is not

00:21:12,219 --> 00:21:17,739
a fully free as in freedom type service

00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:21,759
the same with articles that are about

00:21:17,739 --> 00:21:23,859
say using Amazon Web Services AWS not a

00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:25,690
free as in freedom service but it's

00:21:23,859 --> 00:21:27,700
something that many many people use and

00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:29,889
they use fedora to get there fedora is a

00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:32,979
great is a great system to be able to

00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:35,379
use for managing your cloud-based

00:21:32,979 --> 00:21:38,049
applications so that's what we really

00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:40,960
concentrate on is what do the users care

00:21:38,049 --> 00:21:43,119
about at the same time however we do

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,159
care about software in the platform and

00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:46,749
our preference is always to talk about

00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:47,200
the free software that you can get in

00:21:46,749 --> 00:21:50,589
fedora

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:54,099
so for example if you are doing an

00:21:50,589 --> 00:21:56,589
article that uses a virtual machine to

00:21:54,099 --> 00:21:59,229
accomplish some task our preference is

00:21:56,589 --> 00:22:01,419
not to recommend using say VirtualBox

00:21:59,229 --> 00:22:02,830
for that because you have KVM in fedora

00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:04,599
and we want to promote that we want to

00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:06,549
make sure people understand this is

00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:09,249
something that comes in the operating

00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:13,149
system and they can make use of it you

00:22:09,249 --> 00:22:15,099
know right out of the box so I think you

00:22:13,149 --> 00:22:16,929
know just so describing that our you

00:22:15,099 --> 00:22:18,609
know that's how we we look at the

00:22:16,929 --> 00:22:20,489
freedom aspect if so if people are

00:22:18,609 --> 00:22:22,599
coming to us with a pitch for an article

00:22:20,489 --> 00:22:26,049
that's one of the things that we'll look

00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:28,299
at we we we will not turn down a pitch

00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:31,690
based on whether or not it interfaces

00:22:28,299 --> 00:22:34,419
with a non-free service but we will look

00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:36,479
at the the way that the process is

00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:38,469
working

00:22:36,479 --> 00:22:40,809
technically in other words what is the

00:22:38,469 --> 00:22:42,339
author describing and is there a way to

00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:44,619
do what they're talking about with

00:22:42,339 --> 00:22:46,359
software that comes straight out of the

00:22:44,619 --> 00:22:49,539
box in fedora that you can install from

00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:52,089
the official repositories we also don't

00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:54,039
I guess you know the other I guess the

00:22:52,089 --> 00:22:55,809
other note is that we don't we don't

00:22:54,039 --> 00:23:00,309
usually

00:22:55,809 --> 00:23:04,419
promote software repositories that

00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:06,580
contain material that is illicit in some

00:23:04,419 --> 00:23:09,879
parts of the world right the u.s. is one

00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:11,040
of many territories in the world where

00:23:09,879 --> 00:23:12,690
certain you know

00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,820
certain kind of software protected by

00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:18,030
intellectual property rights and we

00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:19,710
don't want to put the Fedora project we

00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:23,070
don't want to put our sponsor Red Hat in

00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:26,100
a in an untenable position for that so

00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:28,650
we do try to avoid dealing with software

00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:33,540
that is in some parts of the world not

00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:34,980
legal to promote so yeah that's but

00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:36,360
that's about it right if it's but if

00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,040
you're talking about software that is

00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:40,530
legal to distribute we you know that's

00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:41,850
fine so in other words we'll we're happy

00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:43,890
to deal with things like Google Chrome

00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:46,410
but we tend to stay away from things

00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:50,310
like say the RPM fusion non-free

00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:52,140
repository it's there anything else we

00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:57,270
should mention there that was about it

00:23:52,140 --> 00:24:00,300
oh and copers we we material that deals

00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:03,390
with packages that you get from the

00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:05,010
coppa repositories we generally don't

00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:06,930
have a problem with those we do like to

00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:10,460
include a caveat that just notes that

00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:13,590
copers are not an officially produced

00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:14,700
source of fedora material and that way

00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:17,130
people understand that what they're

00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:26,580
getting is you know caveat emptor as

00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:29,850
they say well is it well to zoom in on

00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:31,200
that later I think what else would I

00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:32,520
guess what would it be hopeful to talk

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:37,040
about now I guess just maybe talk about

00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:37,040
somebody maybe encourage some ideas here

00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:48,240
so we have one more category that isn't

00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,700
in our official workflow where that is

00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,280
kind of dwindled over the past couple of

00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:55,470
months called starter pitches where I

00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:58,440
think what's on IRC one day we sat down

00:24:55,470 --> 00:25:01,050
and brainstormed a bunch of ideas we're

00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:04,020
like these are great articles that

00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:06,570
someone knew or even me when I'm I need

00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:08,820
I need an article and I have an idea for

00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:11,840
one that I can grab it and just go and

00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:14,250
it's an already approved pitch so it's

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:19,220
basically ready to go it's an idea that

00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:19,220
yep it's good to go so that's what

00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:27,860
thinking about doing a little brainstorm

00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,019
session now to just come up with some

00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:33,649
some more ideas where we can just sort

00:25:30,019 --> 00:25:37,000
of throw some mud at the wall and see

00:25:33,649 --> 00:25:41,470
what sticks and I think that yeah that

00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,470
sound good sorry I'm saying yeah

00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:48,179
from the information you just learned in

00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,340
this workshop that would be fantastic

00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:52,559
for the Fedora magazine but if it's more

00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:54,299
about this session and kind of the

00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,860
people who are talking about or talking

00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:58,230
here and then of what kind of topics we

00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:00,990
were covered that would be more anything

00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:02,399
about who we writing for if you're

00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:03,990
writing for people who are Fedora

00:27:02,399 --> 00:27:06,090
contributors who are interested in flog

00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:07,500
your audience would be fedora

00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:09,360
contributors so you go to the community

00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:13,289
blog but if you're writing for people

00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:15,140
who know cool things and we ready to

00:27:13,289 --> 00:27:17,789
write an article your audience would be

00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:19,289
kind of a broader group of people so

00:27:17,789 --> 00:27:21,120
it'd be for the fedora magazine what I

00:27:19,289 --> 00:27:22,590
think like the questions that you can at

00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:27,870
you can answer that question to your for

00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:29,720
yourself even without asking yeah

00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:32,039
exactly

00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:33,330
it all depends who is your audience and

00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:35,070
what's your purpose what are you trying

00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:36,270
to do are you trying to inform someone

00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:38,010
about how to write for the fedora

00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:39,899
magazine or are you trying to inform

00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:42,230
someone about what was being covered

00:27:39,899 --> 00:27:42,230
here

00:27:55,250 --> 00:28:00,080
see that is where the line sort of we

00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,850
sometimes straddle the line on the

00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:05,690
Fedora magazine because especially for

00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:07,960
sort of entry-level community where we

00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:11,150
actually want more people to come in

00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:14,120
yeah so you can yeah that's where it's

00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:15,860
it can get a slightly blurry but then

00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:17,780
there's other other posts where you like

00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:19,880
yeah that's definitely community blog so

00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:21,620
I think there's been a few that we have

00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:24,260
gone through where it's sort of on the

00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:28,010
line it's like you try to frame it as

00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:30,799
hey are you not it's to the non

00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:40,730
contributor becoming a contributor more

00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:42,890
than a current contributor so and then

00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:45,020
we also sort of try to limit the number

00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:49,159
of those posts because we know that the

00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:52,880
majority of our audience is not really

00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:55,039
gonna gonna care that much so they care

00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:58,059
more about tips about fedora so and then

00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,059
if we can

00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:26,380
it's got some ideas writing about or

00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:27,460
teaching other people that's definitely

00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,990
something that we'd love to have your

00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,980
input on or anything you think that

00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:31,929
you've been kind of like on the fence

00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:33,630
about or if there's something that you

00:29:31,929 --> 00:29:35,559
just think that you could talk about

00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:37,030
this would really be a great time for

00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:40,630
you to get feedback on those ideas too

00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:42,340
if you have any or we can also kind of

00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:43,390
talk about just general starter pitches

00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:45,190
like one of the things that we just

00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:47,590
tried doing it as an experiment a few

00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:49,330
weeks ago on the magazine I don't if any

00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:50,590
of you read open source calm but you

00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:53,440
might see some of these articles like

00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:55,480
the top five terminal emulators on Linux

00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,880
or the best one of the ones that we just

00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:00,100
ran not too long it was like four fonts

00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:03,160
for four mono space fonts that you can

00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:05,620
get on fedora so kind of an interesting

00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:09,580
thing from open source com that we

00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:11,559
learned these kind of articles we've

00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:12,820
kind of nicknamed them listicle articles

00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:14,049
yeah actually three ways to trick out

00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:16,809
your terminal emulator that's a great

00:30:14,049 --> 00:30:23,230
example these kind of like listicle

00:30:16,809 --> 00:30:26,650
articles are actually yeah they actually

00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:29,559
have a really great engagement with

00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:31,419
readers and even better they're

00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:33,100
extremely easy to write so if you just

00:30:31,419 --> 00:30:34,390
take a look at all of these so these are

00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:36,220
all linking in this case we're actually

00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:37,809
linking to articles that are already

00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:39,040
written on the fedora magazine but if

00:30:37,809 --> 00:30:41,110
you look at the can screw up just a

00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,790
little bit more about how many sentences

00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:46,030
we have describing each of these

00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:48,640
different articles there's only just a

00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:51,429
little bit higher you'll see like that's

00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,929
just like one two sentences for each

00:30:51,429 --> 00:30:55,540
each of these articles that's kind of

00:30:52,929 --> 00:30:57,220
summarizing these big points so to kind

00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:59,080
of turn that back about things that you

00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:01,030
could write about if there's things that

00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:04,270
you're using in fedora that's kind of

00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:06,250
like key for your workflow or things

00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:07,720
that you find that are really helpful if

00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:09,970
you can kind of think of like wow like

00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:11,350
what argh in this case I was like what I

00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:13,030
was just thinking like what are three

00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:15,760
things that I'm doing in my terminal all

00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:16,899
the time that I think are super great so

00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,029
I was like oh I use power

00:31:16,899 --> 00:31:20,320
and I use a couple of other things and

00:31:19,029 --> 00:31:22,089
then I was like well three things you

00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,969
can do to customize your terminal

00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:25,929
interface I think of other like these

00:31:24,969 --> 00:31:27,369
are the kind of things that would also

00:31:25,929 --> 00:31:28,539
be really great to brainstorm to if

00:31:27,369 --> 00:31:29,889
there's like if you can think of like a

00:31:28,539 --> 00:31:32,830
number of things that you're using

00:31:29,889 --> 00:31:34,389
already like if you're using like

00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:41,379
Firefox extent I don't fire fox

00:31:34,389 --> 00:31:43,359
extensions maybe yeah yeah I could even

00:31:41,379 --> 00:31:46,059
be an idea it's in itself like five

00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:47,409
Firefox extensions that either if it's

00:31:46,059 --> 00:31:48,969
like trying to help you do something I

00:31:47,409 --> 00:31:51,549
think also tying it back to like that

00:31:48,969 --> 00:31:53,799
purpose question like if you can combine

00:31:51,549 --> 00:31:55,779
in this case like these listicle

00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:57,609
articles if you can kind of combine that

00:31:55,779 --> 00:31:59,830
with a purpose like in this case it was

00:31:57,609 --> 00:32:02,399
to make make it easier to work in the

00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:04,719
command line or to make it look prettier

00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:06,249
it's like for fire in the example of

00:32:04,719 --> 00:32:08,679
like Firefox extensions maybe it could

00:32:06,249 --> 00:32:11,889
be three Firefox extensions to help you

00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:13,089
protect your privacy that kind of things

00:32:11,889 --> 00:32:14,889
like if you can kind of follow that

00:32:13,089 --> 00:32:16,450
train of thought like it's those kind of

00:32:14,889 --> 00:32:18,759
things that really actually engage

00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:19,929
pretty well with readers too but that's

00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:21,309
not just saying like traditional

00:32:19,929 --> 00:32:22,869
articles like they can this woman all

00:32:21,309 --> 00:32:24,309
these are linking to articles we already

00:32:22,869 --> 00:32:31,210
wrote it's like power line on fedora

00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:51,039
that's its own article too so if anyone

00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:52,269
does have if it's an idea that you think

00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:54,249
to yourself this is something I'd like

00:32:52,269 --> 00:32:55,269
to see like I'd like to read this I

00:32:54,249 --> 00:32:58,679
don't want to write it but I'd love to

00:32:55,269 --> 00:32:58,679
read it even that's great

00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:36,030
so just to repeat that back to animate I

00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:38,250
understood it yeah the idea was to

00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:39,780
writing like a regular column or series

00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:42,330
on how to get started contributing to

00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:44,250
fedora on the magazine with linking to

00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:46,230
things like easy fixes or ways that like

00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:51,720
really easy on boarding pass for people

00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:53,399
to get involved okay so and so one way

00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,800
to like one way to approach that might

00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:58,230
be sorry I don't mean to be like taking

00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:01,170
a over an over role here I'm just I

00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:02,460
happen to be like near the projector so

00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:04,470
one way to think about that might be

00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:06,210
like you know if we had a template for

00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:08,550
that kind of article where you described

00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:10,560
you know it you could again keep it

00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:13,140
short and focused you could describe

00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,849
what is that project trying to do like

00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:18,060
what is the goal of that of that

00:35:14,849 --> 00:35:21,180
particular initiative what are they

00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:23,130
having trouble with right here's in

00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:26,070
order to help you need to have the

00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:27,750
following skills if you do here's who

00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:30,330
you contact or here's how you get in

00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:31,890
contact with that initiative right and

00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:34,170
you know something like that I think

00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:36,930
could be again keep you know keeping

00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:39,540
that short within that 300 to 600 word

00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:42,810
range I think that would be pretty easy

00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:45,270
to do and the scale of you know one of

00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:48,000
those every month or so I think is

00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:51,890
that's probably within the you know

00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:54,510
within the scope of the magazine right

00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:57,150
right and maintains enough of the focus

00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:59,790
yeah and then I I would probably if I

00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:01,650
was to do that if you're focusing on one

00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:03,990
project I probably do a companion

00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:07,430
article on the community blog that

00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:07,430
actually does the detail

00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:59,809
yeah I think one of the main ideas with

00:36:46,910 --> 00:37:06,549
why the split happened was because that

00:36:59,809 --> 00:37:06,549
was sort of drowning out the actual

00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:35,450
absolutely absolutely

00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:33,270
right

00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:35,250
right and we can yeah and we can work

00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:36,270
with you know we can work with the you

00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:38,430
know any teams that are deal like if

00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:40,380
you're doing this through the cops team

00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:44,370
for example you know we can work with

00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:46,290
you guys on on fleshing out that

00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:49,590
template right so that we know it will

00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:52,380
score well in search engines and get

00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:54,480
readership right because one of the you

00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:56,880
know one of the pitfalls for having a

00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:59,910
template is that if the template is too

00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:04,710
simple it and it starts to appear like

00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:06,450
say a course description right where you

00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:08,520
have a heading and a colon and then a

00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:12,120
very short description or something like

00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:14,610
that those types of articles because

00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:18,030
they they don't look like pros anymore

00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:20,790
they don't look like a long written form

00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:23,760
they start to resemble computer

00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:26,460
generated output forms search engines

00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,350
push that away right so what we don't

00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:29,880
want to do is have the template be so

00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:32,160
simple that you're simply filling in

00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:34,230
forms like in like one line per entry

00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:36,000
because that results in an article that

00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:38,520
no one will read and search engines will

00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,140
push down right so but again you know I

00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:43,980
think the our team what our team can do

00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:46,980
is kind of help give the article the

00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:48,300
right the right type of expansion so the

00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:49,530
template looks good I think you know

00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,270
again the classroom

00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:52,950
I think the classroom articles are a

00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:54,120
good example this would you know maybe

00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:56,550
the exception of the title because I

00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:57,960
think we all kind of realized as we were

00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:59,250
doing this and maybe I'm Justin I think

00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,510
maybe you were the person who pointed

00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:02,760
this out that the titles in the

00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:04,620
classroom simply quality guy you know

00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:07,110
classrooms session number one two or

00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:08,760
three like didn't really catch your eye

00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:11,460
very well right so that was something

00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:13,830
that we kind of you know realized as we

00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:17,160
baked it hey we need to maybe improve

00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:18,330
our recipe here a little bit so yeah so

00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,960
we can kind of take what we've learned

00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:24,210
and and help improve that that template

00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:26,850
so so we should said let's let are there

00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:28,200
other ideas for for articles we've got a

00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:29,850
couple more people in here but I'm not

00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:33,410
sure whether they're they're into

00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:33,410
brainstorming with us but we'd love to

00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:22,120
we love technical stuff

00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:13,559
yeah your audience might be like

00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:15,779
hardcore sis admins who are using fedora

00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:19,380
or a downstream distribution based on

00:42:15,779 --> 00:42:21,299
Fedora like send to srl where might you

00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:23,760
know might be like that you know

00:42:21,299 --> 00:42:25,650
developer who's writing you know nodejs

00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:28,650
stuff like here are some cool plugins

00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:35,029
for nodejs editing that you can use on

00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:42,329
your Fedora station that was a great one

00:42:35,029 --> 00:42:48,930
sorry ocular how how do you spell it

00:42:42,329 --> 00:42:51,210
oh sorry that's probably not it don't

00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:53,009
this is a lesson to Paul don't type in

00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:56,119
blind searches unless you know what's

00:42:53,009 --> 00:42:59,630
gonna come up that could have been worse

00:42:56,119 --> 00:42:59,630
that could have been much worse

00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:08,339
beautiful yeah I love it yes so so a

00:43:05,579 --> 00:43:10,619
post that so one thing that might be

00:43:08,339 --> 00:43:13,319
that we might want to think about so

00:43:10,619 --> 00:43:17,099
let's let's let's like live debug this

00:43:13,319 --> 00:43:20,130
as a pitch ocular seems like it's pretty

00:43:17,099 --> 00:43:22,200
flexible and pretty wide-ranging so you

00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:24,569
might want to think about how are you

00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:29,579
gonna fit that hawk you'll all popular

00:43:24,569 --> 00:43:31,230
into 300 to 600 words maybe yeah maybe

00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:33,630
this is how do you get it and install it

00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:34,980
is it packaged for fedora already can

00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:38,220
you install it that way well maybe that

00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:39,930
makes that part short if you can't you

00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:42,509
have to you know grab it from upstream

00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:44,670
and compile it than the actual grabbing

00:43:42,509 --> 00:43:47,670
compiling and installing of it is in

00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:50,490
itself an article you know not even

00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:52,019
counting how you actually use it the

00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:53,940
other thing to think about is how good

00:43:52,019 --> 00:43:56,099
are the docs for ocular itself on how to

00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:58,859
use it do we want to replicate those in

00:43:56,099 --> 00:44:00,880
fedora probably not but there might be a

00:43:58,859 --> 00:44:02,530
specific use case that you want to

00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,990
and out of the docks like here is a

00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:08,650
here's a specific way to apply hoc Euler

00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:11,020
right go back and read the first article

00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:12,820
on how to install it in fedora and then

00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:15,190
once you've done that here's how you

00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:20,860
could use it to do the following you

00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:22,930
know really cool solution you know so I

00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:25,540
like it I definitely like like right

00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:27,790
away I would think like how about how

00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:29,950
about installing installing ocular just

00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:32,830
bring it up so it works in a machine

00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:35,460
like even that love would be a great

00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:35,460
starting pitcher

00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:15,840
it's 456 right now

00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:19,070
so I going to ways like one way it could

00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:22,580
be like if there was one that someone

00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:24,410
knew seven specific online Oh Kathy I

00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:26,690
see that one there like caffeine how to

00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:28,760
keep your like how to keep your your

00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:32,180
monitor screen away that'd be like a

00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:34,640
specific one but this we do okay so in

00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:36,470
that case like so put Billy on that one

00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:38,270
article actually right now so we have

00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:39,590
specific articles on no I'm extension

00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:42,020
it's an easy one I can think of right

00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:44,620
now for gnome extensions to make your

00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:44,620
life easier

00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:12,680
like what do you want to customize no

00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:14,630
what are you willing when you searched

00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:16,670
customized know what did you want to do

00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:18,200
you want like something could make you

00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:20,359
be more efficient or did you just want

00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:21,920
to customize the look and feel or I

00:47:20,359 --> 00:47:26,720
guess the kind of thing I think would be

00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:28,910
hell yeah so like maybe in this case

00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:33,290
like see like so like for ways to make

00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:35,000
you know more about user earner using

00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:37,099
user friendly but like these kind of

00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:40,240
things a purpose they're like it's for

00:47:37,099 --> 00:47:40,240
gnome extensions to do

00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:53,150
there you go hey I'm putting that in

00:47:49,010 --> 00:48:25,810
here right now putting in gnome

00:47:53,150 --> 00:48:25,810
extensions for developers absolutely

00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:45,570
I'll introduce you

00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:09,090
I'd be a really great like a long

00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:12,950
shelf-life article too so this is

00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:12,950
another kind of thing that I think is

00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:18,990
there's articles like so in this case

00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:21,720
like what our introduction to gnome

00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:23,970
extensions in awesome extensions for now

00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:25,890
for developers

00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:27,630
those are ones that generally have like

00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:29,820
a longer shelf life actually I'm looking

00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:31,470
at a lot of easily they're generally as

00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:33,270
long as the project remains active like

00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:35,190
for popular and some of these they have

00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:37,109
a longer shelf life the LX q t spin

00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:41,400
that's an article that be more like a

00:49:37,109 --> 00:49:44,940
short term kind of has it has a shorter

00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:49,470
shelf life on so how you write content

00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:50,670
for something like the LX q t spin that

00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:52,109
you can obviously you can make

00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:54,900
references and things that are happening

00:49:52,109 --> 00:49:56,460
now or like Fedora 26 just released not

00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:59,400
too long ago and now there's a new Hilux

00:49:56,460 --> 00:50:00,810
QT spin like you can use language and

00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:03,780
you can make references to things that

00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:04,920
are more dated you know like have a have

00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:06,660
a deadline but for something like

00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:08,970
anything what our gnome extensions

00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:10,800
keeping that generic like without what

00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:12,330
you mentioned in like Fedora 25 or like

00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:16,590
you get your own extensions for Fedora

00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:18,540
26 and 27 is the way you write articles

00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:19,290
that would have liked that longer shelf

00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:21,119
life

00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:23,040
gnome extensions will be around for a

00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:24,570
long time so the way you would write

00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:27,570
that is you've wanted her to keep it

00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:29,280
generic without necessarily dating the

00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:31,410
articles so I think it like if someone

00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:33,450
comes around in a year this articles

00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:35,130
still make sense two years I get for no

00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:37,260
more than just two years this article

00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:38,640
still probably make sense like for

00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:40,950
introduction that would probably be a

00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:43,350
pretty helpful one just because those

00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:44,910
articles also end up getting go to

00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:46,109
google gnome extension what our

00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:47,330
introduction of gnome extensions like

00:50:46,109 --> 00:50:50,640
that's the kind of articles that will

00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:52,170
they'll pop up there and that also is

00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,340
better like those are really great

00:50:52,170 --> 00:50:55,780
articles too they're really great

00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:58,330
articles because they last for so long

00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:59,830
like the LX q t article example gotta be

00:50:58,330 --> 00:51:01,900
for them be really cool for like two

00:50:59,830 --> 00:51:05,410
weeks and then okay we have an Alex

00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:08,050
acute tsp sweet it loses that valuable

00:51:05,410 --> 00:51:14,080
like really cool factor right when it

00:51:08,050 --> 00:51:17,730
comes out that's cool for long as its

00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:17,730
current it's cool forever

00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:39,810
right that's why that's yeah yes just

00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:42,270
make sure that gets in the the recording

00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:44,940
like that I think you just tell me if I

00:51:42,270 --> 00:51:47,340
got this one but I think the the point

00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:49,560
that she was making was that you know

00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:51,840
having going through a list like this

00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:53,610
where you have a use case like you want

00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:57,720
to do something like maybe you're doing

00:51:53,610 --> 00:52:00,780
development or you want to have your you

00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:02,880
know some some feature in in you know

00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:05,730
for example right and so you can list

00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:07,950
several different ways to do that right

00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:10,230
that's that's absolute like that's a

00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:12,180
that's a great use for an article um

00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:14,460
I think well we don't on the other hand

00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:17,070
like here's here's the anti case right

00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:20,280
though the or the anti pattern which is

00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:21,990
we don't want to have like just a here's

00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:24,600
an opinion article and here are the

00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:26,100
eight extensions that I use right that

00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:27,930
all do different things for different

00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:30,240
reasons right because those are always

00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:31,590
going to be a personal choice and I feel

00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:33,390
like those articles have very little

00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:35,010
value to the reader because the reader

00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:36,480
is going to be in a different situation

00:52:35,010 --> 00:52:44,100
than you like they may have different

00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:46,290
preferences so there that's so there is

00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:48,030
it that's a that actually it's that the

00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:49,770
the reason for the interviews I think

00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:52,920
I'm sorry sort of jewelry of repeating

00:52:49,770 --> 00:52:54,390
again so the the comment was that that

00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,920
actually fits in well with like

00:52:54,390 --> 00:52:57,230
interviews and you will in fact see

00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,580
those in the how do you Fedora

00:52:57,230 --> 00:53:01,110
interviews that we do where people do

00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:03,270
actually talk about like here's what I

00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:05,310
use verses other people and that that

00:53:03,270 --> 00:53:07,650
can also give people ideas about what

00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:09,900
they might want to try right as opposed

00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:12,390
to that which actually has a personal

00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:13,680
face in other words you have a person

00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:16,020
who is actually standing behind like

00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:17,640
here's what I use that's a different

00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:19,890
stance than the magazine like one that

00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:21,840
when a magazine article is published and

00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:24,060
this is a subtle point and maybe and

00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:26,010
it's interesting to us as editors but

00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:30,990
maybe everybody doesn't know this is

00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:32,700
that the magazine itself has has an

00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:35,430
identity in other words the magazine

00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:37,050
speaks with a voice but the magazine

00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:39,720
does not tell people what they should

00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:41,280
use if I write an article it's okay for

00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:43,080
me to write an article that says here

00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:45,210
are four ways to do the following thing

00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:45,809
in fedora but for me to in other words

00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:47,729
if

00:53:45,809 --> 00:53:50,219
Palfrey olds write an article I'm not

00:53:47,729 --> 00:53:51,749
going to describe it it would not be a

00:53:50,219 --> 00:53:55,109
suitable article for me to write about

00:53:51,749 --> 00:53:58,469
you know a factual article about what I

00:53:55,109 --> 00:54:03,029
Paul fields use because the magazine is

00:53:58,469 --> 00:54:06,539
not intended as an editorial as an

00:54:03,029 --> 00:54:08,339
editorial output so yeah it's not a

00:54:06,539 --> 00:54:10,890
soapbox right that the magazine doesn't

00:54:08,339 --> 00:54:14,189
speak with my voice the magazine is a is

00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:16,349
a I guess like an independent sort of

00:54:14,189 --> 00:54:18,859
objective view of the kind of things

00:54:16,349 --> 00:54:21,299
that fedora wants to let people know and

00:54:18,859 --> 00:54:23,099
dictating to people what extensions are

00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:26,069
good and which aren't is really not our

00:54:23,099 --> 00:54:27,719
or the way we go right but we will tell

00:54:26,069 --> 00:54:29,339
them here's like three extensions you

00:54:27,719 --> 00:54:31,859
can use to do this and you might like

00:54:29,339 --> 00:54:34,499
them but we don't tell them use these

00:54:31,859 --> 00:54:36,779
extensions right cuz the magazine

00:54:34,499 --> 00:54:39,469
doesn't speak with that voice does that

00:54:36,779 --> 00:54:39,469
make sense at all

00:54:45,890 --> 00:54:48,550
yeah

00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:07,220
yeah yeah

00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:16,130
right right so we'll you know we will

00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:17,960
talk sometimes about yeah and I think

00:55:16,130 --> 00:55:19,610
when I tried to touch on this before so

00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:21,680
that was kind of a long comment I'm

00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:24,050
gonna see if I can encapsulate some of

00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:27,650
that which is that you know there are

00:55:24,050 --> 00:55:30,260
there are times that we will print

00:55:27,650 --> 00:55:32,810
articles that are about software that

00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:35,600
maybe Fedora doesn't itself you know

00:55:32,810 --> 00:55:37,610
become like the first proponent of but

00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:38,780
we cover because it's available for

00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:40,970
fedora and the fact that it's available

00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:44,150
for fedora is a big deal and maybe a

00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:46,010
good example of this is Netflix on

00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:48,440
Chrome right that's if that's from a few

00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:50,750
years back but you know we we know for a

00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:53,300
fact that out of all fedora users

00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:55,820
worldwide something like 50% of them

00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:57,260
install Google Chrome right it's one of

00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:58,670
the first things they do is they they

00:55:57,260 --> 00:56:00,380
they are used to using it on other

00:55:58,670 --> 00:56:02,210
platforms whatever

00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:03,950
instead of using Firefox they install

00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:06,140
Google Chrome that's a personal choice

00:56:03,950 --> 00:56:08,480
and we don't get in the way of that when

00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:10,400
when Netflix made chrome yeah you could

00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:12,830
see like I'm one of them you know and so

00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:14,270
I it's I use both actually I juggle them

00:56:12,830 --> 00:56:16,609
like I'll switch back and forth every

00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:19,970
few months just for fun because I'm an

00:56:16,609 --> 00:56:21,680
idiot like that but um so we you know we

00:56:19,970 --> 00:56:24,500
know that when Netflix became available

00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:26,290
for Chrome out of the box we know that a

00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:29,300
lot of people who are in high bandwidth

00:56:26,290 --> 00:56:31,820
countries they loved the fact that they

00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:33,590
could now watch Netflix on their Fedora

00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:35,420
laptop without bringing some other

00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:36,890
device with them so that was a really

00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:39,590
big deal we wanted to make sure people

00:56:36,890 --> 00:56:42,560
knew hey if you really care about

00:56:39,590 --> 00:56:44,420
watching Netflix on your laptop don't

00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:45,710
let that stop you from installing fedora

00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:47,510
now because now you're gonna be able to

00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:49,070
do it out of the box because you know

00:56:47,510 --> 00:57:03,430
chrome just gonna support it out of the

00:56:49,070 --> 00:57:03,430
box on Linux right yeah

00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:14,530
yes sir Ryan's Ryan's making the point

00:57:17,289 --> 00:57:21,250
yeah yes

00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:30,619
right yes so to sum up so Ryan was

00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:32,450
making the point that you know the

00:57:30,619 --> 00:57:34,369
reason some an article like that is okay

00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:36,410
with the magazine's voice is that we're

00:57:34,369 --> 00:57:38,150
not dictating to people that either that

00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:39,529
either that they should have to use

00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:41,329
Chrome or that they should have you know

00:57:39,529 --> 00:57:43,549
they should everybody should go ahead

00:57:41,329 --> 00:57:46,010
and watch Netflix you're we're not

00:57:43,549 --> 00:57:47,900
weren't simply not judging we're we're

00:57:46,010 --> 00:57:49,910
noting that you know we know from you

00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:52,250
know just from the metrics that are out

00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:54,410
there we know that people that there are

00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:56,839
people who use this stuff and like it

00:57:54,410 --> 00:57:59,119
and we don't want that to stop them from

00:57:56,839 --> 00:58:02,180
using fedora right in other words I

00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:03,230
won't I can't use fedora because this is

00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:05,119
something that I like to do with my

00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:07,069
laptop and I haven't been able to do it

00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:09,079
well the fact that they now can is an

00:58:07,069 --> 00:58:11,240
inducement for them to stop avoiding

00:58:09,079 --> 00:58:13,760
fedora so that's great at the same time

00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:15,829
though you know the point for us is to

00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:17,690
preserve choice right we're not telling

00:58:15,829 --> 00:58:28,849
people that they ought to use this

00:58:17,690 --> 00:58:30,109
rather than that just as it came up how

00:58:28,849 --> 00:58:32,569
do you do

00:58:30,109 --> 00:58:34,750
thanks for see profit plus plus for all

00:58:32,569 --> 00:58:37,369
those awesome how do you fedora articles

00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:40,640
yeah Charles profit if he's out there is

00:58:37,369 --> 00:58:42,589
he's a god among men he's he does these

00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:45,799
interviews for us like all the time and

00:58:42,589 --> 00:58:47,630
and it's a great great source of it puts

00:58:45,799 --> 00:58:48,950
a human face on fedora that I really

00:58:47,630 --> 00:58:51,259
love because it's always a picture of a

00:58:48,950 --> 00:58:52,579
person you know it's not abstract it's

00:58:51,259 --> 00:58:55,119
somebody out there who's doing something

00:58:52,579 --> 00:58:55,119
really interesting

00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:35,030
[Music]

00:59:54,180 --> 01:00:00,550
so if yeah if we could find a way to

00:59:57,820 --> 01:00:02,500
sort of get get that done ahead of time

01:00:00,550 --> 01:00:05,230
so then we know when when it actually

01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:06,880
hits the repos we can just go bang okay

01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:09,130
we've got a new major release of this

01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:12,100
piece of software or new something

01:00:09,130 --> 01:00:15,850
that's important about getting those new

01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:17,410
Z ones rolling and I think in the past

01:00:15,850 --> 01:00:21,220
we've sort of just slaughtered them in

01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:23,680
between our three more more informative

01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:25,750
posts but this is like a news post so we

01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:29,100
like doing those - other than the

01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:29,100
releases we don't do that much

01:01:41,050 --> 01:01:46,820
sorry Oh

01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:48,230
Mycroft you know I want to say that

01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:50,450
somebody pitched that a while ago and

01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:51,860
just never showed up to write it but

01:01:50,450 --> 01:01:54,830
that's it's not in here now

01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:57,320
Mycroft yeah it's like that it's it's an

01:01:54,830 --> 01:02:03,350
AI engine for like voice recognition and

01:01:57,320 --> 01:02:04,430
stuff like that yeah yeah yeah is this

01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:12,130
something that you're interested to

01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:12,130
write cool I'm gonna put it in

01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:28,900
either yeah is so the question was if

01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:30,460
I'm putting in all these oh great

01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:33,760
there's no internet connection suddenly

01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:36,030
that's awesome so the question was so

01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:38,770
I'm putting all these pitches in in

01:02:36,030 --> 01:02:41,050
hopefully a helpful way and how would

01:02:38,770 --> 01:02:42,130
somebody then claim one of these because

01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:44,080
should they get in touch with us through

01:02:42,130 --> 01:02:46,210
the IRC through IRC or through a mailing

01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:48,340
list the answer is yes any of those any

01:02:46,210 --> 01:02:50,560
of those would work and what we'll do is

01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:53,470
those of us who have the admin or

01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:54,970
editorial access we can reassign posts

01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:56,920
and so we'll just flip it over to your

01:02:54,970 --> 01:02:58,360
Fedora account and that basically gives

01:02:56,920 --> 01:03:02,820
you the at all the access that you need

01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:02,820
to continue drafting etcetera etcetera

01:03:33,029 --> 01:03:37,630
just to put that on to the recording to

01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:39,339
so if you want to write an article that

01:03:37,630 --> 01:03:40,480
we have in the starter pitches all you

01:03:39,339 --> 01:03:42,339
have to do if you see one that you like

01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:43,990
when you log it in the magazine just let

01:03:42,339 --> 01:03:46,269
us know on the mailing list or an IRC

01:03:43,990 --> 01:03:48,700
we'd love to see when you say hello we

01:03:46,269 --> 01:03:50,079
will give you an answer so just if you

01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:51,700
do see an article that you want to write

01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:53,019
just log into the magazine check out

01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:54,819
what's there and if you want to write

01:03:53,019 --> 01:03:57,069
just let us know and we can reassign the

01:03:54,819 --> 01:03:59,349
article to your Fedora account so then

01:03:57,069 --> 01:04:01,660
you'll have the full rights to edit the

01:03:59,349 --> 01:04:04,029
article to make changes and you can do

01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:05,589
all that without without any limitations

01:04:04,029 --> 01:04:07,180
but you just gotta let us know if you

01:04:05,589 --> 01:04:09,069
see an article you want don't be afraid

01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:14,079
to be like hey I want to take a stab at

01:04:09,069 --> 01:04:17,019
this and give it a go the Internet's

01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:20,980
very slow in here I blame that guy in

01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:28,059
the back no you're not downloading an

01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:30,250
ISO right now or something oh I'm on I'm

01:04:28,059 --> 01:04:42,460
on the other one right now I switch just

01:04:30,250 --> 01:04:44,640
a minute ago yeah so cool Oh Mike on the

01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:44,640
Mike

01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:22,320
but the last release was and most of

01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:23,880
them yes

01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:26,040
I don't know if this is coming through

01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:27,750
on that on the screen or not but you

01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:30,360
know if you can look just imagine like

01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:33,840
the trend line here so it's basically up

01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:35,580
into the right the peaks kind of throw

01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:37,080
the scale off a bit right because those

01:05:35,580 --> 01:05:39,660
Peaks that you see are essentially those

01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:41,280
are Fedora GA s right there so that's

01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:43,590
people hitting the release announcement

01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:45,510
which gets linked all over the world and

01:05:43,590 --> 01:05:47,880
from you know on other different sites

01:05:45,510 --> 01:05:50,760
but if you look at like the average you

01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:53,010
know back here in 2014 2015 we're

01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:55,740
averaging you know hundred and some

01:05:53,010 --> 01:05:56,910
thousand a month hits and now we're you

01:05:55,740 --> 01:06:01,580
know kind of more up in the two hundred

01:05:56,910 --> 01:06:01,580
and some thousand so yeah

01:06:07,790 --> 01:06:25,070
was I'm sorry was the question it'll be

01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:27,650
like 12 to 15 a month basically and we'd

01:06:25,070 --> 01:06:29,690
love that to be more and the issue for

01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:32,150
us has been simply finding authors who

01:06:29,690 --> 01:06:34,610
are willing to you know coming with an

01:06:32,150 --> 01:06:37,160
idea and then you know commit to writing

01:06:34,610 --> 01:06:39,320
it and finish their article right I mean

01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:40,670
it's basically it's it's no different

01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:42,230
than any other problem an open source

01:06:40,670 --> 01:06:44,300
right which is people who are willing

01:06:42,230 --> 01:06:46,040
not only to come with an idea but the

01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:48,710
commitment to do it the nice thing about

01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:51,800
the magazine is you don't need a lot of

01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:54,470
special skills to finish your commitment

01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:58,160
whereas you know fixing a bug can often

01:06:54,470 --> 01:07:00,170
go way beyond a a new users ability to

01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:02,960
deal with right even what we might call

01:07:00,170 --> 01:07:04,550
an easy fix bug can often get really

01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:06,110
really complicated but the great thing

01:07:04,550 --> 01:07:07,880
about an article is that if you can

01:07:06,110 --> 01:07:10,250
write text you can write an article

01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:13,970
there doesn't really scale beyond a

01:07:10,250 --> 01:07:16,190
user's skills or abilities so you know I

01:07:13,970 --> 01:07:17,330
think there's there's probably other I

01:07:16,190 --> 01:07:19,670
don't know maybe there are other there

01:07:17,330 --> 01:07:21,230
may be other like social barriers or

01:07:19,670 --> 01:07:24,200
things that are you know maybe we have

01:07:21,230 --> 01:07:27,590
yet time cover but I think the key for

01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:30,140
us is expanding our pipeline of users

01:07:27,590 --> 01:07:33,170
right I'm sorry expanding our pipeline

01:07:30,140 --> 01:07:38,180
of contributors to the magazine right if

01:07:33,170 --> 01:07:41,900
we had let's say for example we had 10

01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:44,060
people who were willing to write one

01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:48,320
article a month right that's again only

01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:50,420
300 to 600 words a month most of us

01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:52,910
right single emails that are longer than

01:07:50,420 --> 01:07:54,770
that well a lot of us do I know I do

01:07:52,910 --> 01:07:58,700
much to the chagrin of the people who

01:07:54,770 --> 01:08:00,740
have to read them but you know that's

01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:02,420
that's not a whole lot of writing only

01:08:00,740 --> 01:08:04,160
you know to do only one a month but if

01:08:02,420 --> 01:08:06,980
those ten people were writing once a

01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:09,170
month our output on the magazine would

01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:12,340
probably go up by fifty to a hundred

01:08:09,170 --> 01:08:16,400
percent right and out of those articles

01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:18,609
every article is almost guaranteed to

01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:20,889
have tens of thousands of people

01:08:18,609 --> 01:08:24,400
look at it right here tens of thousands

01:08:20,889 --> 01:08:27,339
of pageviews right this this graph would

01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:31,270
take off like in a crazy way if that

01:08:27,339 --> 01:08:33,040
happened so yeah our you know maybe our

01:08:31,270 --> 01:08:35,109
one of our unstated goals is to find

01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:37,509
like those ten people essentially and

01:08:35,109 --> 01:08:38,469
then kind of school them and how to how

01:08:37,509 --> 01:08:40,889
to come in with greater and greater

01:08:38,469 --> 01:08:40,889
ideas

01:08:53,869 --> 01:08:57,799
yeah so the question was what is the

01:08:55,460 --> 01:08:59,179
motivation to write well so obviously we

01:08:57,799 --> 01:09:01,730
like to find people who like to share

01:08:59,179 --> 01:09:04,489
knowledge and what I've I guess what I

01:09:01,730 --> 01:09:06,859
found in like docks docks people or

01:09:04,489 --> 01:09:08,569
other writers are that they are at heart

01:09:06,859 --> 01:09:10,549
their teachers so there's a lot of self

01:09:08,569 --> 01:09:12,920
fulfillment from that but in addition to

01:09:10,549 --> 01:09:14,599
that yes we do have badges as well so if

01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:17,150
you have if you've done an article that

01:09:14,599 --> 01:09:18,889
gets a certain number of hits I can't

01:09:17,150 --> 01:09:23,000
remember what the levels are off the top

01:09:18,889 --> 01:09:26,509
of my head one five and 25k page views

01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:29,659
okay so and the first so the three

01:09:26,509 --> 01:09:33,230
levels are 1k 25km 50k or certainly I

01:09:29,659 --> 01:09:35,060
just get the 1 5 and 25k right so each

01:09:33,230 --> 01:09:36,859
of those is a badge level that you can

01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:39,230
get and I can tell you right now the

01:09:36,859 --> 01:09:42,770
first definitely the first one usually

01:09:39,230 --> 01:09:44,599
the first two are it's almost a

01:09:42,770 --> 01:09:47,299
guarantee that you're gonna get two

01:09:44,599 --> 01:09:50,960
badges out of writing an article yeah

01:09:47,299 --> 01:09:55,070
yeah sorry yeah if it's your first

01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:56,480
article you might get three yeah so yeah

01:09:55,070 --> 01:09:57,920
there are badges in fact we probably

01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:59,270
ought to set up some other ones now that

01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:01,040
the some of these articles have been

01:09:59,270 --> 01:10:02,810
around long enough they've gathered more

01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:04,219
page views we probably ought to think

01:10:02,810 --> 01:10:06,730
about setting up like a fifty and a

01:10:04,219 --> 01:10:06,730
hundred K

01:10:13,570 --> 01:10:28,490
yeah yeah so that's a great place to

01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:37,790
kind of make sure that you have a level

01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:39,230
like yeah so oh sorry for that so for

01:10:37,790 --> 01:10:41,030
the mic we were just having we were just

01:10:39,230 --> 01:10:43,550
saying that there's there's definitely a

01:10:41,030 --> 01:10:45,260
distribution of page view number of page

01:10:43,550 --> 01:10:46,790
views for articles and justin has done

01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:48,290
some research on the articles over the

01:10:46,790 --> 01:10:52,310
last eight months and that might

01:10:48,290 --> 01:10:54,230
basically lead us to add some extra

01:10:52,310 --> 01:10:58,330
badge levels as well right where we

01:10:54,230 --> 01:10:58,330
could have have some other inducements

01:11:06,380 --> 01:11:10,760
oh you know what might worth it might be

01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:13,220
worth noting here some of our referrals

01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:15,500
as well right you can tell that like

01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:19,400
search engines for example number one

01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:24,440
referral is Google search by a factor of

01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:27,110
a gazillion but we also get hits from

01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:29,080
duck duck Oh Bing apparently someone

01:11:27,110 --> 01:11:31,760
uses that I guess

01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:36,110
Yandex I don't even know that was a

01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:37,910
thing I have no idea why AT&T has their

01:11:36,110 --> 01:11:41,110
own search engine referral but thank you

01:11:37,910 --> 01:11:43,550
guys thank you AT&T for that one hit

01:11:41,110 --> 01:11:45,230
also we get a lot of hits from start

01:11:43,550 --> 01:11:47,000
dolphin or project org which is why

01:11:45,230 --> 01:11:49,880
start dolphin or project at work does

01:11:47,000 --> 01:12:00,170
not die because it refers quite a lot of

01:11:49,880 --> 01:12:01,910
traffic to the magazine yeah yeah start

01:12:00,170 --> 01:12:09,770
down Fedora project org is the home page

01:12:01,910 --> 01:12:12,380
for Firefox yeah oh that's a neat idea

01:12:09,770 --> 01:12:15,860
so Justin's idea is a badge for

01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:17,720
referring a new writer so in other words

01:12:15,860 --> 01:12:20,300
you refer a new writer they write an

01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:21,770
article right complete an article like

01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:24,110
complete an article through the process

01:12:21,770 --> 01:12:26,510
so it's a manual but it's a manual badge

01:12:24,110 --> 01:12:29,080
but it could be done that that's we can

01:12:26,510 --> 01:12:29,080
scale to that

01:12:51,639 --> 01:12:54,639
nice

01:13:06,670 --> 01:13:10,250
yeah we're getting close to 7 million

01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:14,900
all-time views that's not bad

01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:17,060
considering like you know because the in

01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:19,100
the last how long like three years maybe

01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:31,790
has been our our big our biggest our

01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:33,350
bigger push for it yeah yeah it's

01:13:31,790 --> 01:13:36,820
looking good Maggie I always like to see

01:13:33,350 --> 01:13:36,820
that up and to the right is always good

01:13:44,539 --> 01:13:49,909
yeah yeah we expect the fidor 27 release

01:13:47,329 --> 01:13:53,920
it's gonna it's gonna pop way up above

01:13:49,909 --> 01:13:53,920
the above the standard month

01:14:00,940 --> 01:14:05,539
yeah sudden oh if you guys can read that

01:14:03,139 --> 01:14:07,489
so we're Einstein so that's two hundred

01:14:05,539 --> 01:14:10,039
and sixty one thousand page views in

01:14:07,489 --> 01:14:12,679
August we've got to put a couple days

01:14:10,039 --> 01:14:15,639
what one day two days left in August so

01:14:12,679 --> 01:14:18,980
August is are out of non release months

01:14:15,639 --> 01:14:21,289
August is our best month ever right and

01:14:18,980 --> 01:14:23,719
that's been a great sign right as if we

01:14:21,289 --> 01:14:25,789
can go through month by month more often

01:14:23,719 --> 01:14:26,929
than not in the past year or a year and

01:14:25,789 --> 01:14:29,179
a half that we've been looking at it

01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:31,489
each month has become like oh this is

01:14:29,179 --> 01:14:33,289
our best non release month ever Oh again

01:14:31,489 --> 01:14:35,030
this month is our best non release month

01:14:33,289 --> 01:14:39,130
ever right that's a good sign because it

01:14:35,030 --> 01:14:39,130
shows the the pageviews are going up

01:14:41,289 --> 01:14:47,530
yeah that the question was is chromium

01:14:44,119 --> 01:14:47,530
and Apple I have no idea

01:14:49,119 --> 01:14:53,539
probably yeah that'd be a good question

01:14:51,650 --> 01:15:10,610
for spot maybe if you find out let us

01:14:53,539 --> 01:15:11,989
know it's chromium in Apple oh so well

01:15:10,610 --> 01:15:15,050
actually so I think the point was is

01:15:11,989 --> 01:15:17,269
that if because spot packages chromium

01:15:15,050 --> 01:15:19,550
set the home page for chromium to the

01:15:17,269 --> 01:15:21,230
same start off at or project org and

01:15:19,550 --> 01:15:22,489
we're getting all of those Apple users

01:15:21,230 --> 01:15:26,440
out there who might be using the

01:15:22,489 --> 01:15:26,440
packaged chromium suddenly

01:15:39,110 --> 01:15:45,659
just two more pieces you could throw in

01:15:42,210 --> 01:15:49,590
right now to how to use Thunderbird mail

01:15:45,659 --> 01:15:54,320
filters and then in five Thunderbird

01:15:49,590 --> 01:15:54,320
extensions to improve your privacy or to

01:16:23,530 --> 01:16:29,969
oh yeah

01:16:44,439 --> 01:16:49,219
double was that was your pitch right to

01:16:46,699 --> 01:16:52,900
get there right Justin I think they call

01:16:49,219 --> 01:16:52,900
it a Don Oh add ones okay

01:16:59,469 --> 01:17:05,820
oh yeah that would actually be a super

01:17:03,369 --> 01:17:05,820
one Oh

01:17:23,740 --> 01:17:28,160
all right so we're getting on the time

01:17:25,790 --> 01:17:30,710
that um that um that 5:30

01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:34,120
WSL was coming up so I need to run out

01:17:30,710 --> 01:17:34,120
if I'm gonna cover that than I need to

01:18:04,219 --> 01:18:11,099
wait so is this a is this a proposal to

01:18:08,699 --> 01:18:14,360
do Colonel benchmarking work or is this

01:18:11,099 --> 01:18:16,590
a is this something that would be a

01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:18,989
process that like some any kernel

01:18:16,590 --> 01:18:22,170
developer or any kernel interested

01:18:18,989 --> 01:18:31,619
person might do because it's it has

01:18:22,170 --> 01:18:36,710
value to them I'm sorry like how fast is

01:18:31,619 --> 01:18:36,710
my hardware there you go

01:18:47,970 --> 01:18:51,090
