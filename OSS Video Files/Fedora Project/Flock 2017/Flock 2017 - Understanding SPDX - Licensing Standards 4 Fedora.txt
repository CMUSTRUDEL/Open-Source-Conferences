Talk: Understanding SPDX - Licensing Standards 4 Fedora
Presenter: Tom Callaway

Description:
The Linux Foundation has been working for several years on SPDX, a standard for understanding the licensing of open source code. Currently, Fedora uses its own naming scheme, but there are some potential benefits to using the SPDX names. However, there are some downsides as well. I'll talk through the problem and solicit volunteers to help.
