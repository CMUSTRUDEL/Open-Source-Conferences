Talk: What did we do - Demo day
Presenter: All

Description:
We tried something new this year with Flock. We did lots and lots of workshops and hackfests with more time for mingling and the hallway track. Now, let's see what you did! We want you to show us all what was accomplished so we can decide, as a group, if this is a good idea for future flocks.

In short, come to this session and give a "demo" of what you & your friends did this week. The demo can be showing something technical or a document. It could be slides. It could be just you telling us all about it.
