Talk: What did we do - Demo day
Presenter: All

Description:
We tried something new this year with Flock. We did lots and lots of workshops and hackfests with more time for mingling and the hallway track. Now, let's see what you did! We want you to show us all what was accomplished so we can decide, as a group, if this is a good idea for future flocks.

In short, come to this session and give a "demo" of what you & your friends did this week. The demo can be showing something technical or a document. It could be slides. It could be just you telling us all about it.

	00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:07,309
so I'm told I'm supposed to use the

00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:09,990
microphone because apparently huh

00:00:07,309 --> 00:00:11,790
no no I'm good I'm good

00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,500
apparently our camera is very hard of

00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,590
hearing though and if I don't talk into

00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:23,699
the microphone the camera can't hear me

00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:27,269
so how was flock that's what we like to

00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:29,670
see so this year the council put

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:31,800
directions on flock that said we want

00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,739
this to be more du oriented whether

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,890
that's writing coding hacking planning

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:39,239
strategizing or literally just sitting

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,090
down with somebody for a couple of hours

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:43,320
to unblock things we wanted to see the

00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,510
project try to move forward

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,980
incrementally I mean we're not

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,420
necessarily gonna take any binding

00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,370
decisions we don't necessarily expect

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,500
production code to have come out of this

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,539
event but I think that in all of these

00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,370
sessions many of them several hours long

00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:58,440
we've actually accomplished a whole lot

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,710
I know in the sessions that I was able

00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:04,439
to attend so much got done and in fact I

00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:07,200
might tell you about some of it because

00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:09,420
we're gonna do readouts now which is a

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,670
fancy term that just Boyer introduced me

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:15,000
to and then he proceeded to not come to

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,939
flog so he's not here to explain it no

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,130
and we really do miss that he's not here

00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:23,009
but the general idea is on the first day

00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:25,710
we all stood up and we said to everybody

00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:27,450
what we hope to accomplish and it gave

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,070
us all an opportunity to find out about

00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,650
parts of the project we might not know

00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:33,390
about or keep up with and now in the

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,759
last day we'd like people to stand up

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:38,369
and tell us what we did accomplish where

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,020
are we going what our next steps because

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:41,850
it'll give us an opportunity to figure

00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,680
out what we want to keep a closer eye on

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,420
that we might not have noticed before or

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,070
how things are going to intersect in the

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,909
future so that we can be better prepared

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:54,479
and plan so with that in mind we look

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:59,040
forward to seeing all of you up here we

00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:01,619
all of you is it but but in the spirit

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,210
of good leadership matthew miller is

00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:06,200
going to lead by example and be versed

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:06,200
so Matthew Miller

00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,930
[Applause]

00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:13,490
my primary recap is the slide which is

00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:15,560
an updated version of the one from my

00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:17,209
talk where I had said that the rolling

00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,040
average hadn't crossed over the line

00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:22,180
look now you can see that the Green Line

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,459
is over the blue line so yay all right

00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:27,470
everything did not crash and burn I feel

00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:28,970
like I spent a lot of this conference as

00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:30,980
was described to me going around to

00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:32,660
people and collecting little fires and

00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:35,090
putting them into a basket so I have a

00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:36,260
big basket of fires that I'm carrying

00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:39,830
that I'm gonna make an awesome fire

00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:42,110
tornado out of really I think we've got

00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:43,850
a lot going on things are scary but I

00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:45,080
think we've made a lot of progress and a

00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,480
lot of those things that a lot of the

00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:49,880
things that felt like they were raging

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,010
brush fires before we at least have

00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:54,080
plans to handle so I think this has been

00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:55,610
very productive even if we're doing

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,450
flock during what feels like hard times

00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:00,890
for fedora so that was great I'm feeling

00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:02,930
optimistic about things and I think

00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:04,459
we're gonna have a really nice release

00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:06,140
maybe a little bit later than the

00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:09,260
schedule planned because we still don't

00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:11,030
have a compose today but ever I think

00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:13,760
yet another thing that was broken is now

00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:14,989
fixed so steps forward we'll see how

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,660
that goes

00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:20,810
I really want to thank our sponsors Red

00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:22,730
Hat and rel openSUSE and Capital One for

00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:25,459
making this possible that is very

00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:31,130
important the local team who helped

00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:33,470
organize the local team who helped

00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:38,570
organize this location at Sully and Moe

00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:42,200
and Dave control and David control sorry

00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:45,049
Dave and also the people who helped run

00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:48,739
the event here Brian and Jen and Jenny

00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:50,030
and spot that obviously everything would

00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:52,130
have fallen apart without that Steve

00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:53,690
Gallagher doing logistics and everybody

00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:56,019
who volunteered for video thank you very

00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:56,019
much

00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:06,050
so there's my recap who wants to recap

00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:20,120
their session next all right Steve

00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:22,720
awesome Thank You morning so I'm not

00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,010
specifically recapping my session I'm

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,190
effectively recapping a series of

00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:32,870
hallway conversations that came out of

00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:34,790
of that session so I gave a talk on ways

00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:39,980
that we can that can pull some things

00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:41,900
out of rpm scriptlets to make with a

00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:44,540
specific goal of making virtual machines

00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:48,020
and container images image generation

00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:51,490
more robust and what I found when I came

00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:53,630
to the conference I went through a talk

00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:55,940
okay I have a question what is an RPM

00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:57,380
scriptlet so rpms are these magical

00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:00,650
things that put software on your Fedora

00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:02,000
system and they have scriptlets which

00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,950
are basically the little pieces of

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,450
arbitrary code that our PM can execute

00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:08,840
when it's installing or uninstalling or

00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:11,870
updating yes our Batory code yes this is

00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,400
a problem we're trying to find ways to

00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:15,380
pull that out and make it to make sure

00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,540
that it's operating under SC Linux and

00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:19,750
things like that and what I found was

00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:22,520
that there are there was another team

00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:24,260
the welder team that has been focusing a

00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,050
little bit on some of this as well

00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:28,640
and so now I have a set of a set of

00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:30,860
research that they've done to work with

00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:33,740
and will be working closely together in

00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:35,840
the coming months so I think we are on

00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:38,660
track for trying to get rid of

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,480
scriptlets more or less entirely over

00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:45,610
the next couple of years so that's

00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:45,610
that's a good progress

00:05:48,580 --> 00:06:11,330
thank you who else would like to give a

00:05:53,210 --> 00:06:14,749
readout Bueller not dusty so the session

00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:17,990
that I did was not quite a working

00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:20,330
session it was more of let's teach

00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:23,599
people about a new thing that we have

00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:25,430
called atomic host so basically had

00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:27,649
people come in I gave a little bit of a

00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:29,659
spiel about what atomic host is why it's

00:06:27,649 --> 00:06:31,610
different and then I basically had

00:06:29,659 --> 00:06:33,949
people run you know about an hour and a

00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:36,139
half worth of lab material on their

00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:38,839
local system or in a cloud system or

00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:41,779
whatever to learn about all the features

00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:44,569
of atomic host I think we had a lot of

00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:46,129
good good learning experiences that in

00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:48,949
there a lot of people asked questions a

00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:51,849
lot of people really enjoy the lab but

00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:54,169
I'm also here to pitch it to you as well

00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:56,839
because you can actually execute this

00:06:54,169 --> 00:06:58,789
lab on the airplane on the way home you

00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:02,180
can do it completely offline and on your

00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:03,740
laptop so if you're interested you can

00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:05,659
grab some files for me or you can

00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:07,939
download them from the internet and go

00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:09,019
to my website it's actually a developer

00:07:07,939 --> 00:07:12,080
j'en of the website because I has a

00:07:09,019 --> 00:07:14,300
haven't fully posted the full lab on my

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:18,139
predict production version but if you go

00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:20,449
to de velde Maebh comm you can see all

00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:22,399
the lab sections there and if you pulled

00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:24,050
them up on your computer before you get

00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:25,909
on the plane you can actually execute it

00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:27,589
on the plane so if you're looking for

00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:30,800
something to do in a completely offline

00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:33,529
setting try it out but yeah we had a lot

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,759
of good people that learned and had a

00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:36,080
lot of people that said that they

00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:38,330
unfortunately couldn't make it to the

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:42,580
session but also we're interested so if

00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:42,580
you couldn't make it try it out

00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,950
[Applause]

00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:25,300
so again not kind of covering any

00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:28,060
individual session per se but kind of

00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:30,310
modularity in general we had a lot of

00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:32,590
really good feedback like really useful

00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:36,130
feedback some of it actually good some

00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:38,349
of it just useful during the feedback

00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:40,120
sessions I think we learned a bit about

00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:42,340
how to run those a little better which

00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,950
is cool and we've been talking to Mary

00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:47,260
and and I think we're gonna talk to

00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:49,120
other kind of the UX people in fedora

00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,560
land and see if we can make this more of

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,530
a regular thing where we're kind of

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,210
rotating maybe UX testing so that people

00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:57,610
can try stuff out and give us in-person

00:08:55,210 --> 00:09:00,400
feedback not just modularity but other

00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:02,250
stuff which I think would be cool a

00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:05,440
bunch of interesting things we learned

00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:07,000
you know some people preferred some of

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,090
the ways that Voltron worked over the

00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,740
way the new implementation works so that

00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:14,890
was interesting

00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:16,240
pointed out a large number of bugs some

00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:18,940
of which actually even got fixed this

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,350
week which is super awesome so I think

00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:22,270
that was that was really really useful

00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:24,040
so I really appreciate anybody who came

00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:26,530
to the feedback session and and gave us

00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:30,730
feedback so that was nice

00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:33,700
we had kind of our you know kind of long

00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:35,560
for modularity talk you know from two

00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:38,920
o'clock till what six or something

00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:41,290
yesterday so I thought the block worked

00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:44,320
well I thought that was interesting

00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:47,740
I think we didn't do enough offline

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,350
preparedness you know dusty you know

00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:52,750
props to you and to our other summit

00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:55,030
talks that we've done before for making

00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:58,060
sure everything works offline that's

00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:59,740
it's really hard but it can be really

00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:03,400
useful at conferences so I think we know

00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:05,470
better for next time on the flip side I

00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,960
think we got you know we had a good

00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:10,630
attendance and we had a lot of good

00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:12,880
discussion not only during kind of the

00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:15,040
talk that we had but then also we kind

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,540
of had a panel session in the middle

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,260
and I thought we had a bunch of good

00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:23,080
feedback there so that was that was

00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:25,120
useful and we really like to see that

00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,330
kind of move forward

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,980
and I think it prompted a lot of

00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:35,070
thinking at least if not some actual

00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:37,630
progress on various aspects modularity I

00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:41,080
think that's about it and obviously the

00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:44,920
hallway track is always useful but yeah

00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:53,110
I think that was my read out who's gonna

00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:54,310
go next are you standing up because

00:10:53,110 --> 00:11:14,680
you're going next to you're standing up

00:10:54,310 --> 00:11:17,590
because you're trying to escape him so

00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:20,860
we had a workshop that was trying to

00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:25,060
kick start the next phase of the federal

00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:28,000
documentation project and by offering

00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:30,990
away a new approach that was both making

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,120
documentation a bit leaner and also

00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:38,710
making it simpler for new contributors

00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:41,260
to come along and contribute to you know

00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:44,530
in smaller pieces more approachable one

00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:45,790
set of low-hanging fruit and I believe

00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:47,410
that even though we had a very low

00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:49,750
attendance that was the low point of

00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:52,090
that we were able to sell the idea to

00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:54,070
who those who came we actually got a

00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:58,420
bunch of pull requests out of the

00:11:54,070 --> 00:12:01,950
workshop as well and I think that we're

00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:04,480
in a really good path towards making

00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:07,630
along with the new tooling making

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:12,630
documentation project a viable thing

00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:12,630
again which i think is pretty cool so

00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:29,839
I will call names which actually has

00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:33,680
some of you wondering if I know your

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:35,560
name you can take the podium if you want

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:39,529
or you can stand here if you would like

00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:41,630
hi everyone so in iodine and

00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:43,820
localization thing currently we are

00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:47,270
working on a system which actually trans

00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:49,850
track translations progress for the

00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:53,779
releases and we have a demo instance

00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:55,430
installed at trans-fats dot X Y Z so I

00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:58,130
would like to invite all of you there

00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:59,990
have a look there and actually we are

00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:02,450
seeking some feedback because we are

00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:07,899
getting things ready for federate only

00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:07,899
it so please do have a look thank you

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,029
[Applause]

00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:20,830
it's tran starts dot XY z-- it thank you

00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:26,209
thank you good morning all

00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:28,820
so in this flock I attended bunch of

00:13:26,209 --> 00:13:30,860
sessions on the quality engineering so

00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:36,589
CI CD upstream first most of the things

00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:39,620
and in the workshop by the verdict I did

00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:41,990
a CI for low heat Devanagari fonts so I

00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:45,470
already had a bunch of test cases and

00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:47,959
it's now there in the disk kit and other

00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:50,180
than that we had lots of discussion on

00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:52,190
the local Asian side so I will give that

00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:56,480
John Baptist maybe update on that rather

00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:58,130
than me from the iodine inside oh yeah

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:02,420
so we had a very good session yesterday

00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:04,790
and we had lots of discussions so I

00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:06,440
think various things for the few things

00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:08,690
for the coming before coming flock will

00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:11,829
have some more update on that yeah so

00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:11,829
most of the planning for the idea

00:14:14,499 --> 00:14:22,839
I went to a session on putting tests

00:14:20,829 --> 00:14:24,789
into diskit and it was awesome so I want

00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:26,349
to share with people there is a cool

00:14:24,789 --> 00:14:28,059
thing how many people know that there we

00:14:26,349 --> 00:14:31,329
have a framework for how running tests

00:14:28,059 --> 00:14:33,189
out of right out of disk it okay good

00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:36,729
like half the room the other half of the

00:14:33,189 --> 00:14:39,579
room how many of you are packagers okay

00:14:36,729 --> 00:14:41,439
so cool we've got a thing that is

00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:44,829
actually hooked up right now but will be

00:14:41,439 --> 00:14:47,019
soon where you can make a test directory

00:14:44,829 --> 00:14:49,659
right in disk it next to your spec file

00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:50,919
and put an ansible PlayBook in there in

00:14:49,659 --> 00:14:52,869
a certain form and this is all

00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:54,729
documented and it is not hard and it's

00:14:52,869 --> 00:14:56,709
very very simple ansible so if you've

00:14:54,729 --> 00:14:59,919
never used ansible before don't worry

00:14:56,709 --> 00:15:02,169
it's like a simple the Amal file

00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:04,239
basically indented list of commands and

00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:05,469
it can run your tests and then tell you

00:15:04,239 --> 00:15:07,269
success or failure there's a little

00:15:05,469 --> 00:15:09,129
framework for doing that and that's

00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:11,799
gonna be hooked up to run automatically

00:15:09,129 --> 00:15:13,569
for tests that really - atomic at first

00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:15,939
and then eventually to other things and

00:15:13,569 --> 00:15:17,679
it's going to significantly increase the

00:15:15,939 --> 00:15:21,220
quality of all of the stuff in fedora

00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:23,559
which is very cool part 1 part 2 Red Hat

00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:25,449
is contributing thousands of tests for

00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:28,389
hundreds of different packages that were

00:15:25,449 --> 00:15:30,189
previously secret Red Hat tests those

00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:34,989
are now going to be open source fedora

00:15:30,189 --> 00:15:37,749
tests which I yeah

00:15:34,989 --> 00:15:39,489
thank you Red Hat and that will vastly

00:15:37,749 --> 00:15:42,369
increase the quality and stability of

00:15:39,489 --> 00:15:44,799
fedora and obviously then make that a

00:15:42,369 --> 00:15:47,379
better input for rel in the future and

00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:48,549
other Red Hat things so it's the way

00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:49,899
things should work and I'm glad to see

00:15:48,549 --> 00:15:51,519
it happening ok

00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:53,079
sorry for taking a second turn but I

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,409
just wanted to emphasize that it was so

00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:57,849
cool anybody else who went to a session

00:15:56,409 --> 00:15:59,409
that wasn't their own session and found

00:15:57,849 --> 00:16:01,329
it exciting feel free to come up and

00:15:59,409 --> 00:16:03,909
tell about it that would also also be

00:16:01,329 --> 00:16:04,829
cool but I'm gonna go back back to Brian

00:16:03,909 --> 00:16:08,339
calling names

00:16:04,829 --> 00:16:08,339
should I call names

00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:16,920
Oh oh wow guilting without actually

00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:19,230
calling the name Jana I apologize I was

00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:21,600
really gonna make him come up here so I

00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:23,370
you will be next I promise on The Price

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:27,270
is Right but first let's bring down our

00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:30,530
new contestant because I've already told

00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:34,260
him I was going to shame him publicly

00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:37,800
Thank You baron and yesterday was very

00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:41,310
happy because three of my snails end up

00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:44,970
on the telegram Connor so this night

00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:47,040
saying that we had very old school car

00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,730
with no cause for great models but

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,210
nothing else

00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:53,640
I really believe now that thanks to this

00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:55,800
another team we may at least have an

00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:59,520
update of our software maybe have some

00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:01,710
information in our cockpit to have some

00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:04,950
real management of the localization in

00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:08,760
fedora I really love what sandeep did

00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:10,920
with constat that XY said I think it's

00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,440
going to really improve our processing

00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:17,520
at least saying what what's happening

00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:20,700
and yesterday thanks to Brian and thanks

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:23,160
to David I think we have a fully working

00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:26,400
documentation system that include

00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:29,040
translations so we have a French

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,440
translation check a translation and

00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:34,980
Spanish translation the world content

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:37,080
works including the hyperlink and the to

00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:39,060
change language button so this is

00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,940
something we were waiting for one year

00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:48,080
and a half so it's something that we did

00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:50,690
yesterday at one Thank you very

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:53,930
I'll be happy to show it to you after

00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:53,930
Yann talks

00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:05,840
so I went to flock with some list of

00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:08,929
issues whoa

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:11,269
which I mostly didn't understand why we

00:18:08,929 --> 00:18:14,330
have these issues and I wanted to talk

00:18:11,269 --> 00:18:16,429
to people to understand like what was

00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:19,519
the problem and how we can deal this

00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:22,490
visit and I'm quite happy with the

00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:25,700
outcome because after the flock I have

00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:29,330
or I solved most of the issues I came

00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:32,840
here with and for some issues we have at

00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:36,679
least some plan how to move on so I

00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:39,380
learn a lot especially about things how

00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:43,190
different teams communicate how they

00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:46,159
work together why sometimes they are

00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:50,269
stuck with something waiting for for

00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:54,919
some other people so I learned a lot and

00:18:50,269 --> 00:18:58,190
thank you all who I was I was talking to

00:18:54,919 --> 00:19:06,440
because it'll help me to understand how

00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:07,669
things works in the community do you all

00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:12,610
want to see this that we worked on last

00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:12,610
night at 1:30 in the morning all right

00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:28,700
so this is a first on a lot of levels

00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:30,889
this is the first time this particular

00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:34,630
laptop ever been plugged into a

00:19:30,889 --> 00:19:42,730
projector so let's see if that works oh

00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:42,730
it's broken no yeah it's broken that's

00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:18,260
like everybody just gave me a different

00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:22,809
method and now my laptop will never be

00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:22,809
the same again all right

00:20:32,889 --> 00:20:38,110
so we've learned that both Adam and the

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:42,440
camera are hard of hearing

00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:44,649
no uh all right so we had a soft launch

00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:47,929
of the new Doc's website last week

00:20:44,649 --> 00:20:50,389
mostly because fedora infra is amazing

00:20:47,929 --> 00:20:52,070
and we opened a ticket figuring that

00:20:50,389 --> 00:20:53,389
we'd need to go some back and forth and

00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:57,799
the first comment and the ticket was

00:20:53,389 --> 00:20:59,389
done so that was unexpectedly awesome so

00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:00,769
if you've gone to the new docs site

00:20:59,389 --> 00:21:03,740
you've seen something that looks a whole

00:21:00,769 --> 00:21:05,809
lot like this so last night until about

00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:08,990
1:30 in the morning john baptiste of it

00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:11,269
did not seung-ki I should say and I we

00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:13,399
sat down and we pretended we translated

00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:15,260
a page in the install guide and we

00:21:13,399 --> 00:21:17,659
figured out how to get it working this

00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:19,549
is not on Doc's stage yet it will be on

00:21:17,659 --> 00:21:22,510
Doc's stage eventually under the rawhide

00:21:19,549 --> 00:21:24,440
Doc's we are not going to mess with f26

00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:25,700
because we don't want to like hurt

00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,399
people who are actually trying to be

00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:30,919
users of the door but what we have done

00:21:28,399 --> 00:21:34,299
is we have actually managed to get the

00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:34,299
language selector working

00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:43,610
you actually want to see the languages

00:21:38,499 --> 00:21:50,090
okay that was a little too much is that

00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:51,379
good that's what you get yeah if you're

00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:54,440
sitting in the back of the room I got I

00:21:51,379 --> 00:21:56,090
got nothing but sympathy for you so we

00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,470
now have a little language selector

00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:59,570
that's specific to the languages that

00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:00,889
we've played with I'm not actually sure

00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:02,960
what Spanish didn't make the list I

00:22:00,889 --> 00:22:05,419
think we were just tired so I apologize

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,669
to those of you who do speak Spanish but

00:22:05,419 --> 00:22:10,909
we can flip to French for example and

00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:15,049
look it's in French see this is French

00:22:10,909 --> 00:22:16,220
I'm told this is French it looks like

00:22:15,049 --> 00:22:20,029
things that were spoken when I was a

00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:22,070
child and we also have something that is

00:22:20,029 --> 00:22:24,230
in Czech and this so looks like where I

00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:27,110
live like seriously I go to this store

00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:30,830
every day they have the best roll lake

00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:32,480
in town so it looks very minor and very

00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:34,850
small but to actually get this working

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,860
we've had to interface with zannara we

00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:39,950
have had to figure out how to convince

00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:41,419
ASCII binder that languages exist and

00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:45,289
that it should consider them when

00:22:41,419 --> 00:22:46,940
building we have a couple of issues we'd

00:22:45,289 --> 00:22:48,919
love people to come and help us with if

00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:50,960
you're interested the first one is that

00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:52,249
everything is driven by Bosch scripts

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,799
that were written at 1:30 in the morning

00:22:52,249 --> 00:22:57,049
I think you can see where that one's

00:22:54,799 --> 00:23:00,710
going so I'll just leave that there and

00:22:57,049 --> 00:23:02,990
the second one is we have figured out a

00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:05,210
process for translating the menus cuz

00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:06,830
you'll notice these aren't in Czech and

00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:08,149
everything after the second paragraph

00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:11,330
isn't either

00:23:08,149 --> 00:23:13,100
but we don't have that working yet so we

00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:14,450
know what we need to do we just haven't

00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,100
gotten that quite done yet so that's

00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:17,600
gonna be our next goal is to get the

00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,789
menus translatable so that we can

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,070
actually roll these sites and this will

00:23:19,789 --> 00:23:24,049
also give us a platform upon which to

00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:26,450
help the translation teams reenergize

00:23:24,049 --> 00:23:29,749
and increase their contributions to

00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:32,029
fedora as well the last thing that I

00:23:29,749 --> 00:23:36,049
will do is publicly call out Matthew and

00:23:32,029 --> 00:23:38,330
I because one of the ways that we're

00:23:36,049 --> 00:23:40,059
going to help translations is by helping

00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:42,200
them get a new instance of zunara

00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:44,210
there's been a lot of challenges with

00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,950
upgrading sanada in the past and so

00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:47,690
Matthew and I are gonna put our backs in

00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:50,190
this and you've said this publicly in

00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:52,679
the hallway so I'm just repeating Oh

00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:55,350
shift we're actually gonna work very

00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:58,019
hard with these inaudible team and with

00:23:55,350 --> 00:24:00,480
the various infra and IT teams to get an

00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:02,220
instance of Zen Auto running that we can

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,230
have a more reliable upgrade process

00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:06,000
that's not reliant on people having

00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:08,669
spare time but it's kind of built into

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,409
their workflow process so that should

00:24:08,669 --> 00:24:11,759
get us new features which will be all of

00:24:10,409 --> 00:24:16,639
the things that enable what Jean

00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:16,639
Baptiste was saying who's next

00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:27,419
[Applause]

00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:29,039
like seriously who's next Jerry would

00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:36,299
you like to be on the magic stage or

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:39,450
there so in the spirit of flock being a

00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:41,070
duquan and not just a talk con based on

00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:43,500
a hallway conversation earlier this week

00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:46,049
I was having with Peter Robinson I took

00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:48,210
some time yesterday afternoon to dive

00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:51,570
into the wonderful world of templates on

00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:53,879
MediaWiki and fixed up a new arm SOC

00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:56,279
template so it's easy for us to better

00:24:53,879 --> 00:24:58,200
document all the different arm systems

00:24:56,279 --> 00:25:01,080
on a chip that we're trying to document

00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:04,919
there so a couple hours of work but it's

00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:06,090
nice and Adam taught me what I didn't

00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:06,870
know about templates and now he can

00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:19,950
forget about it

00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:33,179
me too next everybody who talks get

00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:35,159
surprised my undying love this cable was

00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:36,990
left in bash forever last night so if

00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:42,120
you can identify its color we will give

00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:43,860
it to you you know what this thing is

00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:46,379
because if you don't then now you know

00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:49,409
it's a federated and we built like ten

00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:54,169
of these on Tuesday and they're the

00:25:49,409 --> 00:25:54,169
future of fedora stalls and booths

00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:03,300
if you still haven't gotten your SD card

00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:07,470
from me see me after this session

00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:10,290
thank you what it does it flashes

00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:13,130
Federer unto flash drives you plug one

00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:15,840
in you select the spin you want and it

00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:19,920
writes a bootable image onto the flash

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:30,570
drive very soon

00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:31,830
that's on the arm guys do we have a plan

00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:36,150
for how those parts go somewhere that

00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:38,030
isn't here I had seen a box of parts and

00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:40,860
wanted to make sure it had had a home

00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:48,450
next you don't have to have a physical

00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:50,940
prop Laura ok so I helped guide the

00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:52,410
session on Fedora kernel processor

00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,060
review yesterday and I think it was

00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:55,290
really really successful this is just a

00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:58,170
brief summary about what we talked about

00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:59,820
in the two hours Don Z from Red Hat

00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:02,550
presented some details about a new

00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:05,040
testing initiative that Red Hat is

00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:08,130
trying to do to help the Fedora kernel

00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:09,600
Red Hat is releasing tests and donating

00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:13,140
hardware in time to in the hopes of

00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:16,650
helping to improve Fedora kernel test

00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:18,870
coverage there the goal is to be able to

00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:20,010
run this all in a CI effort which I'm

00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:23,130
sure everyone's been talking a lot about

00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:25,110
CI for Fedora as well so this is really

00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:28,740
beginning to tie the kernel into that as

00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:30,150
well so everyone was really enthusiastic

00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:33,000
about this idea

00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:35,490
props to Don and everyone else for

00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,530
driving for driving this this up to some

00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:39,660
discussion about managing kernel

00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:41,940
Bugzilla is just because there are still

00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:46,500
only two Fedora chroma main hairs versus

00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:48,630
a lot more Bugzilla so there are a lot

00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:50,400
of discussion about how can we continue

00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:52,800
to manage this and I think the

00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:55,680
conclusion is is that we really really

00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:58,290
value contributors who take the time to

00:27:55,680 --> 00:28:01,650
triage and report bugs and work with the

00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:02,700
upstream kernel to get those fixed and

00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:04,950
basically be able to Shepherd those

00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:06,780
along even if you can't fix bugs them

00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:07,860
themselves

00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:09,090
we didn't necessarily get a good

00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:12,300
solution to this just because it's a

00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:14,790
hard problem but I think what we did

00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:16,830
conclude is that additional CI testing

00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:19,590
should not increase the Bugzilla load

00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:25,710
too much the hope is that we will still

00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:26,850
get valuable bug reports let's see we

00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:29,040
did spend some time also talking about

00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:31,530
the concept of test gating because with

00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:33,630
CI you get this concept of being able to

00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:35,610
gate test and what exactly that will

00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:36,960
look like for the kernel it sounds like

00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:38,730
there will be some options coming soon

00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,790
to be able for the current to experiment

00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:42,960
with some level of CI test gating one of

00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:45,330
the big things that came out of someone

00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:48,840
came up the idea of doing a kernel test

00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:50,430
day like other things like that so the

00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:53,280
federal kernel test day will be coming

00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:55,770
up sometime within the next month or

00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:58,490
some time period shortly so keep an eye

00:28:55,770 --> 00:29:00,510
out for that finally we did talk about

00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:02,460
arbitrary branching and how that might

00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:04,290
apply to the kernel and I think the

00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,940
answer is for now that no the kernel is

00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:08,790
not going to do our betray branching

00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:12,060
just because there is still again only

00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:13,440
to maintain errs and not enough effort

00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:15,450
to be able to maintain all the branches

00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,830
and really for the kernel is that we

00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:18,090
would prefer is to be able to fix the

00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:19,890
bugs such that there should be no need

00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:21,900
to have an arbitrary during arbitrary

00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:24,300
branch and be stuck on a version for so

00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:26,490
long so once again thanks for everybody

00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:28,070
who participated in this workshop and as

00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:30,300
always if you have any kernel questions

00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:31,950
mailing list IRC we're happy to hear

00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:37,119
them thanks

00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:37,119
[Applause]

00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:55,250
all right so outside of the usual

00:29:53,360 --> 00:30:03,530
hallway track and hopefully this is

00:29:55,250 --> 00:30:05,360
mirrored get back to the oh yeah I mean

00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:06,530
it's the old question of how many

00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:16,160
engineers does it take to get a laptop

00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:17,750
hooked up to a projector usually all

00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:20,120
right so other than you know the usual

00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:23,710
always useful hallway track and talking

00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:28,640
a lot about CI and upstream first

00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:30,980
finally got this running this is a small

00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:34,340
app that runs that it shows the status

00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:36,280
of the upstream first initiative and the

00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:39,140
initial package list that we're tracking

00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:41,240
and it shows the number of ones that are

00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:43,400
complete the number of ones are complete

00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,810
in progress and the ones that have not

00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:49,550
started so we still have a long way to

00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:52,910
go but the upstream first initiative is

00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:57,160
the has been mentioned it is the push

00:30:52,910 --> 00:31:04,730
within Red Hat to upstream test cases

00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:07,520
the other thing huh the this particular

00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:11,420
initiative is about test cases I'm not

00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:13,550
and that's all I'm there the thing that

00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:14,660
this is tracking may be patches will

00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:18,290
come out of it but for now it's just

00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:24,370
test cases the other thing that I got

00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:27,740
done this week was a sort of stopgap the

00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:30,440
the the current CI system doesn't run

00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:32,810
tests on everything because they've

00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:36,650
limited their scope because for good

00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:38,870
reasons so I wrote a shim to get some of

00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:41,090
the new tests running on things that

00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:43,000
aren't covered by the CI system in our

00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:44,990
existing systems if that makes sense

00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,000
it's supposed to be it's a stopgap so

00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:52,710
that the the test can start running

00:31:48,000 --> 00:32:17,510
before the the new UCI system is

00:31:52,710 --> 00:32:17,510
complete yep thank you

00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:24,809
hi everybody so seeing Laura speak made

00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:27,870
me sings that I should tell people about

00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:29,940
outreach she one of the things that I

00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:31,140
was doing so my name is marina and one

00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:34,020
of the things that I was doing here is I

00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:35,700
was talking to Brian and Laura and a

00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:38,010
meet and a diversity team about how we

00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:39,630
would participate in hafidh or would

00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:42,510
participate in outreach in the next

00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:45,570
round ike organized outreach e it is a

00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:47,299
remote internships program for women

00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:51,080
non-binary people and trans people

00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:54,150
internationally and it's also open to

00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:56,280
people of all genders who are people of

00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:57,539
color in the united states who are

00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,130
underrepresented from groups

00:32:57,539 --> 00:33:03,630
underrepresented in technology such as

00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:07,140
blacks and latinos and we're gearing up

00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:08,820
for a new round the applications are

00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:11,100
going to open in a week so we need

00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:13,440
project ideas from people if you want to

00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:16,470
mentor mentorship commitment is about

00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,880
five hours a week in a course of the

00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:19,650
next six months first during the

00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,909
application period selection period and

00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:24,240
then there are three months remote

00:33:20,909 --> 00:33:28,650
internships from early December to early

00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:30,900
March we are going to make a call for

00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:32,429
mentors later but if you have an idea in

00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:33,929
mind or if you talk want to talk more

00:33:32,429 --> 00:33:37,350
about what type of a commitment that

00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:41,429
says please talk to me or to Laura like

00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:44,520
while we're here or reach we email us

00:33:41,429 --> 00:33:47,010
and also there are flyers in the hallway

00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:49,799
and if you know anybody criteria for

00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:53,130
participants who whom you would like to

00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:55,020
see more involved in open source in

00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:57,330
fedora or there are like many other open

00:33:55,020 --> 00:34:00,409
source projects that participate please

00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:00,409
encourage them to apply

00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:14,210
[Applause]

00:34:04,539 --> 00:34:21,109
I'm nexton I haven't even broken out my

00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:27,590
teacher stare yet well I I feel your

00:34:21,109 --> 00:34:29,840
pain on that one sir I was hoping I

00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:31,250
could take the podium Melissa McCarthy

00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,800
style but it doesn't seem like it has

00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:36,109
wheels so I'll stay down here the

00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:38,780
biggest thing I did this week I think

00:34:36,109 --> 00:34:41,510
was to reduce my bus factor dramatically

00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:43,159
by sitting down with cilantro who's on

00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:45,109
our team and teaching him a lot of the

00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:47,629
things that I do or starting to teach

00:34:45,109 --> 00:34:49,159
and other things that I do that no one

00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:50,149
else knows how to do which was a great

00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:53,629
thing to get done

00:34:50,149 --> 00:34:56,570
the other cool thing we got done this

00:34:53,629 --> 00:34:59,840
week which wasn't so much me but the

00:34:56,570 --> 00:35:02,540
kernel testing initiative Sorento ran a

00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:04,790
workshop on that and talked to Laura and

00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:08,390
we and Justin and we came up with a plan

00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:10,130
to run kernel regression test days each

00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:13,490
time we're going to rebase the Fedora

00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:15,440
kernel so now instead of having a kernel

00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:17,210
rebase come in and we kind of tested in

00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,369
Bodhi maybe we're gonna have a sort of

00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:21,050
process by which we made sure those

00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:23,119
kernel rebuses go through some testing

00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:26,300
and don't break people systems we hope

00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:29,150
and on the QA and ghrelin side we found

00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:30,770
an awful lot of new ways in which 27 and

00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:32,690
more hi composers are broken I mean we

00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:34,760
gathered a lot of fire this week which

00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:37,850
was great and then we gave it all to

00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:40,600
Matthew he's collecting the fire so that

00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:46,210
was lots of fun stuff - thank you

00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:59,240
[Applause]

00:35:46,210 --> 00:36:01,130
next so on the outreach side or more of

00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,810
the outreach non-technical teams in

00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:04,070
Fedora there was a lot of awesome things

00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:05,510
that were happening in different parts

00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:07,880
of the project but I think that you

00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:09,830
could sum this up into a cumulative

00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:12,290
group with this mind share initiative

00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:14,360
that Robbie duck is mostly been working

00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:16,370
on and is the objective lead 4 which is

00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:19,030
kind of this idea of being the glue

00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:22,160
between all these different outreach

00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:23,390
oriented teams in fedora so I just

00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:26,750
really thought it was very insightful

00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:29,450
and really exciting to see the work

00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:30,590
that's being prepared for the mine share

00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:32,720
initiative and I think it's something

00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:33,920
that is definitely relevant for a lot of

00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,170
people I just want to give a shout out

00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:39,650
to that session because for me it was

00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:42,230
extremely valuable on the other side we

00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:45,050
also had the fedora marketing session on

00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:46,910
Wednesday which we cover a lot of things

00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:49,070
that we know have been problems for a

00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:50,870
while and it's a limited group number of

00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:52,610
people so we tried to come up with this

00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:55,100
idea of what we want to try to knock out

00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:59,480
by the next release plus a few months up

00:36:55,100 --> 00:37:01,850
to 2018 and this ended up becoming two

00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:03,170
things that we wanted to try to do one

00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:04,910
of which is that we'd like to try to

00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:06,770
have a relationship with people who are

00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:09,470
doing work with the objectives like the

00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:10,940
objective leads in marketing so that way

00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:12,620
when marketing goes to prepare the

00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:14,510
talking points that we create and

00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:16,040
ideally share with the ambassadors

00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:18,260
people who are going to Fedora events

00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:19,730
and talking about fedora and especially

00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:22,880
in the context from might the keynote on

00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:25,790
Tuesday about trying to bring more

00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:28,120
people to specific topic oriented events

00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:30,770
that fedora has a strong presence at

00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:33,950
it'd be very valuable for marketing to

00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:35,060
build talking points and content for the

00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:38,120
people who are going out to represent

00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:39,500
fedora and getting that feedback from

00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,690
the objective leads and people who were

00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:44,090
actively involved with those parts of

00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:45,410
the project would be very valuable so we

00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:47,450
just like to try to have a better

00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:49,250
relationship with the people working on

00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:51,650
the objectives and preferably the

00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:53,990
objective leads as well the other thing

00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:56,600
that started in this session and then

00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:57,110
kind of bled out to a few others was

00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:00,470
this

00:37:57,110 --> 00:38:03,170
this idea of data rot and the wiki so

00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:06,080
for marketing we have a lot of pages

00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:08,450
that we'll get I mean it's it's the wiki

00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:10,550
it's the see of the wiki and things get

00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:11,630
lost and it's a lot of manual work that

00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:13,040
we're doing and there's probably a

00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:15,440
better way that we could put things in

00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:17,390
different places and came up about the

00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,600
docs toolchain about some of the awesome

00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:22,810
work that's happening with asciidoc and

00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:25,970
it had never occurred to us about moving

00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:29,090
community contributor oriented content

00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:32,000
that's not technical docs on fedora but

00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:34,280
community Doc's how do I get on boarded

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,250
into a team all these other things into

00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:39,050
the doc site proper which to me was like

00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:41,450
a realization that like hey like we've

00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:43,940
been trying to figure out how to fix

00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:45,710
some of this data rot and all this these

00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:48,080
problems of losing critical information

00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:51,290
or having it become outdated and the

00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:52,820
wiki I just felt like it was very it was

00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:55,120
very insightful for us to think about

00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:57,950
moving our community focused

00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:59,900
documentation out of the wiki and into a

00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:01,880
more static place in the docs and then

00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,870
maintaining it with git and then that

00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:05,930
was something that came up in the

00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:08,000
comment section and it came up in the

00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:09,620
mind share session and the diversity

00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,120
session and I just think it's something

00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:13,370
that for us it was very valuable to

00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:17,780
start thinking about ways we could try

00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:19,430
to improve our our own documentation for

00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:22,520
our team how we're trying to bring

00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:24,560
people into our sub project by making

00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,910
those things more easily accessible and

00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,250
visible and making sure that they don't

00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:30,230
disappear into the ocean of the wiki and

00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:32,390
they don't we're not giving people

00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:33,710
outdated information so for marketing

00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:35,090
generally it was between those two

00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:38,030
things is we want to try to have a

00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:40,430
better relationship with the objective

00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:42,770
leads and the initiatives going on in

00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:45,440
fedora as well as trying to migrate some

00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:47,540
of our valuable content that we do use

00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,070
and maintain out of the wiki into the

00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:50,360
docs

00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:52,190
we also had the comeup session on

00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:54,380
Tuesday which was mostly focused on

00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:55,970
metrics and data so we've split the

00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:58,700
first half of that trying to introduce

00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:59,930
people about how to get their head

00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:01,820
wrapped around some of these metrics

00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:03,500
tools we're using with fed message and

00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:05,360
data grepper and how you can actually

00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:07,160
use them for your own projects to do

00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:10,160
cool visualizations and data

00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:10,850
I think the TLDR for like the coolest

00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,730
part that came

00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:15,380
of that so if you have an infrastructure

00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:17,690
environment monitoring is really

00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:19,040
important right you're you always want

00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:20,390
to understand what's happening in your

00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,610
environment so you can try to do

00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:25,670
preventative work instead of reactionary

00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:29,420
work and so we have this huge pool of

00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:31,460
data and fed message and there's not

00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:34,130
really an easy way to represent that and

00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:36,080
to work with that and unless you know

00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:38,180
the tooling very well and so maybe

00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:42,500
you're familiar with things like Griffon

00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:44,180
or grimore so this was an idea that was

00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,950
worked I don't see Sachin in here right

00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:48,500
now but so one of our comm ops team

00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:50,990
members sachin scott meth

00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:53,960
he's working on moving or creating a

00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:56,540
grimore dashboard built off of some of

00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:59,750
the fedora fed message metrics that were

00:40:56,540 --> 00:41:01,550
collecting so ideally we aren't going to

00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:04,550
have to ask people like if you want to

00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:06,080
use fed message data for your project or

00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:08,210
if you want to understand what's

00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:11,060
happening there you don't have to learn

00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:12,710
all the tooling if you don't want to but

00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:14,150
by using something like a grimore

00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:17,270
dashboard to create visualizations

00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:19,130
charts graphs pie charts things that you

00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:20,980
can easily see and understand and you

00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:23,600
don't have to know the entire stack to

00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:25,670
to know it is you can see I understand

00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,870
this in five seconds you don't have to

00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:29,360
write a scrip you don't have to build a

00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:30,830
application to do that analysis so I can

00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:32,150
that side of it that was really cool

00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:35,600
when this is something that we're trying

00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:37,130
to work on - ideally implement and make

00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,750
accessible for other people in the

00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:40,700
project so you can actually if you're

00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:43,850
not ready to sit down and write a lot of

00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:45,500
code to work with the fed message stack

00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:47,330
this is one thing that we'd like to try

00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:49,700
to do to make it easier for other people

00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:52,630
in the Fedora community to understand

00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:54,410
what's happening in their own projects

00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:55,910
additionally that they let the second

00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:58,460
thing we mostly dove into in the comment

00:41:55,910 --> 00:42:01,100
session was about the fedora classrooms

00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:03,710
which is this idea we've been doing for

00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:04,850
the last few weeks if you might be

00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:06,260
familiar if you've been around for a

00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:07,940
while you might remember them as the IRC

00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:10,700
classrooms where people are teaching

00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:13,760
skills to interested people and the

00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:15,230
fedora community or to users so we

00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:18,020
started doing that again a few weeks ago

00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:20,870
and we had a like a video conference one

00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:24,620
on open source 101 and we had 75 people

00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:26,150
show up which was like huge

00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:28,070
so what we wanted to do with that is we

00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:30,770
wanted to try to make it easier to

00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:33,020
actually teach people skills relevant to

00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:34,970
contribute to Fedora projects so we

00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:36,980
ended up picking on fedora hubs because

00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:38,300
we had saying in the room and we were

00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:40,730
able to pick his brain on some of these

00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:42,380
things so like what we've mostly tried

00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:44,420
to figure out was like prerequisites for

00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:46,520
things we'd like people who want it to

00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:49,160
participate in these classrooms to know

00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:50,900
which is things like how to learn Python

00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:52,700
or how to learn get like some of these

00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:55,400
basic skills that if you want to bring

00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:56,960
people into your into your app like you

00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:59,150
kind of got to have that knowledge up

00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:01,400
front on the flip side we tried to

00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:02,960
identify some of the things that we

00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,730
thought we could try to teach people

00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,990
like some of the especially some of the

00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:08,360
soft skills I think we're really

00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:10,820
important like how to interact and

00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:14,120
communicate with a upstream project like

00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:16,010
let's say perjurer or Bodhi or fedora

00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:17,510
hubs like having that communication is

00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:20,210
still something that's really important

00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:21,920
for having someone get involved and

00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:26,210
contribute to your project communication

00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:27,710
is key so that was just kind of the the

00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:29,390
focus of like how we can actually try to

00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:31,640
take these classrooms that seem to be

00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:33,830
engaging really well with people outside

00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:36,290
of the Fedora community and try to

00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:39,650
enable them to actually get involved

00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:42,260
contribute and do cool things in fedora

00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:44,120
it's like for now our test case is

00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:46,490
probably gonna be Fedora hubs but

00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:48,500
ideally we would be very the classrooms

00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:50,540
team with the join cig would be very

00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:52,850
interested in feedback from other people

00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:54,410
who would like to try to engage with

00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:57,140
that audience and try to bring more

00:43:54,410 --> 00:44:00,040
people into your own project if you're

00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:02,450
doing something really cool in Fedora I

00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:05,510
know I'm talking a lot but I have one

00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:07,430
more on the fedora magazine we also did

00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:09,080
that on Tuesday which was that was a

00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:10,640
pretty straightforward session we have

00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:12,980
and for all these if you want to check

00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:16,100
out the cops notes these are hanging up

00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:20,650
on the projector to the left and the

00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:23,240
fedora magazine ones are down here and I

00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:24,650
think that's all of mine but so for the

00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:26,510
magazine the other things that we were

00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:28,670
trying to work on and do we gave a quick

00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:30,890
introduction about how to write for the

00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:33,830
magazine and what kind of things were

00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:35,360
looking for on the magazine a while ago

00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:37,010
we used to kind of have a mixed audience

00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:38,570
for what we were putting out on the

00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:40,940
magazine it wasn't really

00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:42,320
clearly focused on a group and one of

00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:44,780
things that we try to emphasize the most

00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:47,450
in that session was on the magazine

00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:50,390
we're trying to reach out to the the

00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:52,730
user audience and what we what we found

00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:54,220
after we came up with we answer the

00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:56,870
questions who are we trying to write for

00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:59,000
what are we trying to do when we started

00:44:56,870 --> 00:45:00,740
doing that we had significant

00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,470
improvement with how we were engaging

00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:05,540
with with with people even now we're

00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:07,580
approaching for this year our goal is to

00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:09,770
hit 3 million views on the magazine for

00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:11,870
this year we just hit or we're coming up

00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:13,970
right on I think 2 million we were at

00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:15,500
one point nine five million a couple

00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:17,060
days ago so I think we might actually

00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:18,950
have just hit 2 million views for the

00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:21,410
magazine this year which is really

00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:22,640
awesome because we this is a great like

00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:24,380
we've been steadily growing every year

00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:26,390
and it was a it was really exciting for

00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:28,970
us to get here so far and I think it's

00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:31,220
because of that we answered those

00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:32,750
questions who are we writing for what

00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:34,940
are we trying to do what is our purpose

00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:37,100
with that so that's the kind of things

00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:40,250
that we want to have on the magazine and

00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:43,130
if it's user oriented content especially

00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:44,540
if you're writing something like so

00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:46,100
doing really cool things in fedora like

00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:47,630
atomic or you're doing things with

00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:49,640
modularity or other things that are

00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:52,790
really relevant to a Fedora user

00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:54,230
audience we would love your content we

00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:54,920
would love you to come and swing by the

00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:57,680
magazine

00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:58,910
so that was one side of it just trying

00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,320
to really establish that and then what

00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:03,590
we actually came out as a concrete

00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:06,080
action of concrete items was just some

00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:08,150
starter pitches of kind of ideas that

00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:10,190
anyone who was wants to write for the

00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:12,170
magazine or you want to write for the

00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:14,150
magazine you don't really know what we

00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:15,590
have a few starter pictures that we have

00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:18,170
where you can just check out and see

00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:19,460
what we have ideas wise and you can jump

00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:21,260
on something like some of these ideas

00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:23,300
where these what we call these listicle

00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:24,860
articles which do really well if you

00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:26,270
were watching the magazine is last week

00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:28,580
you might have seen three cool ways to

00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:30,530
trick out your terminal emulator these

00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:31,970
kind of things resonate really well with

00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:34,940
the target audience and they're really

00:46:31,970 --> 00:46:36,560
easy to write you write one paragraph or

00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:38,750
something and you drop a link somewhere

00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,800
else so that's something else that if

00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:41,300
you were actually are interested in

00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,530
writing for the magazine and you don't

00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:44,450
know where to start

00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:46,730
these startup pitches are something that

00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:48,080
we have for that and so one of the

00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:50,670
things that came out of that session was

00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:53,400
a significant amount of more

00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:55,410
easier articles to get started on so

00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,300
that was four sessions I think that's

00:46:55,410 --> 00:47:06,590
everything

00:46:56,300 --> 00:47:06,590
sorry to steal the mic for so long next

00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:30,660
so after Matt's State of the Union

00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:34,440
earlier in the week

00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:37,050
it was obvious that we had he actually

00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:38,940
pointed out that we have a problem with

00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:43,100
the way the search engine works in in

00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:47,160
the marketplace and so we now have a

00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:51,860
path moving forward to to change I'm

00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:53,970
sorry the Amazon Marketplace so on AWS

00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:57,510
that's what we're gonna do we're gonna

00:47:53,970 --> 00:48:00,660
turn this over so that the latest

00:47:57,510 --> 00:48:04,800
actually shows up on the top so yeah

00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:07,170
absolutely and then spits spent some

00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:11,640
great time with Laura in the do session

00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:14,040
on the kernel and we have some some more

00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:17,070
fun tests and some bigger communications

00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:21,240
coming in in the future

00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:42,010
[Applause]

00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:44,500
next just kidding it's gonna steal it

00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:45,609
hey I just so since we had a note about

00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:47,950
the marketplace the only thing I'm up

00:48:45,609 --> 00:48:50,740
here to say is many people don't know

00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:53,800
that the Amazon partner team graciously

00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:57,130
donates a good deal of service to us

00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:59,740
every month for doing testing of our

00:48:57,130 --> 00:49:01,930
cloud products and some other various

00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:06,910
bits and bobs also of course providing

00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:09,190
mirror services inside s3 for Apple so I

00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:11,020
just wanted to say thank you today Mazon

00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:13,710
and specifically the Amazon partner team

00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:13,710
for doing that

00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:24,800
there was a guy who had his hand up like

00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:25,790
whoever oh good alright so a couple of

00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,070
things that I was involved with this

00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:30,560
week first off was a workshop Jeff

00:49:28,070 --> 00:49:32,540
burkas and I as representatives of the

00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:34,820
atomic working group put on a workshop

00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:38,420
of how to become a container maintainer

00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:41,270
for the layered image rebuild system we

00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:43,880
did a really good example of a review

00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:45,080
that was currently has been in waiting

00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:49,220
for a while and we were able to go

00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:50,630
through and apply the current guidelines

00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:51,920
to it and actually go through kind of a

00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:53,960
formal review with everybody and I think

00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:57,050
we got like probably about 18 people

00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:58,940
that paired up and went through and

00:49:57,050 --> 00:50:01,790
created a container and then peer

00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:02,840
reviewed with with somebody else so we

00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:05,840
had people going through the process

00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:07,880
which was great nothing in the the

00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:10,580
infrastructure working group run by

00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:14,990
Kevin Finzi I had an opportunity to

00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:17,540
speak with a few people about our plans

00:50:14,990 --> 00:50:20,750
moving forward to bring flat-pack and an

00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:22,640
OSI I based images into the build cycle

00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:25,550
as well as a way to host that in our

00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:27,140
registry so that should probably shaking

00:50:25,550 --> 00:50:29,290
out maybe later today during the

00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:32,680
hackfest or over the next couple weeks

00:50:29,290 --> 00:50:35,270
we'll likely see that stuff'll and soon

00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:38,330
also working on the container layered

00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:39,860
image itself Patrick and I had an

00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:41,180
opportunity to sit down and kind of hack

00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:43,040
on some things and figure out a couple

00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:45,740
of couple of bugs that were causing

00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:48,620
build failures and and so get that

00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:51,080
sorted out as well just trying to trying

00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:52,760
to work towards getting various things

00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:54,650
for the atomic working group as well as

00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:56,560
the container layered image build system

00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:58,610
moving towards multi architecture

00:50:56,560 --> 00:51:00,970
hopefully have that that ready to go

00:50:58,610 --> 00:51:00,970
very soon

00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:07,889
[Applause]

00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:25,810
so this is some additional atomic

00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:29,410
container stuff we had a dark writing

00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:33,010
session yesterday about writing docs for

00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:35,200
atomic host and some kubernetes and

00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:37,000
origin stuff as well that went pretty

00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:41,099
well if you want to join in on that

00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:45,210
effort in github in the project atomic

00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:49,570
organization it's atomic - house - Doc's

00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:51,070
there's issues in there where we have an

00:51:49,570 --> 00:51:52,690
outline of the docs that we're trying to

00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:54,730
write and we have issues for each one

00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:57,040
and in each issue they're like source

00:51:54,730 --> 00:52:00,820
materials so it's pretty easy to jump on

00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:02,380
there and find one and some of the stuff

00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:04,630
is just a matter of kind of cutting and

00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:06,579
pasting things and getting it into shape

00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:09,940
and then we can review it and get those

00:52:06,579 --> 00:52:12,880
docs in place and then Adam mentioned

00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:16,630
the workshop about Rob being a container

00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:21,160
maintainer I was also involved in a talk

00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:23,290
about system containers which is kind of

00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:24,819
a cool way to take a container but run

00:52:23,290 --> 00:52:27,130
it a little more like you're accustomed

00:52:24,819 --> 00:52:28,660
to running an RPM and there's a lot of

00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:31,540
flexibility and how you run it and what

00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:34,000
kind of permissions you give and it can

00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:38,290
create a pretty easy experience for the

00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:40,510
for the user so there are documentation

00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:42,880
in the container guidelines about how to

00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:45,430
do that stuff and there's also the

00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:51,660
slides for the talk go into some detail

00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:55,480
and I also did talk about kubernetes and

00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:56,980
OpenShift origin on fedora there's a

00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:59,589
bunch of things to that kind of

00:52:56,980 --> 00:53:01,810
depending on how much we want that stack

00:52:59,589 --> 00:53:04,390
to be Fedora based there's packaging

00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:06,940
work to do there's testing work to do

00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:08,380
and there's containerization stuff and

00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:11,230
there's documentation like I mentioned

00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:14,260
also so for any of this stuff you can in

00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:17,609
freenode go into the atomic room on IRC

00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:22,359
and just ping us dusty you can ping

00:53:17,609 --> 00:53:24,430
dusty or ping me Jason Brooks and just

00:53:22,359 --> 00:53:26,859
you know get involved there's plenty of

00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:28,359
stuff to be done and this is a you keep

00:53:26,859 --> 00:53:31,330
hearing about atomic this is kind of a

00:53:28,359 --> 00:53:33,880
cool hot you know area right now in

00:53:31,330 --> 00:53:37,859
fedora and more generally and it's a lot

00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:37,859
of fun to work on so I invite you all

00:53:40,859 --> 00:54:00,070
next longer you take the longer dance so

00:53:55,840 --> 00:54:03,340
I was involved in leading two sessions

00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:06,880
one was with Patrick on the atomic

00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:08,740
workstation and in plot of good

00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:12,160
questions I talked a lot of interest in

00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:15,480
preparation for the talk we updated the

00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:17,950
docs for how to setup atomic workstation

00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:20,109
alongside your normal workstation

00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:22,119
install and going through that we found

00:54:20,109 --> 00:54:24,310
uh they worked with Colin on that and

00:54:22,119 --> 00:54:26,950
there was a lot of workarounds there

00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:28,359
that will be very good bugs to fix in

00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:31,930
the future

00:54:28,359 --> 00:54:33,400
then also that does talk about a session

00:54:31,930 --> 00:54:35,170
about flat packs I've been talking a lot

00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:38,170
different people about how we go ahead

00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:41,020
and get the work they're deployed and

00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:43,380
have a good plan with Adam and with

00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:45,310
Randy Barlow about how we're going to

00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:47,350
move these pieces into the Fedora

00:54:45,310 --> 00:54:49,660
infrastructure and also had a really

00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:52,450
good conversation with a young Kaluza

00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:54,310
about how we're gonna make freshmaker or

00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:58,140
support flat packs and that's something

00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:58,140
else we have to keep on working on

00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:13,010
Denis hey I actually didn't give a talk

00:55:10,369 --> 00:55:15,220
for the first time ever and it was kind

00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:18,589
of an interesting experience to just

00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:21,050
participate and take things in rather

00:55:18,589 --> 00:55:23,690
than try and you know provide a bunch of

00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:26,859
feedback but I did manage to fix Delta

00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:29,060
OPM creation for Fedora 26 updates so

00:55:26,859 --> 00:55:32,599
hopefully that'll make a bunch of users

00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:36,710
happy and I spent a lot of time talking

00:55:32,599 --> 00:55:38,990
to people about changes that are going

00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:41,329
on that are involving like release

00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:43,130
engineering so I have about a list of a

00:55:41,329 --> 00:55:46,010
hundred odd things to add to the backlog

00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:48,710
of 300 odd things so if there's going to

00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:52,099
be a lot of work that needs to be done

00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:54,619
and so you know people that want to see

00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:57,760
an effect change in how we ship and

00:55:54,619 --> 00:56:00,109
deliver come and you know see me and

00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:07,990
figure out how to get involved to make

00:56:00,109 --> 00:56:17,119
things better for everyone thank you

00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:19,670
next Adam then in B also I haven't heard

00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:20,990
from anybody in design or diversity and

00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:25,579
I remember we had a lot of sessions on

00:56:20,990 --> 00:56:29,150
both of those so be warned everyone

00:56:25,579 --> 00:56:31,339
madam I was here for Wendy for module RT

00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:33,290
and I don't already spoke about it we

00:56:31,339 --> 00:56:35,630
got many good feedback that was pretty

00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:37,550
useful and I think the most benefit was

00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:40,069
that we had many people from Brno here

00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:41,720
meeting other people and that makes any

00:56:40,069 --> 00:56:43,400
future work much easier if we know each

00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:45,829
other in person

00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:48,170
one session I did there was wasn't

00:56:45,829 --> 00:56:50,599
directly related to modularity was a

00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:52,940
discussion about splitting documentation

00:56:50,599 --> 00:56:55,970
from the coton package level and we

00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:57,800
spoke with mr. tips and yeah we figured

00:56:55,970 --> 00:56:59,800
out a way how to do it in the package

00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:02,300
guidelines how to a recommendation to

00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:04,700
make the dependencies smaller that was

00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:07,480
pretty good and also I spoke to many

00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:09,710
people about to some people about how we

00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:11,329
composed the destroy in a modularity way

00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:13,940
there are many things we still need to

00:57:11,329 --> 00:57:16,760
think about and yeah of course

00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:19,490
fires some of them will go to Matthews

00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:22,119
I'm moving will be kept in my pocket you

00:57:19,490 --> 00:57:40,609
just burn and yeah we'll fix it and

00:57:22,119 --> 00:57:47,170
we'll do something pretty cool Thanks so

00:57:40,609 --> 00:57:51,440
I myself and Jana we did a session on

00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:54,220
Fedora ambassadors the future and I

00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:57,710
believe we had a good discussion about

00:57:54,220 --> 00:58:03,230
what is ambassadors doing what do we

00:57:57,710 --> 00:58:06,910
need to change and discuss different

00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:10,810
ideas and also I think some of that even

00:58:06,910 --> 00:58:14,119
continued a little in the hallway track

00:58:10,810 --> 00:58:17,270
David Cantrell and I were brainstorming

00:58:14,119 --> 00:58:20,810
and we were talking about different

00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:23,900
things we could do at events besides

00:58:20,810 --> 00:58:26,390
just I mean like it's some of the events

00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:29,300
we've that I've been to it seems like

00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:32,630
every year we just set up a laptop and

00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:34,550
show off Fedora workstation or have the

00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:38,869
multi image where people can choose

00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:42,680
different desktops and people don't

00:58:38,869 --> 00:58:45,170
really look at it much and it's just

00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:47,630
people come by sometimes will help them

00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:52,160
with stuff but we were talking about

00:58:47,630 --> 00:58:56,240
more interactive options like David and

00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:59,450
I were talking about doing using the ham

00:58:56,240 --> 00:59:05,839
radio spin or lab or whatever they're

00:58:59,450 --> 00:59:08,329
called now to demonstrate ham radio at a

00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:10,609
conference because like itself I know

00:59:08,329 --> 00:59:14,890
they're it's a Linux conference but

00:59:10,609 --> 00:59:18,050
there's a large amount of hams there so

00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:20,510
we can show off hey this is what you can

00:59:18,050 --> 00:59:24,890
do you can just download this spin and

00:59:20,510 --> 00:59:28,190
have ham radio programs and even Brooke

00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:30,500
we can even bring equipment and

00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:36,500
I may actually use him radio at the

00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:41,000
conference okay

00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:45,650
ham radio is all is also known as

00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:47,569
amateur radio you can talk you can talk

00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:50,660
to people all over the world and there

00:59:47,569 --> 00:59:58,930
is also data ways of transmitting data

00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:58,930
over radio or voice or Morse code etc

01:00:02,530 --> 01:00:10,010
sorry did you did you have another

01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:11,420
question or no oh okay sorry you're

01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:14,869
welcome

01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:18,920
and also another talk I went to that I

01:00:14,869 --> 01:00:21,130
really found interesting and I'm looking

01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:24,140
forward to when it gets finished is the

01:00:21,130 --> 01:00:27,680
having fedora on the windows subsystem

01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:30,280
for Linux I think that could even be a

01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:33,619
way of reaching out to people that use

01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:37,069
Windows and say well you don't want to

01:00:33,619 --> 01:00:40,490
actually install Fedora okay fine run

01:00:37,069 --> 01:00:45,530
fedora on top of Windows yes it's not as

01:00:40,490 --> 01:00:48,740
good as running Fedora I mean on just as

01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:51,710
your based operating system but it may

01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:56,089
be a way of getting them to try Linux

01:00:51,710 --> 01:01:01,280
and then maybe they'll decide hey I like

01:00:56,089 --> 01:01:04,700
this I want to actually try it so I

01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:09,340
think that's all I have to say

01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:17,750
[Applause]

01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:18,830
next nope for the record Nick was

01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:23,540
thanked because he ran the ham radio

01:01:18,830 --> 01:01:26,570
licensing session and the GPG signing

01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:30,850
session and the signing tests with GP

01:01:26,570 --> 01:01:30,850
chi-chi's for ham radio purposes session

01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:42,770
so yesterday we had diversity session we

01:01:39,850 --> 01:01:44,330
in my in our mind we were thinking that

01:01:42,770 --> 01:01:46,850
we will come up with the events we

01:01:44,330 --> 01:01:49,850
wanted to do but other than that the

01:01:46,850 --> 01:01:52,490
list of the events we got very brilliant

01:01:49,850 --> 01:01:54,230
ideas like these events can be in

01:01:52,490 --> 01:01:57,830
collaboration with the local communities

01:01:54,230 --> 01:02:01,010
like women who code pie ladies etc so

01:01:57,830 --> 01:02:02,960
also we did talk about the impact how we

01:02:01,010 --> 01:02:06,860
gonna measure the impact of these image

01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:09,770
events so the idea in the was discussed

01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:12,470
in the ambassador's session as well so

01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:14,420
the idea is to come up with certain set

01:02:12,470 --> 01:02:16,400
of questionnaire and answers so that

01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:20,120
that can be included in the event

01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:23,630
reports when we visit some place and we

01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:26,300
can evaluate with the impact matrix that

01:02:23,630 --> 01:02:29,780
how fruitful it was other than that we

01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:32,960
discussed about the budget so really

01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:36,610
lines of begs who shared this thing that

01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:39,290
we need to plan about the budget and

01:02:36,610 --> 01:02:42,910
it's not limited we are flexible about

01:02:39,290 --> 01:02:45,440
it if there is something which is really

01:02:42,910 --> 01:02:49,520
impactful and necessary for the fedora

01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:52,820
to do we discussed about onboarding new

01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:56,930
people in diversity team and what which

01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:59,170
all steps we need existing process I

01:02:56,930 --> 01:03:03,950
would say is little lengthy process and

01:02:59,170 --> 01:03:07,130
not so simple so we we are we tried to

01:03:03,950 --> 01:03:09,310
make it more simpler and we succeeded in

01:03:07,130 --> 01:03:12,860
that we came up with a plan which will

01:03:09,310 --> 01:03:14,570
soon we will update on wiki pages we

01:03:12,860 --> 01:03:17,680
discussed about the diversity advisor

01:03:14,570 --> 01:03:21,000
position which is the diversity team

01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:23,490
representative in the council team

01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:26,369
other than that we also discuss about

01:03:23,490 --> 01:03:29,130
the diversity survey which we will be

01:03:26,369 --> 01:03:30,539
publishing but maybe by next year so we

01:03:29,130 --> 01:03:34,829
discussed about the tooling we're gonna

01:03:30,539 --> 01:03:38,190
use how we analyze the results etc and

01:03:34,829 --> 01:03:40,049
we discuss about outreach II thanks

01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:44,670
marina for helping us out in this

01:03:40,049 --> 01:03:47,250
initiative here this initiative is where

01:03:44,670 --> 01:03:50,480
the diversity team is putting a helping

01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:53,309
outfit budget etc so everyone please

01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:56,609
there will be applications as marina

01:03:53,309 --> 01:04:00,720
already said please come up if you would

01:03:56,609 --> 01:04:04,140
like to mentor someone and apply for the

01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:07,349
mentorship program in the outreach if so

01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:09,930
and there are the charts with a

01:04:07,349 --> 01:04:12,180
beautiful writing for the diversity team

01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:25,259
so you can read out if you need to know

01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:29,339
more things for you

01:04:25,259 --> 01:04:31,109
I still don't know if I see many of our

01:04:29,339 --> 01:04:33,329
design people I'm having trouble seeing

01:04:31,109 --> 01:04:35,190
in the dark though so I won't lie but

01:04:33,329 --> 01:04:40,680
I'd love to know what happened with

01:04:35,190 --> 01:04:42,990
design and hubs anyone anyone well while

01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:44,789
we wait on somebody to to be a victim

01:04:42,990 --> 01:04:49,049
Justin's comments reminded me of

01:04:44,789 --> 01:04:51,329
something we tested also last night but

01:04:49,049 --> 01:04:53,430
not before one third well before 1:30 in

01:04:51,329 --> 01:04:55,319
the morning the idea of doing a lift and

01:04:53,430 --> 01:04:59,130
shift of documentation out of the wiki

01:04:55,319 --> 01:05:02,339
and in 15 minutes we were able to

01:04:59,130 --> 01:05:04,680
publish to the docs stage a security

01:05:02,339 --> 01:05:06,509
guide component so it's about how to use

01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:08,430
you be keys that came out of our wiki

01:05:06,509 --> 01:05:11,460
and it's now more findable and durable

01:05:08,430 --> 01:05:12,599
so it really is an easy thing to do we

01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:14,400
probably could have done it in five

01:05:12,599 --> 01:05:16,890
minutes if we hadn't taken notes and

01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:18,779
made bad jokes the whole time but bad

01:05:16,890 --> 01:05:27,890
jokes and notes tend to drive lenox so

01:05:18,779 --> 01:05:39,380
we were cool next person sweet

01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:41,450
run dancing my back hurts Hey so among

01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:42,230
the various thing that happened here at

01:05:41,450 --> 01:05:46,249
some point

01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:49,910
ai ai ai helped mismo rebase her stuff

01:05:46,249 --> 01:05:51,200
on an 8 month long backlog of CSS

01:05:49,910 --> 01:05:53,930
changes and the project she was

01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:55,940
contributed to 22 and if you know mismo

01:05:53,930 --> 01:05:58,190
you know she doesn't really like it and

01:05:55,940 --> 01:05:59,930
so I got her at the end of that I got

01:05:58,190 --> 01:06:02,450
her to say something like well this

01:05:59,930 --> 01:06:03,109
wasn't entirely horrible so I'm pretty

01:06:02,450 --> 01:06:15,049
happy with that

01:06:03,109 --> 01:06:18,009
that's all dude you keep walking around

01:06:15,049 --> 01:06:18,009
I'm gonna make you come back up

01:06:23,049 --> 01:06:28,730
is there anybody left from IOT I know we

01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:30,739
heard about the arm SOC documentation

01:06:28,730 --> 01:06:32,900
and unfortunately Peter had to catch an

01:06:30,739 --> 01:06:34,309
early flight today but is there anybody

01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:35,809
wants to talk about what we've talked

01:06:34,309 --> 01:06:42,470
about with regards to IOT

01:06:35,809 --> 01:06:48,470
I am going to assume all of the things

01:06:42,470 --> 01:06:55,940
have left sir sweet we welcome you back

01:06:48,470 --> 01:06:58,849
to the podium there was a lot of IOT

01:06:55,940 --> 01:07:03,049
discussions most of it at the moment

01:06:58,849 --> 01:07:04,730
there's no real concrete plans on any of

01:07:03,049 --> 01:07:07,279
what we're actually going to deliver

01:07:04,730 --> 01:07:10,160
because there's so many things we could

01:07:07,279 --> 01:07:13,670
do and we just really need to focus it

01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:15,920
down and get a few smaller things moving

01:07:13,670 --> 01:07:21,230
forward is there any specific questions

01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:24,789
on IOT that anyone had or just monitor

01:07:21,230 --> 01:07:28,400
general it's it's moving along the arm

01:07:24,789 --> 01:07:30,619
side of it is going fairly well just in

01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:35,259
killing 32-bit kernel is not going to

01:07:30,619 --> 01:07:35,259
help it so Justin

01:07:36,570 --> 01:07:46,119
no 32-bit x86 there's some IOT on x86

01:07:41,950 --> 01:07:49,660
but most of it is on arm so it's kind of

01:07:46,119 --> 01:07:52,720
hand in hand the software stacks the

01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:58,840
commonly used in IOT applications are

01:07:52,720 --> 01:08:03,670
very convoluted and they bundle lots of

01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:08,200
things and like I home assistant at home

01:08:03,670 --> 01:08:10,359
and it's all in Python it's all open but

01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:12,910
it's written and set up in such a way

01:08:10,359 --> 01:08:16,120
that it doesn't fit into the traditional

01:08:12,910 --> 01:08:18,670
packaging model in fedora dough and it

01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:20,560
you know you you you really need to just

01:08:18,670 --> 01:08:23,319
run up from get and pull down the bits

01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:25,900
because of how they're doing it and it's

01:08:23,319 --> 01:08:27,850
easier for the developers but it's

01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:30,040
really really difficult to fit into the

01:08:27,850 --> 01:08:31,989
distribution model and that is a problem

01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:35,529
that at some point we're going to need

01:08:31,989 --> 01:08:37,660
to address in fedoras how we go from the

01:08:35,529 --> 01:08:41,170
developer centric models of doing things

01:08:37,660 --> 01:08:45,489
and pip installing and how we make that

01:08:41,170 --> 01:08:57,310
work in a distribution model there's

01:08:45,489 --> 01:09:01,350
lots of challenges and opportunities she

01:08:57,310 --> 01:09:01,350
got the dreaded finger point of the FPL

01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:10,509
hello so there were a couple of sessions

01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:13,930
for design we learned some things so for

01:09:10,509 --> 01:09:19,330
example Jen did a session on micro

01:09:13,930 --> 01:09:22,089
testing which is a UI tool that you use

01:09:19,330 --> 01:09:23,859
to see if your software is working so

01:09:22,089 --> 01:09:27,630
that was very informative I didn't know

01:09:23,859 --> 01:09:34,480
a whole lot about that also Suzanne did

01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:36,670
a somewhat similar thing for UI on it's

01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:39,609
like more about the research side of it

01:09:36,670 --> 01:09:42,910
and how you can use the analytics you

01:09:39,609 --> 01:09:46,180
get from those tests to further your

01:09:42,910 --> 01:09:48,820
software make it better and then we had

01:09:46,180 --> 01:09:52,060
a hackfest that was great

01:09:48,820 --> 01:09:55,420
as far as Fedora badges it went well

01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:59,080
attendance was well was good and we made

01:09:55,420 --> 01:10:03,910
a few designs I managed to get a design

01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:07,930
as well but I kind of left the session

01:10:03,910 --> 01:10:09,820
having more questions than then answers

01:10:07,930 --> 01:10:11,620
I mean I wasn't looking for answers you

01:10:09,820 --> 01:10:14,770
know we're looking to design things and

01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:18,150
continue helping out using badges but in

01:10:14,770 --> 01:10:21,400
some ways I feel as though badges is

01:10:18,150 --> 01:10:22,180
kind of an older project maybe not as

01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:25,060
exciting

01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:26,050
maybe not everyone's as excited to work

01:10:25,060 --> 01:10:28,960
on it anymore

01:10:26,050 --> 01:10:31,600
I'm definitely looking for developers to

01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:35,020
push approved badges or even get a

01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:37,120
comment back there's four or five year

01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:39,850
old tickets I'm like is this still

01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:42,640
relevant and there's radio silence on

01:10:39,850 --> 01:10:46,420
that so that would be interesting and

01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:50,080
then to get some more help but I was

01:10:46,420 --> 01:10:53,340
also kind of inspired by Matt's talk at

01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:58,360
the beginning the state of Fedora and

01:10:53,340 --> 01:11:00,930
talking about how we can use the tools

01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:06,700
that we have or do things differently to

01:11:00,930 --> 01:11:09,400
further the goals of fedora and I did

01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:12,640
design this badge during a flock this

01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:14,740
year but so how we can use you know

01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:18,100
different parts of Fedora to further the

01:11:14,740 --> 01:11:20,710
goals so I have a good idea of what the

01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:23,890
goals are but I'm not super entrenched

01:11:20,710 --> 01:11:25,990
in the you know the development side of

01:11:23,890 --> 01:11:30,190
it the ambassador side of it I'm a

01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:32,770
designer so although I speak about it

01:11:30,190 --> 01:11:35,230
and I I love it and I'm in you know

01:11:32,770 --> 01:11:37,600
passionate about it I don't have all the

01:11:35,230 --> 01:11:40,300
insight that all of you people have I

01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:41,740
have some right but I'm here to learn so

01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:48,940
anyway the point that I'm trying to make

01:11:41,740 --> 01:11:51,580
is I'd like to get a little more passion

01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:56,440
or like an injection of ideas and

01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:58,750
thoughts into fedora badges so even if

01:11:56,440 --> 01:12:00,910
that just means you know I had this idea

01:11:58,750 --> 01:12:03,300
I haven't taken the time to file a

01:12:00,910 --> 01:12:07,060
ticket for it do

01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:08,020
and for the people who are leadership

01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:10,930
for fedora

01:12:08,020 --> 01:12:14,800
what can fedora badges do where do you

01:12:10,930 --> 01:12:17,410
want the work to be happening can we use

01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:20,949
badges to make that happen

01:12:17,410 --> 01:12:23,620
more and you know that can be a

01:12:20,949 --> 01:12:26,590
discussion that you have with me like

01:12:23,620 --> 01:12:29,530
email me directly if you need like focus

01:12:26,590 --> 01:12:31,390
work because although I do work on it

01:12:29,530 --> 01:12:33,580
every week it's still contributing for

01:12:31,390 --> 01:12:36,690
me I don't have a lot of dedicated time

01:12:33,580 --> 01:12:40,420
but I would be happy to make that if

01:12:36,690 --> 01:12:43,750
there was a solid goal if it wasn't just

01:12:40,420 --> 01:12:46,330
a lik list of old tickets like event

01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:48,520
tickets we make happen right other

01:12:46,330 --> 01:12:51,190
tickets we make happen and I like to

01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:54,070
leave easy open tickets for new badge

01:12:51,190 --> 01:12:57,000
designers so I don't go and do those but

01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:59,830
I could but I'm I guess the point is I

01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:01,480
don't feel like there's as much

01:12:59,830 --> 01:13:03,730
excitement about the project and I'd

01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:07,690
like there still to be and how can we

01:13:03,730 --> 01:13:10,449
bring some excitement back to it does it

01:13:07,690 --> 01:13:13,270
mean overhauling how the website looks

01:13:10,449 --> 01:13:16,630
maybe or adding more features in there

01:13:13,270 --> 01:13:21,310
so that people enjoy spending time on

01:13:16,630 --> 01:13:24,699
that website there's there's stuff there

01:13:21,310 --> 01:13:27,940
that I think we can continue to grow and

01:13:24,699 --> 01:13:31,300
improve on to continue to make Fedora

01:13:27,940 --> 01:13:34,420
great and better and also you know

01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:36,480
design wise what can we do to make that

01:13:34,420 --> 01:13:36,480
happen

01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:45,600
[Applause]

01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:48,650
I actually have a badges related idea

01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:51,270
that came from previous FK crumby

01:13:48,650 --> 01:13:54,000
which I think we haven't taken advantage

01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:55,520
of very much and some of it could be

01:13:54,000 --> 01:14:00,420
what's that

01:13:55,520 --> 01:14:03,330
boots Troy alright but basically the

01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:05,250
idea was that instead of just having one

01:14:03,330 --> 01:14:06,630
off badges for you came to an event you

01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:08,940
did this thing but to have a little

01:14:06,630 --> 01:14:11,340
series of badges that show you how like

01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:13,980
how to get involved in it's different

01:14:11,340 --> 01:14:16,650
section of the project but and so if you

01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:18,990
have something like joined process for

01:14:16,650 --> 01:14:20,970
your team or web sites team it might be

01:14:18,990 --> 01:14:23,730
nice to think about a series of badges

01:14:20,970 --> 01:14:26,370
there like your first contribution this

01:14:23,730 --> 01:14:27,420
next level and a sort of a little series

01:14:26,370 --> 01:14:29,850
of things that someone can actually

01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:32,220
follow like oh yeah I want to get the

01:14:29,850 --> 01:14:34,560
next badge and by following those badges

01:14:32,220 --> 01:14:35,790
that makes an easy path to get involved

01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:37,290
in your project so I think that's a

01:14:35,790 --> 01:14:38,580
really strong thing we can do with

01:14:37,290 --> 01:14:41,430
badges that we're not taking advantage

01:14:38,580 --> 01:14:45,720
of yet this isn't really a recap comment

01:14:41,430 --> 01:14:48,150
I'm just sticking it in here anyways and

01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:50,310
the Justin tells me the functionality to

01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:52,260
do that is there we just need ideas for

01:14:50,310 --> 01:14:57,390
which things need to work on those

01:14:52,260 --> 01:15:02,760
tracks so it's called bootstrap so there

01:14:57,390 --> 01:15:04,350
we go so I'd like to come back on chip

01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:07,080
and startup and during the this week

01:15:04,350 --> 01:15:09,810
conference the first one is so I had the

01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:12,330
access unpacker we managed there was

01:15:09,810 --> 01:15:14,940
very little attendance considering how

01:15:12,330 --> 01:15:16,590
many great talks were next to it so we

01:15:14,940 --> 01:15:18,570
had like five people in the room and

01:15:16,590 --> 01:15:20,940
just with the five people we managed to

01:15:18,570 --> 01:15:22,920
get on board one new contributor who has

01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:26,040
submitted a pro request who I just need

01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:28,290
to merge we managed to we've can even

01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:31,530
see we managed to fix the the bug that

01:15:28,290 --> 01:15:32,610
was known but not reported so you know

01:15:31,530 --> 01:15:35,790
if you have a barrack and that's

01:15:32,610 --> 01:15:38,720
annoying to you please report it and so

01:15:35,790 --> 01:15:41,070
now you can again reply to issue

01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:43,410
notifications directly by email and your

01:15:41,070 --> 01:15:45,390
email is going to be sent he's going to

01:15:43,410 --> 01:15:47,370
be headed to the ticket it wasn't

01:15:45,390 --> 01:15:50,070
working but nobody mentioned it but we

01:15:47,370 --> 01:15:52,040
knew it was on so we just fix it and we

01:15:50,070 --> 01:15:53,210
managed with Matt to

01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:55,070
and some of the people request which was

01:15:53,210 --> 01:15:56,890
related to Packer on this key to improve

01:15:55,070 --> 01:15:58,550
things for the contributors so

01:15:56,890 --> 01:15:59,660
considering how many people are in the

01:15:58,550 --> 01:16:02,090
room actually quite happy with the

01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:03,290
outcome of that the tag vest the second

01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:04,790
thing which I would like to come back on

01:16:03,290 --> 01:16:07,600
is something that matters already

01:16:04,790 --> 01:16:10,460
mentioned it's the atomic CI effort

01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:12,140
that's um this is something that I've

01:16:10,460 --> 01:16:13,670
been involved for a few months and it

01:16:12,140 --> 01:16:15,500
has been it has been a little bit

01:16:13,670 --> 01:16:20,150
frustrating too because it's been a lot

01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:21,560
of back behind work we were working on

01:16:20,150 --> 01:16:23,600
the tool in we were working on making

01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:26,330
things happen but nowadays we have

01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:28,040
something to show for and we have been

01:16:26,330 --> 01:16:30,350
able to show them during this conference

01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:31,940
and see them well this is what we have

01:16:30,350 --> 01:16:35,240
been working on and this is how it's

01:16:31,940 --> 01:16:37,190
going to influence the entire project so

01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:38,540
I'm very happy that this is finally

01:16:37,190 --> 01:16:40,460
something that's coming out and that's

01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:42,740
something that we can actually show and

01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:44,900
prove and you know ask for feedback and

01:16:42,740 --> 01:16:46,970
discussions and see how we can improve

01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:49,670
things from the current state and I'm

01:16:46,970 --> 01:16:51,170
also so I'm also standing here to tell

01:16:49,670 --> 01:16:53,510
you that if you're a fellow atomic

01:16:51,170 --> 01:16:56,080
package maintainer we'll be coming after

01:16:53,510 --> 01:16:57,920
you to help you get the test on

01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:59,900
basically in the connection in the

01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:02,750
coming months with the rigidity a

01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:06,110
dedicated group of person that will be

01:17:02,750 --> 01:17:08,840
working on helping the federal to make

01:17:06,110 --> 01:17:11,120
package maintainer to get tests on to

01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:12,890
get a study to the diskette so if you're

01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:15,110
some if you're interesting come to see

01:17:12,890 --> 01:17:16,910

01:17:15,110 --> 01:17:19,930
interesting we'll be coming to you and

01:17:16,910 --> 01:17:23,010
try to convince you otherwise thank you

01:17:19,930 --> 01:17:28,949
[Applause]

01:17:23,010 --> 01:17:28,949
thank you anyone else

01:17:30,090 --> 01:17:40,510
Matthew do you want to give us some

01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:42,610
closing remarks thanks everybody I'm

01:17:40,510 --> 01:17:44,409
glad that session went well because we

01:17:42,610 --> 01:17:45,999
were a little bit worried because when

01:17:44,409 --> 01:17:47,860
we were planning this vlog we thought we

01:17:45,999 --> 01:17:49,869
should have an awesome recap session and

01:17:47,860 --> 01:17:51,309
then we put on the on the schedule and

01:17:49,869 --> 01:17:53,139
then we didn't really do a good job of

01:17:51,309 --> 01:17:55,119
reaching out to session leaders and

01:17:53,139 --> 01:17:56,739
various people saying oh yeah remember

01:17:55,119 --> 01:17:58,780
please think about doing a recap so

01:17:56,739 --> 01:18:00,309
thank you everybody who came up here at

01:17:58,780 --> 01:18:03,880
the last minute and didn't hate anyways

01:18:00,309 --> 01:18:05,650
I think that worked out really well kind

01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:07,989
of related to that and also related to

01:18:05,650 --> 01:18:11,170
the badges in previous years we've had

01:18:07,989 --> 01:18:13,300
badges for fedora for speakers at flock

01:18:11,170 --> 01:18:15,429
and this year we decided we wanted to

01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:18,400
have just one badge for everybody

01:18:15,429 --> 01:18:19,900
because this is supposed to be a hack

01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:22,119
fest where just because you're up in

01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:24,849
front of the mic doesn't make you super

01:18:22,119 --> 01:18:26,639
special everybody here is very special

01:18:24,849 --> 01:18:32,769
for being part of the Fedora project and

01:18:26,639 --> 01:18:35,199
right exactly and I wanted to say thank

01:18:32,769 --> 01:18:36,519
you to everybody when I was at the

01:18:35,199 --> 01:18:38,079
beginning I should have started with

01:18:36,519 --> 01:18:40,090
thank you for everybody for being here

01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:43,059
and for being part of fedora and making

01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:44,619
Fedora what it is and I am just always

01:18:43,059 --> 01:18:47,019
so grateful to be part of this awesome

01:18:44,619 --> 01:18:49,179
community and don't dismiss us because

01:18:47,019 --> 01:18:53,550
brian has more logistic stuff to say

01:18:49,179 --> 01:18:53,550
afterwards but again thank you everybody

01:18:54,710 --> 01:18:59,940
I apologize I called Matthew up and

01:18:58,260 --> 01:19:01,830
Yin's was actually standing and I did

01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:03,720
not see you because it's very dark in

01:19:01,830 --> 01:19:05,430
the back and so you have been outed by

01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:10,680
one of your good friends and now you

01:19:05,430 --> 01:19:12,920
have to come up here and talk I have

01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:12,920
eyes everywhere

01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:30,830
so I apologize I did not mean to skip

01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:33,870
over you yesterday we had Fedora

01:19:30,830 --> 01:19:35,700
internationalisation session for 90

01:19:33,870 --> 01:19:39,210
minutes it's got a small session but we

01:19:35,700 --> 01:19:44,880
had reviewed the Fedora changes we've

01:19:39,210 --> 01:19:47,670
done since Fedora 24 and also discussed

01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:49,340
a few interesting topics like what to do

01:19:47,670 --> 01:19:52,410
with line packs

01:19:49,340 --> 01:19:57,540
how we can improve the user experience

01:19:52,410 --> 01:20:00,240
the yeah also some of the other hands-on

01:19:57,540 --> 01:20:03,300
sessions were pretty useful like atomic

01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:05,430
host 101 session by dusty I was really

01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:08,700
good I thought helped me to understand

01:20:05,430 --> 01:20:10,470
better maybe how we might approach some

01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:16,800
of the internationalization issues for

01:20:10,470 --> 01:20:19,800
that and also the modularity testing was

01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:21,870
quite nice to play to that and I think

01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:24,870
maybe that's a majority might help with

01:20:21,870 --> 01:20:26,430
the line packs handling we could have

01:20:24,870 --> 01:20:35,690
different profiles maybe for workstation

01:20:26,430 --> 01:20:38,490
or atomic and Sun so and it's my first

01:20:35,690 --> 01:20:40,800
Fedora conference in u.s. and I really

01:20:38,490 --> 01:20:44,180
enjoyed and I think this new to session

01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:49,590
format is really good so I hope that'll

01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:53,310
continue yeah also I contain a packaging

01:20:49,590 --> 01:20:56,180
session I made up hand out container to

01:20:53,310 --> 01:20:56,180
program gonna submit

01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:10,060
yeah I have no other announcements other

01:21:08,410 --> 01:21:12,520
than Matthew is walking back up here so

01:21:10,060 --> 01:21:13,840
I'll briefly say expect a survey which

01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:16,420
I'm saying publicly so that I'll

01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:17,800
actually do it it will be short and

01:21:16,420 --> 01:21:20,140
sweet but the goal will be to collect

01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:21,610
some feedback to help the council make

01:21:20,140 --> 01:21:24,070
further decisions about flock in the

01:21:21,610 --> 01:21:25,210
future I'll give this to you just a

01:21:24,070 --> 01:21:26,800
second I'm going to remind people that

01:21:25,210 --> 01:21:28,390
if you do need to ride the Boston

01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:30,100
Airport we've got three people who are

01:21:28,390 --> 01:21:32,080
willing to do rides today and a couple

01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:36,700
who are doing rides tomorrow so see

01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:38,140
David Brendan spot and probably lots of

01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:39,820
other people who are nodding at me like

01:21:38,140 --> 01:21:41,440
Jarrod's basically if somebody's

01:21:39,820 --> 01:21:45,310
jangling keys they've probably got a

01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:46,810
seat and I turn it over you sir yeah no

01:21:45,310 --> 01:21:48,100
I thought of more things sitting there

01:21:46,810 --> 01:21:49,660
looking at the back of the video camera

01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:53,170
reminded me hey yeah this is all being

01:21:49,660 --> 01:21:55,240
recorded and well we've got like 150 200

01:21:53,170 --> 01:21:56,680
people or whatever here obviously

01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:58,900
there's a lot more people than that

01:21:56,680 --> 01:22:00,280
involved in fedora you know thousands of

01:21:58,900 --> 01:22:03,100
people every year and not everybody

01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:04,720
could be here so let's make sure that we

01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:06,310
talk about what we did here in the rest

01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:08,890
of the community and when these videos

01:22:06,310 --> 01:22:10,330
are available share them as widely as

01:22:08,890 --> 01:22:12,910
possible we're also going to have a

01:22:10,330 --> 01:22:15,300
short little marketing promotional video

01:22:12,910 --> 01:22:18,130
made up from the official photographer

01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:19,960
share that around spread things you know

01:22:18,130 --> 01:22:22,680
spread the love that kind of thing and

01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:28,770
