Talk: The Future of fedmsg?
Presenter: Jeremy Cline

Description:
fedmsg is the library Fedora Infrastructure applications use to communicate,
both within applications and to make announcements to the world at large.
It is powered by ZeroMQ, although it supports other message brokers via its
dependency on Moksha.

In this talk, I'd like to cover some of the pain points we have with fedmsg
in Fedora Infrastructure and talk about potential solutions to the problems
we encounter. This includes refactors, re-working features, and adding entirely
new features.
