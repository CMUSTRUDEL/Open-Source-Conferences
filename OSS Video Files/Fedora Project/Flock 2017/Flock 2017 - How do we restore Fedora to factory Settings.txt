Talk: How do we restore Fedora to factory Settings
Presenter: Stephen Gallagher

Description:
This talk will focus on some less-recognized needs of Fedora packaging. In order to better operate in a world where servers are increasingly being virtualized, Fedora needs to be easier to turn into a "Gold Master".

In this topic, we'll discuss the problems with some classic approaches and a discussion of how to use systemd features to solve them. There will also be a specific case-study on how to improve the creation of self-signed-certificates for services that offer HTTP-based interfaces.
