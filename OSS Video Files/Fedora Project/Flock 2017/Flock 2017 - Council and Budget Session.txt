	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,530
right this is the secret on the record

00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:31,890
council cabal meeting that is being

00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:33,360
videotaped do we have a plan for this

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:38,340
meeting Brian I believe the answer's no

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:40,559
is that technically we have a very good

00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:43,860
would you like to relay the not very

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,420
good plan because all of you chose to

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,940
come to this meeting we will not be

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,350
doing open mic stand up so this is the

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:54,500
part of the meeting where you have to

00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:54,500
ask questions because you chose to come

00:00:54,620 --> 00:01:04,799
we will recognize the gentlewoman in the

00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:06,780
second row yeah that is a good question

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,689
the question was are we taking questions

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:12,030
and the answer is yes yes we are in fact

00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:13,979
taking questions anyone who would like

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,780
to ask a question I'm sorry you've

00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:18,720
already asked a question anyone else who

00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:21,140
would like to ask a question Amita what

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,140
is your question

00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:34,430
so I'm going to repeat the question

00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:37,400
first and I'm gonna paraphrase it a bit

00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:39,980
the blog posts that was written by

00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,270
Matthew and was actually read by number

00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:43,220
of members of council before it was

00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:46,430
posted so that he doesn't have to take

00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:47,810
all the blame and a lot of the

00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:50,390
communication that has come out of the

00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:53,810
council has indicated a desire to align

00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:55,300
the activities what we're working on as

00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:59,780
well as like how we spend our money

00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:00,980
around the objectives of the project the

00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,410
primary objectives that have been

00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:06,650
identified by the council being the the

00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:08,690
CI and modularity components as well as

00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:10,730
we have things like mine chair and the

00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:14,810
additions of fedora and so the core

00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:17,269
question was how do we align non like

00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:19,370
technically contributing parts of the

00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:22,040
project around these things and is there

00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:23,630
any scope for expansion of these and I'm

00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,580
actually hand the mic to Matthew if

00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:27,319
that's okay with everybody cuz he gave a

00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,269
good version of the answer I think

00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:32,870
earlier that I would like to have him

00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:35,090
repeat maybe all right I'm gonna say an

00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:37,040
answer and then if it's not the one you

00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,390
were looking for you can you like prompt

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,260
me until I come up with the thing you

00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:44,660
think I said that was good yeah so I

00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:47,690
think I do have two separate answers to

00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:50,150
it one of them is that the things that

00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:51,560
we've identified the the CI and

00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:53,870
modularity objectives are

00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,609
they're both technical things but in

00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:58,370
general what we're doing if it overall

00:03:55,609 --> 00:04:00,140
is technical and the tech all the

00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:02,269
technical things have very important

00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:05,630
non-technical aspects to them that are

00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:08,480
important within that so we're going to

00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:10,519
need all of the soft things around NCI

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,500
and modularity like that's going to need

00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:15,230
documentation it's gonna need design

00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,940
it's gonna need just people talking

00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:19,850
about it those kind of things which are

00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:21,890
less technical so that's one aspect of

00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:23,720
it and I think the other aspect is like

00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:27,080
we have identified those objectives

00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,460
right now we have room for more

00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,370
objectives and so there are other things

00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:33,860
that can fit within the mission that

00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:35,330
could also possibly be more aligned with

00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,000
some of the things people are interested

00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:40,110
in it

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,880
haven't you know put up right now is the

00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:47,970
things we're focusing on it's either of

00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:50,910
those close to what you thought is one

00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:53,910
very simple statement is that we are

00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:56,070
fundamentally missing objectives that we

00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:58,110
know are important to fedora that do not

00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:01,500
have essentially objective write-ups and

00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:03,210
sponsors you know as I jokingly keep

00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,070
reminding that you know I wrote some

00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:07,140
examples of those things in that blog

00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:09,960
post you know I just completely made

00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:11,820
them up but no this is the whole point

00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,370
is that the first part of your statement

00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,690
is should all of the funding and work

00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:18,540
and everything else be focused around

00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:20,220
those objectives yes second part of that

00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:28,080
question is are the objectives complete

00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:30,000
no that makes sense and I don't want to

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,500
change too long

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,480
you specifically mentioned things like

00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,160
fedora Women's Day which I did not put

00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,240
in my paraphrasing and I happen to know

00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,860
you're very active on the diversity

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:42,240
which I also did not put in my

00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:45,150
paraphrasing the activities of that

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,160
group create opportunities for new

00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:49,320
contributors to the project and new

00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:52,470
users of the project there is absolutely

00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:55,320
no reason why a say fedora Woman's Day

00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:57,390
activity could not be focused on a

00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,820
female community that would lead to

00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:02,880
modularity contributors so there is a

00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:04,919
heavy alignment there so it's just we

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,960
need to look at the right way to to put

00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:08,820
it all together so that we're attracting

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,229
in your case because you're thinking

00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,510
about diversity we're attracting a

00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:14,340
diverse community of people who are

00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:16,830
going to align well with what we're

00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,390
trying to do going out and attracting I

00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,919
don't know llama farmers because they're

00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:22,320
my favorite group to pick on these days

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,729
is not necessarily going to align well

00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,330
with what we're trying to accomplish in

00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:26,970
fedora

00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:28,740
so attracting a large diverse group of

00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:30,360
them is just going to lead to a large I

00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:32,010
grew for a diverse group of people who

00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,800
are upset because we're not doing

00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:38,330
something that makes sense to them and I

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,330
think that answers

00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:48,540
exactly the other piece too is that the

00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:51,510
the council I don't expect it to be

00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:54,270
particularly draconian so make the

00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:56,640
proposal find some rough tie into one of

00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:59,010
the objectives and see what happens you

00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:01,830
know so you know they the idea is just

00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:05,490
that I think the council and the budget

00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:07,440
process we felt like it was really kind

00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:09,390
of black box II you know it was like you

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,400
know money went out to these various

00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:13,290
regions and there was very little kind

00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,760
of information back about like how

00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:16,260
successful is this is it aligned with

00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,150
what we're trying to do is it you know

00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:20,070
can it be improved could could we learn

00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:22,800
from each other about how we do things

00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:24,780
differently and so this was an attempt

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,370
to make it so that it could be a little

00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,230
bit more transparent and it could be a

00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:31,080
little bit more focused and with actual

00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:31,770
metric results it may not be a great

00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,870
idea

00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:35,670
it's but it's one we you know came up

00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:38,090
with just start with right and we'll see

00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:38,090
how it goes

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,380
next question from the gentleman

00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:30,449
I'm just gonna repeat kind of what you

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,949
said then I'll hand you the mic what I'm

00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:33,930
hearing from you is that given a

00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:37,529
hypothetical objective or alignment

00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:39,659
around containers for example today when

00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:41,370
an ambassador attends a general Linux

00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:43,680
event we will typically send two

00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:45,899
ambassadors oftentimes an experienced

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,480
ambassador and then a new ambassador and

00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:50,279
they will work the event but if we were

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,529
to attend a specialized event such as a

00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:54,360
containers event we need someone who is

00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:57,510
not only good as an ambassador but we

00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:59,279
also need a container expert and what

00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:01,589
are we going to do about that is that

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:06,060
the general gist of the discussion okay

00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:09,420
mr. melih I think that's a good thing I

00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:12,480
guess I think it is we've definitely had

00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:14,190
a problem with very little communication

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,140
between ambassadors and the rest of the

00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:18,540
project for a while in both directions

00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:20,550
like it's people technical people don't

00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:22,350
really think you know working I'm just

00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:24,720
working on this stuff and not like how

00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:26,760
will I engage ambassadors to help bring

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,890
this to people and ambassadors you

00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,959
haven't been you know dragging container

00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:33,630
experts or whatever to talks so I think

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:38,250
anything we can do to help that happen

00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:41,040
is actually really good I don't know how

00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:42,870
to do it but I think I think it is

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,149
definitely a good thing to strive for

00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:48,089
and I think and we do have those

00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:49,980
container experts in the community and a

00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:52,260
lot of them are outgoing friendly nice

00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:54,120
people who just maybe don't know the way

00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,440
the ambassador's project works so I

00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:59,610
think that pairing you're talking about

00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,560
is very possible and a good strong thing

00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:05,399
we have got going

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:07,199
of course Lange that has more to say so

00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:09,899
while I generally agree with you I

00:10:07,199 --> 00:10:11,490
disagree with the necessary point in a

00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:13,140
sense like I don't actually think you

00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:14,940
need a container expert to go and talk

00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:17,579
about containers I mean you don't need

00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:19,709
you know somebody who you know is an

00:10:17,579 --> 00:10:21,839
expert in you know the bootloader to go

00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:24,480
in and pitch fedora today right I mean

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,610
they you know you you're not trying to

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,760
go and teach people how containers work

00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:32,310
I think you could and it doesn't hurt

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,560
but I don't I don't actually see a

00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:35,760
juxtaposition between that and and

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,170
saying hey you know we have this

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,209
distribution it's

00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:41,910
you know one aspect of it you know the

00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:44,100
addition is kind of very focused on good

00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:45,420
runtimes for containers somebody asks

00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,149
you back how to build a particular

00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:49,380
container you know that but we have lots

00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:51,000
of them available we have a community

00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,980
around it you know come and join us and

00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,290
talk about it I mean so I'm not a

00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:57,930
hundred percent in agreement that you

00:10:55,290 --> 00:11:00,329
actually need that expert in the

00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:02,040
objective just because you know you want

00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:06,240
to kind of approach fedora their

00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:08,579
potential fedora people yeah I basically

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,380
agree with that except I think sometimes

00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:13,860
some that some of these new technologies

00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:16,800
are kind of scary and foreign to people

00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:18,779
who are in the ambassador's not that

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,130
it's things are changing a lot these are

00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:21,089
new things and you're not you just

00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,769
because you're an ambassador doesn't

00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:25,410
mean you're up on everything so I think

00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:28,290
that it would be good as a project and

00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:31,649
if you know people doing the doing the

00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:33,810
objectives have materials that are

00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:35,639
useful for the Ambassador is like we

00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:37,740
need to start producing those things as

00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:40,440
part of the documentation stuff part of

00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:42,899
marketing like this is things that so so

00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,459
if you're an ambassador who is basically

00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:45,660
you have a crash course in what you're

00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:47,940
talking about when you go to the

00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:50,279
conference that you don't feel like

00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,990
you're too stupid to be there you know

00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:55,640
the basics and you know like where to

00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:55,640
refer to people to other things as well

00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:10,680
this is this topic is something which

00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:13,170
mine chair should care about and I think

00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:15,240
one of the main goals of mine cherish is

00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:17,690
to improve the communication between

00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:21,269
technical teams and outreach teams and

00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:26,390
this could lead also to find out which

00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:30,300
persons we need in that event and to be

00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:34,410
as best present as possible to the user

00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:36,060
experience sending sending there to

00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:41,399
ambassadors which don't know anything

00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:44,220
about containers doesn't make that sense

00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:46,709
I think so having one expert and one

00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:49,880
ambassador is much much more useful than

00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:49,880
having two ambassadors there

00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:56,370
I was just gonna add very briefly well I

00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,870
agree with everything that's been said

00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:00,660
I'm gonna play devil's advocate on the

00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:02,910
other side I work for the OSS team at

00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:05,400
Red Hat as part of my role and one of

00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:08,070
the things that my boss metrics my team

00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:11,490
mates on is the number of times that we

00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:12,930
sent someone who wasn't us and so I

00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:15,540
would turn that around a bit to the

00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:17,400
ambassadors and I would say part of your

00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:19,710
role is of course to represent the

00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:22,140
project part of your role is to identify

00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:24,810
where the project should be represented

00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:27,390
and to get the right person to the right

00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:30,570
place so there are definitely certain

00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:33,420
events certain kinds of talks etc where

00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:36,240
we may literally send no ambassadors and

00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:38,250
we give somebody the equivalent of what

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,620
Matthew brought up which is here's the

00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:42,570
sheet on how you help somebody get to

00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:44,340
the rest of the project but we're

00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:46,890
expecting you to go there because you're

00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:48,750
a kernel engineer and they're all kernel

00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:51,930
engineers and that's what they're going

00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:55,890
to be talking about so it kind of works

00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:58,200
both ways as an outreach activity so

00:13:55,890 --> 00:14:00,030
just another form of that to keep in

00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:05,100
mind and and I apologize you were gonna

00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:07,500
stalk and then I'm just gonna add some

00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,270
context too because I knew like some of

00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,830
the concern is also with about budget

00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:12,360
and like a smaller pool of fedora

00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:18,740
ambassadors I can in the specific

00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:21,540
example of North America so right right

00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:24,330
so you have greater travel costs in

00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:25,830
combination with possibly fewer events

00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,300
because you would have increased travel

00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:34,320
costs to get people from different areas

00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:36,510
in locations so uh right so I think in

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,980
my mind I think definitely a huge part

00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:40,590
of this is along with mine share and

00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,670
trying to create easier talking points

00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:43,200
for some of these more advanced

00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:45,180
technical topics so we can't actually

00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,010
send people from our existing pool and

00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:48,900
try to train them on some or train them

00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:51,720
provide them with the information and

00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:53,910
tools for success to be to have an

00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,950
impact at these new kind of events so I

00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:58,950
think it would be a combination of kind

00:14:55,950 --> 00:15:00,600
of both things of being strategic with

00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:02,580
kind of the people we are sending to

00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,840
events which might bring increased

00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:05,490
travel cost and like an example

00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:09,060
of North America where you might have a

00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:11,190
15 people for both sides of the of the

00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:13,860
coast right but I also think another

00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:15,600
part of it is also putting confidence

00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,040
into our existing pool of ambassadors

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,200
which i think is something that has been

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,340
identified already as an active focus to

00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,050
try to make some of these really

00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:24,810
complicated and really complex things

00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:26,250
into more easier to understand talking

00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:27,570
points like an example of marketing we

00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,100
have like it's kind of like these things

00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:30,690
that we have like talking points every

00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,640
release we have like what's new in

00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:35,340
fedora new things in workstation server

00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:37,170
cloud or atomic so it's really easy for

00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:39,420
an ambassador to understand I think

00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:42,000
that's a really great way for us to try

00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:43,920
to kind of take some of these technical

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,660
topics even some things that aren't

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,150
already included like in the marketing

00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:49,890
talking points to try to make it easier

00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:51,810
for our ambassadors to understand these

00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:54,120
things and also have the confidence and

00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:55,620
feel like they can be successful at some

00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,700
of these kinds of events so I feel like

00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:59,040
it's kind of a middle ground approach

00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:00,480
that we need to take where it be also

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,280
some of the ambassadors trying to do

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,680
more outreach maybe other people in our

00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:06,570
community and coming with maybe a little

00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,640
higher travel cost for some of them in

00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:12,000
combination with providing the resources

00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:13,770
and information to help our existing

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,440
ambassadors feel competent at these kind

00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:19,440
of events so Brian was just showing me

00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:22,470
here had this rank migrated over

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:25,080
directly according to the budget page

00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:27,870
today there's $42,000 in unallocated

00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:30,240
cash so I'm not worried about the

00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:32,100
ability of a region to come back and go

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,560
we have this event we need somebody yet

00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,570
and it's gonna have an extra $400 plane

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,270
ticket or $1,000 plane ticket and cost

00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:40,590
with hotels associated with it and we

00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:42,810
don't have the money in our current

00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:44,970
budget we know why it's important to be

00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:46,170
there we need that money and that's part

00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,880
of the goal of what the council is doing

00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:49,500
by sitting on this pot of money is not

00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,580
because we enjoy swimming in it like

00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,520
Scrooge McDuck

00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:56,940
but it's because we want to have this

00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:58,860
money available for these kinds of

00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:00,810
important functions and not necessarily

00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:03,060
locked up in a sub budget somewhere

00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:04,680
where we can't access it to hand it to

00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:07,040
the group that's got the idea to run to

00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,040
the finish line

00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:34,520
that actually dovetails into what I was

00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:38,600
gonna say but basically you're saying

00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:39,830
you know and but you don't want to you

00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:44,289
don't want to throw our booth populated

00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:44,289
with salespeople right or non-technical

00:17:47,169 --> 00:17:54,860
right so you know I guess I guess I

00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:57,530
don't necessarily share the I don't mind

00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:58,970
being an idiot so you know I'll walk in

00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:00,289
there and anybody asked me a question if

00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:02,840
I don't know the answer I'll go find out

00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:05,090
and then I'll bring it back to them but

00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,230
the only point I was gonna add really

00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:06,650
which kind of dovetails what you're

00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:08,210
talking about

00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:10,400
I think there's actually ridiculously

00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:14,150
more experts available than you may be

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,710
aware of I know for me like I didn't

00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:17,990
know for a long time that there was the

00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:19,490
kind of that there was a channel for

00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:22,130
which I could say hey I'm gonna be in

00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:24,650
this area you know is there anything I

00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:26,090
can do to like present at a meet-up or

00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:28,460
something like that

00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:30,260
so I actually think there's there's

00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:32,780
probably more experts out there than

00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:36,169
necessarily realize they don't know that

00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:38,120
there's a need to be able to may in a

00:18:36,169 --> 00:18:40,130
booth or whatever so you might be

00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:42,980
pleasantly surprised if we find a better

00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:44,630
way to try to find them and I think

00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:47,809
that's part of the issue which you're

00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:49,460
kind of identifying for but I do think

00:18:47,809 --> 00:18:52,460
that there may be more than you know of

00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:55,570
that we have to figure out how to expose

00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:55,570
or whatever the reward is

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:04,530
I just would like to ask a question do

00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:07,710
you see or the proposal you made is it

00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:10,170
some issue you are currently facing or

00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:12,380
is it a proposal how to make things

00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,380
better

00:19:23,290 --> 00:20:32,360
ok so it's not like we need to so I I'm

00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:34,370
gonna actually in order to only because

00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:36,140
I think that there's gonna be some great

00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:39,440
conversation on these kinds of specific

00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:42,650
level ways to solve this in sessions

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:47,230
like the mind share session and yes when

00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:50,960
is your session I'm sorry

00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:53,660
Thursday Thursday at 2 p.m. in the mind

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:58,160
share session there's a session by n B

00:20:53,660 --> 00:21:00,140
and Jana at Thursday at 3 p.m.

00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:02,690
how convenient like it's almost like the

00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:04,370
scheduling committee knew but they're

00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:07,190
gonna be talking about the future of

00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:08,990
ambassadors as well so I think that for

00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:11,750
the purposes of the council conversation

00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:14,210
we should keep it not to necessarily how

00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:17,330
ambassadors can affect the change as

00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:19,310
much as how can we as council support

00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:21,590
you in effecting a change that makes

00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:24,650
sense and it may be a different thing in

00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:27,700
na or for American ambassadors then say

00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,700
for Greek ambassadors

00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:33,680
yeah that's actually just what I was

00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:35,750
gonna say I think we need to make sure

00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:37,490
there's a bridge between the specific

00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:39,020
objectives like right now there are two

00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:41,420
so it's not like we have an infinite

00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:43,940
list of things to worry about so you

00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:45,350
know talk to Langdon talk to staff like

00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:48,020
maybe set up a thing with the

00:21:45,350 --> 00:22:45,590
ambassadors and they and those working

00:21:48,020 --> 00:22:49,460
groups and see what yeah so basically if

00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:52,550
you look at fedora next right as the

00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:56,200
beginning we've kind of been proceeding

00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:59,150
along that path and we had next right

00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:01,070
this one note so we have Fedora next

00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:03,260
which led to kind of the ring story

00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:04,580
which led to the addition story and then

00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:09,370
it kind of morphed into the modularity

00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:09,370
story you're supposed to be here stuff

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,200
so and the the question basically is

00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:18,980
that how should we be explaining

00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,450
modularity as an objective as you know

00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,950
maybe the ring story it was simpler to

00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:24,110
explain the additions was simpler to

00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:26,950
explain and personally the way I

00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:29,360
explained modularity is it's a desire to

00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:30,950
disconnect the lifecycle of the

00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,320
particularly the OS from the

00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:35,390
applications that sit on top of it and

00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:37,250
the applications from each other which

00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:39,740
is kind of the antithesis of the

00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:41,690
distribution model so that's really what

00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:42,320
the goal of modularity is it's taking

00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:43,880
the

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,230
ditions and going another step further

00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,450
and saying how can we actually

00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:51,259
disconnect the individual pieces from

00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:53,799
each other someone on the developers

00:23:51,259 --> 00:23:58,370
said in response to basically that

00:23:53,799 --> 00:24:00,830
that's not really a goal that's a step

00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:03,799
on the way to some other goal what is

00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:06,080
the what what does doing that get us if

00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:10,610
we if we have that split what do we get

00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:13,039
from it Adam I think actually came up

00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:14,629
with this tagline and which is giving a

00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:17,659
user the version of the thing that they

00:24:14,629 --> 00:24:19,340
want when they want it instead of the

00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:21,860
you know kind of the authors and the

00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:23,690
distribution deciding what version of

00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:26,779
things that a user wants and when they

00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:28,279
get it is I really like that explanation

00:24:26,779 --> 00:24:31,519
but it's I think it's easier written

00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:32,960
than it is verbally does that make sense

00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:36,740
anybody can somebody else paraphrase

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:40,009
that differently so right now Fedora

00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:42,230
tells you when you get the new version

00:24:40,009 --> 00:24:44,179
of whatever right and you get it whether

00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:45,710
you like it or not right you can you can

00:24:44,179 --> 00:24:47,960
try to pin you can try to hack it you

00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:49,580
can try to avoid upgrades but basically

00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:52,190
Fedora tells you when you will get

00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:54,740
something modularity the idea is the

00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:57,320
reverse is that Fedora makes it

00:24:54,740 --> 00:25:00,139
available and then you choose as a

00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:02,450
consumer when to consume it and so that

00:25:00,139 --> 00:25:03,740
consumer could be you know you take

00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:05,840
something like read mine which it's like

00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:07,519
a ticketing system and rails right so

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,350
whenever the new version of rails comes

00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:11,000
out fedora pushes that new version or

00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:12,830
else and you're gonna get it for read

00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,629
mine whether read mine is ready for it

00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:17,210
or not right my actually my classic

00:25:14,629 --> 00:25:18,559
example of this was Pete sorry Drupal

00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:22,220
ice worked for a company that

00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:24,710
specialized in doin Drupal and PHP 5 2

00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:27,080
to 5 3 had caused breaking changes in

00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:29,779
Drupal and all of the distro is upgraded

00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:33,139
to 5 3 and lots and lots of drupal broke

00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:34,639
and so that's exactly the problem we're

00:25:33,139 --> 00:25:36,440
trying to avoid right so you have that

00:25:34,639 --> 00:25:38,480
kind of consumer which is like a

00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:40,120
developer consuming the new version of

00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,990
things when they're ready to consume it

00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,700
and then you have other kinds of

00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:45,950
consumers like you know humans who are

00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:48,259
sitting at our workstation they want you

00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:49,340
know the the rolling release of Firefox

00:25:48,259 --> 00:25:51,379
because they want the bleeding edge

00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:53,120
version oh wait but this other guy

00:25:51,379 --> 00:25:54,950
doesn't because none of his extensions

00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,730
work right so you have all these

00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:56,800
different use case

00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:59,180
where all these different people

00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:01,280
depending on the scenario in which they

00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:03,560
find themselves have completely

00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:05,870
different rules for when they want to

00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:09,590
upgrade or you know or remain the same

00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:12,740
and everybody thinks that their own

00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:16,730
personal experience is the actual answer

00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:18,440
for everyone else right and in fact it's

00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:20,090
pretty much by use case and you may even

00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,440
have different answers depending on

00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:23,600
which computer you're talking about

00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,950
right so in your container for example

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,710
you may want all the bleeding edge stuff

00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:29,600
right or in your you know server in your

00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:31,820
basement you want you know nothing to

00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,530
ever upgrade ever right or on your

00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:35,510
laptop you want the bleeding version of

00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:38,960
you know Firefox but you want them to

00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:39,980
leave Emacs alone you know so everybody

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,180
has different answers these questions

00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:42,530
they have different answers these

00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:44,450
questions depending on the time of the

00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:46,070
day and use case and scenario and

00:26:44,450 --> 00:27:12,200
environment and that's we want to

00:26:46,070 --> 00:27:20,990
annealing Mike McGrath makes a ready

00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:25,010
reference so an example of kind of

00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:26,300
communities so I actually don't know it

00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:30,320
either and I actually has read it too

00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:31,790
but so another example is when you talk

00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,430
about community use cases so in other

00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:35,870
words does the nodejs community have the

00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:37,820
same requirements out of their

00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:39,470
distribution or have the same life cycle

00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:40,790
out of their distribution or what they

00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:43,250
you know what they want to give to their

00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:45,020
end users as the Perl community I mean

00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:50,990
you know any day now we'll get Perl six

00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:52,550
right so it's not the one right and

00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:54,140
there's no way in a traditional

00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:57,350
distribution model not it not just

00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:59,600
fedora any of them to definitely allow

00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:01,370
for any sort of variation between

00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,530
different kinds of communities you know

00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:05,600
no it's a great example right I mean you

00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:07,790
know Nome wants to rebase whatever it's

00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,600
every six months every year every six

00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:11,210
months

00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:13,430
you know and part of the reason for the

00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:15,260
release timeline for fedora right now is

00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:17,930
because of juleps II right because they

00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,920
want to release every six months so you

00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:20,300
know we have all of these communities

00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,710
that have different needs and different

00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:23,090
goals and then we have all these

00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:24,670
different end you and those are

00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:26,960
different different kinds of consumers

00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:32,000
all of them want to set their own life

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:33,950
cycle around different things so one

00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,650
thing I think I've seen a lot of the

00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:39,320
like modularity gives us a lot of

00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:41,450
capability to do a lot of things and I

00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:43,220
think some of it is a just because we

00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:46,520
could do that doesn't mean we're going

00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:47,690
to let alone that we should so one of

00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:49,340
the things I think is the question is

00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:51,110
like how many modules are current we

00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:53,300
gonna have is there a separate module

00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:56,720
for every individual package will there

00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:59,870
be 14 versions of like G Cal available

00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:02,270
to everybody I hope not I that would be

00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:06,020
terrible we can't possibly sustain that

00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:08,750
so I think that modules are going to be

00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:13,220
your leaf applications and things like

00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:14,720
language stacks probably maybe not but I

00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,770
think that's where we'll focus things I

00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,350
think things will kind of grow out of

00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:19,430
there rather than the now everything's a

00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:22,490
module

00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:24,230
good luck put together a distro I don't

00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:27,350
I think that a lot of the worry I've

00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:28,940
seen kind of is projecting that endpoint

00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:30,350
and worrying from it and I don't think

00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:35,990
that's where we're aiming for

00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:38,330
is that so the and and there's a key

00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:40,580
difference about it enables a lot of

00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:44,090
things that we could do but you know

00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:47,420
what right now we can't do half this

00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:49,610
stuff right we can't do 80% of it we it

00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:51,110
just it fundamentally doesn't fit

00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:52,520
through our infrastructure it doesn't

00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:55,070
you know we have an infrastructure that

00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:57,470
is designed around taking binaries

00:29:55,070 --> 00:30:01,370
putting them into rpms and producing one

00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:03,110
product right we went crazy and now

00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:05,390
produce a few different products and oh

00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:07,970
my god the heartache involved in making

00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:10,220
all of that stuff go right like that's

00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:12,260
just going from one to like five right

00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:13,880
you started introducing containers and

00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:15,110
they you want to have specialized VMs or

00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,760
you want to have specialized anything

00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:19,370
like it just goes insane the

00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:21,080
infrastructure just falls apart and what

00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:22,110
it really also lets you do is lets you

00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,299
start to think about it

00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:27,299
currently and part of the goal for me is

00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:29,850
that I don't know where it's gonna go

00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:32,940
and like this guy for example decided

00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:35,309
hey here's a way we can model CI right

00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:36,120
in using modularity right I mean you

00:30:35,309 --> 00:30:38,670
might have been able to do it another

00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:40,770
way but I'm gonna hassle stuff and make

00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:47,120
any answer about using atomic 4 modules

00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:51,870
was all modularity is the ShamWow of a

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:54,330
atomic host based on CI there's a list

00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:59,150
of stuff that we've been talking about

00:30:54,330 --> 00:31:02,460
for how to make atomic host development

00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:04,740
automatable such as reverting changes

00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:08,429
that are broken rolling back a package

00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:11,220
that later was found to have that should

00:31:08,429 --> 00:31:15,720
not have gone out or I'm describing the

00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:17,549
exact env ours and and content that

00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,960
should go into a compose and there's a

00:31:17,549 --> 00:31:22,380
there's a list of these types of things

00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,690
that if you don't use modules to solve

00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:27,570
that problem you can invent something

00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:32,760
that looks a lot like modules to solve

00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:34,620
that problem and so modules I think as a

00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:36,900
concept they work really well we need to

00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:39,450
of course work out the kinks I think and

00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:44,010
see when we splice that into the to the

00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:45,780
CI concepts for atomic host but but it

00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:48,360
really does answer a lot of questions

00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:50,280
and I think that's good

00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:54,090
let's see where can you get more info

00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:56,910
this the CI the objective that we have

00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:59,250
for CI CD enumerates these and refers to

00:31:56,910 --> 00:32:01,740
modularity so there's bullet points down

00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:05,309
I think you scroll past the the fold

00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:07,020
you'll find that on the wiki page the

00:32:05,309 --> 00:32:09,809
only point I was trying to make there is

00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:12,570
that I wanted you know I wanted

00:32:09,809 --> 00:32:14,610
modularity to allow for people to think

00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:17,669
about the problems they're looking at

00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:19,740
differently right it's not you know rpm

00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:22,320
is not the single answer right you know

00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:23,610
or our Koji or whatever you know like

00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,850
I'm not sure whether quite the right

00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:29,760
word but it's like the fedora way is not

00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:31,559
the only way we can have we can think

00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:35,789
about things completely differently if

00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:38,039
we can kind of make our pipeline more

00:32:35,789 --> 00:32:40,049
flexible and that's really what the goal

00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:59,190
is who knows where it'll go

00:32:40,049 --> 00:33:00,539
I mean that's the point if ik problem

00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:03,080
with explaining it and also it's a

00:33:00,539 --> 00:33:03,080
general problem

00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:28,559
next question yeah we're gonna actually

00:33:26,789 --> 00:33:30,989
usually we're gonna pause for a moment

00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:32,669
since we're on video and Steph showed up

00:33:30,989 --> 00:33:33,539
we're going to do a quick round of

00:33:32,669 --> 00:33:35,519
introductions

00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:39,149
just so we've got that captured for

00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:41,609
folks not present is Josh Moyer the

00:33:39,149 --> 00:33:50,429
Fusco representatives so if you're on

00:33:41,609 --> 00:33:55,919
video know that he's not here yes I'm

00:33:50,429 --> 00:33:58,799
Robert Myer al Robbie doc I'm the main

00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:02,820
lead of the website's team fans

00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:08,819
co-member counsel for last doing

00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:11,970
releases and actually also pharma my

00:34:08,819 --> 00:34:17,369
main goals are representing the

00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:22,619
community so the non red-hot part of our

00:34:17,369 --> 00:34:25,159
community and trying to get as much as

00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:31,129
possible outside through outreach teams

00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:31,129
what we decide in inside the council

00:34:32,089 --> 00:34:42,419
okay so my name is yang Creek so the

00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:44,099
shortcut on IRC is Jerry Creek and I'm

00:34:42,419 --> 00:34:46,579
program manager for fedora

00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:48,540
that means I'm thinking taking care of

00:34:46,579 --> 00:34:51,770
scheduling

00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:54,780
change wrangler election wrangler and

00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:58,550
all these not all but some of these

00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:58,550
administrative stuff around

00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:04,109
i'm brian axel beard i'm back so be on

00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:07,650
IRC i'm the fedora community action and

00:35:04,109 --> 00:35:09,570
impact coordinator the f cake I mostly

00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:13,050
have secret cabal meetings with matthew

00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:15,660
Miller and I work to try and empower the

00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:18,060
community to get to where it wants to go

00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:20,700
whether that serving as a liaison with

00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:25,109
our primary sponsor red hat whether that

00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:27,150
is you know working actually on hacking

00:35:25,109 --> 00:35:28,680
on things doing things showing up the

00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:30,030
conference's whatever it is that I need

00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:33,890
to do to help the community be

00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:33,890
successful that is what my job title is

00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:38,340
I'm matthew Miller I'm the Thoreau

00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:39,630
project leader I've been doing this for

00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,460
longer than any other Fedora project

00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:47,040
leader which probably makes me the

00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:51,060
craziest I think that's Matt diem on all

00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:54,060
of the things hi my name is Justin

00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:56,520
Florrie my fast is J flurry seven IRC

00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:58,230
jwf I'm involved in a lot of different

00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:00,000
non-technical areas in the project like

00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:03,060
community operations ambassadors

00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,760
marketing the diversity team a few other

00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:08,160
areas I was elected to the council this

00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:14,970
past election so I'm be serving for the

00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:20,369
next two release cycles I'm Steph Steph

00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:22,740
W on IRC I've contributed to over a

00:36:20,369 --> 00:36:26,190
hundred different open source projects

00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:28,740
and that points to what I'm really

00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:30,359
interested about in Linux is integrating

00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:32,340
it bringing it together and making it

00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:34,440
work so I've been involved in cockpit

00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:37,500
doing that talking to all sorts of parts

00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:41,580
of the system and building a UI out of

00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:45,359
it and now we in that project we we used

00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:47,580
machines and BOTS and robots really

00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:50,280
effectively its contributors to the

00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:52,530
project and got really far down that

00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:55,470
road down all the way to machine

00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:59,369
learning and training machines and so on

00:36:55,470 --> 00:37:01,650
and I'd like to help fedora be able to

00:36:59,369 --> 00:37:02,340
take advantage of that by doing see ICD

00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:04,140
and

00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:10,560
which are really the foundation of those

00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:12,690
things I'm Langdon and Langdon most

00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:17,820
places except on Twitter where I am one

00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:20,700
followed by angin but let's see so I

00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:24,210
think I am primarily thought of as the

00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:28,380
person who sets things on fire but yeah

00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:31,980
that's pretty much me I really I try to

00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:34,230
think about how do we you know what

00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:36,150
what's coming like how are we gonna do

00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:38,100
the next thing and how are we gonna be

00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:40,500
capable of doing the next thing and then

00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:43,920
how can we take this kind of really

00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:45,420
amorphous future land problem and break

00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,920
it down into pieces that we can then

00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:48,960
turn into things like the factory to

00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:50,520
project or turning into things like the

00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,070
bass runtime and hosting platform

00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:55,620
projects or how do we you know kind of

00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:57,570
specialize out into taking you know

00:37:55,620 --> 00:38:02,910
modules and bringing them back together

00:37:57,570 --> 00:38:06,150
again so so my general goal I think is I

00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:09,290
want to see you know Fedora be the

00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:11,700
distribution as somebody quoted that

00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:14,850
can't think of the article but basically

00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:17,370
it's like I want innovation around the

00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:19,980
OS right I don't want us to be an

00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:23,220
upstream consumer that packages and

00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:26,910
distributes I want the I want us driving

00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:30,090
change and how people consume software

00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:31,800
and my end state goal is like completely

00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:34,250
nutter so we can talk about that fear or

00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,250
something

00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:17,279
so I'll repeat the question briefly

00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:20,220
there was recently a lively discussion

00:39:17,279 --> 00:39:23,400
on developed where it was posited that

00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:25,920
perhaps there were ways to build parts

00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:27,839
of fedora without rpm and the question

00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,809
becomes is that a core part of our

00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:33,299
identity and basically should we ride

00:39:30,809 --> 00:39:35,309
rpm into the sunset if it's a sunset or

00:39:33,299 --> 00:39:37,140
into the future if it's the future or

00:39:35,309 --> 00:39:38,940
should we give serious consideration to

00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:44,940
possibly having parts of it or that our

00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:50,190
RP unless said I'm gonna go first before

00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:52,799
Lange that talks so yeah I think that

00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:56,309
there are a lot of valuable things that

00:39:52,799 --> 00:39:57,960
rpm brings to the distro and the RPM

00:39:56,309 --> 00:40:01,650
management tools that are important to

00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:03,839
people I think doing those things in a

00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:07,890
good way that preserves the value that

00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:10,200
people get from them is core but I don't

00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:12,269
think that we should saddle ourselves to

00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:21,960
that horse as it rides out into the

00:40:12,269 --> 00:40:25,819
ocean or whatever not very far so so I

00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:29,609
largely agree I mean I think rpm is a

00:40:25,819 --> 00:40:31,710
euphemism for a bunch of things that

00:40:29,609 --> 00:40:34,650
that technology happens to bring to the

00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:37,980
table for fedora right reproducibility

00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:39,839
traceability metadata around what you

00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:43,619
know what the thing is dependency

00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:46,890
structure you know licensing lots and

00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:48,150
lots and lots of different stuff you can

00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:50,549
look at all in one space to find all the

00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:52,470
nice software one of the things that you

00:40:50,549 --> 00:40:54,359
know kind of that I would say mostly rpm

00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:56,759
distres value is that upgrades are

00:40:54,359 --> 00:41:00,240
unattended you know things like that

00:40:56,759 --> 00:41:02,279
it's not actually rpm right I mean maybe

00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,019
it is for some people but I know I

00:41:02,279 --> 00:41:05,700
certainly don't care about the

00:41:04,019 --> 00:41:09,120
particular piece of software that is per

00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:11,540
that that set of features I think the

00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:13,830
set of features is incredibly important

00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:15,960
and right now we have a thing that

00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:20,070
delivers that set of features so why

00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:22,410
would we write a new one but that said

00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:24,750
does it mean that perhaps we may want to

00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:27,360
you know expand upon it or write a new

00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:28,800
one or whatever we might but you know

00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:31,920
just like why would we sit down and

00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:34,920
rewrite Cote you know for you know

00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,960
there's potentially value there sure but

00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,880
it's a huge amount of work and most

00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:42,480
importantly it is a huge amount of

00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:44,880
testing right we know Kouji delivers

00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,320
what it delivers today we know rpm

00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:49,800
delivers what it delivers today through

00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:51,930
many many years of proving it the second

00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:54,450
you try to Greenfield that you're in

00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:56,400
trouble right that is a lot of work I'm

00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:57,780
speaking as a software consultant who

00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:02,280
made a lot of money on doing those

00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:04,620
things it is very very dangerous so like

00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:07,110
I said I don't I'm certainly not married

00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:09,120
to rpm you know or young or DNF or any

00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:11,070
of the kind of tool chain around it but

00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:12,930
I am very married to the feature set it

00:42:11,070 --> 00:43:09,210
brings and it's a really good tool of

00:42:12,930 --> 00:43:11,370
doing it so why bother doing so to

00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:13,470
paraphrase the question statement for

00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:16,650
discussion during the State of the Union

00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:20,160
we saw a slide where Apple growth was

00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:22,829
to be both on a very strong upward trend

00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:24,990
and significantly larger than Fedora

00:43:22,829 --> 00:43:28,109
growth and the question is how do we

00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:31,289
convert Apple users into Fedora users

00:43:28,109 --> 00:43:33,420
and contributors or I'm kind of

00:43:31,289 --> 00:43:35,339
paraphrasing here but but also get them

00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:38,160
frankly to identify the source of the

00:43:35,339 --> 00:43:40,559
thing which they love is one of the

00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:42,359
takeaways and the question was kind of a

00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:51,569
discussion point for the counsel of what

00:43:42,359 --> 00:43:52,680
do you think of these things well why

00:43:51,569 --> 00:43:55,109
don't we start with someone from the

00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:57,650
audience mr McGrath please no reddit

00:43:55,109 --> 00:43:57,650
references

00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:44,980
I'll paraphrase that briefly then we

00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:46,270
think that all they're there is some

00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:48,460
percentage of Apple growth that is

00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:50,140
driven by the use of Amazon Linux which

00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:53,140
can also make use of a lot of Apple

00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:55,630
packages and they present very different

00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:58,480
use cases and user base and so that may

00:44:55,630 --> 00:45:00,100
potentially create a different answer

00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,900
for what we might want to do with this

00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:03,190
question to think about it outside of

00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:34,960
the bounds of the Enterprise Linux

00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:36,490
family of distributions so I'm I want to

00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,870
be very careful when I paraphrase you

00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:39,730
here in case someone watches the video

00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:43,060
so please correct me if I if I miss

00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:44,050
state or misspoke misspeak yeah all

00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:47,970
right you can correct all of those

00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:51,220
things too but basically there is

00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:54,250
interest potentially in seeing Amazon

00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:57,190
become a greater contributing partner to

00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:59,200
Apple in both pushing tools and agents

00:45:57,190 --> 00:46:01,540
that are Amazon Linux specific but also

00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:03,280
perhaps becoming members of the

00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:05,920
packaging and contributing community

00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:09,640
around heavily used Apple packages

00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:11,890
within the Amazon Linux space said okay

00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:16,480
thank you that may not be held against

00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:19,270
anyone on this video all right we will

00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:22,180
finally let Matthew talk what was I even

00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:23,830
going to say no I think Amazon people

00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:25,060
who are watching I really like to

00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:26,980
encourage you to get involved directly

00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:29,950
in fedora and working on Apple there

00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:31,030
that would be awesome and if you would

00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:32,890
like to talk to me about that

00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:39,010
off-the-record on-the-record whatever

00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:41,020
I'm here for you in general or on with

00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:42,760
Santos in particular I guess you know

00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:44,290
now that Santos is kind of part of the

00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:47,080
Red Hat family we've got sent to us

00:46:44,290 --> 00:46:48,670
people here at this conference I would

00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:50,560
really like to work more in building

00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:52,000
those bridges and making sent to us feel

00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,620
people feel like they're part of the

00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,630
Fedora community and

00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:59,800
the other way around as much as much as

00:46:55,630 --> 00:47:02,020
we can as well I I have some hopes for

00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:03,670
modularity along these lines I think I

00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:05,320
mentioned that in my keynote if I didn't

00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:07,420
I skipped something I think is important

00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:11,050
which is that you as we're building

00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:13,360
modules those modules should run on you

00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:15,430
know the Enterprise Linux stuff as well

00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:17,620
and I think that's an opportunity for

00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:19,840
bridging things there I'd like to see

00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:21,760
you know like sent OS SIG's if we have

00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:24,340
modules that have like a three year life

00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:26,380
span I'd love to see that be a send to

00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:28,720
us cig working on that in fedora to

00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:30,700
maintain that longer life span kind of

00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:33,640
fitting with the Santo s brand for a

00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:35,350
longer longer maintenance window I don't

00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:36,820
know how we'll figure all that out but I

00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:40,510
think we've got some opportunities for

00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:42,820
building that up yeah I think we've now

00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:44,950
I have envious of our Susa friends

00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:47,350
because they've got all this stuff under

00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:49,000
one nice marketing name bubble of their

00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:51,340
leap and tumbleweed and all those things

00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,710
together and we have some of the same

00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:55,510
kind of thing but we've segmented into

00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:58,060
separate communities and it would be

00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:59,980
nice to build those bridges up so people

00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:03,310
who are sent to us users using Apple

00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:05,410
feel like I am a fedora user and we

00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:06,880
don't feel like the people who are sent

00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:09,640
to us you they need that sent to us base

00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:11,590
OS like we don't feel like you can't be

00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:13,540
really part of our community unless you

00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:15,610
switch out your base OS for the one that

00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:19,810
changes every six months because that's

00:48:15,610 --> 00:48:21,370
not doing us any favors either you kind

00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:24,160
of touched on some of what I say a very

00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:26,920
smart man said to me early into my role

00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:29,440
that Apple is in many ways the core of

00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:31,390
what Fedora is because it is our core

00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:33,100
packaging it is where a lot of but

00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:35,440
certainly not all of our contribution

00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:38,560
has taken place historically and an

00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:40,090
interesting objective idea that as a

00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:41,740
council member I would love to see

00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:46,620
fleshed out would be something around

00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:49,510
how do we grow participation in Apple as

00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:52,900
a way of talking about the Fedora

00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:56,740
project because that may you know we

00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:58,630
heard from our friend at Amazon we we

00:48:56,740 --> 00:49:01,000
have a lot of opportunity there to bring

00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:03,220
packages that might not ever land in

00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,990
fedora proper without outside assistance

00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:05,570
of people who are not already in our

00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:08,720
community

00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:10,460
so that could be a really cool third

00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:12,440
seat which we did not represent with

00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:14,870
empty seats but we have the opportunity

00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:34,040
to put more chairs up here for more than

00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:40,100
just the missing Josh Moyer is the

00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:44,500
engineering side rep so Josh should I

00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:44,500
didn't want too many people at the table

00:49:47,410 --> 00:50:04,250
other questions and comments so going

00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:06,220
this kind of goes back to the aligning

00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:09,170
everything with objectives question and

00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:10,730
so the question that was supposed to me

00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:13,040
was basically with somebody who's been

00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:18,410
an active ambassador for I don't ever

00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:19,550
and that you know they recognized the

00:50:18,410 --> 00:50:20,960
kind of statement of that there's

00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:22,910
missing objectives and maybe we need to

00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,200
build those up so that they're

00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:28,160
reflective of the things that the

00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:30,800
ambassadors do or need to do but the

00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:32,480
question was basically like that they

00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:35,120
felt like that their ambassador

00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:36,380
commitment was already the the edge of

00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:38,780
the amount of effort that they could

00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:40,610
provide or you know contribution that

00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:43,400
they could provide and that actually

00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:44,840
being an objective lead you know much

00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:47,230
less writing the objective but maybe

00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:51,830
being the objective lead was too much

00:50:47,230 --> 00:50:57,890
time from from them so that's the

00:50:51,830 --> 00:51:09,920
question do you form your question in

00:50:57,890 --> 00:51:11,300
the form of a question this person just

00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,920
doesn't have the time you're expecting

00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:14,850
somebody else to have the time are there

00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:16,920
ways

00:51:14,850 --> 00:51:18,900
that we opposed in there was ways that

00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:21,450
you could expand the effort so you could

00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:22,860
actually have several people right that

00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:26,220
we're going to be leading an objective

00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:28,230
potentially so that's the question is

00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:32,400
how does somebody go about this without

00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:34,170
a be too high very yeah so um it's

00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,760
definitely something that I expect would

00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:36,630
be a commitment right I mean there's

00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,190
something we don't somebody say I'm

00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:41,250
gonna be the objective lead and then not

00:51:38,190 --> 00:51:44,220
show up again that would not be good I

00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:46,410
think it doesn't necessarily need to be

00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:49,890
something that's a full-time job or a

00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:51,900
ten hour a week job it would be nice if

00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:53,520
person has the objective lead can show

00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:55,200
up to most of the council meetings

00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:58,440
especially ones that are related to that

00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:00,060
objective but also you know maybe check

00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:02,100
in you know once a month or so with the

00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:03,990
report on how this is going you know go

00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:05,850
to the related meetings and things so I

00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:07,770
think it's a it is a commitment but it's

00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:09,480
not it's not necessarily an

00:52:07,770 --> 00:52:11,400
insurmountable thing and it is also

00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:13,440
something that is you know time limited

00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:15,060
to this is in 18 you know 12 to 18 month

00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,860
kind of thing so you can say I'm good

00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:19,740
this is gonna be my project for this

00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:21,690
year kind of thing and not like from the

00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:23,640
rest of my life I am now the lead for

00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:25,440
this objective unless you want to keep

00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:34,560
read unless you're Langdon he's stuck

00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:36,150
with this does that objectives you can

00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:38,460
kind of think about them like open

00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:40,980
source projects you you rarely will be

00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:43,290
as successful alone as you will be with

00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:45,360
a group so you may have a great

00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:46,770
foundational idea for an objective and

00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:48,270
you can get it to the point that you

00:52:46,770 --> 00:52:50,370
bring in two or three people who are

00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:52,500
interested and one of them steps up to

00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:54,060
the plate to do the writing and one of

00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:56,040
them steps up to the plate to be the

00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:58,590
objective live I'll pick on Steph

00:52:56,040 --> 00:53:01,350
because the CI objective actually has a

00:52:58,590 --> 00:53:03,210
couple of people who were key in

00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:05,160
bringing it forward to the council and

00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:07,080
when the council debated it and we

00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:08,940
finally decided to approve it the big

00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:12,000
question we sent back to them was you

00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:13,560
guys pick one person to show up because

00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,380
we're not appointing everybody to the

00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:18,690
council as the objective rep and they

00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:19,890
had to go back to the table and I'm

00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:21,270
assuming it wasn't an arm-wrestling

00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:24,210
contest because Dusty's bigger than you

00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:26,910
but you know Steph Steph won or lost

00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:28,349
depending on how you look at this but I

00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:30,690
think there's a lot of

00:53:28,349 --> 00:53:32,369
therefore people to build a community

00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:34,410
around their objective to ensure its

00:53:32,369 --> 00:53:36,779
success and by virtue of that not have

00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:38,970
to overextend themselves yeah absolutely

00:53:36,779 --> 00:53:41,789
like like any open-source project if it

00:53:38,970 --> 00:53:43,650
is just your personal hobby thing the

00:53:41,789 --> 00:53:45,420
success is going to be limited if it's

00:53:43,650 --> 00:53:47,130
something where it is something there's

00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:49,200
a lot of people in the Fedora community

00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:51,029
who are interested in it you should be

00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:52,979
able to build up a community around it

00:53:51,029 --> 00:53:54,450
even if it's you know two or three core

00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:56,130
committed people and then some other

00:53:54,450 --> 00:53:58,019
people with smaller contributions around

00:53:56,130 --> 00:53:59,640
the edges I think things that are

00:53:58,019 --> 00:54:02,039
objectives should be things like that

00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:04,079
and if you have a great idea like I

00:54:02,039 --> 00:54:06,569
wanted somebody to show up and do a

00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:08,819
fedora and OpenShift ooh look how great

00:54:06,569 --> 00:54:11,190
we work together objective I put that

00:54:08,819 --> 00:54:13,200
idea out there and nobody showed up

00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:15,779
around to do it so we don't have that

00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:17,700
it's an objective because it takes it

00:54:15,779 --> 00:54:19,680
takes thing you know people committed to

00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:21,029
do it to make it happen I still hope

00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,170
we'll eventually get there because I

00:54:21,029 --> 00:54:23,789
think that's a good idea

00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:25,200
but right now we didn't really have the

00:54:23,789 --> 00:54:34,380
people with the interest to do it so

00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:35,819
it's not an objective yeah so I thought

00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:37,710
the answers were good and you know

00:54:35,819 --> 00:54:39,779
largely I think that was kind of how I

00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:41,160
answered as well but I wanted to kind of

00:54:39,779 --> 00:54:42,690
state it for the record and I think

00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:46,380
maybe I follow up blog post might be a

00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:47,999
good idea but then in a related way you

00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:50,309
said one thing is like how could you

00:54:47,999 --> 00:54:51,989
share this out what's the what's the

00:54:50,309 --> 00:54:54,479
recommended channel that we should be

00:54:51,989 --> 00:54:58,160
sending out calls for help for

00:54:54,479 --> 00:55:01,999
objectives would it be the community

00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:01,999
comm blog okay

00:55:04,190 --> 00:55:09,359
the answers for how to find help I think

00:55:06,539 --> 00:55:11,369
would be very similar to your question

00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:13,410
regarding finding people to assist with

00:55:11,369 --> 00:55:15,450
specific kinds of focused events in

00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:16,680
Ambassador hood look at the mailing

00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:18,630
lists within the project that are

00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:21,299
focused around that area look at the

00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:25,140
comm blog potentially even Fedora

00:55:21,299 --> 00:55:27,450
magazine depending on the topic comm

00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:29,160
blog has come a long way that group has

00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:32,160
done a fantastic job of I think creating

00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:34,799
an opportunity for us to talk to people

00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:36,359
across the project who may not realize

00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:38,759
they're interested in a topic so they

00:55:36,359 --> 00:55:40,910
never joined that mailing list so I'm

00:55:38,759 --> 00:55:47,930
gonna push very heavily on Comm blog

00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:50,900
mostly so Justin doesn't have to I mean

00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:52,999
I do really yes I mean it from the very

00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:55,220
beginning of when the Community Blog was

00:55:52,999 --> 00:55:56,479
created it was specifically with the

00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:58,430
motivation that there's these different

00:55:56,479 --> 00:56:00,529
silos across the project that normally

00:55:58,430 --> 00:56:01,940
wouldn't have a reason to communicate so

00:56:00,529 --> 00:56:03,109
you'll have different parts of the

00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:04,519
community they're all working in

00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:06,140
different areas and there might be like

00:56:04,519 --> 00:56:07,880
that missing bridge between the two and

00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:10,369
that's definitely when when we concept

00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:12,019
or when we concepted the comm blog that

00:56:10,369 --> 00:56:14,059
was part of the motivation that's part

00:56:12,019 --> 00:56:15,739
of the driving one of the driving

00:56:14,059 --> 00:56:17,390
motivations for the community operations

00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:18,529
team as a whole so if there was a group

00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:20,420
that I would say it would be willing to

00:56:18,529 --> 00:56:22,160
like have a conversation or help people

00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:24,979
with that I would also probably point

00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:28,249
people to calm ups if not the council

00:56:24,979 --> 00:56:31,039
for specific questions to create an

00:56:28,249 --> 00:56:33,739
objective order to go that route but as

00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:35,450
far as communicating information across

00:56:33,739 --> 00:56:37,609
different parts of the project that's

00:56:35,450 --> 00:56:39,259
definitely one of the driving

00:56:37,609 --> 00:56:42,019
motivations for comm ups and the

00:56:39,259 --> 00:56:43,970
community blog is one of those branches

00:56:42,019 --> 00:56:45,589
off of how we're trying to make it

00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:48,440
easier for people to keep up with things

00:56:45,589 --> 00:56:50,029
so I definitely recommend and I also

00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:51,019
would love feedback on this process too

00:56:50,029 --> 00:56:54,140
from people who have you ever written

00:56:51,019 --> 00:56:55,460
for the combo or ways to make it easier

00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:57,469
for people

00:56:55,460 --> 00:57:00,469
I guess ideally we would like it very

00:56:57,469 --> 00:57:02,029
easy to make it to make it easy for

00:57:00,469 --> 00:57:03,440
people to keep up with the information

00:57:02,029 --> 00:57:05,539
that they want to that's why you can go

00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:07,150
in the combo go to categories Council

00:57:05,539 --> 00:57:09,440
there's objectively as modularity

00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:11,960
project atomic and you can keep up with

00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:15,410
these very like very specific categories

00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:17,359
of fedora and it's the goal is to make

00:57:15,410 --> 00:57:19,700
it make that information accessible and

00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:21,499
visible as it was once said it's about

00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:23,719
bringing heat and light to these

00:57:21,499 --> 00:57:25,640
different different parts of the Fedora

00:57:23,719 --> 00:57:27,789
project and community technical and

00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:27,789
non-technical

00:58:24,259 --> 00:58:29,640
so the question was around the mention

00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:32,630
that perhaps traditional Linux events

00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:34,769
were not as valuable for impact purposes

00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:36,900
although they remain valuable for lots

00:58:34,769 --> 00:58:39,059
of potentially other reasons in the blog

00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:42,210
post and so the question is how do

00:58:39,059 --> 00:58:43,799
hackathons work and at least in North

00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:45,750
America it sounds like about 40 percent

00:58:43,799 --> 00:58:48,750
of events that ambassadors are attending

00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:50,339
our college-level hackathons and so how

00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:53,549
do you see that fitting in you were the

00:58:50,339 --> 00:58:55,559
primary author you get to go first I

00:58:53,549 --> 00:58:57,750
don't know actually

00:58:55,559 --> 00:59:00,000
so I have not been to a college

00:58:57,750 --> 00:59:02,549
hackathon in a very long time so I don't

00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,049
I I'm not quite sure how fedora is

00:59:02,549 --> 00:59:06,029
working there I guess I would like to

00:59:04,049 --> 00:59:08,400
see four of those events you know

00:59:06,029 --> 00:59:09,809
specific goals and then you are the how

00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:13,619
do we measure them and you know are

00:59:09,809 --> 00:59:15,299
those goals achieved I think that there

00:59:13,619 --> 00:59:17,250
are things in these that probably can

00:59:15,299 --> 00:59:18,990
align with the objectives I know that

00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:22,079
new student developer is one of the

00:59:18,990 --> 00:59:25,619
personas for fedora workstation so one

00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:27,480
easy answer is funnel all that through

00:59:25,619 --> 00:59:29,220
look or promoting fedora workstation to

00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:31,380
student developers because that is

00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:33,269
something that is in in the target

00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:35,789
audience there and I think that probably

00:59:33,269 --> 00:59:38,039
can also fit for things like atomic and

00:59:35,789 --> 00:59:41,160
the CI initiative we can probably find

00:59:38,039 --> 00:59:42,450
hooks for those things there but I don't

00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:45,390
actually know the format of with these

00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:47,490
hackathons is so maybe I'll pass it to

00:59:45,390 --> 00:59:50,790
Justin who does

00:59:47,490 --> 00:59:52,980
I think that there is kind of two

00:59:50,790 --> 00:59:54,119
different ways of putting it so I a lot

00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:56,010
of times with the students that these

00:59:54,119 --> 00:59:57,540
hackathons are very ready to try new

00:59:56,010 --> 01:00:00,270
technologies and they go there with the

00:59:57,540 --> 01:00:01,260
mindset of intentionally trying to try

01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:02,490
new things that they wouldn't normally

01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:03,960
do and I think there's actually very

01:00:02,490 --> 01:00:06,420
strong case especially for like

01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:07,829
containers and that and looking at that

01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:09,809
kind of facet of it with containers and

01:00:07,829 --> 01:00:11,609
container orchestration so I think that

01:00:09,809 --> 01:00:13,589
it's very possible to still have a

01:00:11,609 --> 01:00:16,140
presence at hackathons like student

01:00:13,589 --> 01:00:18,000
hackathons but the mindset for proposing

01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:20,160
how we're going to represent ourselves

01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,230
there is extremely important I think

01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:23,520
going in with a focus on knowing some of

01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:25,349
the technologies that we have available

01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:27,420
and being able to speak at least at an

01:00:25,349 --> 01:00:28,950
introductory level for them is really

01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:30,299
important to introduce some of those new

01:00:28,950 --> 01:00:31,680
things because I think if you can make

01:00:30,299 --> 01:00:33,569
if you can make a clear and convincing

01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:35,130
case like hey if you're developing

01:00:33,569 --> 01:00:37,170
you're trying to do your app and you've

01:00:35,130 --> 01:00:39,059
done this in like normal command line

01:00:37,170 --> 01:00:40,109
like on your workstation if you can

01:00:39,059 --> 01:00:41,730
introduce some of these really cool

01:00:40,109 --> 01:00:43,470
things like it make it easier if our

01:00:41,730 --> 01:00:44,910
containers are to develop inside of the

01:00:43,470 --> 01:00:46,410
container and then try to orchestrate it

01:00:44,910 --> 01:00:48,089
with the or host it like in a cloud

01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:49,290
platform for your own development and

01:00:48,089 --> 01:00:51,690
you can use some of these tools that are

01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:53,520
available in fedora to do that knowing

01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:55,290
being able to say that and know when it

01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:56,760
applies I think is extremely vital

01:00:55,290 --> 01:00:59,220
because I think if you can just have the

01:00:56,760 --> 01:01:00,869
enough knowledge and understanding of

01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:03,690
some of these technologies and tools and

01:01:00,869 --> 01:01:07,290
fedora to just kind of guide someone in

01:01:03,690 --> 01:01:09,359
that direction I think that's a great

01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:11,430
way to actually have strong engagement

01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:13,589
with students specifically at like

01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:15,000
collegiate hackathons to engage with

01:01:13,589 --> 01:01:16,859
some of these technologies inside of

01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,260
Fedora whether they're using fedora

01:01:16,859 --> 01:01:22,230
explicitly or not like on their on their

01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:23,880
laptop I think if if they're if I was

01:01:22,230 --> 01:01:26,220
looking at like an event proposal for a

01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:30,270
hackathon anywhere and there wasn't some

01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:31,829
kind of goal or some kind of plan to try

01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:33,450
to be like I want we want to try to

01:01:31,829 --> 01:01:35,369
introduce these technologies we want to

01:01:33,450 --> 01:01:37,140
try to introduce students to containers

01:01:35,369 --> 01:01:38,849
or our project atomic as like a

01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:40,619
development platform like these kind of

01:01:38,849 --> 01:01:41,670
things I'd be a little more skeptical

01:01:40,619 --> 01:01:43,140
because you can send people to

01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:46,079
collegiate hackathon you can talk about

01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:48,119
fedora but I think the engagement and

01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:50,250
the the interest to have from students

01:01:48,119 --> 01:01:54,180
is much higher - if you can talk about

01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:55,440
not just Fedora Linux workstation but if

01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:57,150
you could introduce them to these tools

01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:58,530
that they're already ready to try and

01:01:57,150 --> 01:02:00,630
they don't might not even know exists

01:01:58,530 --> 01:02:02,940
for their projects they would use

01:02:00,630 --> 01:02:05,280
I think just knowing ahead of time kind

01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:07,140
of like talking points again of the

01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:09,780
things you would want to kind of guide

01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:12,660
them towards so I think it just it would

01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:14,870
require plant pre-planning before you go

01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:17,520
there to introduce some of these things

01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:19,620
I'm gonna play put Stefan Langdon on the

01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:21,630
spot so for you you've got these

01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:24,570
objectives the atomic CI and modularity

01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:27,240
if there were a hackathon and it's like

01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:29,070
you're supposed to have something bring

01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:30,720
something with CI at you know if

01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:32,730
specifically atomic OCI to this

01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:35,840
hackathon like what would you be able to

01:02:32,730 --> 01:02:39,600
bring and what would you get out of that

01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:41,730
so I'm gonna use a real example not of a

01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:45,150
hackathon but something that had to work

01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:47,220
and it's pretty impressive to me at

01:02:45,150 --> 01:02:48,450
least what what people come up with the

01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:50,360
really cool thing when you go to these

01:02:48,450 --> 01:02:53,760
places is the new ideas that come out

01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:56,460
and so for CI a lot of times we think of

01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:58,170
CI as the end all and be all really

01:02:56,460 --> 01:03:02,460
tests and I'll talk about this more on

01:02:58,170 --> 01:03:05,250
Thursday at 5 p.m. so come is tests are

01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:07,140
the the way to teach machines between

01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:10,710
good and evil right and wrong and so you

01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:12,690
you build off this basic substrate and

01:03:10,710 --> 01:03:14,760
you sort start to get machines to do

01:03:12,690 --> 01:03:16,470
interesting things and a lot of people

01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:18,930
at hackathons are interested in machine

01:03:16,470 --> 01:03:20,220
learning machine training and so on so

01:03:18,930 --> 01:03:22,740
we we took a bunch of data

01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:24,480
half-a-million test results with various

01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:26,310
fields associated with them such as what

01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:28,890
was done afterwards and so on and within

01:03:26,310 --> 01:03:30,990
a couple days posting this we get back

01:03:28,890 --> 01:03:34,410
in someone just hacked up a neural

01:03:30,990 --> 01:03:36,840
network predicting what what what kind

01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:38,430
of what kind of tests actually were real

01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:40,920
failures and what kind of tests were

01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:42,390
flakes like what a human would have done

01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:43,710
with these things what they did in the

01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:45,450
past predicting what they're gonna do in

01:03:43,710 --> 01:03:47,550
the future that's the kind of thing that

01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:50,850
right off the top of my head I would say

01:03:47,550 --> 01:03:52,700
bring that to - to a college hackathon

01:03:50,850 --> 01:03:55,470
or to any kind of place like bring data

01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:59,400
bring these ideas and the framework

01:03:55,470 --> 01:04:04,050
necessary to enable teaching machines

01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:08,460
based on this this foundation so I'm

01:04:04,050 --> 01:04:10,310
gonna cheat by first saying I think you

01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:12,390
have described a great objective of

01:04:10,310 --> 01:04:13,829
producing several play books for

01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:19,140
hackathons to be used

01:04:13,829 --> 01:04:21,690
by colleges to you know sell Fedora so

01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:23,519
that like I think that would be an

01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:25,529
objective in and of itself it's like how

01:04:23,519 --> 01:04:27,450
do we how do we better approach hack

01:04:25,529 --> 01:04:30,209
days you know and I think that could be

01:04:27,450 --> 01:04:31,950
all on its own and then incorporate

01:04:30,209 --> 01:04:34,140
things like the CI objective or whatever

01:04:31,950 --> 01:04:36,959
ask some of the channels as far as

01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:38,849
modularity is concerned I think I think

01:04:36,959 --> 01:04:40,469
that one's weird I think it's gonna be

01:04:38,849 --> 01:04:41,519
hard because you've got to be really

01:04:40,469 --> 01:04:44,549
steeped in understanding what a

01:04:41,519 --> 01:04:47,099
distributions about that said I think as

01:04:44,549 --> 01:04:50,670
the tools get better there will be

01:04:47,099 --> 01:04:52,799
opportunity for people to kind of show

01:04:50,670 --> 01:04:54,319
new and different ways of kind of

01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:57,869
bringing things together to provide

01:04:54,319 --> 01:04:59,339
platforms or solutions but I don't think

01:04:57,869 --> 01:05:02,160
we're there yet I think I think we got

01:04:59,339 --> 01:05:04,349
another you know couple months before we

01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:08,999
we had something that we could give at

01:05:04,349 --> 01:05:10,589
like a college hackathon but so

01:05:08,999 --> 01:05:15,809
something that strikes me is that both

01:05:10,589 --> 01:05:18,719
of the these objectives are supposed to

01:05:15,809 --> 01:05:20,999
be enablers for then big steps and

01:05:18,719 --> 01:05:24,359
innovation right this was to unlock

01:05:20,999 --> 01:05:26,339
what's then possible so I I don't know

01:05:24,359 --> 01:05:29,400
that we would expect such a hackathon to

01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:31,859
do the unlocking but then to bring

01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:35,930
enough of it and to give clues and hints

01:05:31,859 --> 01:05:39,239
as to okay now how help me that kind of

01:05:35,930 --> 01:05:41,219
you know it's ring bring some ideas that

01:05:39,239 --> 01:05:43,140
are based on top of this or like it

01:05:41,219 --> 01:05:45,509
germinate that and make that happen so

01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:47,940
it's similar goes to modularity it's

01:05:45,509 --> 01:05:50,190
supposed to be an enabler for then cool

01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:51,930
stuff to come out that cool stuff is

01:05:50,190 --> 01:05:56,400
over after when we go and into a

01:05:51,930 --> 01:05:59,519
hackathon I would say the hackathons are

01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:03,180
way more interesting about like you know

01:05:59,519 --> 01:06:05,430
how fast you know can you put up a full

01:06:03,180 --> 01:06:07,410
development environment leveraging you

01:06:05,430 --> 01:06:10,170
know true CI right

01:06:07,410 --> 01:06:13,259
you know well-known working components

01:06:10,170 --> 01:06:15,029
which is the modularity part and you

01:06:13,259 --> 01:06:17,640
know and then you know shipping a

01:06:15,029 --> 01:06:20,009
machine learning engine you know you can

01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:22,529
we could show you how you could do that

01:06:20,009 --> 01:06:24,779
and like in a hackathon kind of set up

01:06:22,529 --> 01:06:27,089
way and then the hackathon could it be

01:06:24,779 --> 01:06:27,990
all about you know leveraging the

01:06:27,089 --> 01:06:30,840
countless

01:06:27,990 --> 01:06:33,300
you know Matt's crazy statistics on

01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:34,800
hotspot or on Apple downloads and what

01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:36,540
what does that mean for the future of

01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:37,980
fedora I mean you know it's like they

01:06:36,540 --> 01:06:46,080
are enablers more than they are

01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:47,820
hackathons themselves I'll just add that

01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:49,590
I think it would be totally awesome if

01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:51,390
an ambassador went to a hackathon and

01:06:49,590 --> 01:06:53,400
came back with a laundry list of things

01:06:51,390 --> 01:06:55,890
that would make fedor workstation better

01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:57,660
for developers and that's the kind of

01:06:55,890 --> 01:06:59,670
thing that we can also learn by going to

01:06:57,660 --> 01:07:02,190
hackathons and we get a secondary

01:06:59,670 --> 01:07:03,930
objective out of it so I'll just toss

01:07:02,190 --> 01:07:06,630
that out there is a final keynote or a

01:07:03,930 --> 01:07:12,120
final point on that unless you always to

01:07:06,630 --> 01:07:15,750
be final eight-pointed thank you Mike

01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:17,460
for all of the questions you have 18

01:07:15,750 --> 01:07:23,870
more minutes to generate yet any other

01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:23,870
questions we have 18 minutes so yes

01:07:25,010 --> 01:07:48,540
orange so the question is for each of

01:07:47,370 --> 01:07:51,870
the council members if you had

01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:54,810
essentially unlimited time what would

01:07:51,870 --> 01:07:56,910
you do as an objective lead in fedora

01:07:54,810 --> 01:07:58,560
and I'm going to skip with no disrespect

01:07:56,910 --> 01:08:00,810
either the two of you unless you want to

01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:06,300
come up with another one okay so we'll

01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:13,020
start with Roberto I'm sure we have a

01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:18,210
not sure what my objective I would like

01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:21,030
to have some kind of like automated

01:08:18,210 --> 01:08:23,940
tools for a lot of administrative tasks

01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:27,390
I'm dealing this so having these

01:08:23,940 --> 01:08:32,360
automated will be awesome but at the

01:08:27,390 --> 01:08:35,450
moment there is not enough capacity to

01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:38,040
to develop some tools for this

01:08:35,450 --> 01:08:39,480
administrative task so that's because

01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:41,819
I'm doing this

01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:44,640
this quite often I'm spending a lot of

01:08:41,819 --> 01:08:51,120
time on the on days that would be what I

01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:52,620
would like to like automate so for me

01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:54,450
some of you may have noticed we recently

01:08:52,620 --> 01:08:57,480
soft launched a brand new Fedora dock

01:08:54,450 --> 01:09:00,029
site and I had a lot to do with the work

01:08:57,480 --> 01:09:01,920
on that tooling if I was to lead an

01:09:00,029 --> 01:09:04,140
objective right now kind of dovetailing

01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:06,750
on that I would love to see the Fedora

01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:09,810
project become an innovator in the space

01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:11,790
of documentation not because the world

01:09:09,810 --> 01:09:13,830
needs more innovators in that space but

01:09:11,790 --> 01:09:16,440
because I think we have a general enough

01:09:13,830 --> 01:09:18,390
problem that the tooling that we come up

01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:20,520
with the way that we could look at like

01:09:18,390 --> 01:09:22,680
what Robert and that are gonna propose

01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:24,900
around user story based writing and

01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:27,839
stuff we can actually demonstrate that

01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:30,509
for so many consumers that need this and

01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:32,489
we have the skills and capacity to

01:09:30,509 --> 01:09:35,609
actually bring it to fruition and show

01:09:32,489 --> 01:09:37,589
people how run this ansible playbook and

01:09:35,609 --> 01:09:39,569
you have everything you need and here's

01:09:37,589 --> 01:09:41,130
the playbook for how you actually do the

01:09:39,569 --> 01:09:45,359
writing so I think that's something

01:09:41,130 --> 01:09:46,739
where we could really be a leader so I

01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:49,020
kind of like the OpenShift thing I

01:09:46,739 --> 01:09:51,839
mentioned earlier I think you mini shift

01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:53,819
is cool but if you want to go to a real

01:09:51,839 --> 01:09:56,640
deployment of open shift origin it is

01:09:53,819 --> 01:09:59,250
ridiculously hard I would love to see

01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:02,340
that become very easy with fedora but

01:09:59,250 --> 01:10:04,500
that's a lot of work so I also like your

01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:07,410
docs thing and I also like that in

01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:09,150
particularly I'm a gigantic fanboy of

01:10:07,410 --> 01:10:12,230
Stack Exchange I think they've got the

01:10:09,150 --> 01:10:14,790
QA think down really well and our ask

01:10:12,230 --> 01:10:17,370
fedora thing makes me sad every time I

01:10:14,790 --> 01:10:19,260
look at it because it's not the fault of

01:10:17,370 --> 01:10:21,500
the community it's really the fault of

01:10:19,260 --> 01:10:23,820
the software because the software is

01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:25,590
it's kind of it's a one-person project

01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:27,840
that person has done a fine job but it

01:10:25,590 --> 01:10:30,720
copies the surface of Stack Exchange and

01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:32,250
not the heart of it I would like to set

01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:35,220
up some and Stack Exchange is great but

01:10:32,250 --> 01:10:38,010
not necessarily perfect they tried to do

01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:40,860
a new Docs site and it fell flat on its

01:10:38,010 --> 01:10:43,410
face which is interesting I would like

01:10:40,860 --> 01:10:46,500
to see us set up something that combines

01:10:43,410 --> 01:10:48,570
the best of the QA thing with a real doc

01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:51,210
short doc site because those things are

01:10:48,570 --> 01:10:53,160
really kind of intrinsically connected

01:10:51,210 --> 01:10:55,950
because a lot of times like what people

01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:58,530
we want I have a question the answer

01:10:55,950 --> 01:11:00,300
should be here's the short documentation

01:10:58,530 --> 01:11:03,540
that tells you exactly how to do that

01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:05,790
thing so I would love to hack on that

01:11:03,540 --> 01:11:11,160
but I'm not going to I'm just gonna look

01:11:05,790 --> 01:11:13,230
at it wistfully so for me it's actually

01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:15,120
not a new objective but more like a

01:11:13,230 --> 01:11:16,680
retired objective there is the formerly

01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:19,560
the University involvement initiative

01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:21,840
that kind of fell through for various

01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:23,940
reasons but if if I could take on a lead

01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:25,860
or I take on an objective with unlimited

01:11:23,940 --> 01:11:28,800
time I would really like to see Fedora

01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:30,710
try to have a targeted strategy towards

01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:32,730
university and student participation

01:11:30,710 --> 01:11:36,090
partially because I think there is a

01:11:32,730 --> 01:11:38,160
very large pool of people that we could

01:11:36,090 --> 01:11:40,860
attract both as not just users of new

01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:43,680
technologies in the fedora family but

01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:46,290
also potential contributors as well and

01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:47,400
I think it requires a different there's

01:11:46,290 --> 01:11:48,840
I think there's two things you have to

01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:50,940
think about going into putting together

01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:52,760
a proposal for that because it's

01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:54,840
something that would involve people from

01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:55,770
ideally from all parts of the world so

01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:58,560
you really would need to have

01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:59,820
representation from different areas in

01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:01,710
different parts of the world because

01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:04,200
there's not really anywhere that's quite

01:12:01,710 --> 01:12:06,000
like another place as far as like

01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:07,620
different university structures and and

01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,960
curriculum works and understanding how

01:12:07,620 --> 01:12:13,500
you can engage with those students but I

01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:15,420
do think that there really is a large

01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:16,860
amount of interest in working with new

01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:18,630
technologies and you're able to

01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:21,150
introduce these things to students

01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:22,170
fairly easily as like I like you said

01:12:21,150 --> 01:12:24,330
earlier it was actually or like Mike

01:12:22,170 --> 01:12:26,970
said earlier was impressionable and

01:12:24,330 --> 01:12:29,700
ready to try new things but I just think

01:12:26,970 --> 01:12:31,320
it's it's it really does require you to

01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:32,910
think about how you're promoting

01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:34,050
technology in a new way because like

01:12:32,910 --> 01:12:35,580
when we go to a traditional conference

01:12:34,050 --> 01:12:37,950
or if we go somewhere like even like a

01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:40,260
specific conference for like a topic

01:12:37,950 --> 01:12:42,660
like let's say coop con or or a CAD

01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:45,210
ocker conference or any kind of specific

01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:47,280
focused topic people there know the

01:12:45,210 --> 01:12:48,570
technology they know the software they

01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:50,550
know the stack and you're just trying to

01:12:48,570 --> 01:12:53,220
show them why fedora is a great platform

01:12:50,550 --> 01:12:56,370
or is a great way to accomplish their

01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:58,520
work with the tooling and what's

01:12:56,370 --> 01:13:00,840
available for them in the end fedora

01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:02,670
with students that knowledge isn't there

01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:04,410
so you have to kind of do a little bit

01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:06,630
of extra legwork to introduce these

01:13:04,410 --> 01:13:09,210
things because sometimes they

01:13:06,630 --> 01:13:10,230
I just not know about why they don't

01:13:09,210 --> 01:13:11,940
have that background knowledge that

01:13:10,230 --> 01:13:12,990
someone at like a specific conference

01:13:11,940 --> 01:13:14,640
like coop con everyone knows about

01:13:12,990 --> 01:13:16,710
kubernetes you're trying to tell people

01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:18,930
why Fedora is a great platform for open

01:13:16,710 --> 01:13:21,210
shift in kubernetes and like a student

01:13:18,930 --> 01:13:22,770
or I get a student-focused event whether

01:13:21,210 --> 01:13:25,890
it's a hackathon or something or

01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:27,540
something some other kind of place you

01:13:25,890 --> 01:13:30,660
have a you have to do that some of that

01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:32,580
extra work yourself to try to make that

01:13:30,660 --> 01:13:35,690
picture about why these technologies are

01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:38,750
great and why it's why it's helpful and

01:13:35,690 --> 01:13:40,920
efficient or effective to work on them

01:13:38,750 --> 01:13:42,840
so that's why I just think it would take

01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:44,310
some participation to work on this

01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:46,170
initiative it would take participation

01:13:44,310 --> 01:13:47,940
from people in in different regions of

01:13:46,170 --> 01:13:49,920
the world and it would also require a

01:13:47,940 --> 01:13:51,540
little bit of extra legwork to think

01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:54,540
about how you're introducing these

01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:56,850
topics to people because I really

01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:59,580
strongly believe that if you can get

01:13:56,850 --> 01:14:02,400
that presentation down you could you

01:13:59,580 --> 01:14:03,840
would attract a significant pool of not

01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:06,420
just users but I think you would also

01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:08,430
invite people who want to actually have

01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:10,320
an impact to work on these technologies

01:14:08,430 --> 01:14:12,150
and to understand them better and they

01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:20,730
would become contributors to different

01:14:12,150 --> 01:14:24,420
parts of the Fedora community so I have

01:14:20,730 --> 01:14:26,790
like three right now two of them are

01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:29,790
hard technical the other one is software

01:14:26,790 --> 01:14:33,840
I think the first one is significantly

01:14:29,790 --> 01:14:36,030
automate the RPM spec file management

01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:38,070
and development you know so basically

01:14:36,030 --> 01:14:39,870
try to get it down to where you know

01:14:38,070 --> 01:14:43,320
it's no big deal for one person to be

01:14:39,870 --> 01:14:46,710
maintaining a thousand rpms right and

01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:48,870
you're not spot right that's one the

01:14:46,710 --> 01:14:51,780
second one is automatic back porting and

01:14:48,870 --> 01:14:54,450
patches so using static and analysis of

01:14:51,780 --> 01:14:57,090
code and fuzzy fuzzy search algorithms

01:14:54,450 --> 01:14:59,640
as well as generation of tests can we

01:14:57,090 --> 01:15:02,610
actually say okay you know we have this

01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:04,860
new patch for XYZ bug and the latest

01:15:02,610 --> 01:15:06,990
version of thing you know we can

01:15:04,860 --> 01:15:09,030
automatically back port it to the last

01:15:06,990 --> 01:15:10,050
16 minor versions so I think that'd be

01:15:09,030 --> 01:15:11,160
really interesting I think we could

01:15:10,050 --> 01:15:14,070
actually do that a lot better than

01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:16,770
people think we do and then the last one

01:15:14,070 --> 01:15:18,590
which is lot of software is I would like

01:15:16,770 --> 01:15:20,960
a true end and

01:15:18,590 --> 01:15:24,469
heavily focused development environment

01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:26,719
for developers on Fedora so in other

01:15:24,469 --> 01:15:28,849
words like I want I want all those guys

01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:32,750
who switched to Mac I want them back

01:15:28,849 --> 01:15:35,750
right you know and I want to have a true

01:15:32,750 --> 01:15:38,270
truly awesome and and developer

01:15:35,750 --> 01:15:39,699
experience where we add in all the

01:15:38,270 --> 01:15:42,429
knowledge we have as a distribution

01:15:39,699 --> 01:15:44,810
about what they want to work with and

01:15:42,429 --> 01:15:47,119
then use that as part of the information

01:15:44,810 --> 01:15:48,110
that we feed to the to the actual

01:15:47,119 --> 01:15:50,480
developers about what they're trying to

01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:53,239
accomplish and shortening the life cycle

01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:58,639
on development so those are my three

01:15:53,239 --> 01:16:01,310
current crazy for the purposes of the

01:15:58,639 --> 01:16:02,989
video especially I think the breadth and

01:16:01,310 --> 01:16:05,300
depth of the different kinds of things

01:16:02,989 --> 01:16:08,150
that we answered shows just how many

01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:10,070
objectives we are missing and there's

01:16:08,150 --> 01:16:11,719
really a lot of opportunity to come to

01:16:10,070 --> 01:16:14,119
the council with an objective and not

01:16:11,719 --> 01:16:16,580
worry about us having a preset mindset

01:16:14,119 --> 01:16:19,219
about what an objectives supposed to

01:16:16,580 --> 01:16:20,929
look like because I think we would

01:16:19,219 --> 01:16:22,219
really kind of also like to be surprised

01:16:20,929 --> 01:16:26,179
by something completely out of left

01:16:22,219 --> 01:16:29,239
field or right field I guess but left

01:16:26,179 --> 01:16:32,270
field preferred sports metaphors gonna

01:16:29,239 --> 01:16:34,550
be surprising is there a final question

01:16:32,270 --> 01:16:43,280
or any closing thoughts from members of

01:16:34,550 --> 01:16:48,800
the council so um your between me and a

01:16:43,280 --> 01:17:09,349
toilet no well you know I pee it happens

01:16:48,800 --> 01:17:11,000
yes sir what is your final question are

01:17:09,349 --> 01:17:14,449
the three editions that we produce and

01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:17,810
the spins and I'm gonna toss in labs the

01:17:14,449 --> 01:17:22,730
right set of artifacts and outputs from

01:17:17,810 --> 01:17:25,010
the project I think that with a switch

01:17:22,730 --> 01:17:26,780
from the generic cloud to atomic I think

01:17:25,010 --> 01:17:29,300
that was a pretty good move and I think

01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:30,829
we're pretty well set with things at

01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:32,469
this point

01:17:30,829 --> 01:17:34,309
I think we may need to make other

01:17:32,469 --> 01:17:36,530
Corrections like that in the future

01:17:34,309 --> 01:17:39,349
sometime that's the you know again sting

01:17:36,530 --> 01:17:40,789
of the innovative point on things I feel

01:17:39,349 --> 01:17:42,260
pretty good about our set of

01:17:40,789 --> 01:17:44,689
deliverables I think maybe the one thing

01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:47,300
we're missing is a IOT offering of some

01:17:44,689 --> 01:17:48,800
sort Peter Robinson is not in this room

01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:51,709
but he's got to talk about that

01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:53,689
somewhere else and I think yeah

01:17:51,709 --> 01:17:55,669
especially as we actually get working on

01:17:53,689 --> 01:17:59,629
raspberry pie and which is the most

01:17:55,669 --> 01:18:02,479
popular hobbyist thing out there that

01:17:59,629 --> 01:18:05,689
will definitely help but yeah I don't

01:18:02,479 --> 01:18:07,959
know as people come up it that's the

01:18:05,689 --> 01:18:10,339
same thing as with the objectives like

01:18:07,959 --> 01:18:13,820
those are things that should be coming

01:18:10,339 --> 01:18:17,300
to us as a community like showing up if

01:18:13,820 --> 01:18:25,070
we can't think of it you should be

01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:27,349
coming from the community the only one I

01:18:25,070 --> 01:18:29,570
think there's a gap again around that

01:18:27,349 --> 01:18:32,229
kind of developer space in that like I

01:18:29,570 --> 01:18:34,669
don't think we produce particularly good

01:18:32,229 --> 01:18:36,530
I'm gonna say vagrant vm's

01:18:34,669 --> 01:18:38,209
but I don't mean necessarily vagrant

01:18:36,530 --> 01:18:41,389
vamps I kind of mean like the things

01:18:38,209 --> 01:18:43,010
that you use as the VM to develop things

01:18:41,389 --> 01:18:44,449
on so you might use a container for that

01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:46,849
but you can't use that with maque you

01:18:44,449 --> 01:18:48,439
know so you know you might so I think we

01:18:46,849 --> 01:18:51,589
have a little bit of a gap in there that

01:18:48,439 --> 01:18:54,739
cloud the cloud edition was filling that

01:18:51,589 --> 01:18:56,869
I think atomic will not and so I think

01:18:54,739 --> 01:18:58,429
we have there is there is something in

01:18:56,869 --> 01:19:00,559
there but it might be fulfilled by a

01:18:58,429 --> 01:19:03,709
spin it doesn't listen TV edition so

01:19:00,559 --> 01:19:06,409
there's something there's a gap there oh

01:19:03,709 --> 01:19:08,149
and Taylor had a presentation at DEFCON

01:19:06,409 --> 01:19:10,699
for this thing called purple egg which

01:19:08,149 --> 01:19:14,449
is way up there in worse possible names

01:19:10,699 --> 01:19:16,459
but basically a docker container based

01:19:14,449 --> 01:19:18,050
development environment sort of like the

01:19:16,459 --> 01:19:20,570
developer assistant thing but

01:19:18,050 --> 01:19:23,570
containerized with also a nice genome

01:19:20,570 --> 01:19:26,119
GUI around it which I think attacked

01:19:23,570 --> 01:19:28,219
that problem in a really interesting way

01:19:26,119 --> 01:19:30,139
he has no funding to develop that idea

01:19:28,219 --> 01:19:31,429
but if it's interesting to anybody and

01:19:30,139 --> 01:19:32,659
they want something to hack on I think

01:19:31,429 --> 01:19:34,189
that's really cool and I think that

01:19:32,659 --> 01:19:36,739
would would help fill something that's

01:19:34,189 --> 01:19:37,909
missing in our developer story but it's

01:19:36,739 --> 01:19:39,079
not really an edition it's just

01:19:37,909 --> 01:19:42,219
something it's like a feature for

01:19:39,079 --> 01:19:42,219
workstation I'd like to see

01:19:45,519 --> 01:19:49,900
I have to tell you upfront I am not

01:19:47,559 --> 01:19:51,820
actually a huge fan of the spins labs

01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:53,710
and editions name said I feel like it's

01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:56,679
very hard to explain to people who are

01:19:53,710 --> 01:19:58,630
not steeped in the project but um I

01:19:56,679 --> 01:20:02,110
would like to see us have more labs I

01:19:58,630 --> 01:20:03,670
believe that we could easily answer more

01:20:02,110 --> 01:20:05,590
of our target audiences with some

01:20:03,670 --> 01:20:07,510
specialized builds which I think better

01:20:05,590 --> 01:20:09,070
build systems will make easier and

01:20:07,510 --> 01:20:12,070
practical to do without me being

01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:14,530
attacked by release engineering but I

01:20:12,070 --> 01:20:16,269
feel like part of modularity is this

01:20:14,530 --> 01:20:17,019
idea of giving the user what they want

01:20:16,269 --> 01:20:18,940
when they want it

01:20:17,019 --> 01:20:21,280
I feel like labs are a great way for us

01:20:18,940 --> 01:20:24,429
to go this is the fedora you want when

01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:25,960
you want it and it also you know you

01:20:24,429 --> 01:20:28,630
could argue some of these developer

01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:29,800
concepts or labs some of the target

01:20:28,630 --> 01:20:33,010
audiences that have been talked about

01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:34,630
our labs yeah it'd be great to have like

01:20:33,010 --> 01:20:36,369
a machine learning thing that's like the

01:20:34,630 --> 01:20:37,840
Python one but it's focused on machine

01:20:36,369 --> 01:20:40,630
learning too right now that's a lot of

01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:42,489
Python but that is a lot Python already

01:20:40,630 --> 01:20:49,360
but something specifically focused on

01:20:42,489 --> 01:20:52,840
those will do it in Perl there's five

01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:56,260
minutes left so I'm gonna call it unless

01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:58,210
there are closing remarks from anybody I

01:20:56,260 --> 01:21:00,070
encourage you to go off and enjoy other

01:20:58,210 --> 01:21:01,659
sessions there will also be sessions in

01:21:00,070 --> 01:21:05,820
this room if you wish to remain and

01:21:01,659 --> 01:21:05,820
