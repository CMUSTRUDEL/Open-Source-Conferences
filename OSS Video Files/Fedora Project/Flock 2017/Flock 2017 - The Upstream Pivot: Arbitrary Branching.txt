Talk: The Upstream Pivot: Arbitrary Branching
Presenter: Matthew Prahl

Description:
To fully take advantage of modularity, we need to provide packages with different lifecycles, SLA, and EOLs. With the current branching workflow, we have one branch per Fedora release, which restricts a package to a single version in a Fedora release. By introducing the new workflow of “arbitrary branching”, this allows module packagers to use package/component branches that meet their needs in regards to version, SLA, and EOL. This talk will cover:
- Why we implemented “arbitrary branching” and how this affects Fedora
- What tooling changes took place and why we made those decisions
- How to get involved and take advantage of “arbitrary branching”, including a walkthrough of the current tools
