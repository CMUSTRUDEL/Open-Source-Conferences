Talk: Create, build and develop our Fedora Websites
Presenter: Andrea Masala, Robert Mayr

Description:
The Fedora Websites are probably the first place a user gets in contact with when searching for Fedora on the web.
For this reason, and also if he gets the websites in his local language, makes our work very important for the project.
In this workshop I'd like to show how the websites are built,
how we make translations happen and what kind of tools we use to develop our
websites to make them appear in time for a new release.
Learn our workflow and be able to build your changes locally before submitting a PR.
See also how we communicate normally and why collaboration with other teams is so important for us.
