Talk: Fedora Hubs Demo + Roadmap
Presenter: Aurelien Bompard, Máirín Duffy

Description:
Fedora Hubs is a project we've been working on in the Fedora community for a couple of years now. It's meant to both be a sort of project intranet for Fedora contributors as well as a single, unified interface to make it easy for learn about teams across Fedora and to provide a consistent on boarding experience for new contributors.

We will give a demo of Fedora Hubs and discuss the future roadmap, as well as point to other sessions here at Flock where you can learn more about how to contribute to hubs including a widget-creation workshop for beginners and a hackfest.

	00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:05,940
all right cool hey so this is a pretty

00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,700
quick talk it's only half an hour we're

00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,349
out at 4:00 so we're gonna give you a

00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,809
quick overview of the Fedora hubs

00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:14,790
project what it is why we're working on

00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:19,890
it an overview of how it works

00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:21,420
technically and then we're doing yeah

00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,890
we're gonna do a small demo too so you

00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,910
can kind of see where the projects at

00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:28,619
and then where to go from here okay so

00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:31,080
my name is Maureen Duffy I'm the UX

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:32,790
designer for Fedora hubs and this is

00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,190
aurelion and vom part he's one of the

00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:38,670
developers and then cyan Chau Hardy he's

00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:40,559
the other one and you'll you'll get to

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,780
hear from them directly - as we get to

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,730
their parts of the presentation so um

00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,200
this is just an overview of what we're

00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,450
going to talk about first we'll talk

00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,129
about what is Fodor hubs why are we

00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,289
making it what's the point because

00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:53,670
that's kind of important to know then

00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:55,739
we're going to go into the architecture

00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:58,140
of Fedora hubs the basic architecture

00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:01,320
how do the widgets work because widgets

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,660
are a core concept in hubs and sort of

00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,280
the roadmap what where are we going from

00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,159
here what are we going to be working on

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,170
and focusing on and then we'll talk a

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,530
little bit about you know how you can

00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:16,740
get involved you know all different

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:19,520
things like that so let's move on so why

00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:23,220
are we why are we building Fedora hubs

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,350
one of the key kind of problems to solve

00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,880
that we were looking at for Fedora hubs

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:32,460
is trying to get new contributors

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,770
introduced into fedora without causing

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,420
issues for pre-existing contributors

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:37,920
this has been something that on the

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,000
Fedora infrastructure team we've been

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,500
working on we've kind of tried different

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,020
approaches over the years of doing

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,850
things and what we found is sometimes if

00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,549
you do something to help new users you

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,409
disrupt existing users and sometimes

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:55,560
when you cater to the existing users

00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:58,310
it's to the detriment of new users so we

00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,719
wanted to build a system that would help

00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:01,950
pre-existing users you know not throw

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,619
them off they could use it if they

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,540
wanted but for new contributors it would

00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:08,129
make it so much easier to get on board

00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:12,000
and I don't know how many of you in here

00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:13,620
have ever unboard anew contributor as

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,420
sort of their mentor in photo

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,550
or you know maybe some of you have

00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:20,940
recently been on boarded in fedora but

00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:23,520
it's definitely a very windy path

00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,810
involving a lot of different systems and

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,940
you definitely need some hand-holding

00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,190
there so we wanted to make it a lot

00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,810
easier to join the project we also

00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:34,650
wanted to make the different efforts

00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:37,440
across the project more kind of

00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,330
consistent more visible so each team

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,730
within Fedora is almost like its own

00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,380
little I don't know what they call it

00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:46,230
like its own little organization right

00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:49,290
and every team has its own sort of

00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:52,080
workflow the kinds of artifacts that

00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:53,850
they work with they have their own

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,530
organization is how they work with a

00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:57,330
team and that's great we're a community

00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:00,180
project we do things in that kind of

00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:02,790
organic matter and we let teams organize

00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:05,069
themselves however they see see fit is

00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:07,049
the best way to do it but because of

00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:09,269
that the way teams work is somewhat

00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:11,640
inconsistent like like one team might

00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:14,760
use bugzilla another team might use pug

00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:17,040
or one team might use the wiki and rely

00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,380
very heavily on wiki documentation and

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,660
another team might use get and keep

00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:23,130
documents and get so we want to let

00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,799
teams do what they do

00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:27,660
you know you do you teams and we just

00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:29,640
want to look at kind of the artifacts

00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:31,470
and things are producing and bubble them

00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,810
up to the surface and a single unified

00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:35,340
interface so if someone comes to Fedora

00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:36,750
and like they want to you know what is

00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,760
the design team working on is this a

00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,079
team that I want to join you know kind

00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,670
of shop around and see what the teams

00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:44,160
are working on they could go to the

00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:46,440
design team hub see screenshots of what

00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,359
we're working on see our blog posts see

00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,100
our mailing list posts and really get a

00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:51,750
feel for what we're working on and not

00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,670
just what we're working on but what

00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,859
we're actively working on because wiki

00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:57,900
pages are kind of old the second that

00:03:55,859 --> 00:04:00,450
you hit publish on them whereas if we

00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,639
could give people a feed of the activity

00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:04,079
that's going on in fed message you know

00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:05,519
that people are actively working on that

00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:06,989
so if you wanted to jump in

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,639
there's someone thinking about that

00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:10,739
right now it's not some dead wiki page

00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:12,870
that hasn't been touched for years right

00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:16,229
because we've all encountered that too I

00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:19,380
think so yeah I mean this is basically I

00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:21,690
just told you but the other idea with

00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,039
hubs is that you know the primary focus

00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:25,020
was we want to make it easier for new

00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:26,430
contributors to join our project but

00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,710
another focus is

00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,840
can we make life easier for existing

00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:32,850
contributors a lot of contributors in

00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,740
fedora are volunteers this is not their

00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:36,900
day job this is something that they do

00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:39,240
on the side they enjoy being part of the

00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:42,090
community but there's so much going on

00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,250
it's really really hard to keep up so we

00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,720
were looking at models of you know how

00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,850
do people keep up with the news how do

00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,800
they keep up with friends and like the

00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:52,380
single consistent thing seems to be like

00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,509
this sort of stream of content like a

00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:56,910
Twitter timeline or a Facebook feed or

00:04:54,509 --> 00:04:59,610
all that kind of stuff so we wanted to

00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:01,740
make Keeping Up with fedora even when

00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:03,630
it's like an occasional thing to make it

00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,430
easy to keep up with what's going on so

00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:07,320
you have this one single interface that

00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,910
you can go to to keep up with all the

00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,010
things you missed since the last time

00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,780
you logged in rather than have to hunt

00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,550
like oh well go to Fedora magazine then

00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:17,130
I'll go to you know the ticket system

00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:18,000
and then I'll go to IRC logs and instead

00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,500
of being pulled in a million directions

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,680
you can just go to the Fedora team

00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,789
you're interested in and check in on it

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:30,720
all right so now rolling is going to

00:05:23,789 --> 00:05:34,650
talk about the architecture so yeah

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,210
basically hubs is web page where you

00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:38,690
have different components inside the web

00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:41,760
page and those components will be

00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:43,680
different depending on the team and the

00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,620
how they're working what aspect they're

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,409
working on in those so those components

00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:51,330
are called widgets and there on the left

00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:52,680
you have the web browser and you have

00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:54,630
those widgets in your web page and

00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,330
they're Co they're connected to the

00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:59,070
backend and those widgets are connecting

00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:01,949
to external services what I mean by

00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:05,220
external services it can be federal

00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:08,300
services like updates for example like

00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:11,639
the the badges all the things that make

00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:13,289
that compose the federal experience as a

00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:15,060
contributor or they can be really

00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:16,830
external services like github for

00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,199
example so they can be anything that

00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:21,900
brings information relevant to what

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:25,919
you're working on in your team or as a

00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:30,780
single contributor right here you have

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:32,610
an example of a webpage it's here but

00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:34,229
basically you have a list of hubs that

00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:36,950
you've subscribed to in the menu on the

00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:36,950
left and

00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:42,490
and you have the feed that Moe was

00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:44,320
talking about which is all the activity

00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:46,060
of your team or of your single

00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,400
contributor and on the right you could

00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:50,680
have also separate widgets which has

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,140
specific to your workflow you can have

00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,640
like widgets on your team activity on

00:06:53,140 --> 00:07:00,940
your badges on the people that you are

00:06:54,640 --> 00:07:03,090
following all that kind of stuff so on

00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:05,860
the right that you see the badges and

00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:07,720
like the members on stuff so these are

00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,160
basically the external services that we

00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:13,060
are connecting to and fetching the data

00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:15,060
from those external services and so on

00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:18,130
the left hand side you can see multiple

00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:20,290
hubs in place and these are basically

00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:22,690
the different hubs like the design have

00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:25,330
the infrastructure hub and your personal

00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:28,060
profile is also considered as a hub so

00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:32,640
all the tears all the hubs are basically

00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:32,640
listed on the left hand side as a navbar

00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:44,980
yeah so this is kind of update that you

00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:47,530
can do like this is kind of a social

00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:49,720
media that we are building inside like

00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:51,670
the idea is a platform for the

00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:54,640
contributors to collaborate communicate

00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:56,980
and get to know the status of what's

00:07:54,640 --> 00:08:03,430
happening in that particular hub so this

00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:07,720
is kind of a pose that you can do yep so

00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:10,030
how does it work those widgets basically

00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,530
everything that you see displayed on the

00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:14,290
page except the menu on the left is

00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:16,180
widgets we have tried to make a system

00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:18,010
that makes it very easy to create new

00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,540
widgets because we want teams to be able

00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,870
to create their own widgets if they need

00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,580
to

00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:24,280
we will she will be shipping a lot of

00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:27,190
them like for example weekly updates for

00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:29,470
example update that packages update that

00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:33,070
are available that you have just worked

00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:34,840
on badges too but it should be easy for

00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:37,060
a team to create their own widgets if

00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:41,260
it's specific to their workflow so we

00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:44,110
have a framework for that yeah the

00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:46,260
widgets can can talk to external

00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:49,060
services like body patches by here

00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,620
basically that's just a bit of code but

00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:53,350
it's just to show you how

00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:55,150
is to create a widget you just import

00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:57,190
the class it's in Python you just import

00:08:55,150 --> 00:09:00,100
the class and you setup name you set up

00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:03,400
a position and you have a root view

00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:06,370
basic view that will call up the

00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:09,610
component of the widgets on the page and

00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:12,100
that can be a very simple API at rest

00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:14,950
call to something external formatted to

00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:16,779
to be displayed on the page and of

00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:20,860
course that will use that will use a

00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:23,680
attend a template and HTML template and

00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:25,839
of course when you do calls to external

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,360
services and can be slow so we want to

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,490
cache that a new widget can use cached

00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,800
what we call cache functions which are

00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:35,589
just a way to cache the results of an

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:39,820
external call or a very intensive

00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:44,380
computing thing operation and this these

00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:46,150
cached functions will be will of course

00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:48,339
the pay display much faster in the UI

00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:51,850
and they will also be automatically

00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:53,890
automatically invalidated when relevant

00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:57,670
message appears on the bus so for

00:09:53,890 --> 00:10:00,760
example you have a wiki you have a wiki

00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:02,740
widget that shows you your last edits as

00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:06,790
soon as you edit something on a wiki

00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:09,670
page there is a Fed message sent to well

00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:11,950
sent to the federal bus and that will

00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:14,529
get caught by hubs and it will know to

00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:16,240
refresh this widget with the last edit

00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:18,040
that you've just made so everything will

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,959
appear transparently you just do

00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,790
something on the federal infrastructure

00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:29,350
as a whole and it will refresh the

00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:32,500
relevant widgets on the hops so the road

00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:35,650
ahead so the thing is now we have a hub

00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:37,870
instance devil instance running and you

00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:40,630
can actually log in there and see how

00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:43,779
actually hubs looks and get the feel of

00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:46,150
that get the feel of hubs but going

00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:47,680
ahead we are planning to roll hubs into

00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:50,170
production because it has been there

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:53,950
into a dev more devil instance for a

00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:57,010
long time and before moving ahead so

00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:59,740
first thing we are planning to do is so

00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:02,260
are always target was to release the

00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:04,420
design hub first and get all the

00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:06,490
necessary features that's

00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:08,560
Cerie for the design hub but moving

00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:10,990
forward we would like to have the

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:14,019
Ambassador hub in place because there

00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:17,040
was a discussion going on like we should

00:11:14,019 --> 00:11:20,920
there was a necessity for the hubs to

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:23,440
like no which all ambassadors are there

00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:25,480
in which who all are the active

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,750
ambassadors around the world so knowing

00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:33,940
that can be easier to communicate around

00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:35,889
around the different ambassadors so so

00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:37,389
the thing is we can have the ambassador

00:11:35,889 --> 00:11:39,870
hub and you can get all the latest

00:11:37,389 --> 00:11:43,000
updates in place and then we have

00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:46,990
something as regional hubs switch

00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,850
Suzanne will be talking on and and then

00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:51,660
we have the website steam having a

00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:55,269
separate hub and we a few of the

00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:57,730
mock-ups like mesmo has been working on

00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:59,500
the mockers for different widgets so one

00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:02,110
of the team that is not included here

00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:04,120
but have all the most of the mock-ups

00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:06,850
already is the translation hub that we

00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:08,949
can go forward with it so these are the

00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:10,959
few teams that we need to roll out first

00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:13,570
and then these teams can start working

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:16,870
on their hub and like interact regularly

00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:20,199
do or use it on a regular basis so that

00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:23,920
we can go get more feedback on how to

00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:26,050
improve hubs and like get features and

00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:29,110
then have contributors from the team to

00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:31,839
work on hubs so that because we are kind

00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:34,360
of on low resource now so if we get more

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,740
people to work on hubs it's better so

00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:41,110
that we can roll out more much more

00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:43,120
faster so one thing that I wanted to

00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:44,860
note that you know the reason that we

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,170
targeted the teams that we did is

00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:48,850
because in the past we've built systems

00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:50,350
that were focused on packagers because

00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:52,660
we figured well it's one of the largest

00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:55,569
communities within Fedora and what we

00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:58,660
found out in trying to tailor tools like

00:12:55,569 --> 00:13:00,639
this to packagers is that packagers

00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:02,560
already have a pretty good personal

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,810
workflow for doing what they do and it's

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,180
really hard to get them to try to adopt

00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:09,370
something new and we were trying to

00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:11,769
target teams that don't actually have

00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:14,350
tools that support their workflow in

00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:17,520
Fedora right now because we figured well

00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:19,200
you know they don't have any alternative

00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,000
so they'll be more willing and more

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,430
receptive to trying a new tool and it

00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:31,650
might actually you know help them become

00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:34,890
more efficient so as I told like we have

00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:36,950
the translation team which after ruling

00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:39,240
out like the Ambassador websites and the

00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:40,830
design hub we will be working on the

00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,580
translation meeting and the regional

00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:46,470
hubs so and then moving ahead we right

00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:48,240
now we don't have a very much good

00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:50,250
communication on what actually happening

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,640
in the federal house front so I was

00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:55,200
talking with one of the OpenStack folks

00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:57,540
on how they are getting more

00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:00,720
contributors so they usually have a

00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:05,340
biweekly sprint so where they dedicate

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:07,890
two hours to us just to work with the

00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:09,690
contributors on a bi-weekly basis so

00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:12,060
that's something we should be starting

00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:14,310
on hub side also and then a biweekly

00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:21,030
blog post on what's actually happening

00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:23,370
around in the hops project so how can

00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:26,490
you actually help so first and foremost

00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:29,490
is like you can build wagers in hub so

00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:31,890
we have a bunch of issues already

00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:33,780
created where the mock-ups are already

00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:35,940
done but there's no one right now

00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:39,390
walking on it so you can start building

00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:42,510
those widgets so like like the meeting

00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:44,460
widget you can start building on you you

00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:47,490
need to know on how federal Cal works

00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:49,440
how the API works and then you can start

00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:53,550
building the Wizards based on the API

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,680
and then tries issues so we have a lot

00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:58,530
of open issues as I told so you can go

00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:01,470
ahead and see if the the ones which are

00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:03,990
boss if they can be reproduce and like

00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:06,120
take appropriate action on it and then

00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:08,010
we have the documentation for hubs so

00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,830
right now we are focusing on more

00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:13,200
documentation because we try we really

00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:16,200
need to work on the contributor base and

00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,970
we so we are planning to have more and

00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,910
more documentation so that people can

00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:23,340
quickly build widgets and then help us

00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:26,000
with different stuffs and one of the

00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:28,230
main concerns is a code documentation

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,450
like having the documentation in the

00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:31,220
code so that's one of the area you can

00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:36,740
actually start

00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:38,389
tributon and then you have okay so then

00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:40,970
you can actually should not be designed

00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:44,449
widget it's basically designed for hubs

00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:46,430
so there are lot of mock-ups which are

00:15:44,449 --> 00:15:49,759
basically wireframes that have been made

00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:52,850
but not actual mock-ups which should

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,350
which should be kind of made into the

00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:56,180
front-end but there are actually

00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:58,189
mock-ups like suzanne has been working

00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:00,319
on the event and the regional hubs

00:15:58,189 --> 00:16:03,319
mock-ups so you can actually start

00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:06,490
walking or with the team design team and

00:16:03,319 --> 00:16:08,810
convert them into proper mock-ups so

00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:10,490
that's one area if you are a designer

00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:12,709
you can start contributing to that part

00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:15,350
and then connect teams for hubs so

00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:18,860
basically going forward we need more and

00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:20,360
more hubs in place so if you have if you

00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:23,329
are working in particular field so you

00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:25,639
can actually start integrating and ask

00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:28,790
like which all features do that

00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:32,120
particular team need and come on IRC and

00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:34,430
talk with us and then we can have a hub

00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:40,550
for you for your team and you can start

00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:43,129
using that as a full-time yep so where

00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:46,279
do we meet so we usually are online on

00:16:43,129 --> 00:16:49,939
federal hast channel and every Tuesday

00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:52,279
at 1400 UTC we have our weekly updates

00:16:49,939 --> 00:16:55,910
and we have a meeting actually so we

00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:58,550
usually have a like what's going on and

00:16:55,910 --> 00:17:00,620
what's the status of basically a status

00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:02,689
update meeting and what are the focus

00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:04,339
that should we should be planning on in

00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:06,650
the future so you can if you are

00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:09,559
planning to contribute you should drop

00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:14,990
to the hubs meeting and it's a place

00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:16,400
where you can get started yeah so this

00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:18,890
is one thing that I was talking of

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,829
deploying the house to production yes we

00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:24,110
are very close and earlier walked on the

00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:26,030
ansible also so right now the vagrant

00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:29,990
setup is really really easy so you can

00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:32,120
just go clone the project and just do a

00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:37,070
vagrant up and your project will be up

00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:39,320
and running so so the plan is after post

00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:42,470
log we start moving towards deploying it

00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:45,049
to production and then but we need to

00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:47,090
build our widgets ecosystem so

00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:50,779
we need your help on building those

00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:52,669
widgets so we you can use the hub's dev

00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:54,820
federal in for cloud so you can just pay

00:17:52,669 --> 00:18:04,369
go on to this website and see how

00:17:54,820 --> 00:18:08,779
actually hubs looks right now and we are

00:18:04,369 --> 00:18:11,570
actually hacking on hubs tomorrow so in

00:18:08,779 --> 00:18:14,600
that half wished earlier will be giving

00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:17,480
a small workshop on how you can start

00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:20,239
building your widgets and then we have a

00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,799
lot of open issues so you can start

00:18:20,239 --> 00:18:24,440
building and we would be around to help

00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:26,840
you around so it should be easy for you

00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:30,859
to construct contributing and get active

00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:34,749
on the federal hops community and so the

00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:39,470
hackfest is and I guess in the same room

00:18:34,749 --> 00:18:41,269
yeah so we have the hackfest in the same

00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:44,179
room so please come down and start hack

00:18:41,269 --> 00:18:55,730
on hubs we really need you to help us

00:18:44,179 --> 00:18:58,340
with the project and I also I wanted to

00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:00,559
mention Suzanne is giving a talk at it's

00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:02,840
2 p.m. on Thursday right and she's gonna

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:06,859
go over sort of the regional hubs

00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:09,739
feature that you know she's done all the

00:19:06,859 --> 00:19:11,359
initial design research and and the

00:19:09,739 --> 00:19:13,159
actual design and planning for the

00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:14,899
future so if you're interested in

00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:16,369
contributing to hubs this is how you can

00:19:14,899 --> 00:19:17,539
learn more about the design for this

00:19:16,369 --> 00:19:19,639
feature so you could get started

00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:22,399
implementing it's also a great case

00:19:19,639 --> 00:19:24,139
study of how to perform UX within a

00:19:22,399 --> 00:19:26,330
project so if you have a project that

00:19:24,139 --> 00:19:28,309
needs UX help and you kind of want to

00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:30,019
DIY it Suzanne's gonna give you a pretty

00:19:28,309 --> 00:19:32,090
good road map for how to do that for

00:19:30,019 --> 00:19:42,619
your own project in a case study style

00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:47,720
so please check that talk out to fight

00:19:42,619 --> 00:19:51,489
which is totally possible that resolve

00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,489
income center yeah that's not good

00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:57,570
okay let me try that again

00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:14,260
okay blah-blah-blah-blah-blah of course

00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:17,530
because I just changed my IP up it's

00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:24,040
probably not happy about that security

00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:30,280
you know is anybody here planning to go

00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:33,520
to the hackfest cool cool it's gonna be

00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:35,350
fun yeah he elion put together a really

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,000
nice workshop like even if you're not

00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:38,560
familiar with web development you can

00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,640
kind of go in and it's you're gonna

00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:53,530
learn a lot from doing it yeah you have

00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:56,020
a question so the question was is a

00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:57,940
widget linked to one team or can many

00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:00,310
teams use it and it really depends on

00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:02,320
the widget they're implemented in a

00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:04,210
pretty broad manner so you know for

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:08,800
example I'll give you well actually you

00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:11,110
can look here so this this is my hub so

00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:15,010
that's in the middle that's what I'm

00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:17,020
that's my activity recently so I I know

00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:19,450
that I've uploaded this module here I

00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:21,430
did this earlier and now you don't see

00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:24,280
the date here because we don't have a

00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:26,740
good contrast but there's a time and I

00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:28,420
apparently saw something some mushroom

00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:31,210
ingested I don't know what this is but

00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:33,310
it's interesting it may tell me that I

00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:39,790
have something else to do for example my

00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:42,430
build failed somewhere or the thing

00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:45,580
appears okay very interesting so yeah

00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:48,100
I've uploaded a new ticket here moved to

00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:52,840
oh I moved to position 107 on badge

00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:55,870
reader ball oh okay so that's just my

00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:58,720
activity coming from fad message it

00:21:55,870 --> 00:22:01,960
actually gives a good idea of what is

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,000
going on on for a person or a team so I

00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:06,010
think that's pretty useful and then we

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,600
have here widget on the right called

00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:10,210
bugzilla issues so i have my current

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:13,140
open Bugzilla when i'm a point of

00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:13,140
contact for the package

00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:21,450
that still a widget like it can apply to

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,820
a person's home but it can also apply to

00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:26,280
a team hub so that's an example of a

00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:28,560
widget that can apply to pretty much any

00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:30,450
team and you configure which you know

00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:34,140
you can figure all well it's this pig or

00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:36,060
issue or it's this Bugzilla instance or

00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,890
whatever you can configure that stuff so

00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:40,140
it'll display and we have support for

00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:41,520
pig or I think track we're deprecating

00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:43,860
because we don't use it anymore but it

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,510
is implemented and bugzilla at this

00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:47,760
point I think we might we have github

00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:49,740
too right we do yeah we have github

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,120
issue support too so this is like a way

00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:53,580
like you can kind of see like as an

00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,740
example is the widget looks the same and

00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:58,200
sort of the implementation part whether

00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:00,660
or not the team uses github or track or

00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,610
whatever that's sort of hidden the main

00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:03,900
thing is you can see the teams issue so

00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:05,580
it's one of those things where teams are

00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:07,500
inconsistent as to where they track

00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:09,600
their issues and you don't need to worry

00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,220
about that we show it to you the team

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,960
configures it and that's it and you have

00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:15,360
a consistent interface for seeing that

00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,570
so that's sort of a really good micro

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,860
example of what we're trying to do here

00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:24,120
I'll show you just to how to add a

00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:26,460
widget so I switch into edit mode and I

00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:28,620
add this I have this list of already

00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:31,790
existing widgets which are available to

00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:36,600
anybody any team so those widgets can be

00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:38,820
are very common and now I have a widget

00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,680
here which is at that ready for stable

00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:43,080
it will get all the updates that are

00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:49,800
ready for well for stable obviously and

00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:52,620
display them in a widget yeah so that's

00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:54,060
just an example if I add this one it

00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:56,040
will not show anything because I don't

00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:58,500
have any of them right now so it's not

00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:00,930
very a good example but I have like

00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:03,360
plenty of widgets if you have ideas for

00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:05,760
widgets you want please file an issue

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:08,430
and we'll make sure someone looks at it

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,380
we get a mock-up ready and you know in

00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:11,880
the workshop widget I will show you how

00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:16,050
to make a widget that displays your

00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:17,940
current packaging package reviews in the

00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:19,380
different state that they are in so that

00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:22,800
may be very useful because you don't

00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:25,929
always know when someone has fully

00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:27,639
reviewed your package or when when when

00:24:25,929 --> 00:24:29,499
real engines created the repo and all

00:24:27,639 --> 00:24:30,759
that that is good that's a very simple

00:24:29,499 --> 00:24:38,980
thing that you'll be able to do if you

00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:40,509
go to the workshop if you're building

00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:42,009
bridges for different teams you get to

00:24:40,509 --> 00:24:44,249
communicate with them and get to know

00:24:42,009 --> 00:24:47,350
the federal cost of the system more and

00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:52,330
and come up with more and more ideas so

00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:57,360
that's one so that's one way to country

00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:57,360
like get into contribution into fedra

00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:09,190
yeah yeah this is a very simple one

00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:14,259
which is displays a text here this is my

00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:17,350
hub but I could have a link to our rules

00:25:14,259 --> 00:25:19,720
or how we work this wiki pages that

00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:22,240
describe the team works or kind of

00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:24,549
conduct so suppose the infrastructure

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,110
team has a hub so the admin can actually

00:25:24,549 --> 00:25:28,749
set up the different widgets in place

00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:31,330
which are relevant to the their workflow

00:25:28,749 --> 00:25:32,110
and then in the sticky note they can add

00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:34,210
like how-to

00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:37,419
what other steps or new contributors

00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:42,309
should take and so these are the things

00:25:37,419 --> 00:25:44,649
that come in helpful and kind of nice is

00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:48,610
who's the admin who's not admin that

00:25:44,649 --> 00:25:51,159
kind of stuff is out of fast so and the

00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:52,779
hub the way that and I don't know that

00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:55,659
this is implemented exactly right now

00:25:52,779 --> 00:25:58,509
yet but the plan is that each hub like a

00:25:55,659 --> 00:26:00,190
team hub is based on the fast groups so

00:25:58,509 --> 00:26:04,049
like the design team hub is going to be

00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:04,049
coming under the design team fast group

00:26:04,619 --> 00:26:09,700
exactly anyone who's an admin for that

00:26:06,909 --> 00:26:11,980
fast group gets admin for this so it's

00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:14,460
sort of it's more consistent across the

00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:14,460
Fedora apps

00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:30,360
so the question is is as a news user if

00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:32,460
you were looking at this would you see

00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:41,280
real data or would it be sort of mock-up

00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:44,280
data because it gets the data from Fred

00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:46,620
message and does real so the data that

00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:48,240
you see in the stream and then all the

00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:53,520
badges and the Bugzilla issues are the

00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:56,430
real data it might just it might just

00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:58,410
not be formatted yet for sort of you

00:26:56,430 --> 00:27:00,030
know the final consumption that we'd

00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:01,800
like it to be at you know so you might

00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:03,690
there might not be widgets that we'd

00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:07,760
like to show you and you know the data

00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:17,760
might be a little rougher okay great

00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:20,760
awesome okay so the question is are

00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:26,580
those RSS or atom feeds available for

00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:29,400
the data and the feed widget but if you

00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:30,690
have a source in RSS or item and you

00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,220
want to display it you know widget then

00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:34,410
that's very easy you just make the

00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:36,240
backend requests this thing and display

00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:47,490
it in an HTML template that will be just

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:51,300
the widget so on this then that's easy

00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:54,150
that's very easy a lot of infrastructure

00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:56,640
a lot of our infrastructures API

00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:59,910
give us back JSON but it's really not a

00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:02,190
problem to get something else another

00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:05,090
way I have nothing in my figure problem

00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:05,090
that what issue or something

00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:17,500
so yeah we have the cobweb alert so yeah

00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:19,840
that's you the first thing that's also a
