Talk: Fedora Hubs Demo + Roadmap
Presenter: Aurelien Bompard, Máirín Duffy

Description:
Fedora Hubs is a project we've been working on in the Fedora community for a couple of years now. It's meant to both be a sort of project intranet for Fedora contributors as well as a single, unified interface to make it easy for learn about teams across Fedora and to provide a consistent on boarding experience for new contributors.

We will give a demo of Fedora Hubs and discuss the future roadmap, as well as point to other sessions here at Flock where you can learn more about how to contribute to hubs including a widget-creation workshop for beginners and a hackfest.
