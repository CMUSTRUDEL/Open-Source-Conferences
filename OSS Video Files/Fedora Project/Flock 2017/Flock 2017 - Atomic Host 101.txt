Description:

Heard about Atomic Host, but never had a chance to try it out? This
hands on lab will show you the ins and outs of Atomic Host. It will
attempt to dispell some myths and show you how Atomic Host can be
useful even for your traditional non-container workloads. Some of
the features covered will be:

- Atomic Upgrades/Rollbacks
- Browsing OS History
- Package Layering
- Live filesystem updates
- Configuring Storage for Containers
- Viewing Changes to your deployed files

At the beginning of this session I'll briefly present on what Atomic
Host is and then we'll dive right in. Please bring your laptops to the
session and be able to launch a VM on it. We'll send out an email the
week of with instructions on how to download the materials for the
Lab.
