Talk: Introduction to Transtats
Presenter: Sundeep Anand

Description:
In overall success of localization timely translation and their packaging/shipping for targeted release matter the most. Plus packaged translations should be tested as well. In some cases upstream manages the workflow and in another may it be managed for downstream only. In total a sync between upstream, translation platform and build system seem missing. Which actually results in delay or poor localized interfaces. Transtats is an attempt to fill this gap. It answers some of the questions like (1) Translation status of packages at all three places (2) Translation workload estimation for coming release (3) Translation coverage of a list of packages in a set of languages for a given release. Along with this, it can automate a few steps of l10n workflow as well.

Lets discuss Transtats in detail. This project is in early phase of development and any feedback would be of great help!
