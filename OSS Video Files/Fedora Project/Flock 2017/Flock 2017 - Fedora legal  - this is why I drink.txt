Talk: Fedora legal -  this is why I drink
Presenter: Tom Callaway

Description:
Ever wondered why we do the legal voodoo that we do (do) so well? I'll give the 15 minute lightning talk that I did at FOSDEM on Fedora Legal, and then let you pepper me with questions. I promise to try not to answer 'it depends" and "no comment" unless I absolutely have to.
