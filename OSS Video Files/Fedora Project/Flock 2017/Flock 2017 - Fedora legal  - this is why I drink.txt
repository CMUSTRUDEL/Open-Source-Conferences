Talk: Fedora legal -  this is why I drink
Presenter: Tom Callaway

Description:
Ever wondered why we do the legal voodoo that we do (do) so well? I'll give the 15 minute lightning talk that I did at FOSDEM on Fedora Legal, and then let you pepper me with questions. I promise to try not to answer 'it depends" and "no comment" unless I absolutely have to.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,399
background schedule a little bit here

00:00:01,319 --> 00:00:04,560
I'm gonna go ahead and get started so

00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,500
whenever you're ready this is a

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:10,170
presentation that I gave in about 12

00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,610
minutes and faust them they gave me 15

00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,259
minutes to give this presentation so I

00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,839
went super faster and at the end of it I

00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:18,810
had questions and the only question I

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,660
got was how do you talk that fast so I'm

00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,789
gonna slow it down a little bit and and

00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,380
talk about sort of the past present and

00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:28,050
future of Fedora from a legal

00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,490
perspective and and maybe explain a

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:34,230
little bit why whenever you see me I'm

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:36,120
very careless so every good talk about

00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:39,960
legal is required to have a disclaimer

00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:42,660
and mine is no different so I'm not a

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,910
lawyer and working lawyers but I am NOT

00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,989
one nothing in this presentation written

00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,850
or spoken should be considered legal

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:51,180
advice there we go we got the hard part

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:53,280
out of the way I have worked for over 16

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,890
years and I have occasionally allowed to

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,660
speak on behalf of my employer however

00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,730
nothing in this presentation nor this

00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,379
video recording reflects red-hats

00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,899
opinions stances or favorite ice-cream

00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:05,909
flavors basically RedHat didn't

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:08,040
authorize me to say any of this at all

00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:09,780
and if you take any of this as gospel or

00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,549
put it into a press release or you know

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,409
even on hacker news or whatever then

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:18,450
that's on you not on me I'm just finding

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:20,369
it all alright now let's talk about the

00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:25,369
past let's all step back into my legal

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:33,140
TARDIS and visit the long long ago time

00:01:25,369 --> 00:01:36,789
when dinosaurs ruled the earth now once

00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:38,689
upon a time when dinosaurs ruled deer

00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:42,110
there was a thing called Red Hat Linux

00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:44,630
and it was good and this isn't Shack

00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:48,020
which makes it better but but but it was

00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:51,079
good and people were happy and people

00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:53,420
used it and they said we love the Red

00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:55,490
Hat Linux but could you just have this

00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:57,229
one package to it that I found it would

00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:59,060
be really great if you just add this one

00:01:57,229 --> 00:02:00,860
thing and most of the time it was Q mail

00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:02,149
and we laughed at them but sometimes it

00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:05,840
was actually something that we wanted to

00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:08,119
put in and and we said okay you know

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,049
well maybe we'll give you a space to put

00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:11,810
these things so we made this thing

00:02:09,049 --> 00:02:13,190
called contribute up load your rpms

00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,690
whatever you want into that directory

00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:16,430
and that'll be good if people can come

00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:18,110
and get it and then the one point we

00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,250
looked in the contributor directory and

00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,900
then there was like you know what are

00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:24,079
those man-eating plants in the corner

00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,910
and it was like what did you put in the

00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:28,310
contributor rectory you animals whatever

00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:30,650
you're done you know there was like you

00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:33,920
know pieces of a broken car there were a

00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:36,139
couple packages the plant was in there

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:40,400
somewhere and and we said you know this

00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:42,200
is not how we build the Linux we go into

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,319
our nice fancy house and we build the

00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,220
Linux and we do it properly and we do it

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,540
restrictive ly and we put a fence around

00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,069
it and nobody can mess around we don't

00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,989
want your menu any plans that your car

00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:52,549
parks and your garbage in our house Red

00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:53,780
Hat Linux is perfect just as it is and

00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:56,269
we don't need any of your add-ons and

00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,440
none of that nonsense and then some of

00:02:56,269 --> 00:02:58,669
these people I don't know who these

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,430
people are that I've never seen any of

00:02:58,669 --> 00:03:03,109
them before they they said you know what

00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,760
we really would love an opportunity to

00:03:03,109 --> 00:03:07,010
not have it be just done inside the

00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,430
house to really take this vision of what

00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,439
could

00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:12,260
could be in half more input into that

00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:13,819
process and so right now it was like yes

00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,859
if you guys aren't gonna trash it up

00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:18,799
like you draft up Andrew it will let you

00:03:15,859 --> 00:03:20,659
do it and this is how Fedora was born so

00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:22,519
Red Hat kind of let it out there let a

00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:23,870
community form around and let people

00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:25,730
start doing what they wanted to do to

00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,870
shape what they wanted to do in Fedora

00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,950
and they're like you know this is going

00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,450
to be great it's going to be beautiful

00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:32,359
and then it came out for the record one

00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:34,060
would kind of like that but but we had

00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:36,739
faith that someday would look like this

00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:39,439
but right now for core 1 and it looks

00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:41,060
like this and and we went back to these

00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:42,409
people we were like okay well you know

00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,060
we're gonna need some community to

00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:45,530
actually really get involved with this

00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,939
and help us solve a lot of the problems

00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:49,430
that are making this spiky ugly thing so

00:03:46,939 --> 00:03:51,230
it turns into a butterfly and then

00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,609
somebody this has lost to the mists of

00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:55,219
time there when he quite knows who did

00:03:52,609 --> 00:03:56,629
this could have been mark webbing it

00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:58,489
could have been Cthulhu we're not sure

00:03:56,629 --> 00:04:00,260
said you know there's a lot of stuff

00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:02,450
that we're not sure if it's okay to go

00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:04,310
into Fedora or not so what we're gonna

00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,930
do is we're gonna let these people put

00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:09,069
these items into bugzilla

00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:11,479
and we're gonna tag them all efi legal

00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:12,889
so that anything that goes tag there

00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:14,239
somebody will go through and look at

00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:15,709
this and answer the question is this

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,209
okay to go to fedora or not because

00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:18,590
before when it was the house it was red

00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:19,609
hot and red hot knew all the answers to

00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:21,680
these things we could just go to the

00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:22,159
lawyer and say is this okay get out of

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,789
my office

00:04:22,159 --> 00:04:27,260
it wasn't okay and but now we're

00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:28,610
community-driven me into a place where

00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,789
the community to drive these sorts of

00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:34,639
things and so they created a few legal

00:04:30,789 --> 00:04:37,370
but unfortunately what no one realized

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,990
until about Fedora core 3 was that no

00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,550
one was looking at effing legal it was a

00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:42,380
giant black hole people were just

00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,490
throwing issues at Bugzilla tagging them

00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,900
as a big legal and they we're just

00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,770
sitting there assuming that someone was

00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,479
going to look at them but

00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:48,590
no one was looking at them the lawyer

00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:50,449
sure as heck weren't looking at the

00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:52,129
lawyers really knew what bugzilla is I

00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:55,190
think bugzilla my kill blog was much

00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:56,030
less to be addressed for them so you

00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:58,520
know max

00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:00,080
Spivak came to me and he said he any

00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,389
spot you seemed kind of smart which I

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,300
have since learned ends badly for me no

00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:07,099
matter what offense was with but and he

00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:10,460
was like would you help us clear out

00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:11,930
this one tree all these bugs that are

00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,220
filed against Fe legal and I was like

00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,990
I'm not a lawyer he said yeah but you

00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:17,599
seem really smart I think you can figure

00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:18,889
this out I was like alright fine I'll

00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:20,060
figure it out so I'm actually right now

00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:21,949
the legal team and they were like what

00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:23,270
and I was like we have a whole bunch of

00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:24,710
bugs that are filed people want to know

00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:26,870
if these things are ok or not they like

00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:27,860
we're time for any of that you figure it

00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,000
out and it was like how are they

00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,259
supposed to know how to answer these

00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,210
questions they're not lawyers they're

00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:33,680
like look you know all you need to do is

00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:35,240
figure out a basic framework we'll teach

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,460
you what's okay and what's not okay and

00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,479
then you can apply these rules to the

00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,469
thing and I was like okay what are the

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,110
rules are like more you should figure

00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:43,849
that out and it was like so you want me

00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:45,199
to apply rules to the packages to

00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:47,270
determine what can go in and what can't

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,919
and you're not gonna give me any

00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:50,030
guidance on this no but when you come

00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:51,229
when you figure out the rules you come

00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:55,669
Brigham chose whatever they're good or

00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:58,280
bad fine fine fine all right I will I

00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:59,569
will make some rules I will carve them

00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,669
on the wall of the fedora tree house

00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:03,620
they will be henceforth the rules for

00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:05,900
legal what is okay what is not all right

00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:08,090
first rule needs to be free software

00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,259
it's a pretty common sense to me that we

00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,849
wanted to be a free software

00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:14,690
distribution we didn't want any random

00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:17,180
weird garbage trash licenses I was

00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:18,710
looking at contributing a lot of the

00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,690
stuff is in here because it's badly

00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:22,699
licensed it's not under a license to

00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:24,080
anyone understands it has weird clauses

00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:27,020
about walking your dog under the full

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,430
moon and and and that should be since

00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,599
one off so it's like alright done that's

00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:33,050
my rule need to be free software it's

00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:36,540
not them go in and then we thought about

00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:38,979
this a little bit and we realized that

00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:41,830
people like being able to get on the

00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:43,990
internet and if all we have is free

00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:47,590
software then we don't have any wireless

00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:49,030
drivers at all and that's a it could be

00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:50,590
a good thing in some cases but in most

00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:52,690
cases people actually want to be able to

00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:54,220
get on the internet so we're like

00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:55,990
alright well we do want people to be

00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,580
able to use their wireless drivers so

00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:59,229
here's the first exception of the rule

00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:02,229
is that we need firmware to make free

00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:04,210
software look so firmer then powers free

00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:06,009
software is ok we don't like it we

00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:07,889
rather rehab the source code for it but

00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:10,570
since that's never ever going to happen

00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:11,949
we're just gonna deal with it and then I

00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:13,360
thought well there's going to be some

00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:15,060
other rules that we want in there and

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,320
then I said well you know it probably

00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,690
probably should be something that Red

00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:21,699
Hat can actually distribute we don't

00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:23,860
want to be like pirating software

00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:25,479
through a Red Hat that seems like a bad

00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,340
plan since we're all free software

00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:29,110
advocates on this and you know Red Hat

00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:30,849
is a company and we could get sued if we

00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,590
did something really naughty and and and

00:07:30,849 --> 00:07:35,020
most importantly if Red Hat is an

00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:37,030
American company that's not the right

00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:39,729
picture for this slide Red Hat is an

00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:44,849
American that was the right picture at

00:07:39,729 --> 00:07:44,849
FOSDEM Red Hat is an American company

00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:51,639
and there are things that have impact

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,260
our ability to do certain things like

00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:55,150
where you have to make sure we don't

00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:56,740
break federal law we don't break export

00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:59,470
law we don't break any international

00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:01,949
treaties we don't actually go to war

00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:05,349
because of something we distributed and

00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:07,389
so complying with US laws it's important

00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:10,479
and so we have got as an additional rule

00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:11,830
now I took this to the legal team and I

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,720
said well what do you think about this

00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:15,699
and this is kind of the faces that they

00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,110
made back at me this is Chris Blizzard

00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:18,970
by the way a long time red hat her

00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,889
former Fedora and so he he he's cool

00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:26,039
with me using this face

00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:27,330
angry way and they were like and they

00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,650
thought about it for a really long time

00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:30,330
and then they came back and they were

00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:31,949
like none of this has anything to do

00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:33,839
with like specifics of licenses and I

00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:35,940
was like yeah most of this stuff is

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,380
pretty straightforward like GPL BSD MIT

00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:40,409
we've got that covered it's all these

00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:41,909
weird corner cases and they were like

00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:44,459
okay so here's what we're gonna do is

00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:47,370
we're gonna let you bring all the weird

00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:48,839
corner cases to us one at a time and

00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:52,140
we'll classify them as we go and we'll

00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:54,209
add to the list of rules so we start

00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:56,839
with this list of rules and and we're

00:08:54,209 --> 00:09:00,870
pretty good for about ten minutes

00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:02,579
and then someone pointed out hey me

00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:04,320
patents might be a problem should we

00:09:02,579 --> 00:09:06,390
should we be concerned about patents and

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,470
and I went to the lawyers that I was

00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:09,480
like should we be concerned about

00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:14,100
patents and they were like Heather to

00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:15,570
the rulest so so now we've got does not

00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,519
infringe known US patents and I asked

00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:19,350
the lawyer said how should I know if

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,140
something infringes a patent and they

00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,670
said you shouldn't then I'm like well

00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,320
then how am I supposed to tell people

00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:26,370
whether something infringes on own

00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,279
patent and they're like well if it's

00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:35,760
known then then it no and I'm like so

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:37,680
should i search for patents no so when

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,540
does it cross the line from being known

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:51,660
by me then well if somebody would know

00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:55,010
about it and they were like no like if

00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,010
somebody goes running around screaming

00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:00,199
and it was like if people do

00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:06,180
and then there were like while you're in

00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:08,100
here um we have a problem with some of

00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,540
the stuff that we found in contribute

00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,640
old if that existed and we're really

00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,840
concerned about it and it was like you

00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,880
know we don't use that anymore like yeah

00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:18,600
but we really have a problem with all

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,460
the fancy stuff and stuff and they were

00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,200
like well you know the fan stuff but

00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,910
like the community is built and I'm like

00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,890
you mean all over the door no no no no

00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:27,990
no no like the stuff that's like Red Hat

00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:29,490
font and like Red Hat this and red hat

00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,600
that is infringing our trademark we

00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:32,100
really aren't cool with that

00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,410
and I was like well can we still call it

00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:36,090
the door like yeah that's cool that's

00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:38,280
like a great respect - and that

00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:41,010
trademarks and then there were like well

00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,340
you know maybe it should be more broader

00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,750
than that

00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,250
and I'm like what you mean they're like

00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:46,200
well the law doesn't require it it would

00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:48,840
be a nice thing if we we respected other

00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,110
people's trademarks - it was like okay

00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,920
cool

00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:54,300
all right there's my conference so these

00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,800
are the rules and when we set this down

00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,440
and then they were like okay great and

00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,880
then so I started looking at the brunt

00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,980
of the broader problem space we've got

00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,700
our baseline rules for what is OK for

00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,200
fedora

00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,700
obviously there are millions of

00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,320
exceptions that are don't fall into this

00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,700
but this is a gun good guidance that if

00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,080
I put this up and say this is what goes

00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,660
in and what doesn't people will

00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:14,790
generally understand it and then I

00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:18,290
started looking at the packages that we

00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:18,290
inherited from Red Hat and

00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:22,489
people were just kind of writing

00:11:20,809 --> 00:11:23,899
whatever they felt like in the licensed

00:11:22,489 --> 00:11:25,339
feel like if you've ever looked at a

00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:28,610
packaging spec and you've ever looked at

00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:30,550
the group filled like some of the

00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:33,739
packages that Red Hat made had sensible

00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:35,119
consistent text in that string there's

00:11:33,739 --> 00:11:38,689
lots of people that just wrote stuff

00:11:35,119 --> 00:11:40,970
like whatever or required that was my

00:11:38,689 --> 00:11:42,949
favorite group field required probably

00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:44,420
kept it in there but between the

00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:45,709
licensed field it was sort of ad hoc

00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,779
like people would write things like

00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:52,519
distributable distributable is my

00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:56,389
favorite okay

00:11:52,519 --> 00:12:00,889
license okay or license in package was a

00:11:56,389 --> 00:12:02,540
fun one you know or or they would be

00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:04,189
outright honest and we're great cria

00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:10,610
terry in that field and I was like oh

00:12:04,189 --> 00:12:12,199
that's so I said okay well what we gotta

00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:13,879
do is we gotta standardize on this set

00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:15,439
of names for the licensing in the

00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:16,699
packages so it's consistent so somebody

00:12:15,439 --> 00:12:18,379
readily picks up a package they have a

00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:19,819
good idea what the licensing inside of

00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:21,339
the package is there should be an easy

00:12:19,819 --> 00:12:25,850
problem to solve

00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:28,160
no I start pulling packages apart and

00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:32,149
discovering that people in good faith

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,490
mark something as bsd or expert 86 or

00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:35,410
MIT g or

00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:37,390
the number of roughly equivalent naming

00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:38,740
strings and when I would start pulling

00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:40,959
it apart I would discover that there's a

00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:41,920
lot of other licenses there in play in

00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,140
here sometimes they were compatible

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,430
sometimes they weren't which made me

00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,779
walk back down to the lawyers and say

00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:49,240
hey where does a licensed compatible

00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:52,360
with another license and then they threw

00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,709
things at me till I left and and what I

00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,910
eventually learned was as no one knows

00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:56,440
the answer to that question

00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:57,850
no one knows whether one license is

00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,230
compatible with another license other

00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:00,970
than in cases of like obvious

00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:02,290
incompatibility like the Connell license

00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:04,690
which was written to be explicitly

00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:06,130
getting compatible with GPL and then

00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:07,630
some went and interviewed the people in

00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:09,160
public and had them say yes we wrote

00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:11,410
this explicitly to be incompatible with

00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,120
the GPL there's no ambiguity about that

00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:15,250
license whatsoever but other licenses

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,680
are less clear is this license

00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:20,350
compatible with that license maybe kinds

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,670
on which lawyer you ask and then you

00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,930
have guidance from like the Free

00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:24,310
Software Foundation who will tell you

00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:25,839
which licenses are compatible with the

00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:28,660
GPL or not and they know because they

00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,830
wrote the GPL they're just smart I guess

00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:33,430
but we trust them because they're

00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:34,690
lawyers except they're not but so we

00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:36,100
started tracking all these licenses we

00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,450
just started making a list I just said

00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:40,920
okay I'll just write down every time I

00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:43,390
find a new licenses 350 licenses later

00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,040
we pending longest licensing lists of

00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:48,160
any community and free and open source

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:51,399
we know about more licenses than anyone

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,870
does today still consistently we know

00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:53,920
more about licenses than anybody else

00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,450
does didn't I just started putting them

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,010
in a wiki giving them a unique name and

00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:59,260
then every time I saw that again I just

00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:00,910
appended that unique name and came up

00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,990
with a basic machine parsable syntax

00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:03,279
we're putting in the license field

00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:04,170
because that's just a texturing we

00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,990
should be able to parse that

00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:09,089
the machine and what we discovered is

00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:11,310
there are 16 BSD variants and 34

00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:13,110
variants at the MIT they're basically

00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:14,820
all saying the same thing they just have

00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:15,839
slight bits of rewording or some one

00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,089
thought one work sounded more

00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,980
authoritative than another or one legal

00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:21,810
deployer changed off the boilerplate for

00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:24,389
the warranty disclaimer with theirs it

00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:26,639
doesn't change that licenses impact or

00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:27,690
effect on the file but as far as lawyer

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,029
is concerned those are different

00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:31,949
licenses so now we know what the

00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:34,380
licenses are in fedora and I spent

00:14:31,949 --> 00:14:35,730
several major Fedora releases going

00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,990
through and auditing every single one of

00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:38,459
the packages that we had in the fedora

00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:39,839
and making sure that the licenses will

00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:42,540
correct on those files and then they

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,820
reflected the sources within fixing the

00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:46,589
obvious glaring points and getting them

00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,660
through I slipped a couple releases to

00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:51,690
get that fixed I'm sorry that was on me

00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:53,820
my bad but we're now in a state today

00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:55,290
where Fedora is generally correct with

00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:57,180
the license information in the packages

00:14:55,290 --> 00:15:00,329
so that was worth the effort it was

00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:02,699
worth the process and then I kept

00:15:00,329 --> 00:15:04,260
thinking what people give stuff to

00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:06,060
fedora leg

00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:07,820
we're not the Linux kernel we're not

00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:10,949
taking a ton of code but we're getting

00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:13,410
copyright award Senate Tunis we should

00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:14,850
figure out what to do and then I went to

00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:16,230
ask the legal team and I said well right

00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:17,640
now what what what should we do in those

00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:21,839
cases like no that's covered we have a

00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:24,870
CLA now if you don't know what a CLA is

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,850
the CLA is it could stand for

00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:28,769
contributor License Agreement it could

00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:30,060
stand for period license assignment it

00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:32,130
stands for any of those things which

00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:35,610
makes it in its own acronym e way

00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:37,740
confusing and it was written for lawyers

00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:39,660
by lawyers and so it's written in

00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,220
legalese which is not English despite it

00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:44,120
having words that sort of shaped like

00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:44,120
English and

00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:48,259
when I asked two different lawyers on

00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:49,339
the legal team to tell me what it meant

00:15:48,259 --> 00:15:50,809
neither of whom in written the original

00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:52,249
document because the other the lawyer

00:15:50,809 --> 00:15:54,529
who wrote the original document was gone

00:15:52,249 --> 00:15:55,999
by this point they both gave me

00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:58,189
different interpretations of what it

00:15:55,999 --> 00:16:00,079
meant and it was at that point that I

00:15:58,189 --> 00:16:02,269
realized we probably couldn't expect any

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:04,100
normal humans to be able to understand

00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:06,410
what this means either and I could write

00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,970
a long explanation of what I thought it

00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:10,910
meant but it would be better if we had

00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:12,139
something that people understood also it

00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:14,119
looked like a copyright assignment

00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:16,069
agreement and you could interpret it

00:16:14,119 --> 00:16:17,720
that way and it wasn't really red hats

00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:20,329
intent for it ever to be a copyright

00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,470
assignment agreement but if you read it

00:16:20,329 --> 00:16:22,999
in the right light it looks like that

00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:24,529
and as a result we have a lot of

00:16:22,999 --> 00:16:26,179
companies that wanted to participate the

00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:28,459
door that we're like we can't sign this

00:16:26,179 --> 00:16:30,769
thing we don't know what it means so

00:16:28,459 --> 00:16:32,209
worked with one of the lawyers of read

00:16:30,769 --> 00:16:34,339
out Richard Fontana to come up with a

00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:36,649
new text that was written legalese but

00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:38,209
was in the sort of legalese that has the

00:16:36,649 --> 00:16:39,740
rough equivalent in English so you could

00:16:38,209 --> 00:16:42,709
write a short little simple diagram has

00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:44,660
minimal boilerplate just says these are

00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:46,699
the simplified terms that apply if you

00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:48,170
contribute something to us and the goal

00:16:46,699 --> 00:16:49,429
that we set for the lawyer because when

00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:50,839
you're working with a lawyer you always

00:16:49,429 --> 00:16:52,160
want to remember to set a goal for them

00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:54,199
so that they know exactly what they're

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,850
trying to work towards and the goal that

00:16:54,199 --> 00:16:57,350
we set was we want to make it so that

00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:58,879
when people give us something it's under

00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:01,279
a default free license unless they

00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:02,149
specify a different license so if you

00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,309
want to give us something under

00:17:02,149 --> 00:17:06,500
different license you can and if we'd

00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:07,250
like that license we'll take it but most

00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,779
of the people who were doing

00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,549
contributions weren't bothering to put a

00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:12,470
license on it it was just coming in and

00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:14,149
so we wanted to have a default license

00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:15,380
that was permissive that was accessible

00:17:14,149 --> 00:17:17,299
for everybody used was sort of

00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:19,939
universally compatible and that was what

00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:21,049
we created the FPGA some of you have

00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:22,939
been here a while I remember when we

00:17:21,049 --> 00:17:25,549
switched the click-through model from

00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:26,809
the old CLA to the FPGA you you click

00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:28,700
that you accepted that and all of a

00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:29,960
sudden anything you gave us from here

00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,789
until eternity was under one of these

00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:34,490
default licenses unless you specified

00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:35,899
other to date to people that I know of

00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:37,610
have made contributions with a specified

00:17:35,899 --> 00:17:39,080
license the rest of you have been using

00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:41,410
the default license that we set up so I

00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:45,740
figured that news

00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:47,060
now I kept tackling all these other side

00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,890
projects and working with other

00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:50,000
communities to help them understand why

00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:53,300
we weren't letting their stuff into

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,920
fedora and as part of auditing all of

00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:57,320
the packages we discovered lots of

00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,610
things inside fedora that some other

00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:02,000
communities had known about for a really

00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:05,090
long time they never tried to fix a big

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,070
one was there was a big chunk of code in

00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:09,740
xorg that was under what was known as

00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:11,810
the SGI freebie license and the freebie

00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:13,490
license was very clearly not open-source

00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:15,340
and not free like everybody looked at it

00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:19,100
was an agreement that it was not okay

00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:20,420
but actually we needed that code and it

00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:23,330
would be nice if we didn't revert back

00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:25,610
to a pre 3d rendering state for X so

00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:28,220
basically everyone just kept using this

00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:31,670
code and because SGI was unlikely to

00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:34,070
manage to find its you know its socks in

00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:35,720
the morning much less sue anybody

00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:37,430
everybody figure was the next stage we

00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,380
all just kept beating blatant violation

00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:40,700
of this license that it was all good but

00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,530
we really did want to get this fixed

00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:45,950
because it was important not to just let

00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:47,960
you know garbage into Fedora and so much

00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:49,460
discussions with the upstream we finally

00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,900
managed to convince them that it was in

00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:52,790
their best interest we would do a nice

00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,320
press release to thank them for it to

00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:56,210
get this relicensing done and so we

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,860
finally got the SGI freebie license

00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:59,930
realizes to an open-source license

00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:01,700
thankfully they had an or later clause

00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:03,620
in their original license so all we had

00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:05,150
to do is release version 1.1 of the

00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:07,930
freebie license which said this is now

00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,930
MIT and

00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:12,590
and then we started looking at Java code

00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,669
because we went and bought a java

00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:15,020
company and all of a sudden people

00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:16,820
wanted to put a whole bunch more job or

00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:18,049
than ever before in the fedora and we

00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:20,780
started looking at some of the fun stuff

00:19:18,049 --> 00:19:22,669
that some had done and Simon had a

00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:24,049
clause in their license that said it's a

00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:25,130
little longer than I'm simplifying it

00:19:24,049 --> 00:19:28,659
here but it basically said that you

00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:28,659
couldn't use it in a nuclear submarine

00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:35,270
to be honest but but there was a clause

00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:37,580
there and that's a user restriction that

00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:39,620
makes it not open-source and so we spent

00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:42,919
a lot of time talking to Sun and then

00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:44,720
Oracle about dropping the nuclear clause

00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:45,890
for most of the things that Sun finally

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,679
went through and said look if you will

00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:50,570
just stop emailing us we will do this

00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:52,190
and so they dropped the nuclear

00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:53,690
submarine clause from all their licenses

00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:56,809
which made it all nice and open source

00:19:53,690 --> 00:20:00,860
and free and then there was the artistic

00:19:56,809 --> 00:20:03,020
case the Train software case where they

00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:04,580
went law stood in court or the fact that

00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:07,070
the judge interpreted the artistic as a

00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:08,419
contract novel license and which was

00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:11,780
later overturned on appeal because he

00:20:08,419 --> 00:20:13,940
was very very wrong but at that time we

00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:16,909
decided you know what the artistic one

00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:20,690
license is kind of a crap license all

00:20:16,909 --> 00:20:23,539
respect to Larry it's his intention is

00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:25,400
clear his wording was poorly chosen and

00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:27,289
there were other people that had redone

00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,049
the artistic license in several ways you

00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:31,159
have the artistic license improved I

00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:32,419
think is one of the wording variants

00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:34,460
it's out there and then the artistic to

00:20:32,419 --> 00:20:36,169
license that was out there again same

00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:38,000
intent just better wording to close all

00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:39,500
the holes in it make it clear nobody

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,120
really needed to be using the artistic

00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,320
one license anymore so we took the step

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,940
in for the order to say okay we're going

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:47,480
to go through everything that we have

00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:48,950
Perl artistic one in Fedora and we're

00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,780
going to drop all the ones we can't get

00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:52,340
them very license and so I spent a lot

00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,929
of time emailing various upstream

00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:55,290
maintainer x' who said things like

00:20:53,929 --> 00:20:58,440
you're still using our code

00:20:55,290 --> 00:21:00,120
thinking about that 10 years ago and kid

00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:02,070
middles and also know yeah they won't

00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,300
realize yes we had we had about five

00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:05,490
people who refused to realize since

00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:07,890
their code repairing if the door and we

00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:11,400
dropped it nobody knows which is a good

00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:12,930
thing but and then most people were just

00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,310
like oh yeah sure same licenses pearl is

00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:16,380
fine and they would let us add that

00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:22,190
license which is pearls license is GPL

00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:24,450
or artistic so you can choose and we so

00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:25,950
we got all the perl modules cleaned up

00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,690
and we as a by-product we cleaned up all

00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:28,800
of Sipan and what I've been told by some

00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:30,060
folks they're still active in the Perl

00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,010
space is that there's almost nothing

00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:33,270
artistic only in Sipan as a result of

00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:44,120
that effort than those other upstream

00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:44,120
sort of and I looked at the tech life

00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:50,340
which which was a very bad idea in

00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:52,530
retrospect but and then started to work

00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:54,270
to up identify and remove all the non

00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:56,220
free components they had quite a bit of

00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:59,850
stuff that was not free and not open

00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:00,900
source inside tech live and at first

00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:02,550
they were like no that's open source

00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,260
that's fine and I was like you have an

00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:06,210
entire category in your distribution

00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:08,010
where you tag things as other you know

00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:09,330
exactly what's in here what's not okay

00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:10,650
it's not like I'm telling you things

00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:12,240
you're surprised about you just don't

00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:13,430
want to clean out your craft and they

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,540
were like maybe

00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:16,650
but they did and they finally have gone

00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:18,480
through and cleaned out all their craft

00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:19,770
and we haven't there's nothing not very

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,090
left in tech live anymore

00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:24,680
there's stuff that is unholy and

00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:28,200
disgusting but but but not gone for it

00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:29,550
now I also worked with a lot of smaller

00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,870
projects help delivers all the licensing

00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:31,950
issues so that they were free software

00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:33,780
they would come to us and they'd be like

00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:37,170
look we love to get into fedora someday

00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:38,100
and we don't understand you know whether

00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:39,390
we can do this or not

00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,620
and we basically say stop writing your

00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:42,150
own license which is the best advice

00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:44,310
that give most of us dreams is to stop

00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:45,540
writing your own license but we also

00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:47,010
work with a lot of font Huff's dreams

00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:48,990
font authors don't really understand

00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:50,430
copyrights or anything other than making

00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:52,020
awesome fonts and so it worked with a

00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:53,520
lot of them to get their licenses that

00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:55,230
we can ship in fedora because we help

00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,730
them to understand that it is really

00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:58,140
cool to have lots of people use your

00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:01,440
fonts and not just have them be on a

00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:02,280
page that no one ever touches or does no

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,300
he's huge

00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,860
I was pretty obvious with one of the

00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,240
FACA Tolliver's look people gonna pirate

00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,770
your fonts if they're awesome would you

00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,060
rather have them be free and open so

00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:11,160
that people might send you about fixes

00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:12,870
rather than just outright pirate them

00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:15,570
and that was their convincing argument

00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:16,830
for a lot of fun developers we also took

00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:18,540
on the Fedora trademarks and got them

00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:20,160
into just one package so it was really

00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:21,300
easy to rebrand fedora that was

00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,920
something a lot of people wanted to be

00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,150
able to do - for bowl for the or

00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,470
distribution and so I said fine I'll

00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:27,480
just shove everything in one package and

00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:28,650
so if you want a Fedora logo in your

00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,090
thing great we're just in to live in

00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:32,370
that one pack if you can depend on it

00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:33,870
and so that actually helped make you

00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:38,100
know the relative anything's possible

00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:42,370
much later although that was never mind

00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:43,570
but so that brings us to the present so

00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:46,120
let's talk about some new legal issues

00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:48,100
that we've addressed recently so let's

00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:51,400
let's talk about cryptography for a

00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:52,870
little bit cryptography is the art of

00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:55,750
attempting to keep people out of your

00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:57,820
stuff so we've got some locks now a big

00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:59,740
thing in the modern era once people

00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:01,570
discovered that old-school cryptography

00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:02,200
was terribly insecure really easy to

00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:04,330
break into

00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,500
once again all this ECC stuff enabled

00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:08,950
ECC being elliptic curve cryptography

00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:10,570
and so we worked very closely with the

00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:12,280
Riley GLE team to figure out how we

00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:14,110
could get all this into fedora and it

00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:15,970
took it took 10 years to get all the

00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:17,860
core curves into Fedora get them cleared

00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:21,900
through legal because of the immense

00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:24,700
thud and Pat annoys around the space and

00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:27,220
so today we have all the curves and NSA

00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:30,010
sweepy plus those additional curves that

00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:31,330
are there so basically all the ECC

00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:35,230
curves that you care about for anything

00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:37,090
we ship today so we're in a much better

00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:39,760
state now than we were 10 years ago

00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:41,170
around ECC so that's all cleaned up

00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,390
that's all resolved as far as I know

00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:47,130
there's nobody who has a curve that they

00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:47,130
want to turn on that we have

00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:53,320
then let's talk about music yeah

00:24:52,269 --> 00:24:55,750
everybody's groaning because we know

00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:57,639
this but but mp3 has been a big thing

00:24:55,750 --> 00:25:01,419
like you know some people like to play

00:24:57,639 --> 00:25:03,820
mp3s I don't you know it's a little

00:25:01,419 --> 00:25:07,720
unknown music format that occasionally

00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:09,909
people support but today fedora

00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:13,000
we have full functionality on mp3 good

00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:14,500
riddance to naughty patents I say all of

00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,539
them have expired at this point and we

00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:19,149
can have a celebration ding-dong the mp3

00:25:16,539 --> 00:25:21,850
patents or dead party later this is do

00:25:19,149 --> 00:25:23,019
not so much to me but really to

00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:25,179
Christians all around the red have no

00:25:23,019 --> 00:25:26,620
desktop Dima did a lot of solid work in

00:25:25,179 --> 00:25:28,090
the process as the patents were expiring

00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:29,860
figuring out when we would be able to

00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:31,690
enable various aspects of the

00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:33,490
functionality decoding first then

00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:35,139
fooling coding I think it was a little

00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,580
bit of a surprise when the consortium

00:25:35,139 --> 00:25:37,960
announced that anybody could use it now

00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:39,279
it's all done because that almost never

00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,019
happens they usually try and milk that

00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:43,080
out for a year - after the patents have

00:25:41,019 --> 00:25:43,080
expired

00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,980
but we also have mp2 available as well

00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:49,900
so if you're really interested in even

00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:55,530
more obscure formats than

00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:55,530
that's all right let's talk about

00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:03,929
boss now freetype implement Swan

00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:05,340
rendering most places anyway I mean if

00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:06,989
you're using like weird things that

00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:09,090
don't you use three times and do funky

00:26:06,989 --> 00:26:11,129
font rendering that's on you the bike

00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:13,080
book patents expired in 2010 which

00:26:11,129 --> 00:26:14,519
allowed us to do a lot of the stuff that

00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:17,190
used to be in the freetype free world

00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:18,479
package in fedora and get a significant

00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:19,739
improvement in font rendering you can

00:26:18,479 --> 00:26:23,580
look at the before and after pictures

00:26:19,739 --> 00:26:27,389
and it's pretty scary now we're still

00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:30,119
dealing with clear type paths Microsoft

00:26:27,389 --> 00:26:31,590
holds these patents and basically sum it

00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:33,210
up they prevent LCD sub pixel

00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:35,340
functionality which means that if you

00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:36,749
aren't still using a CRT for some reason

00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,950
then there's a lot a significant

00:26:36,749 --> 00:26:41,009
functionality that can improve the

00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:42,809
rendering of your fonts the last clear

00:26:41,009 --> 00:26:45,269
type patent at Microsoft holds that we

00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:48,989
know of being clear I don't go searching

00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:51,899
for patents expires in July of 2019 so

00:26:48,989 --> 00:26:53,039
if we're waiting for patents then it's

00:26:51,899 --> 00:26:56,609
going to be a couple more years but

00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:58,909
we'll close so the homestretch is within

00:26:56,609 --> 00:26:58,909
reach

00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:10,770
near future I hope s 3tc expires October

00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:11,940
2nd I have a calendar alert I'm so

00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:14,190
thrilled when this goes on and really

00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:15,750
like because because then we can put

00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:18,410
stuff like we don't do any hacks for

00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:25,320
steam anymore and that'll be amazing so

00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:25,800
source and pick one video close we're

00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:31,170
close

00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:32,880
maybe I'm think to in 2018 maybe GE 720

00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:36,000
on audio which is used by a lot of the

00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,410
more server IP stuff is clear now the

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,270
patents have all gone away and the

00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:41,400
upstream basically did the same thing at

00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:42,810
mp3 7 they said you know we don't think

00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,010
it'd gotten still apply on this and the

00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:45,480
royalty-free now as far as we're

00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:47,690
concerned so we have the ocular to turn

00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:56,370
it on I just need to make the commits

00:27:47,690 --> 00:28:02,640
and now the far future alright

00:27:56,370 --> 00:28:04,320
x5 2024 I hope you folks don't really

00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,560
want to use any USB keys that are pretty

00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:09,180
damaged in terms of course unless the

00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:14,010
new Microsoft that loves open source

00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:15,120
provides a patent grant for boss except

00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:17,480
on their website where they say they

00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:22,100
explicitly do

00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:22,100
h.264 rough yes

00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:32,740
it's gonna be a while DVD playback you

00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:34,510
haven't just given that's not even

00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:35,380
patent encumbered that's DMCA encumbered

00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:46,420
we're gonna have to get some real

00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:48,940
government changing s P D X now I have a

00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:50,230
session on SPD X tomorrow if you really

00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:54,580
want to go deep into this but the high

00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:56,290
level is that SPD X is a standard that

00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:58,750
the Linux Foundation came up with to

00:28:56,290 --> 00:29:01,150
standardize how licensing are reported

00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:03,640
and it's not it's it's what happens when

00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:06,040
lawyers and supply chain experts have a

00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:08,070
baby and you get X P DX it's not

00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:11,860
necessarily a bad thing it's just ugly

00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:13,450
and I'm sorry I love the work you do you

00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:14,710
do great work SPD X people Linux

00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:15,940
Foundation people you know I love you

00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:20,710
know I respect you look in the camera

00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:21,850
but it's not it's not as simple as what

00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:23,380
we put together in fedora

00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:25,600
it's gonna involve a lot of work for us

00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:27,610
to do it there's two aspects of SPD x

00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,780
one is the license identifiers which are

00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:29,860
actually pretty clean and pretty

00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:31,350
beautiful they're a little different

00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:33,760
from what we use but different is okay

00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:36,040
this is the license identifier that the

00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,630
software installer and genome uses when

00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,340
you pull up an out data file it tells

00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:41,740
you they are licensed NS PDX

00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:43,300
identifiers not fedora identifiers

00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,860
because it's not a fedora thing it's a

00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,210
much more independent thing so it's more

00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:48,280
logical for them to adopt that standard

00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:50,020
and the SPD X people have been working

00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:52,240
to Apple licenses that we added the

00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:53,860
Fedora license lists to their list so

00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,110
they should map up the biggest

00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:57,220
difference is that we take all the BSD

00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:58,810
in the MIT variants that are

00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:01,150
functionally identical we call them BSD

00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:01,720
and MIT every single one of those has a

00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:03,940
unique

00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,740
on a fire so if we were to switch to

00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:07,480
that naming scheme entirely we would

00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:09,940
have to go through an audit every single

00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,230
appearance of a BST or MIT source file

00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:13,660
and determine which one of those

00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:16,810
variants it is and real Abel with that

00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:18,130
man it's not impossible but I don't see

00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:22,240
people falling over themselves to

00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:24,280
volunteer for that task so SP DX is a

00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,170
broader standard involves injecting XML

00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,760
on a per source file basis that tracks

00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:29,710
the license of every single source file

00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,750
in a package so that a package can check

00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:33,400
that out and look at this XML file and

00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:35,260
determine all the sources that went into

00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:39,040
it and which is really good if you're

00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:40,870
trying to be extremely focused on your

00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,280
export control and what shipping what

00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:43,900
you ship and for a lot of proprietary

00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:46,690
companies that use open source that's

00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:48,130
really important for us in fedora we

00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:51,460
probably don't care about it at that

00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:53,170
level also I really feel strongly that's

00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:55,090
where upstream should be delivering

00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:57,010
these files and not us there is a

00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:58,990
potential for a liability concern if we

00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:00,340
ship an incorrect SPG X file and

00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:02,770
claiming something is under a license

00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:04,480
it's not at that level and I'd much

00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:06,160
rather have that liability fall over on

00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,660
the upstream and have them say this is

00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,690
what we think the licenses on these

00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:12,090
files

00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:15,510
would you like to know more tomorrow s

00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:17,400
PDX we go deep and that's that's sort of

00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:19,050
the legal state of affairs on this I

00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,850
will happily take questions in the

00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:22,020
little bit of time I have left but keep

00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:25,140
in mind that I reserve the right to

00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:27,450
answer no comment or I have no idea yes

00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:29,040
so I know back to the elliptic curve

00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:31,950
thing I know for a while there were some

00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:34,820
issues with the default standard library

00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:37,920
and go having a long larger list of

00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:41,430
elliptic curves identifiers than we

00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:43,170
supported has that been more we fixed

00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:45,330
that up there was an implementation now

00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:46,950
when we added that last curve we were

00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:48,300
able to flip back to their default we

00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:50,190
were having to flip it off the default

00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:51,480
and a lot of go code was hard coding

00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:53,880
that default rather than just calling

00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:55,350
the default variable so but that's all

00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,550
fixed we now have that implementation

00:31:55,350 --> 00:32:00,530
and there's no more go problems than

00:31:56,550 --> 00:32:00,530
aware of with that awesome Nick

00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:19,890
all I can say on AAC is that we're aware

00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:23,220
of it and that it's an ongoing process I

00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:24,270
think the obvious example for other

00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:26,190
open-source projects that are following

00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:29,850
this with interest are don't write your

00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:31,559
own license if you know patents are in

00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:33,299
the space do your due diligence and

00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:34,710
disclose them and do your best you get a

00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:35,940
grant put on them so that people aren't

00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:37,950
in front aren't having to worry about

00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:41,789
the conflict between copyright and

00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:43,529
patents try to choose a license that

00:32:41,789 --> 00:32:44,789
matches the rest of your community space

00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:46,529
if you choose a very interesting

00:32:44,789 --> 00:32:47,909
open-source license that is incompatible

00:32:46,529 --> 00:32:52,230
with everyone else then you're gonna

00:32:47,909 --> 00:32:53,789
have a bad day and just make sure that

00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:55,890
you have a history of who contributed

00:32:53,789 --> 00:32:57,720
what win so that if you ever have to

00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:59,909
rely since the path forward is obvious

00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:01,500
it may not be simple but it is better to

00:32:59,909 --> 00:33:02,669
have an obvious path forward than to be

00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,830
like people gave us stuff and we don't

00:33:02,669 --> 00:33:06,899
know who or when or how and again

00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:08,220
github is sort of and get have remedied

00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:09,840
a lot of that because you can see the

00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:11,460
history of whom gave what win and then

00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:14,309
determine who have copyright on the work

00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:16,230
but it's still better to have that in

00:33:14,309 --> 00:33:17,760
some way if you don't use source control

00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:18,799
at least have a history of who

00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,460
contributed

00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:23,380
yes

00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:25,150
and volt a that mobile surprise I'm

00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:26,290
introducing the user experience our

00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:29,400
heard about the case we have

00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:33,730
contributions from minor minor problem

00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:36,250
um no I think that there's established

00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:44,320
case law that they can hold copyright on

00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:45,640
things so technically the Fedora terms

00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,190
say that you have to be thirteen have an

00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:50,170
account but we don't ever ask for

00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:52,410
anybody's age so if anyone is under the

00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:56,980
age of 13 and they should inform me now

00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:59,080
all right good yeah no it gets a little

00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:01,540
complicated as to win-win minors can can

00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:03,040
agree to contracts and licenses and it

00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,630
probably is something that's not

00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,070
terribly binding but it's never been an

00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:07,870
issue so if we ever discovered that a

00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:09,910
very young child had given us a lot of

00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:11,500
stuff we would probably go to the effort

00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:12,910
of reaching out to their parents to

00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:17,310
secure the permission to have copyright

00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:17,310
on the board yes

00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:31,790
that is the epic troll and I respect

00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,790
that

00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:36,119
ya know our export regulations

00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:37,470
specifically say that we have never sent

00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:40,250
anything to North Korea and they will

00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:40,250
never send anything back

00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:54,030
couple d3 Cotton's because there were so

00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,530
many of them the Knights of alarm so

00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:58,770
then they were just popping to go I'm

00:34:55,530 --> 00:35:00,240
happy but funny but in general I have a

00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:02,160
pretty good idea of what's coming up

00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:04,590
because I've run into these on a regular

00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:09,950
enough basis like s3 kisi I know exactly

00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:09,950
when that's going to expire so yes

00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:21,380
for release in futur logos

00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:24,230
how much work with her was was the whole

00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:25,940
open h264 thing we've got going and what

00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:27,900
our chances of being able to use that

00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:30,250
kind of solution from other

00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:32,230
you know you probably have a better

00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:33,700
answer to this one but I think that that

00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:36,070
was sort of a unique situation where

00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:37,900
someone was able to use their existing

00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:39,970
licensing to come up with a very clever

00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:43,030
workaround for a problem that they saw

00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:44,860
and they I think that nobody involved

00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:48,100
with the mpeg-2 source of our h.264

00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:50,530
really doesn't want people to use mpeg-4

00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:52,990
h.264 I think it's just that the money

00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:55,540
is so good with the licensing for it

00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:57,010
that it took someone like a Cisco to be

00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:59,020
able to figure out a workaround for that

00:35:57,010 --> 00:36:01,000
it's possible that were there other

00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:02,260
equally popular technologies that it

00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,150
would be in another company's best

00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:05,710
interest to do a sort of workaround but

00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:06,970
I honestly can't think of a case off the

00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:09,570
top of my head where I think it would be

00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:09,570
likely to crop up

00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:14,200
yeah and again it's not something that I

00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:17,980
would say don't want to be like offering

00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:19,930
up to other people but if it was h.264

00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:22,270
support in the browser with html5 is

00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:23,980
just a really really necessary piece to

00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:26,730
make it work there aren't a whole lot of

00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:26,730
other cases like that

00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:32,050
they're just not as popular so I one

00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:34,240
last question then I'm out of time who's

00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:34,840
my last question one more somebody

00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,330
anybody

00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:39,480
are we done okay we're done thank you

00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:39,480
all

00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:43,550
