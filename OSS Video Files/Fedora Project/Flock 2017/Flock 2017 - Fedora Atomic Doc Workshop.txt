Talk: Fedora Atomic Doc Workshop
Presenter: Josh Berkus, Dusty Mabe

Description:
 Fedora Atomic has all kinds of awesome first-in-the-industry capabilities, but isn't getting the attention it deserves because a minority of our features are documented. As of Flock, we have a brand-new, CI-and-container-driven documentation system, and this work session will help populate it.

This session will include a brief introduction on setting up a local build & test environment for Atomic documentation and the practical basics of our tools and style sheets. We will then pick from a list of areas which urgently need documentation and participants will work in teams to start documentation for those sections.

This Do session follows up on the Atomic Doc VFAD from late July, in order to get more Fedora community members helping with documentation.
