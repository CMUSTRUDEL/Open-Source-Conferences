Talk: Pagure Hackfest
Presenter: Pierre-Yves Chibon

Description:
With pagure becoming more and more popular and being a front-end to dist-git, I would like to invite anyone interested to join and help closing tickets on pagure, easyfix and others.

This hackfest will welcome anyone with interest in pagure, python knowledge and a local instance of pagure running (follow the instructions on pagure's README).


Let's make pagure even more awesome than it is! :)
