Talk: Fedora Python Coding Dojo
Presenter: Till Maas

Description:
In the Fedora Python Coding Dojo we will have a safe place to share and learn Python coding. To implement all the changes needed to fulfill our mission statement we need to do a lot of Python coding since most of the Fedora Infrastructure is based on Python. A coding dojo is a great possibility to share our Python experience, improve coding skills and learn how to communicate/discuss code with other developers. Since Fedora is a distributed project this will benefit the collaboration after the dojo and will inspire the participants to practice it in their local communities.

Depending on the background and experience of the participants we will chooses appropriate training tasks (katas) to solve typical problems when interfacing Fedora Infrastructure components such as RPMs, updates or koji builds. The exchanged knowledge and experience will help to make the other workshops more effective.
