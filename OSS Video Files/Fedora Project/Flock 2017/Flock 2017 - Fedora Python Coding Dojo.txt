Talk: Fedora Python Coding Dojo
Presenter: Till Maas

Description:
In the Fedora Python Coding Dojo we will have a safe place to share and learn Python coding. To implement all the changes needed to fulfill our mission statement we need to do a lot of Python coding since most of the Fedora Infrastructure is based on Python. A coding dojo is a great possibility to share our Python experience, improve coding skills and learn how to communicate/discuss code with other developers. Since Fedora is a distributed project this will benefit the collaboration after the dojo and will inspire the participants to practice it in their local communities.

Depending on the background and experience of the participants we will chooses appropriate training tasks (katas) to solve typical problems when interfacing Fedora Infrastructure components such as RPMs, updates or koji builds. The exchanged knowledge and experience will help to make the other workshops more effective.

hello thank you everyone for coming to

00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:09,750
the Python coding dojo I am to Mars and

00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:16,560
I will start with the short introduction

00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:19,550
about the coding dojo in general the

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:23,910
dojo itself is usually the training

00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:27,900
space for martial arts for example in

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:30,560
Japan and that's the new translation is

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:33,300
the place of the way and we are not

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:38,309
practicing martial arts here but instead

00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:40,620
we will be practicing coding so in the

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:42,719
coding dojo we work together on solving

00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:47,910
a problem the problems are called

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,300
Karthus or training sessions and yeah we

00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:53,640
are

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:59,340
c5 people we will divide into different

00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:01,859
walls at this point and the most active

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:05,760
well in the beginning will be the driver

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:08,549
and that's the one person who will be

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:14,100
calling and font oh there will be no

00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:18,830
more participants so I just started

00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:20,820
about the coding dojo and we will be

00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:23,430
everyone will be having a different

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,790
words and one of the first words will be

00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:30,180
in the driver that's the one person

00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:35,880
sitting here in front and doing coding

00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:37,740
work on the actual test or the practice

00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:42,329
session that you want to do it will be

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:44,909
supplied with pin it's a switch from my

00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:47,939
home town just to make sure because it's

00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:50,340
always making people nervous when

00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:52,920
everyone is watching them code so it

00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:56,939
should make it a little bit easier to do

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:59,969
it and the driver is in charge of the

00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:03,210
colleague so you can he or she can do

00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:06,240
whatever they want and of course we are

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:09,030
all here to support the driver so if

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,979
something is and here if it's unclear

00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,770
what to type or how to type something or

00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:17,640
how to achieve something in Python just

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:21,390
ask for help and the driver also gets a

00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:24,420
person next to them that's the navigator

00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:28,890
and both the driver navigator can also

00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:31,200
work in silence if they prefer and yeah

00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:33,690
the navigator that's a second of all

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:37,230
we'll be having that so we have two

00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:40,140
people pair programming in front and the

00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:43,860
Navigator is responsible to provide the

00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:47,760
plan to the driver and also support the

00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:51,180
driver however it's necessary and of

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,370
course the driver or the navigator will

00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:57,180
be the next driver after a few minutes

00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:59,910
so they should be pay close attention

00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:02,910
about what's the way that we are going

00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:06,960
to so they take can continue in

00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:10,520
programming and the third part is the

00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:13,320
audience so everyone else and they

00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:19,080
should pay attention to what's happening

00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:21,330
on the with the driver and whenever they

00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:24,959
are asked for help they should respond

00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:27,600
kindly and also if they see an

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,780
opportunity to learn something or to

00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:33,480
improve something they should wait for

00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,220
the right moment and then they can give

00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:38,820
a comment ask a question whenever

00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:42,420
something is and here and we want to

00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:49,100
make sure that we follow this guiding

00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:55,590
principle by Zen teacher that is oh

00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:59,160
that's a little bit of lag so it's

00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:01,410
important to note that watch on who you

00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:04,170
Sookie said everything you do is wide

00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:06,600
nothing you do is wrong yet you must do

00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:09,660
make ceaseless effort so it's important

00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:12,090
to do so the driver can actually do what

00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:15,600
I want but of course it's important that

00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:18,930
they at least try to move to the goal

00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:21,690
that we have and there's some one thing

00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:24,870
that's always wrong that's

00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:27,030
code really cute so we are ones we don't

00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:29,850
want to blame anyone for doing anything

00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:32,340
here whatever they do regardless of

00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:35,880
their Python skills or whatever skills

00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:39,630
it's important that we can all learn and

00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:43,230
improve here in a safe way and the

00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:45,600
agenda for the coding dojo will be the I

00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:50,430
give now the introduction and we will

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:55,850
decide on a training session the kata

00:04:50,430 --> 00:05:00,150
and then we have we will start with one

00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:03,900
driver navigator and every five to seven

00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:08,760
minutes we switch places so the driver

00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:10,350
becomes can go back to the audience the

00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,740
Navigator becomes a new driver and

00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:18,840
someone from the audience becomes the

00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:21,840
new navigator and we do it as long as we

00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:24,450
have time or as long as we want to do it

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,660
and probably we will since we are not so

00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:30,890
many people everyone will be in the

00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:36,000
driver seat several times I guess and

00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:41,910
now about the katas the training session

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:44,040
so we have so I it depends on how much

00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:49,430
skills we have so for example of you

00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:49,430
it's already programming - day to day

00:05:50,360 --> 00:06:00,240
brandy please

00:05:53,220 --> 00:06:06,090
and maybe you - ok and maybe every once

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:09,180
in a while ok 1 2 3

00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:14,130
and who's never heard of Python or never

00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:21,840
programmed - you are what are your

00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:23,970
Python skills ok so yeah I guess then

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:30,750
it's good to just start with a simple

00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:32,210
task so the first two tasks just a

00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:37,550
simple

00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:43,449
tasks to get to know - so the one thing

00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:43,449
is oh that's not working as expected so

00:06:46,330 --> 00:07:00,009
the one Carter I can everyone read this

00:06:50,509 --> 00:07:05,990
is it just more is this better

00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:08,570
okay so one training kata would be yet

00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:12,430
to have this problem that we have a

00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:17,470
program that gets letter and depending

00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:20,210
on the letter we will do all this

00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:24,320
diamonds here and for example for the

00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:27,530
letter C we first add 1/8 + 2 B's then

00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:31,190
to seize and for example for that it

00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:32,810
would be the you just diamonds and for

00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:39,940
everything else it would be something in

00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:39,940
the middle and the other simple task

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:50,690
would be fleece bus a fist bus and so

00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:54,830
the it's easiest to see in the actual

00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:57,669
output we will output the numbers from 1

00:07:54,830 --> 00:08:03,620
to 100 and whenever the number is

00:07:57,669 --> 00:08:06,800
divisible by 3 we output this and if

00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:10,190
it's divisible by 5 it will be bus and

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:13,610
if it's divisible by both it will be

00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:17,900
fizzbuzz for example 415 so it's just

00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:24,530
nice way to have a feel a loop and then

00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:29,870
do some checks and yeah afterwards we

00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:37,120
can also try for example a kata targeted

00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:41,709
to python to video development so yeah

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:44,900
at this idea of just for example using

00:08:41,709 --> 00:08:45,860
the metadata API that you have in Fedora

00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,890
which is

00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:52,990
very simple web service and then it

00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:56,980
could get you can use it to query for

00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:59,690
package dependencies and maybe output a

00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:02,209
dependency tree or also if you have an

00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:04,730
idea for fedora kata we could also look

00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:07,070
into this so it's there any preference

00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:10,430
on whether we start with the diamond or

00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:14,570
fizzbuzz kata so who is for the diamond

00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:23,000
cutter I can't

00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:26,480
- and fizzbuzz nobody you will have to

00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,230
sit in front and become a drivers now

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,940
you can decide on what you want to do

00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:37,040
okay then we'll just start with the

00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:41,329
diamond cutter and now it's time for you

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:44,690
to get on this stage so I need two

00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:47,920
people to come up front one will be the

00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,920
driver and one the navigator

00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:57,760
[Music]

00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:04,410
and the second one please

00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:12,190
yeah we also need to navigator so is

00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:22,920
there someone ready for this please you

00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:22,920
can also get a pin just come in

00:13:54,390 --> 00:14:02,519
okay so when you have a question for the

00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:14,310
audience also it's nice if you try to

00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:17,399
explain what you are so I'm I'm sorry

00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:19,680
yeah sure so I'm going to assume we're

00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:22,220
rather than reading it directly I want

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:25,890
to take that from the command line and

00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:33,269
what I remember is going for sis to get

00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:38,310
the command line arguments and let's see

00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:41,690
I believe the character and would be so

00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:50,640
if I say the character I'm interested in

00:14:41,690 --> 00:15:02,010
is equal to like was yeah this keyboard

00:14:50,640 --> 00:15:25,560
is gonna and I'm assuming that's just

00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:28,760
the first argument okay I'll keep typing

00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,760
until I get lucky then

00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:47,279
so you this should probably be okay

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:33,650
yeah oh why does it okay that's French

00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:33,650
oh oh no this just trying to get to that

00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:45,540
in the real world we'd want to test the

00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:49,080
length of the vector I'm sorry oh you're

00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:51,350
right zero was going to be the program

00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,350
name

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:29,490
here we go okay okay

00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:35,210
and just to make sure I know what we're

00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:35,210
doing I'm gonna just print that out and

00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,710
so

00:17:50,150 --> 00:18:01,570
oops and give it an argument maybe I did

00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,570
not

00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:22,429
yep win three right so everyone's

00:18:17,989 --> 00:18:25,749
following what's happening here do you

00:18:22,429 --> 00:18:25,749
have any questions so far

00:18:51,880 --> 00:19:07,610
the other tab okay so now we have the

00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:09,470
first step that you can get in character

00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:12,410
from the command line and you can also

00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:15,590
print it so it's also always good to

00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:19,600
have small steps and see if it works so

00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:22,640
we know where we are heading

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,470
okay and I believe the next thing I'm

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:28,160
going to need is I need to turn that

00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:33,460
character into a number because I need

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:53,240
to know what index I want it's gonna be

00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:55,460
so I'm just gonna make it I'm trying to

00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:57,410
remember to get from an ASCII character

00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:59,980
to an integer right I don't know if

00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:02,720
that's just an int caster if there's an

00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:11,420
index of type thing we have to call on a

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:21,460
character anyone idea what could be okay

00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:21,460
so I think it's all rd4 to get the value

00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:38,059
I think you have to use the first you

00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:38,059
have to get the first character probably

00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:14,230
that's the app so what I got was the

00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:17,350
ASCII code for C and if I really wanted

00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:19,000
that to be you know the way we're doing

00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:23,800
the diamond I probably want that to be

00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:28,690
three instead of 99 so if I subtract the

00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:31,300
lowercase a and so actually maybe you

00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:34,750
can switch now so you said what you

00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:37,870
would do next and then the Navigator can

00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:39,940
take over and we would need a new

00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:48,850
navigator from the audience so as anyone

00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:51,820
interested please you you they will know

00:21:48,850 --> 00:22:07,059
it there will not be no harm done

00:21:51,820 --> 00:22:09,250
we are all friendly here it says you can

00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:13,800
also turn off the recording if it helps

00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:13,800
so yet you would come up

00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:30,620
so if you're not participating it's not

00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:30,620
really the coding dojo at this point

00:22:55,790 --> 00:23:05,930
thank you Steve yeah

00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:35,070
so would you like to explain what you're

00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:38,640
doing yeah I'm not trying to well no why

00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:39,929
is the original by the first kind I

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,380
guess any question is whether we should

00:23:39,929 --> 00:23:45,120
treat capital that is current characters

00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:48,150
separately from lowercase or not or

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:51,210
whether we should fold them into just

00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:55,820
everything be uppercase or what mr. Lee

00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:55,820
webpage they're using

00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:44,820
Oh

00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:57,269
is a maybe in view

00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:04,769
there's four corners

00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:29,190
you maybe just to 30 or something 30

00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:29,190
something really big

00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:43,030
if there's okay

00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:57,440
okay number two number two so - don't we

00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,730
want to I said coming from zero of it's

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,950
okay

00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:02,950
[Music]

00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:55,350
so you do want to ask the question maybe

00:26:56,070 --> 00:27:02,020
does anyone know the function to change

00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:11,370
any of the functions to change case for

00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:13,840
character sir yeah I think it's an

00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:19,030
method of a string so if you have a

00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:21,450
string you can do dot and upper for

00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:21,450
example

00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:40,980
can you eat the terminal or should we

00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:56,250
also increase the size I could okay

00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:56,250
it may be it ctrl+ maybe it's this okay

00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:26,440
I think just start up her there and yet

00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:29,190
the parentheses for the function and I

00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,190
think that should work

00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:56,460
so can everyone's to follow what's

00:28:50,200 --> 00:29:01,810
happening here no questions so far

00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:13,450
okay so then maybe just change the words

00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:17,490
again so it's anyone up for the new

00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:17,490
navigator position please

00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:28,269
no problem because you can always ask

00:29:25,509 --> 00:29:32,529
for advice anyone and it's also just

00:29:28,269 --> 00:29:34,600
helping for example if you think of like

00:29:32,529 --> 00:29:48,419
the structure and then we help you to

00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:52,690
get the actual code out there is

00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:57,509
something that starts off indented goes

00:29:52,690 --> 00:30:07,419
out like a diamond and then comes back

00:29:57,509 --> 00:30:09,909
so we type in the example we type in a C

00:30:07,419 --> 00:30:17,289
and we're expecting to get this diamond

00:30:09,909 --> 00:30:23,070
shape so I'm yeah I'm pointing him on

00:30:17,289 --> 00:30:27,159
line nine we will we got the character

00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:30,429
converted it to an uppercase letter we

00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:32,529
subtracted the uppercase a from it so an

00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:35,970
a is going to give us a zero or B is

00:30:32,529 --> 00:30:41,019
going to give us a 1 C would give us a 2

00:30:35,970 --> 00:31:02,379
and what we're gonna want to do now is a

00:30:41,019 --> 00:31:05,919
loop and I guess and let's see I'm I'm

00:31:02,379 --> 00:31:08,999
more Java than I think I need to say a

00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,999
range here

00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:25,970
I think if I say range I look I say I

00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:38,090
did that wrong tonight that's for row in

00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:41,330
range and then a colon at the end and

00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:43,220
now the white space magic says this is

00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:52,429
inside the for-loop

00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:56,149
and I'm just gonna do a print row for

00:31:52,429 --> 00:32:02,200
right now and that should at least give

00:31:56,149 --> 00:32:10,720
me something that counts

00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:10,720
I'd say cuz see I'm gonna get 0 1 2

00:32:19,929 --> 00:32:28,999
2:01 okay no I'm sorry

00:32:22,879 --> 00:32:33,559
that that was this I is too so I counted

00:32:28,999 --> 00:32:39,739
zero one and it's not inclusive if I

00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:43,929
really wanted this to go zero one two

00:32:39,739 --> 00:32:43,929
I'd have to add one to it

00:32:46,179 --> 00:33:05,179
is everyone still following what's going

00:32:49,340 --> 00:33:06,859
on you you to figure out how many spaces

00:33:05,179 --> 00:33:15,619
I have to put at the beginning of the

00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:17,090
line and let's see if it's first I want

00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:27,019
to put some extra prints and then make

00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:29,710
the prints go away so if I say space is

00:33:27,019 --> 00:33:29,710
equal to

00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:38,450
I'm - ROH isn't - here we go

00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:49,170
I do

00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:09,270
control okay

00:34:24,369 --> 00:34:34,809
okay now what I expect is this to count

00:34:28,529 --> 00:34:37,389
0 1 2 3 4 the row and I expect space to

00:34:34,809 --> 00:34:39,879
go the SP to go the other way around so

00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:43,539
it'll be counting down I'll be doing

00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:45,909
some fewer spaces each time so I put two

00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:51,969
spaces on the first row one on the

00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:55,690
second and zero spaces on the third and

00:34:51,969 --> 00:34:59,009
now I'm gonna hide this because that was

00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:59,009
just so I knew what I was doing

00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:13,940
I'm just gonna make that print go away

00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,940
now and

00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:39,680
yeah I must have instead of the shift

00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:46,250
okay I think you can actually do a

00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:51,020
multiply on a string to get spaces so if

00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:53,930
I say the space times the number of

00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:59,150
spaces I want and then I'm just gonna

00:35:53,930 --> 00:36:05,030
for right now I'm gonna put in X just to

00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:07,390
sneak up on the problem and if I save

00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:07,390
that

00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:20,210
ok so I got the first part of the

00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:25,540
diamond filling in okay so I guess it

00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:32,900
would be good time to switch again yes

00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:39,680
always good boy so there's someone of

00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:49,630
you know there to be the navigator gents

00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:51,800
maybe again yeah we will figure out so

00:36:49,630 --> 00:37:01,400
it's not a problem that you don't know

00:36:51,800 --> 00:37:03,440
pack do you okay but do you understand

00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:06,920
what's happening with the program so far

00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:10,310
or is it completely Americans it's all a

00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:13,300
mystery to me okay so I guess we will

00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:18,950
you just start going through it and then

00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:22,970
you see I but here obviously this is

00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:36,350
what is changing so this is the script I

00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:39,350
guess and okay so but you understand the

00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:42,610
problem what we want to solve you want

00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:45,700
to make a diamond right yeah and so we

00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:50,600
on the right hand side we already see

00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:58,240
part of the diamond yeah so I guess what

00:37:50,600 --> 00:38:02,870
I what I would try to do is flip that so

00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:04,820
well yes so that the top X would be the

00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:07,010
single point but then the other ones

00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:14,480
would go to the right so kind of what he

00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:16,820
did but slightly office yeah okay and so

00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,700
I think also the first thing is that we

00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:25,160
have X's here instead of the actual

00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:25,590
characters so so maybe do you want to

00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,230
change

00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:36,840
that first of do we want to first add

00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:39,390
the other side of the diamond I I would

00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:41,310
think it's probably best to figure out

00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:46,680
the excess first because you could add

00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:54,900
the letters in the end okay whatever you

00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:58,650
want to do it's wise okay I guess I

00:38:54,900 --> 00:39:01,380
would want to start a new line right so

00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:05,610
this is the color that's creating the

00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:08,660
X's you have some kind of understanding

00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:08,660
what's happening there

00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:25,710
vaguely I know that he's somehow

00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:27,740
identified yeah you can you maybe form

00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:33,770
questions and then we try to answer them

00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:33,770
sure so let's see

00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:46,100
so with this base I so I I guess that

00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:54,120
refers to line nine right so line 13 is

00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:59,630
referring to line nine yes yes kind of

00:39:54,120 --> 00:40:04,410
so you probably we need to explain the

00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:06,800
ASCII code to you someone interested in

00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:06,800
doing this

00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:53,990
yeah line 9 was saying whatever whatever

00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:56,930
the character is for whatever the code

00:40:53,990 --> 00:41:03,710
is for the the character we just picked

00:40:56,930 --> 00:41:07,100
on the command line if if it was an a

00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:09,830
and I subtract a I get a zero if it was

00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:13,100
a B and I subtract a I get a one and

00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:16,840
that that just turns it into a counter

00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:24,050
for what how far into the alphabet I am

00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:27,320
and then so that that tells me how many

00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:34,300
rows we need you know on the first part

00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:34,300
of the diamond sure

00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:47,070
for line one you just ignore okay

00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:49,320
then at live five is actually to import

00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:51,000
some kind of system by Riesz and what's

00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:53,130
the system lie reform because you look

00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,740
at the right side of your screen you can

00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:58,890
actually is a command Tommy no so you

00:41:55,740 --> 00:42:00,960
take in some user Tommy no users input

00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:03,120
so you need to import the system from

00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,620
system library so that you can call the

00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:07,500
function from inside so that's for line

00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:08,100
five and four line 7 C is just an

00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,450
argument

00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:13,020
what's an argument it's just like a

00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:16,410
temporary container where equals to CS

00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:18,510
dot argv is to get an argument from your

00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:22,010
terminal from the right side the black

00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:26,520
screen so if you are a user you input C

00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:29,250
for example so C may have a asking

00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:33,210
number may be for example make it simple

00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:37,070
0 1 2 so C is a tell letter right so

00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:41,400
it's number 3 number 2 so if you have

00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:43,890
princey it can come out okay then dot

00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:46,320
apple apple is to change whatever the

00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:48,690
user input from lowercase to uppercase

00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:51,000
if it's an uppercase itself you ignore

00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:53,940
you just taken it is and then for

00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,500
princey it will print out whatever the

00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:57,750
user has input for example this

00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:59,610
continent see if the user inputted C

00:42:57,750 --> 00:43:01,860
into this container it will just print

00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:04,620
out C from this container if the user

00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:06,810
inputs a you will print a instead of C

00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:10,980
because the user inputs a at the

00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:13,350
terminal that's for lying eight the

00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:16,530
princi and then for line nine is

00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:20,910
actually just to take out the ascii

00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:26,850
number by using the function or rd i

00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:32,240
don't know why this time for then c z 0

00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:35,520
is an argument then minus or rd a

00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:39,630
because a is always the first letter of

00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:43,500
a to z for example so a is actually 0

00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:46,140
and let's say C is 2 you take 2 minus 0

00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:48,740
you get 2 spaces so that's why they need

00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:52,350
to find the ASCII number

00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:54,690
from the program user input

00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:58,890
so if user input see you get two spaces

00:43:54,690 --> 00:44:03,200
so that the next four row in range I

00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:07,280
plus one you can have space the line 13

00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:14,220
SP is actually an argument so you get I

00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:17,660
minus row to get the row number and then

00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:20,100
for space you use the row number to

00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:22,230
deduct the asking number you get the

00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:31,480
difference of two can you understand

00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:36,310
that from uh students

00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:36,310
[Laughter]

00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:51,290
you calculate how many spaces you have

00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:54,800
in front of the X so in the beginning

00:45:51,290 --> 00:46:01,430
it's more because I goes from 0 to I

00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:05,780
know I as always the knife to check

00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:08,999
exactly is the value of how many

00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:08,999
[Music]

00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:16,360
characters we have so how many lines

00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:20,510
models so we have that's high and wall

00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:22,670
becomes higher every time we want to

00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:25,760
this loop so this means that we're doing

00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:32,800
this several times and the first time it

00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:39,560
will be for example three no 2-0 I

00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:46,250
suppose and that makes it two spaces

00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:53,390
here see this calculation so for the

00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:59,869
first time it means I 0 and roll is I is

00:46:53,390 --> 00:47:06,250
2 and what 0 so that makes SP 2 and then

00:46:59,869 --> 00:47:08,990
try 9:15 give this based sign and

00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:12,710
multiply it with the value of space SP

00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:16,400
and since it's two it outputs two spaces

00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:22,310
here and then there will be the eggs and

00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:25,700
then whenever we go to this loop SP will

00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:29,810
become smaller because wall is

00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:32,869
increasing and this means that we have

00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:34,490
only 1 and then 0 spaces and what we

00:47:32,869 --> 00:47:38,240
need on the other side is something

00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:40,550
that's so for the first line we don't

00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:45,700
need anything but then for the second

00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:45,700
needs to get one and then it needs to be

00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:49,060
yeah

00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:55,859
so that's more that's like the

00:47:53,460 --> 00:48:01,040
calculation here but in the way that's

00:47:55,859 --> 00:48:02,609
growing and set off does this help you

00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:06,119
okay

00:48:02,609 --> 00:48:13,829
and maybe we would just switch again and

00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:16,980
then yeah if it's okay okay so you

00:48:13,829 --> 00:48:19,890
become the next try and would you like

00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:23,880
to become you you explained it so well

00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:26,210
so it's exactly the same task that you

00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:36,119
have as navigator just explaining or

00:48:26,210 --> 00:48:40,589
helping they're really delicious there

00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:43,400
will be no harm done yeah

00:48:40,589 --> 00:48:43,400
thank you very much

00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:10,410
but what role is one

00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:30,840
so what would you like to do next yes

00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:30,840
I'd like to print the other side

00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:42,010
wonderful I noticed is that the two

00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:43,450
places here in one place but we I still

00:49:42,010 --> 00:49:47,460
have one extra space somehow I'm not

00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:49,660
sure why but first I have three spaces

00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:52,420
well maybe it doesn't matter too much I

00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:56,460
guess I guess the problem is probably I

00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:56,460
guess this spacing is not that important

00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:20,140
so the driver navigator now are trying

00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:23,829
to figure out how many spaces we need

00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:23,829
inside the diamonds

00:50:38,070 --> 00:50:44,670
I'm yeah it was I think in Python 2 you

00:50:41,790 --> 00:50:48,120
could do it but now it's I think an

00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:52,350
keyword argument so you say a comma and

00:50:48,120 --> 00:51:10,490
equals an empty string and then there

00:50:52,350 --> 00:51:13,160
won't be in new line at the end yes I

00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:17,720
guess we will figure that out when we

00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:17,720
cut the other things working

00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:29,470
so on the right hand side we now see the

00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:35,590
interactive Python console which allows

00:51:29,470 --> 00:51:50,020
us to just test individual statements

00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:52,510
from the Python script so do we have a

00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:59,440
question yeah does anyone know how to

00:51:52,510 --> 00:52:02,010
concatenate strings in person with the

00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,010
plus sign

00:52:56,140 --> 00:53:00,579
nominative case it right there mysteries

00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:04,599
on condition it needs to be some

00:53:00,579 --> 00:53:08,079
condition to only print one X at the top

00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:10,630
of bottom of the diamond okay Oh awesome

00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:12,279
Alex have occurred to do it maybe we

00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:15,700
should make a I thinking if you make a

00:53:12,279 --> 00:53:18,029
print some function to print a row or

00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:18,029
something

00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:34,450
so what's your question right now I'm

00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:36,820
trying to work out how many spaces there

00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:41,610
should be in the middle how do we get

00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:41,610
that we start off with three spaces in

00:53:42,330 --> 00:54:13,420
space X X you can just try out something

00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:17,890
and then see how it works

00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:21,360
you can always make it better or is

00:54:17,890 --> 00:54:21,360
there some comment from the audience

00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:37,240
did you hear Steve

00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:22,410
ah yeah two times okay

00:55:41,609 --> 00:55:46,019
it looks pretty nice already

00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:23,210
so things you accomplished quite a lot

00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:33,410
already some maybe it's a good time to

00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:43,640
switch again yeah you you have no the

00:56:33,410 --> 00:56:51,010
chance to implemented but you can sit

00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:51,010
here and then it will work out nope on

00:56:55,090 --> 00:57:04,330
someone interested in becoming the

00:56:57,620 --> 00:57:04,330
Navigator again you maybe yeah

00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:47,390
so can we help you I want to store that

00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:56,090
if it's a I wanna ignore the spring else

00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:58,310
print this so how can I get it a yes so

00:57:56,090 --> 00:58:01,630
I guess that's not the problem that we

00:57:58,310 --> 00:58:05,420
only have X's here for now and not the

00:58:01,630 --> 00:58:10,460
actual character so we need the

00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:15,170
opposites of the Ord function to get the

00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:16,940
character for example so for example ER

00:58:15,170 --> 00:58:19,280
o are different and it turns the

00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:21,140
character into the number now we need

00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:24,740
the opposite form turning the number to

00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:26,870
the character for example or because we

00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:37,090
wanted to get the a if I understood you

00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:37,090
correctly yeah so Steve do you know thee

00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:58,970
yeah it's CHR event maybe do you maybe

00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:03,250
want to try to check for wall equals 0

00:58:58,970 --> 00:59:03,250
and then you will see what how it works

00:59:03,610 --> 00:59:08,320
we can also fix the last 4 data

00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,960
yeah

00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:54,030
so the remark was that before and in the

00:59:52,290 --> 00:59:56,210
end we need a codon at the end in the

00:59:54,030 --> 00:59:56,210
nine

01:00:12,190 --> 01:00:15,190
okay

01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:58,100
so the if statement can be used to yeah

01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:59,780
to only do something depending on the

01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:04,930
condition that's written down for

01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:08,030
example on line 17 we check whether the

01:01:04,930 --> 01:01:10,310
variable role is unequal to zero and

01:01:08,030 --> 01:01:19,300
only then we do the print statement

01:01:10,310 --> 01:01:19,300
below it's this is control

01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:39,340
yes concerns

01:01:42,170 --> 01:02:07,460
nice take your candy so anyone up for

01:01:54,349 --> 01:02:09,529
the next navigator position so I would

01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:12,349
say since we already have the shape of

01:02:09,529 --> 01:02:14,690
the diamond or less maybe so this is the

01:02:12,349 --> 01:02:18,440
upper shape if it would be a good idea

01:02:14,690 --> 01:02:20,630
to start getting the characters right so

01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:23,079
instead of using X use the extra

01:02:20,630 --> 01:02:23,079
character

01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:49,240
yeah

01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:22,070
oh yeah whoops thank you

01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:35,550
and you probably need to add rows gonna

01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:35,550
start with zero

01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:48,440
fine

01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:26,730
so in line 15 we are now reversing the

01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:32,260
number code to the actual character and

01:04:26,730 --> 01:04:35,440
we do this by using the number of the

01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:38,559
character a adding that if the number of

01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:41,170
the wall and then we get the character

01:04:38,559 --> 01:05:06,569
value of the character that we want to

01:04:41,170 --> 01:05:06,569
get no it also works with CMD

01:05:55,260 --> 01:06:03,600
so what's your next plan Katie Jackie I

01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:09,240
guess the a would be the same for

01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:14,420
because it's it will be flipped we want

01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:19,020
to check if it's the if it's a in line

01:06:14,420 --> 01:06:21,720
16 so if it's either the last or the

01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:25,460
first row that we're printing out it

01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:25,460
should okay that did not work

01:06:32,859 --> 01:06:40,029
I don't know if we're gonna want to just

01:06:37,390 --> 01:06:43,589
make a second for loop for coming the

01:06:40,029 --> 01:06:43,589
other way out of the diamond door

01:06:47,369 --> 01:06:52,210
usually what works best is what's the

01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:56,339
simplest and then you can optimize later

01:06:52,210 --> 01:06:56,339
so would be my hint

01:07:06,990 --> 01:07:10,440
this is control

01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:39,119
can we make range count backwards yes

01:07:41,970 --> 01:07:48,329
I think if it because the range accept

01:07:45,869 --> 01:07:51,210
several arguments so it's if it's only

01:07:48,329 --> 01:07:53,490
one it counts from zero to that number

01:07:51,210 --> 01:07:56,460
if it has to you can give the start

01:07:53,490 --> 01:07:58,710
value in the first value that's not

01:07:56,460 --> 01:08:01,980
included and if you have three arguments

01:07:58,710 --> 01:08:06,890
the third argument says what's the step

01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:06,890
and then you can use example minus one

01:08:18,030 --> 01:08:32,740
anything zero would be quick there

01:08:20,470 --> 01:08:38,110
because you want to go yes yes it's -

01:08:32,740 --> 01:08:47,050
you so you're also drawn or the German

01:08:38,110 --> 01:08:52,630
layout I think the problem is you also

01:08:47,050 --> 01:09:00,160
need to at the step I think so and the

01:08:52,630 --> 01:09:11,710
current leads from I plus one - yeah yes

01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:14,500
you can try it try it with the zero if

01:09:11,710 --> 01:09:16,960
if you move it to the right right to the

01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:27,270
left the more to the left edge will

01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:30,510
automatically some point you just try

01:09:27,270 --> 01:09:30,510
you can

01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:54,250
so it's at least a little bit into the

01:09:46,179 --> 01:10:01,150
in the right shape so has anyone an idea

01:09:54,250 --> 01:10:03,280
what might be wrong here we don't need

01:10:01,150 --> 01:10:06,699
to start at I plus 1 because because the

01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:13,239
the middle row is special so yeah and

01:10:06,699 --> 01:10:14,830
then it does not include row 0 so I

01:10:13,239 --> 01:10:17,500
think you have to say I think you have

01:10:14,830 --> 01:10:17,800
to give it a minus 1 now I know I'm

01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:22,659
sorry

01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:28,500
you take that one off instead of the 0

01:10:22,659 --> 01:10:28,500
you have to say stop before minus 1

01:10:30,390 --> 01:10:36,000
because it doesn't include whatever

01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:36,000
value you put there

01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:45,630
you know we're almost done

01:11:16,170 --> 01:11:20,940
this is kind of a season to taste thing

01:11:31,050 --> 01:11:38,920
everyone likes this diamond maybe we

01:11:37,239 --> 01:11:42,510
should also try with other characters

01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:42,510
than Dean just to be sure sure

01:12:02,969 --> 01:12:07,710
yeah I think it looks pretty nice yeah

01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:14,550
Thank You Katie

01:12:07,710 --> 01:12:17,670
you finished the first kata so we can

01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:23,070
now start maybe reflect on what we did

01:12:17,670 --> 01:12:25,710
and what we learned today if you like do

01:12:23,070 --> 01:12:27,270
you want to say something just that I

01:12:25,710 --> 01:12:34,230
learned that that German keyboard is

01:12:27,270 --> 01:12:36,390
tough a lot of other people that I know

01:12:34,230 --> 01:12:39,300
that are programming they don't use the

01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:43,040
German layout because all the special

01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:47,330
characters and what space that's true

01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:51,110
and you know how did you like it

01:12:47,330 --> 01:12:51,110
everyone yeah just

01:13:33,449 --> 01:13:41,800
but the idea to keep it simple to just

01:13:37,650 --> 01:13:44,590
focus on the code because then it will

01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:47,139
speed that for some people who already

01:13:44,590 --> 01:13:52,150
know the one IDE have an advantage over

01:13:47,139 --> 01:13:54,820
the others and it's then people would

01:13:52,150 --> 01:13:57,780
start to argue which IDE to use so it's

01:13:54,820 --> 01:14:05,800
just a simple text editor 'm to keep it

01:13:57,780 --> 01:14:08,880
simple yeah everyone liked it so far we

01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:18,460
have any comments on how to improve or

01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:21,310
do it differently so I think from this

01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:24,099
session we also have about 30 more

01:14:21,310 --> 01:14:27,969
minutes so we can still do more things

01:14:24,099 --> 01:14:30,580
if you like just it's you know notice

01:14:27,969 --> 01:14:33,639
it's all about us doing something

01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:37,179
together so we can do every we want and

01:14:33,639 --> 01:14:40,179
now everyone was brave enough to get on

01:14:37,179 --> 01:14:49,150
this stage I think it makes it easier to

01:14:40,179 --> 01:14:51,639
do more things so what would be your

01:14:49,150 --> 01:14:53,500
preference sure we also do like the

01:14:51,639 --> 01:14:58,420
other kata for example the fist pass

01:14:53,500 --> 01:15:02,650
kata or would you like to improve this

01:14:58,420 --> 01:15:06,330
cooked or are you content and just want

01:15:02,650 --> 01:15:06,330
to take it do something else

01:15:38,099 --> 01:15:50,650
okay so the idea was if you can just one

01:15:42,119 --> 01:15:53,769
vengeance set of two I guess it yeah I

01:15:50,650 --> 01:15:57,969
think it's Nautilus it's an iterator so

01:15:53,769 --> 01:15:59,979
it's like a list but yet technically

01:15:57,969 --> 01:16:02,139
it's a little bit different because it's

01:15:59,979 --> 01:16:04,679
like something that returns one value

01:16:02,139 --> 01:16:04,679
after the other

01:16:06,179 --> 01:16:19,559
yeah that's true so that summer one to

01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:19,559
start combining the two loops

01:16:26,530 --> 01:16:29,100
yeah

01:16:37,070 --> 01:16:43,920
yeah yeah so one idea would - would be

01:16:41,850 --> 01:16:46,320
to create a function that's inside the

01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:52,740
loops instead of having the same point

01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:55,670
so would you like to do it you also need

01:16:52,740 --> 01:16:55,670
a navigator of course

01:17:10,430 --> 01:17:28,050
I've enough if maybe could also copy

01:17:24,060 --> 01:17:35,910
this file and then we have both versions

01:17:28,050 --> 01:17:39,660
since in case we break something you

01:17:35,910 --> 01:17:43,430
could probably just save it is a

01:17:39,660 --> 01:17:43,430
different different name

01:17:53,719 --> 01:17:58,580
yes cutter - maybe and then

01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:22,030
has to read it

01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:49,170
so to define a function which is like

01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:52,440
code that you can reuse again we use the

01:18:49,170 --> 01:18:54,960
DEF statement in line 10 and then

01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:57,500
afterwards there's the name of the new

01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:57,500
function

01:19:14,050 --> 01:19:20,980
so what's your plan here I'm making out

01:19:18,010 --> 01:19:24,510
function basically which will do what's

01:19:20,980 --> 01:19:24,510
inside the loops basically

01:19:40,220 --> 01:19:44,170
and just call this function

01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:06,140
in you have to change the filename

01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:43,510
okay so what we did here is just you

01:20:40,989 --> 01:20:45,040
know reducing the amount of code that's

01:20:43,510 --> 01:20:47,650
in this group which is always good

01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:49,659
because then there's maintenance the

01:20:47,650 --> 01:20:52,139
script ins easy to understand what's

01:20:49,659 --> 01:20:54,849
happening here because you know see that

01:20:52,139 --> 01:20:58,690
what's happening in line 20 and 23 is

01:20:54,849 --> 01:21:02,290
exactly the same and before that you had

01:20:58,690 --> 01:21:09,670
to manually check with your eyes whether

01:21:02,290 --> 01:21:21,070
or not it was the same is it possible to

01:21:09,670 --> 01:21:39,219
have a single loop you think it's better

01:21:21,070 --> 01:21:44,409
to have a single OOP there's one way to

01:21:39,219 --> 01:21:47,250
find out there's only one way to find

01:21:44,409 --> 01:21:47,250
out I would say

01:21:53,420 --> 01:21:55,480
Oh

01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:12,380
maybe just comment that out in case we

01:22:09,690 --> 01:22:12,380
have to come back

01:22:18,590 --> 01:22:21,340
okay

01:22:28,719 --> 01:22:36,229
if we call the list function with that

01:22:31,639 --> 01:22:40,149
create a list like we did list range

01:22:36,229 --> 01:22:40,149
blah blah blah comma range

01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:59,719
no no I think no I think I think you I

01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:02,650
think the comma is right well that's

01:22:59,719 --> 01:23:02,650
gonna be my first guess

01:23:26,570 --> 01:23:30,370
there's only other way to combine ranges

01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:46,810
is it clear what's happening here what

01:23:40,100 --> 01:23:50,660
we checked so the idea is to combine

01:23:46,810 --> 01:23:53,320
both ranges from that we had in line 19

01:23:50,660 --> 01:23:56,420
and 22 the problem is that the

01:23:53,320 --> 01:24:00,020
Constructors range cannot be directly

01:23:56,420 --> 01:24:03,440
added but instead you can create a list

01:24:00,020 --> 01:24:07,630
out of these ranges and then combine

01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:07,630
these lists so you have only one range

01:24:24,489 --> 01:24:32,210
my so the question was whether or not

01:24:27,530 --> 01:24:37,030
this the pythonic way to do things I've

01:24:32,210 --> 01:24:40,250
just I think the problem is that usually

01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:42,710
you use range and iterators or ranges

01:24:40,250 --> 01:24:46,340
because then you don't have that much of

01:24:42,710 --> 01:24:49,580
a memory impact because you only because

01:24:46,340 --> 01:24:52,760
the list needs memory space for each

01:24:49,580 --> 01:24:55,610
element and the range only creates the

01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:58,040
elements on demand but I guess in this

01:24:55,610 --> 01:25:04,400
way it would be okay because we know it

01:24:58,040 --> 01:25:08,570
would be at most 52 elements so usually

01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:10,820
it's I think you right so one important

01:25:08,570 --> 01:25:12,739
thing is when you write code or private

01:25:10,820 --> 01:25:15,710
encoders that you write it not for the

01:25:12,739 --> 01:25:17,930
machine but also for the human who has

01:25:15,710 --> 01:25:22,160
to read it again and understand it so

01:25:17,930 --> 01:25:27,920
that's often should be more important

01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:30,550
than optimizing each bit out of the code

01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:30,550
length for example

01:25:41,210 --> 01:25:50,219
yeah think we can also wrap up and

01:25:46,559 --> 01:25:55,679
that's the best more interesting in

01:25:50,219 --> 01:25:58,019
doing something okay so thank you very

01:25:55,679 --> 01:26:00,960
much for coming and also thank you very

01:25:58,019 --> 01:26:03,480
much for being brave enough to get on

01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:06,420
the stage and I hope you like the

01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:09,900
concept of it and maybe you can also do

01:26:06,420 --> 01:26:12,030
it you find other people after flock to

01:26:09,900 --> 01:26:15,690
do it with them together I think it's

01:26:12,030 --> 01:26:18,960
really nice formal to get people from

01:26:15,690 --> 01:26:22,369
all kinds of skill levels together and I

01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:28,769
also hope you learned something if

01:26:22,369 --> 01:26:34,070
without any coding experience and yeah

01:26:28,769 --> 01:26:34,070
also help on the so if you look for

01:26:34,219 --> 01:26:43,400
coding dojo you also find other

01:26:36,769 --> 01:26:47,269
resources on the Internet my

01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:47,269
presentation contains some links

01:27:18,810 --> 01:27:23,580
[Music]

01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:28,080
so yes cyber dojo talk and coding dojo

01:27:23,580 --> 01:27:31,860
dark two places where you can find a lot

01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:36,630
of details about coding dojo and also

01:27:31,860 --> 01:27:41,070
code kata you find other yeah simple

01:27:36,630 --> 01:27:45,300
testing tasks assignments like the ones

01:27:41,070 --> 01:27:48,690
that we did in this or the one that we

01:27:45,300 --> 01:27:50,670
did and also find my contact information

01:27:48,690 --> 01:27:53,850
in case you want to contact me about

01:27:50,670 --> 01:27:57,680
this anytime later so thank you very
