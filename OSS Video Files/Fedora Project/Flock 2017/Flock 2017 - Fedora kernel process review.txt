Talk: Fedora kernel process review
Presenter: Laura Abbott

Description:
 This is intended to be an interactive session discussing how the Fedora kernel works. Topics of conversation may include:
- A review of kernel configuration options and what Fedora turns on
- What patches Fedora is carrying and if they should go upstream
- Kernel packaging

The outcome should be a better understanding of what is actually supported in the Fedora kernel and what may need to be changed in the future.
