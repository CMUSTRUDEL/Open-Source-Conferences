Talk: How to write dist-git tests in Fedora with Ansible
Presenter: Stef Walter

Description:
Continuous integration aims to ensure broken changes do not affect users, packagers or maintainers. Continuous delivery aims to ensure broken changes don't get released.

At the center of CI is tests. I'd like to show you consistent simple ways to add tests to your dist-git package using Ansible. We'll walk through how to test an installed package, a Fedora Qcow2 image, as well as a docker image and module.

We'll look at how to turn on gating for your package, similar to GitHub, so you can get feedback immediately. This saves packagers extra work having to fix bugs later down the line.
