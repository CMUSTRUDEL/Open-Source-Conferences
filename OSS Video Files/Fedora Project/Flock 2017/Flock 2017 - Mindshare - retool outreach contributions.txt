Talk: Mindshare - retool outreach contributions
Presenter: Robert Mayr, Gabriele Trombini

Description:
As FOSCo is not any longer a thing, Mindshare will take over some of its basical ideas, trying to optimize the contribution process of ambassadors and other outreach teams, by sharing and developing best practices and by improving communication between teams or SIGs.
Mindshare has been declared a Council’s objective for 2017 and many ideas from different groups will be incorporated to define the Mindshare responsibilities. It will be challenging to have ambassadors‘, CommOps‘ and other outreach representatives within this new body.
