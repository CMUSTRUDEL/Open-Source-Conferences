Talk: Mindshare - retool outreach contributions
Presenter: Robert Mayr, Gabriele Trombini

Description:
As FOSCo is not any longer a thing, Mindshare will take over some of its basical ideas, trying to optimize the contribution process of ambassadors and other outreach teams, by sharing and developing best practices and by improving communication between teams or SIGs.
Mindshare has been declared a Council’s objective for 2017 and many ideas from different groups will be incorporated to define the Mindshare responsibilities. It will be challenging to have ambassadors‘, CommOps‘ and other outreach representatives within this new body.

okay I guess most of you know me or I

00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:14,040
know you

00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,830
I'm Robert Myer Robbie duck for most of

00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:20,310
the users

00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:25,010
I'm the website lead actually also on

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:32,430
the council panko and fam'ly and Ayman

00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:34,559
fedora world since 2010 since 2005 I was

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:41,640
active locally with a local Italian

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:46,079
community we are going to talk about a

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:52,850
council objective which is mine chair my

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:56,039
chair is a really new vision of outreach

00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:59,520
contribution and what a mindshare aims

00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:03,149
to is to improve some of the aspects

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:06,720
where we are failing actually so what

00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:10,710
I'd like to do is not to speak about too

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:14,130
much about what we do well but more

00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:18,509
where we are where we can do better not

00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:23,810
what we are going doing worse so let's

00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:27,030
start with the good point event

00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:30,000
ambassadors are organizing events very

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:32,670
well in some of in some regions they are

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,100
very active some other regions lost

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:41,159
activity in the last two years APEC

00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:44,520
actually is totally inactive

00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:48,149
I wouldn't say totally but almost

00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:52,290
inactive they are not meeting they are

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:54,509
not meeting anymore and IRC so they are

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:56,969
not sharing any informations there's

00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:58,560
nothing which goes out to the tour

00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:03,330
ambassadors

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:05,460
and I see it as a great problem if an

00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:10,050
ambassador there want to organize an

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:14,750
event nowadays the regional budget

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:14,750
process is working it works the

00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:26,209
Ambassador Program was born in ten years

00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:29,900
ago budget next has changed a little bit

00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:34,050
how this budget is handed and

00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:37,760
unfortunately only half not more not

00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:42,209
less Ambassadors are aware of this new

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:45,239
handling of the budget this is something

00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:49,590
probably Brian could speak a little more

00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:53,280
about design and web are two very small

00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:55,350
teams they are doing a huge work and we

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,459
are just a few people so I think both

00:02:55,350 --> 00:03:03,000
teams have not more than 10 active

00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:05,519
contributors or so end-users get in

00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,310
touch first probably with the web and on

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:13,470
the web you see websites applications

00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:16,350
and many many things design produced our

00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:19,079
marketing is doing a great job with the

00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:21,510
fedora magazine it's very active the

00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:26,840
federal magazine is something end-users

00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:30,530
appreciate very much so it's active

00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,530
Justin Paul

00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:46,500
yeah I put it under the same umbrella

00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:48,060
I'm the same wingman because it's Justin

00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,440
and Paul are doing great work in federal

00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:55,650
magazine Ryan - which is not here but

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:58,650
it's also just people who are doing the

00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:02,430
job their talking points are very very

00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:05,549
useful but are not used or almost not

00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:07,260
used by ambassadors some ambassadors are

00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:13,079
even not aware about the existing of

00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:16,709
talking point and so I see this as

00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:21,000
another problem we could improve dogs

00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:24,720
yeah we have dogs that's the only

00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,510
positive thing I think since last year

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:33,810
two years ago we had a one man show and

00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:39,060
dogs more or less three two three three

00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:41,490
people nowadays it's that's revolution

00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:45,060
addicts team and we should have better

00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:50,370
talks in an easier way available for the

00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:53,900
end users and even translated in all

00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:53,900
languages or some of them

00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:06,740
uh-huh okay so these are more or less

00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:08,630
the teams which I see as outreach teams

00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:19,250
and what they are doing what they are

00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:22,280
doing well what's going wrong so at the

00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:23,690
pros good points are done by the single

00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,870
teams there's no communication between

00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:29,530
teams ambassadors are doing their own

00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:32,450
stuff marketing is doing its own staff

00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:34,360
design you need to file a ticket if you

00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:36,919
want something from design there's no

00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:40,419
collaboration between web and design

00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:47,360
really or from ambassadors and design

00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:50,570
marketing more or less is not giving any

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:55,690
inputs anymore to ambassadors as we have

00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:59,900
we were used to seven eight years ago

00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:03,040
and become a better communication what

00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:06,729
really helped to make things better here

00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:10,010
best practices is a consequence of

00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:12,260
communications some teams or regions are

00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:16,010
doing very well there are nice ideas

00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:19,220
from local communities or single

00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:22,190
countries or even single person's we

00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:24,200
could share and use also in other teams

00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:31,930
not only not a teams in other regions

00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:34,520
wherever and they are just isolated and

00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:37,430
in the place where the idea came from

00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:39,440
but they are not share the role so mine

00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:43,060
share could help to share his best

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:47,030
practices and make us improve our

00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:51,470
contributions reporting that's related

00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:53,810
to the budget budget next is isn't

00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:58,070
handled anymore by Femmes co regional

00:06:53,810 --> 00:07:02,479
budget are working differently than last

00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:04,279
year's nowadays the council has the

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:09,139
whole budget in

00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:12,289
and Brian is responsible for that but we

00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:15,949
need reporting if you want to get more

00:07:12,289 --> 00:07:18,469
budget or more sources for our not our

00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:22,309
not only for our events but also for our

00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:30,519
teams to help them to improve to grow up

00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:34,639
and to make more contributions marketing

00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:37,309
marketing is totally disconnected I said

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:40,629
it with some basa doors talking points

00:07:37,309 --> 00:07:43,819
are just there some ambassadors use them

00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:46,669
most of them don't use them Fedora

00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:49,749
magazine has split off so it's not

00:07:46,669 --> 00:07:55,939
another magazine another marketing wing

00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:58,789
which yes it's okay but marketing could

00:07:55,939 --> 00:08:02,409
really Drive not only ambassadors post

00:07:58,789 --> 00:08:06,529
but also the order out to each team's so

00:08:02,409 --> 00:08:09,079
could be we have an event we need to

00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:13,849
pass this message we want to send there

00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:17,139
an ambassador and we need flyers of this

00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:20,659
kind of Flyers we need the totem we need

00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:24,049
leaves or special stickers for Python

00:08:20,659 --> 00:08:26,589
guys and then we can organize that with

00:08:24,049 --> 00:08:32,449
the single team's marketing now is

00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:36,769
hasn't this job anymore last but not

00:08:32,449 --> 00:08:40,069
least I said I founded Italian community

00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:44,059
and from the Italian community came out

00:08:40,069 --> 00:08:49,970
many contributors some already gone away

00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:51,800
but we had seven eight seven eight new

00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:56,149
contributors coming out from a local

00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:58,220
community and I remember it worked like

00:08:56,149 --> 00:09:00,259
this also in other countries at least in

00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:01,030
Europe I'm not sure how it worked in

00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:05,710
other

00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:09,070
regions like North America or APEC I'm

00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:14,050
sure the same strategy could be applied

00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:17,050
in South America so we never supported

00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:20,260
really supported local communities it

00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:26,410
would be a good idea I think to support

00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:29,980
them with tools or just with web stuff

00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:33,760
or whatever they could use to build up a

00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:36,400
local community ask Fedora project org

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,980
is a first step it's available in

00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:45,700
Spanish you can ask for other languages

00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:48,280
but mais it's not enough so if there is

00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:51,220
someone in a country who want to set up

00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:58,530
a local community in his language I

00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:58,530
could he should be my hideout and

00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:08,700
we should make available some tools or

00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:12,180
whatever statistics or applications or

00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:16,370
to help them to grow up acuity in

00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,370
community faster than ten years ago

00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:28,990
so I did yeah this slide to show the

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,690
actual outreach situation we have

00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:35,190
technical teams which are pretty much

00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:37,930
working together intra or Alang

00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:41,769
packaging has its own stuff okay

00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:46,810
but we have working groups which are

00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:49,240
very good communicating very good with

00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:51,160
other teams and then we have the

00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:56,459
outreach teams outreach teams are those

00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:56,459
teams in hand in contact with end-users

00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:10,089
dogs come ups ambassadors design and web

00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:13,060
and marketing I would exclude for now

00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:16,660
the localization teams because they are

00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:19,420
somewhat flying around also on technical

00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:22,420
teams and they are working on darks on

00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:26,850
websites so this could be something we

00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:31,329
can include later on what the first

00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:33,550
thought is we should focus on the real

00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:39,250
outreach teams for now and then maybe

00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:45,040
include other localization this should

00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:49,930
then look like this I'm working in a

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:52,180
website's team and we normally have to

00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:54,810
do other important stuff the last two

00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,810
days before

00:11:55,130 --> 00:12:00,140
and why is this happening there's

00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:02,990
there's no communication with the

00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:09,430
technical teams about released stuff

00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:13,160
about news about new accepted features

00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:17,750
or maybe we are away we are aware of

00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:20,060
about an accepted future and it has been

00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:24,190
delayed to to the next release and we

00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:26,870
are not aware of that just happened so

00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:30,110
communication not only between outreach

00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:34,490
teams but also between technical and

00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:40,510
outreach teams so it should be much

00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:40,510
cleaner than actually collaboration

00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:50,660
target mindshare targets our

00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:53,060
communication I would set this on the

00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:54,920
first place if we can start with a good

00:12:53,060 --> 00:13:00,380
communication we have done half of the

00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:07,580
work collaboration between teams can be

00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:10,370
a key a key for success can also be a

00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:13,340
best practice which can be shared by

00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:17,330
other teams like technical teams bad

00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:23,020
practices we need to find a way to share

00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:26,990
them Brian started with some thoughts

00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:29,330
posting a good idea to the mailing list

00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:32,480
other other regions or other people who

00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:35,600
are replying to that and at least people

00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:38,420
were speaking about an idea the same was

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:41,870
for federate or generator was just an

00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:43,700
idea generator is nothing new really

00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:44,970
knew we had this ten years ago I think

00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:49,860
we had

00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:52,949
a big piece of paper and then we had a

00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:55,290
slot inside and you could put your USB

00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:59,189
stick inside and behind it there was a

00:13:55,290 --> 00:14:02,879
laptop so the construction of all the

00:13:59,189 --> 00:14:06,240
thing was ready ten years ago today it's

00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:09,959
very nice you have this cool screen

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:13,439
touch screen where you can choose and I

00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:17,009
see it is a good thing to start speaking

00:14:13,439 --> 00:14:20,100
with this person who is getting the

00:14:17,009 --> 00:14:22,139
image and this started on the mailing

00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:25,649
list and was accepted by almost all

00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:30,029
ambassadors or I'm not sure about APEC

00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:34,699
but it was there were many people in

00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:39,050
North America happy about it

00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:41,610
we did six of them last evening and I

00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:44,120
think this is a good example to follow

00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:50,240
if you want to share a path back to this

00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:53,459
budget managing yeah as I said Pam's Co

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,769
doesn't handle the budget any more but

00:14:53,459 --> 00:15:01,350
most of the budget is dedicated to

00:14:55,769 --> 00:15:04,470
ambassadors actually so collaborate yeah

00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:07,170
collaborating mmm with fans with with

00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:09,569
mine chair and the FK could had to not

00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:11,670
only get the methods through the

00:15:09,569 --> 00:15:13,649
afternoon up to the outreach teams with

00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:16,529
what we want to but also create the

00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:21,509
right tools to get reporting to get the

00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:23,339
stuff we as council need to get to a

00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:25,740
readout at the end of the year and say

00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:29,490
hey we did this this and this for the

00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:31,920
next year we need that so if we are able

00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:34,100
to do that then probably our budget

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:39,589
budget

00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:43,610
rise again otherwise I feel we need to

00:15:39,589 --> 00:15:48,440
to accept have it like we have it

00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:52,180
actually or even less so planning event

00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:56,350
planning with input from all groups so

00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:59,120
we had historically historically fads

00:15:56,350 --> 00:16:03,250
regional feds we're ambassadors planned

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,630
events for the upcoming year they had

00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:07,399
[Music]

00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:13,519
1015 events planned for the whole year

00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:17,990
with attendees with budget proposals and

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:20,630
so on this is not be useful anymore I

00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:23,089
think this has totally changed but we

00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:27,230
still need to plan the events with input

00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:30,199
from all teams why we should attend the

00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:34,880
meeting an event only because we

00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:38,750
attended it the last 10 years maybe it's

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:41,990
more useful together to get to Python 13

00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:47,540
dedicated event or to a design event we

00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:49,089
never sponsored I think liberal graphics

00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:53,260
right

00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:53,260
probably one one year

00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:03,400
last year in liberal graphics nor

00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:06,280
LibreOffice Nimr graphics so we have

00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:08,829
just a few designer design could give us

00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:10,480
an input hey we want to attend this

00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:12,880
meeting and we need a designer there

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:16,089
speak about for our design spin or

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,820
whatever and then marketing can say okay

00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:21,910
we want to send you their mind chair

00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:25,240
should help with that we can provide

00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:28,240
Flyers we can provide tools for

00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:31,480
designers and make an interesting tall

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:34,600
caboose and presenters that this event

00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:38,260
is an interesting distribution otherwise

00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:41,770
it's just we did this last year okay

00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:44,440
let's go there another time and we can

00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:50,250
go also to the bar and drink few beers

00:17:44,440 --> 00:18:00,070
and that's the same so that's the main

00:17:50,250 --> 00:18:03,490
targets I I know it's it's there's so

00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:09,040
much to say about my chair but I would

00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:12,850
rather start small and then when we go

00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:16,030
along with with mine chair see where we

00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:19,840
can improve what we need more where we

00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:23,470
failed then we can live that way step by

00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:29,320
step set it up not think too many things

00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:37,240
at the starting point and yeah try just

00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:39,800
to set the most obvious things up in the

00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:43,370
most easiest way easiest way and

00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:48,500
start from there and say okay we are

00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:50,750
aware we are not covering everything but

00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:55,490
we want to cover that in the next six

00:18:50,750 --> 00:19:00,710
months 12 months 18 months the goal is

00:18:55,490 --> 00:19:08,030
to be as effective as possible as

00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:10,730
outreach group and to help really

00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:22,970
our outreach teams to be effective again

00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:26,740
as we were years ago so ambassadors that

00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:29,810
is the main group probably we have

00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:38,240
inside mind share it's the biggest group

00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:44,050
we have actually 719 if I remember right

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:49,490
ambassadors in our first group we have

00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:51,590
500 1990 active bass adores set us

00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:57,620
active in the past account which means

00:19:51,590 --> 00:20:00,860
the account is active from these 590

00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:05,390
ambassadors how many do you think are

00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:08,720
really active I don't have an answer to

00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:09,620
that I can just guess and you can also

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,160
just guess

00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:17,870
ambassadors activity is something you

00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:21,170
cannot really measure people can stay at

00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:26,480
home and talk to hundreds of me of

00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:28,520
people daily but I think they need to

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:32,510
get information from the federal world

00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:35,240
from our magazine or from from the group

00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:38,840
whatever and they need to log from time

00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:42,290
to time so what we measure is just a fad

00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:44,570
message from a person which log to one

00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:47,330
of our systems or write an email to the

00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:48,419
mailing list or say hey I have this

00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:50,909
event

00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:55,169
who can help me is an activity for me

00:20:50,909 --> 00:21:00,799
and this is an active person how many

00:20:55,169 --> 00:21:04,109
people are attending meetings thirty

00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:09,299
forty in other word how many do you have

00:21:04,109 --> 00:21:13,129
in North America Justin now average

00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:17,299
attendees at your ambassador meeting

00:21:13,129 --> 00:21:17,299
seven eight ten

00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:27,049
yeah same is more or less anemia

00:21:23,399 --> 00:21:32,489
we have probably between 8 and 10 ok

00:21:27,049 --> 00:21:35,210
let's say 20 both and we have the same

00:21:32,489 --> 00:21:38,580
situation in Latin and APEC is no

00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:47,940
there's no meeting at all actually

00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:53,519
so yeah but the last one was canceled

00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:56,159
again yeah yeah at any meeting doesn't

00:21:53,519 --> 00:22:00,629
mean you're active or not active it's

00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:04,379
just an example from these 600 people we

00:22:00,629 --> 00:22:09,059
have 40 around the world who go to our

00:22:04,379 --> 00:22:11,460
meetings I think this is at least once a

00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:13,619
month you should show up and say what's

00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:16,259
going on in Fedora we have many news

00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:19,889
there in just an hour you get a lot of

00:22:16,259 --> 00:22:21,570
informations and if you don't want to do

00:22:19,889 --> 00:22:24,269
that you have the magazine you have to

00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:28,109
come block you have a lot of

00:22:24,269 --> 00:22:30,749
informations but you but apparently only

00:22:28,109 --> 00:22:37,259
a few ambassadors are using this this

00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:41,759
kind of services so I tend to say we

00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:45,720
have 100 150 at maximum active

00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:49,320
ambassadors so the goal is not to clean

00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:53,879
the group up but to understand which how

00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:56,159
many active people we should plan with

00:22:53,879 --> 00:22:58,879
in mind chair so that's the reason why I

00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,879
was talking about

00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:10,860
so ambassadors are doing the stuff on

00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,860
its own

00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:16,970
there's no impede for marketing that

00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:20,520
even ambassadors are not asking for help

00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:26,580
they just say oh we don't have DVDs this

00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:31,320
year but no one of them says we need to

00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:32,429
plan the hoodies DVDs we need to do that

00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:36,630
in time

00:23:32,429 --> 00:23:38,590
although femco was trying to advertise

00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:43,960
that and

00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:48,879
the meetings and so it's not only an

00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:51,220
input missing but also ambassadors are

00:23:48,879 --> 00:23:55,330
not asking was what they are meeting

00:23:51,220 --> 00:24:00,840
actually ambassadors also worked for a

00:23:55,330 --> 00:24:03,460
single region there is no exchange of

00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:07,409
experiences or activities between

00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:13,679
regions and a does its own stuff since

00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:17,320
ever Emir also we had discussions in the

00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:20,379
in the past where people wanted to go to

00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:24,940
an important event in India from email

00:24:20,379 --> 00:24:29,710
and we didn't know who had to pay that

00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:32,830
for for the fourth flight so the

00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:35,619
activity is really a regional activity

00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:40,299
we are just looking in our own garden

00:24:35,619 --> 00:24:46,210
and what our neighbor is doing we don't

00:24:40,299 --> 00:24:48,639
care too much about regions also work

00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:51,129
country wise at least in Europe maybe

00:24:48,639 --> 00:24:55,509
you can help me here Justin I'm not sure

00:24:51,129 --> 00:24:59,470
if any is working east and west coast

00:24:55,509 --> 00:25:01,149
wise or if you have some States or to

00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:04,440
what we say it's working together and

00:25:01,149 --> 00:25:04,440
others completely left out

00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:16,089
in the middle yeah it's it's more or

00:25:13,869 --> 00:25:18,759
less the same in Europe we had in the

00:25:16,089 --> 00:25:20,649
past Germany and France where the act

00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:27,330
most active activity stand there was

00:25:20,649 --> 00:25:30,209
Italy with friends and lately we have

00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:37,889
Albania and Greece

00:25:30,209 --> 00:25:40,869
some people from hungry but certain just

00:25:37,889 --> 00:25:49,749
communicated he was is trying to get

00:25:40,869 --> 00:25:53,019
them time off of the project so what

00:25:49,749 --> 00:25:56,799
remains is a Dania and Greece so it's

00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:59,440
really country wise it's not always the

00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:02,769
same country it goes for two or three

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:07,889
years and then it will be maybe the

00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:07,889
Netherlands and Germany again who knows

00:26:09,029 --> 00:26:13,299
what I said before the ambassadors are

00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:19,089
not applying at all the budget next

00:26:13,299 --> 00:26:22,119
process so when we talk about reporting

00:26:19,089 --> 00:26:25,570
we did that in a pact during the last

00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:31,179
pad con together with X most of them

00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:35,109
said rapid I am doing a blog post yes

00:26:31,179 --> 00:26:38,799
but that's not the report we need so we

00:26:35,109 --> 00:26:42,459
need something more effective or

00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:45,759
concrete not just a blog post we write

00:26:42,459 --> 00:26:48,399
yes I attended this talk and it was nice

00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:53,220
and I did a lot of stuff there I hacked

00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:57,780
I worked on Docs or on or whatever

00:26:53,220 --> 00:27:03,240
Oh clearly how many people came to this

00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:04,289
event how many contacts we have was this

00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,500
a good idea

00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:10,640
would you repeat that we should really

00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:13,320
create a template for that pemko is

00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:16,080
thinking about something like that

00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:25,169
I think this is really a process which I

00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:32,000
know sort should care about inputs for

00:27:25,169 --> 00:27:32,000
marketing again and design are important

00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:37,100
so

00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:45,000
I go to this through this slide and for

00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:47,190
the next one and then we could maybe

00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,789
start a conversation or discussion about

00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:52,799
some ideas because this is not something

00:27:50,789 --> 00:27:57,480
my chair is not something which we want

00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:59,880
to apply just we want to discuss it we

00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,440
need ideas we need input from other

00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:04,409
ambassadors we need

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:07,260
I just told talk to long-term

00:28:04,409 --> 00:28:13,049
contributors and almost got positive

00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:15,059
feedback so activities ambassadors

00:28:13,049 --> 00:28:17,429
should do is share experiences and best

00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:20,250
practices I said it at least five times

00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:23,460
now gives local communities more

00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:26,039
importance not limit funding just

00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:28,200
ambassadors some regions are still

00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:31,230
convinced budget is only for ambassadors

00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:36,059
the budget is for any contributor we

00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:38,370
have if he is a Content Abbasid or it's

00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:40,710
okay but is if he is a packager and

00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:43,559
wants to give a talk in a specific event

00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:48,510
and this is useful for fedora then we

00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:54,360
should fund him do not work region wise

00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:59,700
anymore we are one group and not four

00:28:54,360 --> 00:29:02,880
subgroups the regional staff is not

00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:04,820
working in localization even

00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,500
localization teams don't have regions

00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:10,289
ambassadors are the only group which has

00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:13,080
regions so we would wouldn't have

00:29:10,289 --> 00:29:16,350
regional budgets we should just have a

00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:22,020
federal budget for the actual regional

00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:25,110
activity and this would have many

00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:29,429
advantages I think also in managing

00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:33,559
managing the budget axis out now but we

00:29:29,429 --> 00:29:36,840
could hear the pros this would have so

00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:41,669
thinking regional is something which

00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:44,010
worked for many years the fact that the

00:29:41,669 --> 00:29:46,490
bad that the budget now is on the

00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:46,490
council

00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:56,620
took away a bit the advantages which

00:29:52,929 --> 00:30:00,009
were the most important ones there are

00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:02,710
many others so I am aware we can meet we

00:30:00,009 --> 00:30:04,990
can do a meeting at Lobel meeting we

00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:08,910
shoot the original meeting so at least

00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:13,680
per continent or timezone or whatever

00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:16,770
but I'm I'm going to that now the

00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:20,810
tractor should look like that mind chest

00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:24,870
should absorb completely fans co and co

00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:28,800
already gave over most of the

00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:33,810
responsibilities to the regions now fans

00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:37,470
co has been also that the budget has

00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:43,260
been moved to council so fans who

00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:45,630
actually doesn't have really important

00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:48,000
responsibilities so there are more at

00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:52,830
mister chief they are related to

00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:56,370
mentoring but we have a group for

00:30:52,830 --> 00:31:00,000
mentors which is fam'ly it wasn't used

00:30:56,370 --> 00:31:02,490
for many years but seven eight years ago

00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:06,300
Pamela's an important person it was a

00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:09,810
one person one-man show and he had to do

00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:14,580
a lot of work why we don't use fam'ly

00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:18,240
for our administrative activities for

00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:21,050
ambassadors and keep in mind the real

00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:26,670
important things for outreach teams

00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:29,310
ambassadors included so the idea should

00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:31,320
be like that so we would have first

00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:31,680
corner on one side for the technical

00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:38,760
teams

00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:43,170
mindshare for outreach teams and family

00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:49,070
I would have mentors admins which are

00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:49,070
three persons now not one and treasurers

00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:54,270
yeah

00:31:55,470 --> 00:32:03,970
thought about that I think the most

00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:08,110
important thing is to think globally not

00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:13,630
region wise to imagine our activity as

00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:16,750
shared with other outreach teams to

00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:17,679
improve the message we are giving out to

00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:20,019
end-users

00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:24,120
but the most important impact is

00:32:20,019 --> 00:32:29,070
probably thinking without a regional

00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:29,070
division of the Ambassador group

00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:07,150
yeah I I thought about treasures because

00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:09,340
famine could decide about the real the

00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:14,790
minor events so I am thinking about

00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:17,710
released parties or we had the budget

00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:21,640
business cards which were three dollars

00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:23,650
and eighty yeah stuff like that can be

00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:26,380
handled directly by the treasures or

00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:30,880
should behind it like if I Pharma

00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:35,440
I mean if Pamela is unsure or needs the

00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:42,010
input from mine chair they need to do

00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:43,810
that just the left arm right arm of mine

00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:47,200
chair and should take all the

00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:50,020
administrative things so budget until

00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:52,420
I'm not sure two hundred dollars for two

00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:57,910
hundred fifty fifty dollars or whatever

00:33:52,420 --> 00:34:03,630
I wouldn't I wouldn't set a limit on a

00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:03,630
specific amount of money yeah

00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:17,000
what does it represent it should be a

00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:19,610
committee or a group which works

00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:23,570
together with all outreach teams not

00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:28,750
just ambassadors to get out the fedora

00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:28,750
message more effectively to end users

00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:35,250
sorry I don't hear you

00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:40,970
No

00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:45,010
it's a model we are working on it's a

00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:48,830
council objective so council really

00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:54,650
wants to make that happen in some way

00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:56,390
it's not that this is the the law and we

00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:59,990
need to follow that we can discuss it

00:34:56,390 --> 00:35:02,470
but more or less we should rely on this

00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:02,470
structure

00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:17,990
yes

00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:41,030
yes yes

00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:45,560
yes it fits yes

00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:07,060
yet the you mean structure of mine chair

00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:08,590
how it should look like I was thinking

00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:13,840
about something like that

00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:17,140
so mine chair should be similar to the

00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:19,000
council we have one chair for the

00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:24,070
council it's the project leader for mine

00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:28,180
chair is our SDF cake we should have two

00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:31,920
appointed ambassadors design and web are

00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:37,450
small groups so I think they can share

00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:39,430
seat talks which are important orient

00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:43,800
users because people are looking for

00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:46,630
dogs even better if they are translated

00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:50,140
marketing should have an appointed seat

00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:55,030
come ups on come ups I want to say

00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:59,110
something after that and we should have

00:36:55,030 --> 00:37:01,420
also two elected seat seats why not

00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:06,160
hype elected seats which the community

00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:09,340
elected without need to be in a group or

00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:14,320
whatever just community and users should

00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:17,790
be able to vote for anyone to represent

00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,790
them in the mine chair

00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:28,830
yeah I I think it's similar to

00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:32,520
localization probably in a final model

00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:34,260
we will have a diversity although we

00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:40,470
have it over as a deceit on the conceit

00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:45,720
on the council and we could also think

00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:50,010
about localization representative and in

00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:52,580
my chair yes I see them on the same on

00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:52,580
the same world

00:38:02,329 --> 00:38:05,049
yes

00:38:15,099 --> 00:38:17,700
No

00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:44,829
we could also think about splitting just

00:38:41,499 --> 00:38:47,529
the Ambassador seats in one ambassador

00:38:44,829 --> 00:38:50,829
which is in the diversity team and

00:38:47,529 --> 00:38:54,400
another one I mean the goal is not

00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:57,910
having someone on the seat the goal is

00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:59,710
we need to collaborate between the

00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:02,680
outreach teams and get the message out

00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:07,029
if we need to see it we can we can set

00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:10,539
up a seat is not a problem it's just we

00:39:07,029 --> 00:39:14,549
need to be not not pair with nine people

00:39:10,539 --> 00:39:14,549
or eleven or all seven so

00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:25,950
yes right yes mm-hmm

00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,280
nothing

00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,180
this one

00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:55,470
yes

00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:16,220
yeah I think mmm

00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:19,720
you spoke about IRC channels and

00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:23,840
telegram which are mostly for

00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:27,190
contributors right so I don't see end

00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:27,190
users in our telecom group

00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,400
yes

00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:38,740
I don't see this as a negative thing so

00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:42,520
the goal we have is to speak effectively

00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:44,260
to the contributors or end-users it's

00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:47,050
almost the same contributors or also

00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:51,580
users and end-users could become

00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:52,150
contributors so I think within mine

00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:56,130
chair

00:43:52,150 --> 00:44:00,790
this could behind it really become UPS

00:43:56,130 --> 00:44:04,810
Commerce is in my eyes something which

00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:08,020
is present in any company when you have

00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:12,369
operations sales and operations and

00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:14,970
marketing community operations it's

00:44:12,369 --> 00:44:18,099
something which should care about

00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:21,339
communication so telegram and IRC is

00:44:18,099 --> 00:44:24,270
about communication come up already does

00:44:21,339 --> 00:44:29,320
the comm block which is communication

00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:36,670
one-way communication outside while IOC

00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:39,089
and two ways and come ups could all good

00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:42,760
if we have two people and the main force

00:44:39,089 --> 00:44:45,099
also drive communication between

00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:47,920
technical teams and outreach teams

00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:49,359
because we we really don't want to do

00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:54,720
our own stuff

00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:58,450
we rely always on releases features

00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:01,690
atomic working group whatever

00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:04,690
all of them have messages come ups could

00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:06,609
help to get these messages and to bring

00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:09,369
them to my chair or the marketing and

00:45:06,609 --> 00:45:11,849
then we can figure out the strategy how

00:45:09,369 --> 00:45:15,480
to communicate them as best as possible

00:45:11,849 --> 00:45:18,670
not only during events but also with

00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:21,339
single or mailing or come block

00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:25,060
activities or articles on magazine

00:45:21,339 --> 00:45:28,359
magazine like I saw many end users are

00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:30,430
reading magazine so their articles we

00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:35,999
have they're very useful

00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:40,959
I see many new people in the IRC channel

00:45:35,999 --> 00:45:43,959
locked always now so this is probably

00:45:40,959 --> 00:45:46,089
the result of the latest or we had this

00:45:43,959 --> 00:45:54,279
article three times now or two times

00:45:46,089 --> 00:45:57,549
about that and see the bouncer so what

00:45:54,279 --> 00:46:02,799
you are saying is is it something which

00:45:57,549 --> 00:46:18,579
is the result we should go to yes order

00:46:02,799 --> 00:46:21,039
the gold the target yeah the budget yeah

00:46:18,579 --> 00:46:23,589
the budget now is on the council the

00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:27,549
rest the person who is responsible for

00:46:23,589 --> 00:46:32,859
the budget is f cake as the f cake is

00:46:27,549 --> 00:46:36,789
within the mine chair initiative we

00:46:32,859 --> 00:46:40,170
could handle part of the regional budget

00:46:36,789 --> 00:46:45,249
or almost all the regional budget plus

00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:48,699
budget which the council how heads for

00:46:45,249 --> 00:46:51,160
special events actually we have if you

00:46:48,699 --> 00:46:56,469
have read the strategy article from

00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:59,759
matthew miller you will have you will

00:46:56,469 --> 00:47:02,650
know the council have still money for

00:46:59,759 --> 00:47:06,519
specific events if you have a good plan

00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:08,679
if we have a target if we have a hopeful

00:47:06,519 --> 00:47:11,459
and output of this event and the council

00:47:08,679 --> 00:47:17,589
can sponsor it they can fund an event

00:47:11,459 --> 00:47:18,189
it's not that it's not like people got

00:47:17,589 --> 00:47:20,799
the message

00:47:18,189 --> 00:47:23,519
hey they cut budget about sixty percent

00:47:20,799 --> 00:47:26,289
now and we can't do any events anymore

00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:29,049
that's not the truth we have the same

00:47:26,289 --> 00:47:31,449
budget that last year having the F cake

00:47:29,049 --> 00:47:34,209
with in mind chair could help to bring

00:47:31,449 --> 00:47:35,890
this message better to ambassadors not

00:47:34,209 --> 00:47:38,319
only to ambassadors but to all the

00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:41,170
regions and organize events which are

00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:42,570
very really useful for for fedora and

00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:47,750
then we can ask

00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:51,000
through the F cake the council - for

00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:55,770
extra funding or funding special event

00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:57,360
where we we want to be present country

00:47:55,770 --> 00:47:59,640
or local events can be approved by

00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:02,160
family as I said before so this is

00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:05,880
release parties Linux days we have in

00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:08,760
Italy in November they are very small

00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:13,110
there are many events but they are too

00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:15,720
small to be handled by my chair if I'm I

00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:18,540
think there's a minor impact or they

00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:21,120
expect this specific event to have an

00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:24,540
impact on design or marketing they can

00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:26,730
they should they need to stand up and

00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:30,000
say hey my chair we have this event we

00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:32,090
have the treasurer is aware about the

00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,980
local event

00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:37,290
can we get input from marketing to make

00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:42,270
this event better as the local community

00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:43,620
is organizing and then they feel it

00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:46,880
needs more discussion they will bring

00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:51,110
this to my show we will decide about it

00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:58,470
story tell us yes we still have them

00:48:51,110 --> 00:49:02,190
storytellers they really should be

00:48:58,470 --> 00:49:06,090
driven and in some way I brought by come

00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:08,490
ups but they need a guideline - to

00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:10,410
understand what they need to do actually

00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:14,640
yes they are storytellers they need to

00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:16,860
read to collect reports right but they

00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,780
don't know how to do that actually

00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:21,270
they don't have a guideline they don't

00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:24,060
know what a report should contain they

00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:26,640
don't have a template they they don't

00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:29,049
have anything actually that's why we

00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:32,409
don't we don't have requests probably

00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:34,179
so if we get will give inputs and tools

00:49:32,409 --> 00:49:38,349
to the ambassador's then we will get

00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:39,869
results otherwise all we do their own

00:49:38,349 --> 00:49:45,099
stuff there yes

00:49:39,869 --> 00:49:48,519
as for the last two years and we are we

00:49:45,099 --> 00:49:51,249
are going towards nothing at the end

00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:53,739
because we we don't communicate the

00:49:51,249 --> 00:49:57,789
right message outside we are presented

00:49:53,739 --> 00:50:00,369
event we have a booth we do very well as

00:49:57,789 --> 00:50:02,979
ambassadors so the mirth of those who

00:50:00,369 --> 00:50:05,709
are presented at events actually are

00:50:02,979 --> 00:50:08,769
great guys and they they may create

00:50:05,709 --> 00:50:14,349
events normally without having any

00:50:08,769 --> 00:50:17,349
support any real support from marketing

00:50:14,349 --> 00:50:20,199
design or whatever to to help them to be

00:50:17,349 --> 00:50:24,339
even better so that's my understanding

00:50:20,199 --> 00:50:25,899
what has happened actually I'm around

00:50:24,339 --> 00:50:30,729
since many years and when I came to

00:50:25,899 --> 00:50:34,269
fedora ambassadors group was a really

00:50:30,729 --> 00:50:37,179
good group and was working a lot

00:50:34,269 --> 00:50:41,499
we had people travelling around almost

00:50:37,179 --> 00:50:43,689
the whole year and we had great events

00:50:41,499 --> 00:50:48,239
and peak events with thousand two

00:50:43,689 --> 00:50:52,119
thousand attendees special in Germany or

00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:57,179
and nowadays we have one or two event in

00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:57,179
Germany because we don't have

00:50:57,390 --> 00:51:00,830
a community there anymore

00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:12,630
I tried to resume something something

00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:16,800
more for the order outreach teams design

00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:21,150
and web yeah it's more or less what I

00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:26,460
said already I don't know what to say

00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:28,960
about dogs it's probably Brian is the

00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:36,160
right person to that

00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:41,320
and yes that's more or less my vision of

00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:44,020
how mine chair should work or what I'd

00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:46,380
like to know now is what you think about

00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:46,380
it

00:51:52,470 --> 00:51:55,860
and honestly

00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:14,010
yeah we need we still need to figure out

00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:17,130
how to meet how to file requests or wax

00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:20,610
or whatever so X is another point which

00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:24,740
can be handled differently we know

00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:28,140
actually we produce wax in every region

00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:33,270
we can make bigger orders we can share

00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:35,550
wax we can but we should say much for

00:52:33,270 --> 00:52:38,610
the Federated set up an inventory we had

00:52:35,550 --> 00:52:41,400
this years ago who has to taught them

00:52:38,610 --> 00:52:43,500
when if I need to have to federate or I

00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:47,170
mean just I just have to go to the

00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:49,239
website and see yes he has it his

00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:54,640
there's the contact and I can call him

00:52:49,239 --> 00:52:58,749
so on the wiki we had this on Fedora

00:52:54,640 --> 00:53:03,519
hosted time ago but I would not care

00:52:58,749 --> 00:53:06,369
about stickers and and DVDs and yeah

00:53:03,519 --> 00:53:10,950
we even had this guy has 40 stickers

00:53:06,369 --> 00:53:15,249
left and 70 case badges and whatever

00:53:10,950 --> 00:53:18,729
just the hardware table closes totem you

00:53:15,249 --> 00:53:23,700
have two boxes I think in any write the

00:53:18,729 --> 00:53:27,880
event boxes we had this also in Europe

00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:33,400
every box had also a laptop inside time

00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:35,079
ago so yeah right and this could

00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:39,910
substitute that with a federal rate or

00:53:35,079 --> 00:53:43,349
inside so it could be I mean any idea is

00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:43,349
what common know if you can't prove

00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:17,440
right

00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,630
nothing at all

00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:43,730
this

00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:58,710
yep

00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:08,150
correct

00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:18,500
I brought that up four years ago four

00:55:16,369 --> 00:55:21,110
years ago with the out of laughs and

00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:24,470
said do we need release readiness

00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:26,240
meetings it's just saying okay okay okay

00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:31,550
okay then let's go

00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:34,910
but in the end websites had to do still

00:55:31,550 --> 00:55:39,230
stuff they were not aware of changes of

00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:41,660
the cloud and Adam Miller shows up and

00:55:39,230 --> 00:55:43,460
say hey why don't you have this and this

00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:47,630
and this and this on the website and I

00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:49,760
had 24 hours to fix that so the release

00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:52,220
readiness meeting should be should

00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,600
happen in another way yes and mine chair

00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:57,800
should work on that

00:55:53,600 --> 00:56:01,250
Oh or better mine chair and driven by

00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:05,300
calm ups because I would see that a car

00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:07,190
as a calm ups activity because it's just

00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:08,330
communication and they're always

00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:12,970
readiness meeting

00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:12,970
I don't need really a meeting to do that

00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:47,140
actually I can speak for the websites I

00:58:44,590 --> 00:58:49,060
get my informations through personal

00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:51,450
connections from relaying was then is

00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:54,220
saying hey this has changed and that I

00:58:51,450 --> 00:58:56,950
wasn't worried about about aware about

00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:57,370
that the same for cloud or whatever it

00:58:56,950 --> 00:59:03,900
was

00:58:57,370 --> 00:59:05,590
atom or dusty now giving me a great hand

00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:08,770
totally up to date

00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:13,480
I I guess and I fear the same happens to

00:59:08,770 --> 00:59:16,440
other teams so speaking about websites

00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:20,140
because I have two direct experience but

00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:21,760
what about Doc's mind I mean I can fix

00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:26,560
something in 24 hours

00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:29,530
Doc's I think it would be much more

00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:34,540
difficult and the same is we have a

00:59:29,530 --> 00:59:37,210
readiness meeting on Thursday but before

00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:40,630
Monday we have and we have no release

00:59:37,210 --> 00:59:43,090
announcement we have nothing and it's

00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:46,650
it's always on the last and the world

00:59:43,090 --> 00:59:49,360
last second can you review it no right

00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:51,850
we should have all these informations

00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:53,980
before same for the talking points then

00:59:51,850 --> 00:59:57,250
ambassadors can say oh okay talking

00:59:53,980 --> 01:00:00,760
points is about the new spin but I am

00:59:57,250 --> 01:00:03,570
not aware about this new spin I'm don't

01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:05,920
know anything about Titan classroom so

01:00:03,570 --> 01:00:08,250
10 ambassadors during the readiness

01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:12,220
meeting can say no we are not ready we

01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:14,550
we don't have the information which we

01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:14,550
need

01:00:14,670 --> 01:00:21,210
it's all probably to do before during

01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:25,920
the day and the date of the readiness

01:00:21,210 --> 01:00:27,980
meeting so we are now over time if you

01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:31,770
have any questions or feedback so I'm

01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:35,450
I'm happy to speak with you about your

01:00:31,770 --> 01:00:35,450
thoughts or ideas

01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:43,900
that's a good question

01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:43,900
[Music]

01:00:45,770 --> 01:00:54,470
I don't have an answer now but we should

01:00:49,130 --> 01:00:56,960
think about something we're not the

01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:58,310
whole world should discuss on like the

01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:00,950
Ambassador mailing list or whatever

01:00:58,310 --> 01:01:13,870
because it's not just about ambassadors

01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:13,870
it's on a higher level for whom

01:01:20,020 --> 01:01:28,600
I would it seemed more useful if we set

01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:32,320
up a page where we show what mind child

01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:36,730
should look about like a wiki page or

01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:39,820
whatever and then accept discussions

01:01:36,730 --> 01:01:42,820
about single topics not just speak

01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:44,470
around because if we have hundreds of

01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:49,990
discussions we will never start with

01:01:44,470 --> 01:01:54,820
with my chair so my feeling is that it's

01:01:49,990 --> 01:01:57,790
better if we can't we'll discuss yeah if

01:01:54,820 --> 01:02:01,560
we want to start this we need to file a

01:01:57,790 --> 01:02:01,560
proposal to the council anyway so

01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:09,550
council discuss maybe I should set up a
