Talk: Discussing Kubernetes & Origin Deployment Options
Presenter: Jason Brooks, Yu Qi Zhang

Decription:
When it comes to methods of deploying kubernetes and openshift origin clusters, the Fedora community faces an embarrassment of riches: ansible scripts, kubeadm, oc cluster up, minishift and minikube, among other options. In this work session, we'll try to lay out the main options for setting up these clusters, seek out discussion and feedback about which options are working best for our community members, and develop some plans around better improving, documenting, and promoting these options.
