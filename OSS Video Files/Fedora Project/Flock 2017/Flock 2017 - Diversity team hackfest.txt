Description:
Diversity Team hack-fest - We will like to target two major milestones during diversity team hack-fest -
a). Planning of Diversity Events
b). Diversity team interaction with other Fedora sigs/groups

Agenda
======
Diversity Team did a great job in order to carry out Fedora Women Day and LGBTQA events. We want to do more such events annually, in order to target
more minority groups in future as well. This should be one of the main ongoing, always rolling and continuous activity for our team.

We identified few such events, which we would like to organize in a year -
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
a). Fedora Women Day - In September
b). LGBTQA - May 17 -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day_Against_Homophobia,_Transphobia_and_Biphobia
c). Disabilities - December 05 -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations%27_International_Day_of_Persons_with_Disabilities
d). FLISoL - Fedora Diversity presence for "Latam-Hispanic" group -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLISOL
e). Fedora Diversity Day - FAD for diversity team

As diversity team is a very small team of few core members only, so we want to take feedback from other fellow Fedora contributors as well.
This hack-fest will help us collaborate with other teams in Fedora - Ambassadors, Marketing and CommOps.
We would like to collaborate with these teams for having inputs and suggestions for diversity events and would like to take help to organize these events world wide on large scale.

Inputs
=====
Organizers - This hack-fest will be lead by Amita Sharma and Justin Flory.
Team Members - It will be great to have Jona and Bee in the same room for this hack-fest.
Others - In order to make it real success, we would like to have Bex, Few Ambassadors from different regions (robyduck, sumantro, Jona, Justin, x3mboy) and Paul Fields from magazine team. We have contacted them via mail for joining our session. Also, I am planning to do a blog post to invite more people to join the session on fedora community blog.
Logistics - White board with some markers.

Activities
======
a). Review the existing events on the list and revise he event planning according to the feedback from everyone.
b). Coming up with a flowchart which can fit most of these events and can be defined easily. For example - N days before we need to publish an article
for event, then we need to do next activity, then next...
c). How many regions can be targeted for the event X and how to co-ordinate among regions. Who all from ambassador team can take up the initiative and
whom we can contact for the event X for a specific region.
d). Inputs for activities for every event which will make them unique and remarkable.
e). Format of the posts - Event planning posts, Event Schedule post, Event Report post etc.
f). How to evaluate the success rate of the events.
g). Budget Requirements and what best we can do without depending much on budget.
h). Identify any other significant day to celebrate as a Fedora diversity event.

Outputs/ Outcomes
=============
a). Annual Diversity Events in Fedora Community at large scale, world wide.

Impact on Fedora Mission
====================
[Fedora Mission - https://lwn.net/Articles/720055/ ]
a). Improve and support diverse range of contributors and create more
inclusive space in Fedora.
b). Part of our Fedora mission says " For community members to build
tailored solutions for their users — Fedora isn’t just the toolkit. Many of
our contributors are here to collaborate to create solutions for specific
user problems" , Diversity events will help us bring out different kind of
requirements for different user base. For example disabled people user base
and by identifying such requirements we will be able to serve them more
easily. Here is the LGBTQA event report link, which can be referred to
