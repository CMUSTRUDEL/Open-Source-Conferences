* audience knows how to build a module in production infrastructure and can try it out
* audience is aware of best practices for creating modules
* audience is familiar with whole build pipeline

Agenda:
* short introduction to modularity
* demonstrate a real module, which is already present in infrastructure
* go over though all the steps which take place in the pipeline (dist-git, mbs, koji, testing, module-aware dnf)
* initiate a workshop where audience is meant to create a module of their favorite package/stack
* in this step, presenter should be showcasing module creation live, while other modularity members assist people with module creation
* during this part, best-practices for module creation should be constantly discussed
* if time allows, create at least one test which would prove the module works correctly
* modularity team should gather feedback from audience and incorporate it into documentation
* in the end of workshop, review modules created by audience â€” ideally get them into production infrastructure
