Talk: Fedora Design Pattern Library
Presenter. Máirín Duffy, Mary Shakshober

Description: 
We can improve the UX of Fedora infrastructure apps by using a consistent set of design patterns across applications. Let's talk about a project I've been working on to document Fedora's application UI design patterns as well as our brand elements using the principles of Atomic design and the upstream pattern management tool called patternlab. The end goal of this project is to have a neat and easily-maintained design pattern library that Fedora application developers and designers can use to create applications that provide a consistent, usable look and feel.
