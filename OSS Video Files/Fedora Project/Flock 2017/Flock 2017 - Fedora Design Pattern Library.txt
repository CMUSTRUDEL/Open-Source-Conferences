@Grand I
Talk: Fedora Design Pattern Library
Presenter. MÃ¡irÃ­n Duffy, Mary Shakshober

Description: 
We can improve the UX of Fedora infrastructure apps by using a consistent set of design patterns across applications. Let's talk about a project I've been working on to document Fedora's application UI design patterns as well as our brand elements using the principles of Atomic design and the upstream pattern management tool called patternlab. The end goal of this project is to have a neat and easily-maintained design pattern library that Fedora application developers and designers can use to create applications that provide a consistent, usable look and feel.

what okay so this is gonna be a very

00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:08,639
informal talk because I didn't prepare

00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,590
slides and I thought you know what let's

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,230
just talk and not make it like a big

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:15,480
thing and also because I'm lazy but

00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:18,810
that's alright let me let me give you a

00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,730
little bit of a a whirlwind tour of my

00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,160
history with fedora and its websites

00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:27,180
I've been working with the Fedora

00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:29,760
project in some capacity since 2004 in

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:32,969
that time since then we've probably

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:40,170
redone our main website six times

00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:40,559
maybe sure it was a question oh sure

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,110
sure sure

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,520
oh yeah yeah so let me start with my

00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,200
slug here

00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,340
so my slug is I want to talk about a

00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:53,420
project that I've been working on with

00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:56,640
both Mary and an intern who recently

00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:58,770
finished his internship Erik called

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,440
pattern lab so there's an upstream

00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,600
project called pattern lab it's probably

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,060
pattern lab org or something and the

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,930
idea how many people here have heard of

00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:12,090
atomic design yeah okay so it basically

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,380
follows atomic design principles and

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,250
gives you like a nice little framework

00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:18,450
to plug in your actual design patterns

00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:20,700
so we've been trying to build that out

00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:23,430
based on Fedora bootstrap which Ryan has

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:26,070
created just so that Fedora bootstrap

00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,530
has a documentation to it and so it's

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:30,930
usable both for designers and developers

00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:35,070
to figure out how do you make an

00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:38,549
application look fedora right so back to

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:41,850
my little whirlwind tour so yeah we've

00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:43,770
um you know I as Fedora has changed its

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,210
website and updated and built out our

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:48,420
infrastructure and built out more

00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:51,119
applications the whole practice of you

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:55,710
know web application design has sort of

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:58,200
evolved along with us and one of the

00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:00,090
things and I think that this is an issue

00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,899
with all open-source projects generally

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:06,119
or all community focused volunteer

00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:08,069
projects is you tend to have little

00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:09,479
islands and like oh look it's a new app

00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:12,090
and it has a completely different look

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,420
and feel because they're using Ruby on

00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,620
Rails and Ruby on Rails

00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,060
with this thing and it looks like this

00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:18,580
and we'll just go with that or you know

00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,680
it's it takes hard work to make designs

00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:22,959
consistent and to get a look and feel

00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:31,060
that goes consistently and integrate

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:35,110
different applications sure it's it's

00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:37,150
mostly it won't so it has a bit let me

00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:39,570
just show it to you alright again shout

00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:42,910
out questions this is totally informal

00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:45,100
and I will caveat this with I really do

00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:47,200
not like upstream pattern labs look and

00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,730
feel at all I really don't like it but I

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,400
haven't spent the time on it I've been

00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:53,709
trying to just do the patterns first so

00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,080
the first part and just as a quick

00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:59,530
overview of atomic design atomic design

00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:02,380
basically looks at the different design

00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:04,739
elements of a web application and breaks

00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:08,019
them down in terms of their scope so

00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:10,510
it's extremely tiny I can't any glasses

00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:11,830
and I still don't really see them in the

00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:13,720
upper left you'll see the navigation

00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:18,160
sort of shows you the different

00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:20,739
categories or levels of of I guess the

00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,390
hierarchy of the atomic design so that

00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:24,540
your first thing is atoms right

00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:28,060
so things that are atoms or sort of like

00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:31,450
it really just basic HTML elements like

00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:38,590
I'll go in here a button and see this is

00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:40,630
why I don't like the UI can I do yeah so

00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:42,730
things that are sort of at the atomic

00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:45,549
level this is the smallest unit like an

00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:47,350
atom well like an atom in 1940-something

00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:50,019
you can't break it into sub parts we

00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:53,620
won't talk about quarks it's things like

00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:57,579
the brand colors it's things like the

00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:59,890
fonts that we use and it's not showing

00:03:57,579 --> 00:04:03,910
the other ones that's okay the other

00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:06,459
things would be like parts of forms so

00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:08,709
like a form button basically like your

00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:10,329
standard HTML elements and maybe a few

00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:12,970
other things that you come up with just

00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:15,280
the base components of a design then you

00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:19,079
move up to the molecules and molecules

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,789
are kind of compositions of your atoms

00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,950
so here like instead of just a form

00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:26,320
button you might have this as a whole

00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:29,320
form and let me see if I can't

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,450
this is an entire form and this form as

00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,520
a unit is a molecule design pattern

00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:36,880
you're making a form follow this pattern

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,620
then you go up to organisms so if

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,230
anybody's familiar bootstrap here's a

00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:43,210
kind of a classic one as cards right

00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:45,640
kind of like each Twitter message is a

00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:49,600
card you have sort of the cap and the

00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:52,570
title and you know so these are organism

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,650
patterns and then you have templates so

00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:59,710
these for example you have a blog index

00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:01,470
you have you have a form that's probably

00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:04,150
a more complex form you have a dashboard

00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:06,810
right so these are more patterns of

00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:11,620
things and then you have actual pages

00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:13,630
like a login page or you have the about

00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:16,690
page and these are things that occur

00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:18,070
over and over and websites but you can

00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:20,500
kind of see how you start with the

00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:23,080
smallest unit and you go up so it's sort

00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,630
of organizing your design patterns in

00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,790
terms of how substantial they are and we

00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:29,920
really need to do that for fedora so

00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:33,190
that's sort of what why Ryan has been

00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:35,260
working on fedora bootstrap and sort of

00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:37,450
the whole point of this exercise is is

00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:39,360
to document it so you can kind of see

00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:42,880
where we filled in some of this stuff

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,710
these are the fedora brand colors so

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,720
it's sort of I guess the point I was

00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:49,270
trying to get to is it's kind of part

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,510
brand book a little bit and then it's

00:05:49,270 --> 00:06:00,100
kind of part actual UI you know

00:05:52,510 --> 00:06:02,380
documentation exactly so one of the

00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:05,650
ideas here is I'll take I'll take an

00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:08,250
organism that one of my interns worked

00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:08,250
on let me see

00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:23,449
you know what I might not be hold on I'm

00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:26,090
gonna go doc stop peg org slash pattern

00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:30,110
lab here let me just flash the URL if

00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:31,879
you want to take a look I build it

00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:33,470
pretty frequently so that you can see

00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:40,400
the latest stuff and I know that I put

00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:43,099
his things in there and one of the

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,870
vehicles that we're using to figure out

00:06:43,099 --> 00:06:46,729
what the pattern should be and they're

00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:48,590
not all in Fedora bootstrap I think we

00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:52,129
need to upstream some of this stuff but

00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:55,639
we're looking at sort of the UX design

00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:58,330
for Fedora hubs to try to pull out some

00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:02,240
of those patterns like for example this

00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:07,610
let me zoom in a bit like this left nav

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:09,830
here that's sort of a specific pattern

00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:12,169
right and then like over here you have

00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:17,120
like the community rules box you have

00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:19,759
the subscription bar and these different

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,650
widgets those are actual patterns and we

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:25,580
should the the process that I've been

00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:29,029
following so far is trying to get to a

00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:31,400
base implementing it in HTML and CSS as

00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:33,050
an example pattern and then further down

00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:36,409
the process I would like to up stream

00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:38,509
all that the CSS and HTML kind of stuff

00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:40,159
into Fedora bootstrap so that anybody

00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:41,389
who can pull in for our bootstrap can

00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:43,639
use any pattern that's in the pattern

00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:47,120
library we haven't done that yet so when

00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:49,190
you go to the the pig or Doc's site it's

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,199
a little bit of a hack together mishmash

00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:55,360
right now so don't look at it too

00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:59,210
closely but let me see if I can find

00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:01,819
yeah so these are examples of some

00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:04,490
patterns that Eric worked on this summer

00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:07,039
and for every pattern there's this

00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:08,900
little arrow that you might not even see

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:12,680
it's like in the far right if you click

00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:17,300
on it then it gives you mustache and

00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:20,509
HTML to implement that we're we're a

00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:21,949
little rough here is ideally all you

00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:24,159
would have to do is include the Fedora

00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:26,149
bootstrap and then you could use this

00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:28,099
example code and it would just work

00:08:26,149 --> 00:08:28,790
right now that is not the case because

00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:32,570
we have not you

00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:34,640
upstream the CSS so what what the Fedora

00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:36,500
hubs is doing right now which is very

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,510
messy is it's actually just taking the

00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,919
pattern lab CSS and including it to get

00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:41,810
these styles but I want to break them

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,400
out and properly upstream them into

00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:45,110
Fedora bootstrap which we could work on

00:08:43,400 --> 00:09:15,260
during the heck fest after this that

00:08:45,110 --> 00:09:16,760
would be very very cool yeah right so

00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:19,400
just for the purpose of the video the

00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:21,620
question was is fedoras infrastructure

00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,360
already using bootstrap and what do you

00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,710
do if a developer comes to you and they

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,490
want to use something that's not

00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:30,020
compatible with bootstrap right really

00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:31,550
the only solution is to kind of lay down

00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:34,040
the law and say okay this is the way

00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:35,780
we're going but you know with web

00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,190
development what I've kind of learned

00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:38,840
over the years is there's always a new

00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:40,850
shiny and we'd like to abandon things

00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,260
that we standardize on like the sad

00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:45,770
story there is when the Fedora project

00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:47,630
site used 960 GS which was a cool grid

00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:49,100
system for a while and then it wasn't

00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:51,890
cool anymore and we were kind of stuck

00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:54,200
with it so we've kind of moved on the

00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:56,780
bootstrap we have a lot of legacy stuff

00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,430
that's not using it we have a lot of

00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:00,680
legacy stuff that may be using bootstrap

00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:03,920
but it's not using Fedora bootstrap yet

00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:05,750
so it's just it's a fewer designer or

00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,090
web minded person it's a really good way

00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:11,050
to help fedora out is to help us convert

00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:11,050
these things over

00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:35,299
right

00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:51,880
right so so what Ryan was saying is

00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:53,710
basically we kind of went bootstrap

00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,570
because we do get stuff from upstream

00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:57,820
that's bootstrap that we want to

00:10:55,570 --> 00:11:00,040
integrate kind of off the shelf and it

00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:01,750
also has a it's a solid community right

00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,130
so if we want to get people to

00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,990
contribute and we say well we

00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:06,840
standardized in bootstrap we have a

00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:08,980
larger contributor pool to pool from

00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,510
just because it really has become a

00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:12,580
standard with all this stuff you know

00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:14,920
like there's SAS and then there's s CSS

00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:16,360
and then there's less and it's like you

00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,890
don't really know which one to pick and

00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,480
which one's gonna win sometimes so

00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:21,310
sometimes it's better to hang back but I

00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,020
think at this point bootstrap is pretty

00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:25,150
safe to go with and if somebody wants to

00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:27,790
do something different they kind of have

00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:29,500
to they have to also take the cost of

00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:31,420
doing something non-standard I mean

00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,890
another thing that you could do that I

00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:34,030
don't know that pattern lab has built in

00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:36,730
if you were going to use pattern lab

00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:39,250
specifically but you could always have

00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:42,160
it sort of break out another tab and be

00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:44,440
like well if you're using bootstrap this

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,820
is you know what you would use but if

00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,100
you're not using bootstrap if you're

00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:50,530
using some other system that has a

00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:52,540
trendy name you could just make another

00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:53,890
tab for that but it's more work on the

00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:55,630
design or - because then you have to do

00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:57,700
CSS for two separate systems and learn

00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:59,290
both systems but I mean it is possible

00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,780
to do that and there's other pattern

00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:05,110
libraries like pattern fly they do stuff

00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:06,910
that's you know standard CSS and then

00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:09,460
they'll do stuff for different

00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:11,110
frameworks you know so it's it's

00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:13,530
possible to handle that - if you really

00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,530
need to

00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:37,780
yeah it's actually so it's it's again

00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:40,240
it's like you know not complete it's

00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:42,040
definitely a work in progress so my

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,560
thought is right now we're just putting

00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:46,750
in the patterns and then once we have a

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,700
decent set of patterns we'll probably

00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:50,110
have a lot more documentation and

00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:52,540
framework around them because right now

00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:57,510
pattern lab just spits out and like I

00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:57,510
can show you the way that it it does it

00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:03,490
so there's just directories that show

00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:05,710
and I hope this is big enough I can make

00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:07,840
it bigger but there's just directories

00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:09,910
for each level and I know like the term

00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,770
like the atoms molecules organisms I

00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:13,650
mean we could probably rename it too but

00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:18,870
that's like the standard atomic design

00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:18,870
terminology yeah

00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:29,320
okay so you're struggling with how just

00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:32,080
pattern libraries in general how you're

00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:41,230
even supposed to make use of it yeah

00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:43,390
right right so well so my goal here and

00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:45,460
I may be misinformed if anyone knows

00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:47,620
better please let me know my goal here

00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:50,380
is the pattern lab wood that we're doing

00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:53,110
for fedora I'm hoping would basically

00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:55,870
serve as a documentation or a how-to

00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:57,910
guide using Fedora bootstrap because

00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:59,950
right now to use Fedora bootstrap you

00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:01,510
have to know it exists you have to know

00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:02,920
where the repo is you have to include it

00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:04,210
in your project and then you have to

00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:07,270
kind of read through it to see what it

00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:09,280
gives you whereas with this like the

00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:11,110
idea is well I want to make something

00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,060
and I'm hoping we'll categorize them

00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:14,440
nicer so they're easier to browse but

00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,810
you know I want to make something that's

00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,010
a widget that has to do with events so

00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:19,960
here's a nice little it's all

00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:21,810
pre-designed for me it has like the date

00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:26,740
and the time and blah blah blah and you

00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:29,140
can just go in and grab all you would

00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:31,900
have to do is include fedora bootstrap

00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:34,720
in in your HTML so like in the header

00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:36,460
you would do a CSS include and whatever

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,560
is their job this JavaScript in it too

00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:40,900
right you just include for our bootstrap

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,850
in the header of your HTML and then you

00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:45,640
would just copy-paste the example HTML

00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:47,380
put it into your template or into your

00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:49,810
file however you're doing it whatever

00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:51,640
framework you're using and it's already

00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:54,940
pre-loaded like you see how it has class

00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:56,890
C widget meeting event that would be in

00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:58,150
Fedora bootstrap so you don't have to

00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:00,070
worry about oh well what's the class

00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:02,080
that I need to apply to this element to

00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:04,030
make it look like this you just grab the

00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:06,040
sample HTML and then you just fill in

00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:07,840
the data however you get the data from

00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,160
your app and it'll look the way it does

00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,140
in the example and the only thing you

00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:13,690
really had to do was include Fedora

00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:15,580
bootstrap so that's sort of how I

00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:17,590
envisioned it working does that sound

00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:21,030
like something would work for you or do

00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:21,030
you still find that a little confusing

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,930
right so I mean it could be it could be

00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:38,910
a matter of the usability of their

00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:40,920
actual pattern library yeah it's a

00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:42,360
little rough I haven't used it as of

00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,640
late like it's it's been a while this

00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,529
since I've looked at it but that is the

00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:49,050
general idea it's sort of like I'm

00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:51,149
including this pattern library I'm

00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:53,940
including this you know Fedora bootstrap

00:15:51,149 --> 00:15:55,200
or pattern fly or whatever and then this

00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,820
is just supposed to serve as the

00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,100
documentation how do you actually use it

00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,899
you know look here's a goodie I want to

00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,810
use this how do I actually use it

00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:06,800
copy paste fill in the data done so

00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:06,800
that's like the main point

00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:28,320
why did I go with pattern fly or pattern

00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:28,320
lab yeah

00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:53,990
right right right

00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:59,580
so the question is if you're not a UX

00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:01,050
designer and you're looking at this and

00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:04,170
you want to make a new widget how do you

00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:06,780
make it so it has a good UX you really

00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:09,270
need to talk to you X designer I mean

00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:11,640
the robots at least at this point can't

00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:13,140
replace a UX designer could to step back

00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,520
I'm like Suzanne kind of walked through

00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,500
in her talk how you have to step back

00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,750
and do all this research to understand

00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,380
what is the user goal what is the users

00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,449
workflow

00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,459
how do how do we figure out and

00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:26,010
prioritize what they need to do and you

00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:28,950
know using the hierarchy of the design

00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:30,660
of the screen the visual hierarchy how

00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:32,820
do we promote different things and

00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:34,590
demote different things to make a smooth

00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:37,320
workflow for the user those are all

00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:39,690
things that a UX designer needs to do if

00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:42,240
it would be helpful one thing we could

00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:44,280
you know put on the roadmap for this is

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,310
to have a little paragraph that talks

00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:49,290
about why we designed it this way and I

00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:52,770
mean one goal that I have for these is

00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:55,050
and pattern fly does this and I do like

00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:57,060
how that they do this is they test each

00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:59,640
pattern that they have they do usability

00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:01,890
testing to make sure that the goals of

00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:04,740
each design are being met by the actual

00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:06,210
user user test data so we could test

00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:07,500
them too and talk a little bit about the

00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,600
test results and talk about the

00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,760
strengths and weaknesses like this

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:16,200
widget was designed I can I'll use this

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:17,730
as a specific example the reason that

00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:21,510
this widget was designed the way it was

00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:23,070
is the number one thing so whenever you

00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:25,740
have any kind of visual design right

00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:27,120
there is a hierarchy I don't know if

00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:30,840
anybody's familiar with just all

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:32,550
principles but it's things like one of

00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,290
these things is not like the others

00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:35,970
so it stands out so if you have like a

00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:37,590
list of red things and one is green the

00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:39,000
green thing stands out or like this

00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:42,360
thing is big but everything else is

00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,860
small the size boldness if this is bold

00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:46,230
and that's not bold the thing that's

00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,320
bold stands out you can use gestalt

00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:50,170
principle

00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:51,400
to kind of set up a visual hierarchy so

00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,990
that when someone looks at something

00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,450
there's a certain order that they notice

00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:57,280
things so the number one thing looking

00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:59,170
at this design team meeting widget that

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,220
you notice the number one thing is

00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:04,540
November 4th the reason for that is that

00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:06,430
Fedora meetings well first of all the

00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:08,530
context around this write in a different

00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:10,810
context this design might not make as

00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:13,090
much sense but in the context of Fedora

00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:15,220
meetings and team meetings in general

00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:17,730
they usually happen mostly on a weekly

00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:20,080
basis and not more often than that so

00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:22,210
when you're thinking about units of time

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:25,300
the unit of time that's most relevant is

00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:26,650
the date because that team isn't going

00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,840
to have multiple meetings in the same

00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:30,670
day so the actual time the meeting

00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,460
occurs at is less important than the

00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:35,350
date the date needs to stand out because

00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:38,410
it's only once every week does that make

00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:41,380
sense the second thing that stands out

00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:44,020
in the visual hierarchy arguably is to

00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:45,460
add to calendar and that's so people the

00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:47,080
idea is that you need to know the

00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:49,060
meetings taking place the second thing

00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,320
is that you might want a reminder for

00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:52,030
the meeting you might want to add it

00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,340
into your own system so you get email

00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:56,830
alerts so that's the second thing that

00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:58,780
we know when this design was created

00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:59,980
that was the decision that was made the

00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:02,470
third thing is the name of the meeting

00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:03,450
design team meeting its third even

00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:05,950
though it's sort of the whole point

00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:07,540
because the idea is in context most

00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:09,130
likely this widget is going to be on the

00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,540
design team hub so you already know

00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:12,760
you're talking about the design team so

00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:14,530
the name of the meaning isn't quite as

00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:16,840
important you already have the context

00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:19,600
set by the surrounding page the third

00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:21,340
thing in the hierarchy again arguably

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,650
over the fourth thing arguably is the

00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:25,510
time it's at or the channel that it's in

00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:28,570
but those again it's important

00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:30,010
information to know but it's not as key

00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:32,230
is like knowing what data it is because

00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:33,640
you if the channel was the first thing

00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,570
that was the most important okay I'm in

00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,900
the channel but the meetings not

00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:38,980
happening cuz oh yeah it's not today

00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,030
also important to think about when

00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:43,690
you're looking at a design like this

00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:44,980
what isn't in there right maybe the name

00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:47,050
of the person who's running the meeting

00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:48,550
is that so important probably not I mean

00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:49,840
it's important but it's not so important

00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:53,950
that it needs to be bubbled up here a

00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:55,900
lot of design is actually removing data

00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:57,790
like not showing the data I'm making the

00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,320
decision because every time you present

00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,680
the user with a piece of data you kind

00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,240
of you

00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:04,190
- they're overwhelmed so you want to

00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,800
really work hard to not overwhelm the

00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:08,600
user and only curate information and

00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,100
bubble it up to them in a way that's

00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,110
going to make it most useful so that's

00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,700
just like a quick rundown and that is

00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:15,500
certainly a paragraph that I could write

00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:17,000
for every design and pattern what we

00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,560
have in here we could write that out and

00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,270
then that would help a developer who

00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,890
maybe doesn't have the UX experience to

00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:24,530
evaluate well what is this widget good

00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:26,540
at this widget is great for a context in

00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:28,940
which people know what the team is they

00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:31,850
know what the meetings are about if you

00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:33,650
had a ListView like we were talking

00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:35,780
about with Paul yesterday like if you

00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:37,310
had a view of all the fedora meeting

00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:39,530
channels and all the meetings that were

00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:41,390
taking place in each channel this design

00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:43,190
might not be the best because you know

00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:44,420
what day it is what you really need to

00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:46,280
know is what the meeting is about in

00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:48,020
which case the name of the meeting

00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,820
should be the top of the hierarchy not

00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,780
the date so you see those are sort of

00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:53,240
trade-offs that we can absolutely

00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:54,940
document with this does that does that

00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:58,820
answer the question does that make sense

00:21:54,940 --> 00:22:00,890
yeah so and these are things that we can

00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:02,360
all like if we have the you know Suzanne

00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:03,770
talked about assumptions right those are

00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:06,200
a lot of assumptions in there that this

00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:08,360
widgets on the design team page if we

00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,520
list out those assumptions then we test

00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,080
based on those assumptions and we can

00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:15,560
see how effective a design that it is

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:17,630
but yeah does this project I mean no we

00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:19,490
have like five minutes left but does

00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:20,660
this project seemed interesting does it

00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:25,400
seem like something we should be doing

00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:27,290
yeah cool cool yeah so um I will say

00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:30,800
because I see some technical folks in

00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:32,960
here I am NOT a really good user of git

00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,280
it's my deep dark secret except it's not

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,920
that secret because I about it on

00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:39,440
Twitter all the time so I actually

00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:41,330
forked this from upstream pattern lab I

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,840
want to say like eight or nine months

00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:46,760
ago and I haven't pulled from upstream

00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:48,650
since then so I know I have a really

00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:51,340
painful merch coming up but if anybody

00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:54,050
has the fortitude to deal with my

00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:55,310
swearing at get to help me through that

00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:57,110
process because I've never done it

00:22:55,310 --> 00:23:00,020
before that would be like something we

00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:02,270
could work on awesome okay yeah because

00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:04,780
we had to hack for us after this some

00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:06,710
other things that would be helpful I

00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:09,530
guess I should have probably talked

00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:11,270
about Fedora hubs I know it's in github

00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:14,280
I would love to move it to get lab or

00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:18,550
Pig or but we have a github

00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:21,130
site Fedora design fedora hubs and we've

00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:23,710
been using Sparkle share to work with

00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:26,380
this but this is basically this github

00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:31,480
site is where all the mock-ups are for

00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:37,360
fedora hubs so this is where I had Eric

00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:41,500
was looking at he was working with oh

00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,940
wait I went back to you fire style guide

00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,560
so there's a directory in here called

00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:46,180
style guide and what I did is I went

00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,950
through all the different mock-ups and I

00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:49,930
pulled out individual widgets and I just

00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:51,820
put them in a single file so he could go

00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:53,620
through like widget by widget by widget

00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:55,690
and just implemented in pattern lab and

00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:57,670
you can kind of see where he left off in

00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:59,140
the list so if anybody wanted to start

00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:01,660
implementing them in pattern lab it's

00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:04,000
it's really easy it really is so I can

00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:05,620
show you up here the tough part is

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,470
figuring out for the pattern you're

00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:11,320
working on is it an atom a molecule an

00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:13,060
organism mostly we've been putting them

00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:15,940
in organisms because like a whole widget

00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:17,980
it has forms inside it it has buttons

00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:19,360
inside it whatever so most widgets we've

00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:21,040
been putting under organisms I think

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,440
ideally we'd probably rename organisms

00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:25,210
to widgets but not right now because I

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,800
don't want to break stuff but you just

00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:29,740
go into the directory once you make that

00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:31,720
decision and then you'll see there's

00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:34,720
like global cards forms lists modal

00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:39,130
section text I believe I made the modal

00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:41,950
section but for each one then you have

00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:45,220
an MD file which is marked down and you

00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:47,380
have mustache so let me show you the

00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:49,750
easiest contribution you could ever make

00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:52,210
to an open source project you just put

00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:55,420
the name of the pattern this one is

00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:57,280
modal and then like the detailed name of

00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:58,930
the pattern basic modal dialog and

00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:02,770
that's all you need for that file and

00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:10,690
what that does is it shows up let me see

00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:11,950
if I can pull it up here wait the modal

00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:13,300
patterns are also interesting and that

00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:15,250
you have to click a button to trigger

00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:17,710
them so they're not inline on the page

00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:20,050
but whatever but what you right there

00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:22,150
shows up that's what's used for the

00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:23,680
header here and if you wanted to write a

00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:25,240
little bit of text like the explanatory

00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,160
text I was telling you sign that we

00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:30,450
could do you can write it in that market

00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:34,090
file - you could just put some little a

00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:38,140
little story here about oh you know the

00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:39,640
modal design blah blah blah okay so then

00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:47,340
the other component to making a pattern

00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:50,230
is doing the moustache and I'm not like

00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:52,840
mustache is I think really just

00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:54,790
pseudocode it's not like a language

00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:56,740
really right I mean it's just pseudocode

00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:58,210
so and I think the reason they call it

00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:00,010
mustache is because you can use the

00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:03,270
curly braces that look like mustache in

00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:05,260
them like you know some data goes here I

00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:17,830
think that's why they call it mustache

00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:19,540
oh maybe it's JSON like oh well I used

00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:21,400
examples that were in pattern lab and

00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:23,260
they didn't have them what they had is

00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:26,800
like just oh well you mean for the

00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:28,420
actual data input right yeah yeah yeah

00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,310
yeah yeah cuz they look like a mustache

00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:32,020
on its side yeah so I think the only

00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:33,100
reason that it's called mustache is

00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:36,610
because of that and then you put

00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:38,080
whatever the data yeah anyway I found it

00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:40,000
confusing and intimidating like what's

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:49,780
this new language mustache but no it's

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:57,160
not it's just like pseudocode yeah right

00:26:49,780 --> 00:27:00,520
right yeah yeah it's basically HTML kind

00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:03,430
of template yeah so you just open up the

00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:05,350
mustache file and you you basically use

00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:07,060
the HTML elements that you mean to use

00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:09,130
and then you just add the classes from

00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:10,360
Fedora bootstrap or the ones that you

00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:13,660
made up that you have an upstream jet

00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:16,240
and that's really it and then pattern

00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:18,130
lab will put it into the section so like

00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,470
I made a modal's folder so it made a

00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:22,120
modal section and then for each pattern

00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:24,370
I think it doesn't an alphabetic order

00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:26,050
on off the file system it just inserts

00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:28,480
that code that you put in there so

00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:30,820
that's really all there is to it so if

00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,920
you wanted to go through some of these

00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:34,270
files and like pull out the widgets and

00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,980
decide okay I'm going to do this widget

00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:39,000
I'm going to turn it into a pattern it

00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:41,580
it's really not difficult

00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,990
so that's another way that you know if

00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,730
you wanted to contribute it to this

00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:47,130
during this hack fest which is now just

00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:49,650
starting you know that's another thing

00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:52,620
that would be helpful another kind of

00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:53,909
bigger project that would probably be a

00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:55,850
little bit longer term but if you want

00:27:53,909 --> 00:27:58,679
to get started if you're good with CSS

00:27:55,850 --> 00:28:00,179
we need to take some of the pattern CSS

00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:02,520
and up stream it to fedora bootstrap

00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:04,230
ryan is here he's the Fedora bootstrap

00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:06,120
guru so he's a good person to work with

00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:08,220
on that but to get this stuff upstream

00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:10,260
so that we don't have it all stitched

00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:13,080
together in a hacky way in hubs that

00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:24,090
would be very good so any other

00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:28,559
questions sure am i planning to bring

00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:30,960
the libraries and classes for yeah so

00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:32,730
well so the idea is sort of hubs is kind

00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,130
of the guinea pig like we're using hubs

00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:37,380
to come up with the patterns and

00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:39,210
document the patterns and ideally I

00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,860
would like for them to be used across

00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:42,539
with our infrastructure so you may have

00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:44,100
some other application in fedora but a

00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:46,500
pattern that came from hubs might be

00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:49,470
useful for your app but yeah we'd like

00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:51,690
all of the CSS that's in hubs to kind of

00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:54,179
be pattern eyes and then upstream it to

00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:55,919
Fedora bootstrap so that it's not even

00:28:54,179 --> 00:29:07,590
sitting in hubs it's in Fedora bootstrap

00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:12,630
does that make sense is it graphs

00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:14,520
oh you mean graphs oh um hmm I guess

00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:17,520
yeah i we could you be using grey I

00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:24,740
think we have some things in fedora

00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:24,740
infrastructure that use d3 right yeah

00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:42,749
yeah OPA Gore has like the little graphs

00:29:39,589 --> 00:29:44,639
yeah so Konica if you wanted to look

00:29:42,749 --> 00:29:46,949
into figuring out well where are we

00:29:44,639 --> 00:29:48,779
using graphs can we document them in

00:29:46,949 --> 00:29:50,819
pattern lab those would be perfect cuz

00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:52,709
that's one section that isn't even in

00:29:50,819 --> 00:29:56,549
like the upstream templates that we got

00:29:52,709 --> 00:29:59,669
because we do the figure contribution

00:29:56,549 --> 00:30:01,529
like bar chart graph is one the D three

00:29:59,669 --> 00:30:03,209
things in hyper Kitty or another and if

00:30:01,529 --> 00:30:04,709
you can think of other places that we

00:30:03,209 --> 00:30:07,079
could or should be using graphs

00:30:04,709 --> 00:30:08,969
I think graphs is a great pattern area

00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:11,249
that we could be documenting so that we

00:30:08,969 --> 00:30:13,679
had consistent graphs across I know we

00:30:11,249 --> 00:30:16,559
have some we have some graph designs

00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:18,179
that one of the fedora hubs UX interns

00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:20,279
did a couple years ago but they haven't

00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:21,539
been implemented yet so you know we can

00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:23,099
figure out how to implement them and do

00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:24,719
patterns for those two so yeah that's a

00:30:23,099 --> 00:30:28,549
really good area to work on if you were

00:30:24,719 --> 00:30:28,549
up for it cool

00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:35,549
in bootstrap

00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:52,690
all right right right right yeah so

00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:54,250
that's another thing is we could

00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:55,960
document the patterns you have inferred

00:30:54,250 --> 00:31:00,660
our bootstrap that are unique to fit our

00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:00,660
bootstrap like the masthead yeah so

00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:14,800
right right is what app would you say

00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:17,100
has the most that needs to be up

00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,100
streamed

00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:33,370
kind of figure out which one to

00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:33,370
standardize on and go with that yeah

00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:41,650
sure

00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:46,580
cool yes there's a lot to work on

00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:48,140
there's a lot to do and the cool thing

00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:49,760
about all of it is none of it is really

00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:52,400
particularly hard you just have to sit

00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:54,770
down and do it so that's what we'll do

00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,880
now so I guess we'll stop the recording

00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:59,620
cool

00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:59,620
