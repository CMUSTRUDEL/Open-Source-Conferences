Talk: Gating on automated tests in Fedora - Greenwave
Presenter: Pengfei Jia

Description:
Have you ever noticed the automated test results in Bodhi? The Fedora QA team has done some great work, running lots of automated tests when you file a new update. Today those test results are aggregated in ResultsDB and appear in Bodhi when you file your update – so where do we go from here? In this talk, I will introduce two new services we are working on: Greenwave and WaiverDB. Greenwave is a service that Bodhi will query to decide if an update is ready to be pushed, based on its test results. And WaiverDB is how we deal with test results that are wrong. We'll cover:
- Why we need a service like Greenwave, and what problems it helps us to solve
- What happens when a test goes bad? – why we also need WaiverDB
- Oh no, not more red tape! – how Greenwave will help enable more automation in future, through Freshmaker
- How Greenwave works under the hood, and how it relates to ResultDB and WaiverDB
- How to define a policy in Greenwave, and how to waive a test result in WaiverDB
- Where we are at today with the implementation and our plans for the future
