Talk: Fedora G11N - What's going on
Presenter: Pravin Satpute

Description:  
We started Fedora G11N group 2 years back as a strategic collaboration between groups (i18n [1], trans [2], fltg [3] and Zanata [4]) working together on improving regional language support in Fedora.

This worked great during the first year (May 2015- May 2016 ), we able to achieve good collaboration and resolved few important cross group issues and represented all group as a together at the higher level. G11N FAD (Nov 2015) provided many inputâ€™s which are still useful. [5]

In second year, though as a G11N we not able to do that well. This talk is going to address
What are issues?
Recommended Solutions and other ideas

To make G11N group again successful and achieve objectives we planned during its formation. [6]
