Talk: Kernel regression and perf testing DO session
Presenter: Sumantro Mukherjee

Description:
Most of us test the kernel on our lenovo but we hardly get the chance to test the new kernel
on various off the shelf hardwares. Flock will be a good place where we will have many people
who will have different kinds of hardware and the aim of the do session will be to test if
everything works fine and or not. We also have a big spectrum of ARM devices and certified h/w most of which
can benefit from larger community involvement.Also , going forward we can have a kernel test day
as a part of the release which can help make fedora better.
