Talk: Simple User Testing  - Early and Often
Presenter: Jennifer Kotler

Description: 
User testing is often left until late in the software development process. At that point, it can be more difficult to integrate user feedback into your design. We will discuss ways of including user testing early in development through the use of micro-tests. We will walk through the process of identifying test objectives, and how to write task scenarios which you will present to your testers. We will touch on best practices when running a user test. This talk is useful for any designer or developer who is interested in learning user centered design processes to improve the usability of their work.
