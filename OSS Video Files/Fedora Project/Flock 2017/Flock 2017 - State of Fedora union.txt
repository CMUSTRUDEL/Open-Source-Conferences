um so yeah hi everybody i am matthew

00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:08,130
Miller I am the Fedora project leader

00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,800
which is kind of a weird title for a

00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,780
project like this because it is not the

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,320
kind of thing where I say here's what

00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,330
we'll do

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,430
and then everybody does it it's the kind

00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,470
of thing where I try and talk to

00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,789
everybody who's in this room and not in

00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,039
this room and everybody who works on

00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:24,779
Fedora and try to figure out what we're

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,660
all collectively interested in and

00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:29,519
working on and try and sort of establish

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,830
a coherence so we can all work together

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:35,370
and better get to where we actually want

00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,960
to go I've been doing these state of

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,160
fedora talks for a little while now

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,500
you've probably seen one before I

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,559
usually have some graphs and things in

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,539
them I've got graphs in this one as well

00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:47,789
I also I'm going to try and do something

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,230
dangerous which is make a point with

00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:55,199
some of the things I see in those graphs

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:57,180
so we'll see how that goes this time and

00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:02,670
does the clicker work it does when I

00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:05,240
turn it on okay if I want to laser

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:09,570
pointer that's the window laser pointer

00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:12,570
okay so first the last couple releases

00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:14,909
Fedora 2526 have gotten really good

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:17,220
press and a good good uptake a lot of

00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,930
people saying good things about them so

00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,580
I like to take a moment to show these

00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,950
quotes which I will not read because

00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,320
they're written down but they're nice

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,939
and I would like to congratulate

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,369
everybody who worked on these releases

00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:31,320
that's basically everybody in this room

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:33,720
I think and lots of people again not in

00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:37,970
this room congratulations good job these

00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,970
awesome releases last few releases yes

00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:46,649
so I was also looking back at press from

00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:49,679
you know previous years to see like what

00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:52,590
people said is sort of five years or so

00:01:49,679 --> 00:01:55,289
ago and some of the things back then

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,880
we're so mean that I decided not to put

00:01:55,289 --> 00:02:00,149
those quotes up on the board and instead

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,490
here is a pretty version picture of the

00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:06,359
eclipse from NASA public domain so

00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:08,099
that's any yeah we've done really well

00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:09,989
in the recent few years but it's not

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:11,400
necessarily the natural state of Fedora

00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:12,599
that everything is awesome like it's a

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,129
lot of hard work to make an awesome

00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:17,610
Fedora release and we've done a really

00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:19,620
good job of it recently but we've had

00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,660
some times where Fedora has you

00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,760
struggled a little bit more so it's good

00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,790
to remember those things as well as we

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,290
congratulate ourselves but back to

00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:32,040
congratulating for a little bit here

00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:34,430
this is mirror statistics from the most

00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:37,109
Cup recent couple releases basically a

00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:39,030
number of times are a number of IP

00:02:37,109 --> 00:02:40,859
addresses every day that we see

00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:42,450
connecting to our mirror servers there's

00:02:40,859 --> 00:02:44,609
a whole bunch of caveats with this but

00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:46,260
that's basically we feel like it's

00:02:44,609 --> 00:02:48,989
pretty good for comparing release to

00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:50,880
release even if the axis numbers or

00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:53,190
maybe not tell it completely

00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,930
representative but we can see basically

00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:58,109
we've had pretty good growth since

00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:01,349
Fedora 20 time maybe a little bit dip to

00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:04,799
24 Fedora 25 very high on the charts and

00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:07,650
Fedora 26 just coming up and actually

00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:09,389
this is a seven day moving average if I

00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:11,639
look at the raw numbers you can see that

00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:14,880
Fedora 26 is actually crossed Fedora 25

00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:17,340
so it's now our highest peak release

00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:20,430
right now so that's pretty cool too we

00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:24,120
have had very fast uptake I think it

00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:27,540
took 40 days for that to happen from the

00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,440
release which is a new record for people

00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:34,019
coming to the new fedora

00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:36,299
so again awesome good for us this is my

00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:39,540
dinosaur picture because these mirror

00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:41,639
statistics I promise smooth who helps me

00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,859
gather these that I would present them

00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:45,810
in the context of dinosaurs

00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:48,539
it's dangerous to draw too many

00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:50,400
conclusions from these because there's

00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:51,330
very sensitive to network kind of things

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,220
we don't do any

00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:55,290
vasive tracking a fedora there's no ID

00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:57,300
tracking there's no per machine tracking

00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:58,770
so we're just seeing machines hitting

00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:01,200
the mirrors and there's a lot of reasons

00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:03,450
they wouldn't show up machines behind

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,480
NAT if there's five machines behind one

00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:08,310
in one gateway that's counted as one if

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,320
there's a thousand machines it's counted

00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:12,270
as one on the other hand if you move

00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,220
around two like twenty coffee shops in a

00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:15,690
day you might be counted in as 20 as

00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,160
long as you do an update at each one of

00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,330
those coffee shops maybe you do maybe

00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,130
you don't

00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:24,030
some of us definitely do so yeah

00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:28,490
dinosaurs are involved in these

00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:31,050
statistics so there there's that to

00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:35,010
consider when taking too much from this

00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:37,350
data all right

00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:39,780
so things are generally pretty good in

00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:41,700
fedora right now very popular releases

00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:48,090
are solid I'm very proud of them a proud

00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:50,100
of everybody meanwhile on undeveloped we

00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:53,010
had this quote feels like everything is

00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:55,200
on fire and not in a good way you can go

00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:56,700
go look he said that if you want but it

00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,560
wasn't just one person there's kind of a

00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:01,320
general feeling that things are kind of

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,630
crazy so if everything is so good right

00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,880
now we're in the midst of having a cycle

00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:07,830
where we decided to stick to the

00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,750
schedule of having releases in October

00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:11,850
even though the last release was in July

00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,320
which means we've got like three months

00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:18,950
to put together a whole release which

00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:22,590
seems kind of crazy it is kind of crazy

00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:23,160
and not only that in order to make that

00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:25,050
happen

00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,940
there's basically only one good way

00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:28,350
which is just say we're gonna defer some

00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,790
of the things we wanted to do to the

00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:32,810
next release we're not going to try and

00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:35,820
cram everything in which makes sense

00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:38,940
then the things that we are trying to do

00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:42,180
on this release are big crazy lighting

00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:44,700
things on fire destructive things so why

00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:47,220
are we doing these big crazy things this

00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:49,020
time around rather than saying okay this

00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:52,410
is a short release now it's time to be

00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:54,660
conservative I've hopefully some of

00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:56,910
these dinosaur numbers will help think

00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:58,590
about why we're doing that I strongly

00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:00,570
believe and I think that a lot of people

00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:02,130
in this room feel like the things we're

00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:05,310
doing are important right now and I

00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:06,870
think this flock will hopefully

00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,820
I feel like we can bring everybody who's

00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:10,980
feeling uncomfortable on devel west into

00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:15,180
consensus on that so we feel like we're

00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:17,100
doing the right thing here so this is

00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:20,790
back to more dinosaur numbers here and

00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:22,920
this is basically from all time when we

00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:26,430
have statistics here and I've kind of

00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:27,870
lumped them into random groups here just

00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,370
sort of some of the groups the the

00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:31,920
releases lumped together basically

00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:35,760
arbitrarily as I kind of felt they fit

00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:38,610
together the red here which is actually

00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:40,470
colored red by coincidence but is a

00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:42,180
perfectly good time because you can see

00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:44,490
that's when things started going

00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:47,430
downhill there a little bit where we are

00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:49,230
where the numbers mean instead of going

00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:52,290
up like they had been suddenly or go in

00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:55,080
the wrong direction and this is a time

00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:57,990
of a lot of change for fedora those

00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:01,800
systemd entered the distribution genome

00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:03,720
3 came out was an anaconda rewrite DNFs

00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,370
probably in there somewhere so these are

00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:09,090
things that were pretty scary at the

00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:10,920
time but I think that as we got to the

00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:12,870
fedora next thing which is this green

00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,490
area here those are some of the

00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:16,590
foundational things that made it

00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:19,710
possible for fedora to be as awesome as

00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:22,230
it is today so there was that time of

00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:24,090
decrease but then we had this gigantic

00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:26,250
growth coming up so I think that was

00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:27,420
generally good it would be nice this

00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,550
time when were lighting things on fire

00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:32,070
if we can do it and keep growing at the

00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:34,140
same time but sometimes you know things

00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:36,000
don't naturally just always go out and

00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,440
so one of the things I really want to

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,160
point out the laser pointer supposed to

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:43,230
go on this screen way over here so does

00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,390
it show yeah we've got this growth going

00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:48,000
up here this little dip is kind of a

00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:50,640
weird anomaly this seems to be a lot of

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,490
Fedora 21 and Fedora 22 systems that

00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:55,530
were 32-bit that instead of upgrading to

00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:57,840
the next release they just went away we

00:07:55,530 --> 00:08:00,870
don't know why it may coincide with a

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,880
lot of our chatter about you know we're

00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:04,770
not quite able to support 32-bit on

00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,300
Intel very much anymore so maybe some

00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,700
people like ok we're gonna switch to

00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,890
Santo Sol or something else for those

00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:13,260
systems don't really know again we just

00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:14,790
have observational data it could be

00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:18,210
there all the system just finally died

00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:19,139
and so who knows they're going and then

00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:21,389
things do you know

00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:24,389
going up from there but if we look for

00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:27,240
basic look that's from basically this

00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:29,400
last year here it's actually pretty flat

00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,139
it's neither growth nor decline and

00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:34,169
that's kind of concerning to me because

00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:36,599
this we should be seeing growth and you

00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:38,430
can see in the last bit here which is

00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,440
basically sensitive for our 26 release

00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:42,269
there's higher numbers but you can also

00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,740
see on the very end of the chart that's

00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:46,170
actually kind of back down that higher

00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:48,029
numbers might just be noise and this is

00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:50,760
one of can be one of the dinosaur

00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:53,459
artifacts which is if you have a network

00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,589
which has Fodor 24 or Ford or 25 and

00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:58,199
Fodor 26 machines on it if it's all

00:08:55,589 --> 00:09:01,140
Fedora 25 machines that gets counted one

00:08:58,199 --> 00:09:04,440
time because of the NAT problem if you

00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:06,570
suddenly have a fedora 25 and 26 machine

00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,190
on there now it's counted twice so that

00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:10,470
can cause the data to be higher than it

00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:12,480
is so I hope this is not true I hope

00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:15,329
it's gonna keep going up I hope maybe at

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,310
least it's a new level but I would not

00:09:15,329 --> 00:09:20,250
be surprised to see this come back down

00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:22,199
to be flat for a while there so that's a

00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:24,560
little bit concerning because I don't

00:09:22,199 --> 00:09:27,209
want our growth to slow down

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,600
and so here is another other look at

00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:32,790
this data sort of a way to corroborate

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,230
what's going on with that this is

00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:36,540
looking at a completely different thing

00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:39,600
that we have some metrics on which is

00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:42,690
hotspot check-ins which basically my

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,370
laptop a lot of your laptops every five

00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,380
minutes do a little check to make sure

00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:48,060
that they're not behind a captive portal

00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:50,130
where you're at the coffee shop or the

00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:51,540
hotel and it makes you log in so it's

00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:53,190
the thing that makes it pop up that

00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,899
convenient that thing that says you're

00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:56,730
not on the real internet you need to log

00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:58,800
in this is a pretty common thing that

00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:01,350
basically every operating system does

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,750
this one does these days ours does this

00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:05,519
by hitting a specific URL on the Fedora

00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:07,890
servers so we're just counting the

00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:11,430
number of times people hit that server

00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:13,199
there and again it's not invasive

00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:17,250
tracking it's just we can see that there

00:10:13,199 --> 00:10:19,079
are machines hitting this this URL but

00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:21,089
unlike the other one where it's once per

00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:22,740
day this is every five minutes so we're

00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:25,470
actually counting the average number of

00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:28,410
average per day of five minutes here so

00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:31,380
you can see it's about 90,000 systems

00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:32,699
every every day and so we can say you

00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,000
know that like the fight the average

00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:34,950
fight

00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,320
minutes so if we can basically say let's

00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:40,410
say laptops are on a third of the day

00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,820
eight hours a day we can maybe assume

00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:43,740
that the actual total number is

00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:48,270
something more like 300,000 something

00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:49,590
like that which is okay and not every

00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:50,430
machine is counted obviously servers

00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:53,820
don't do this

00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:55,500
both genome and KDE use this feature I

00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,840
don't think any of our other desktop

00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,520
environments do some people of course

00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,740
they've turned it off or change it to

00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:03,540
hit another server so I wouldn't say

00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:06,060
that 300,000 is the total number of

00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:07,890
fedora machines out there on the other

00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:09,780
hand it's probably somewhere in that

00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:12,690
ballpark maybe half a million fedora

00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:14,430
systems which is really I think a lower

00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:17,610
number than we'd like to have in this

00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:19,650
world there's a Stack Exchange has a

00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:22,530
survey of developers

00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:23,940
exchange is a gigantic website that's

00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:26,400
very very popular among software

00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:28,950
developers and they did a survey of like

00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:31,050
50 or 60,000 people every year which is

00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:33,990
you know it's a web-based survey not

00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:36,060
necessarily scientific but anyways about

00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:38,160
20% of those what developers are using

00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:41,250
Linux as their main desktop environment

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:45,030
and we say that means 20% of developers

00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:46,500
in the world are using Linux that's all

00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:49,020
should be a lot more than half a million

00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:51,330
people in software developers alone not

00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:53,070
not even worrying about all the other

00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:55,430
people who are not software developers

00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:58,080
who are using Linux on their desktop so

00:11:55,430 --> 00:12:00,839
basically I think that although we're

00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:03,240
doing fairly well and we've reached a

00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:04,950
plateau and we really should be growing

00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,550
a lot more in order to have the impact

00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:09,780
that we'd like to have in the world so

00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:11,190
that's kind of why I'm talking about

00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:17,660
lighting things on fire a little bit

00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:17,660
because fire is what propels growth so

00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:21,900
switching graphs a little bit how many

00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,730
people have seen a curve like this

00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,960
before

00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:27,180
this way over this way I'm on screen

00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:29,610
okay yeah good about half through maybe

00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:33,600
this is the diffusion of innovation

00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:35,640
curve and this particularly has a chasm

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:39,120
in it the first time I saw this was

00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:41,040
actually at FUD Con 2005 or Michael

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,530
Tiemann stood up in front of us at

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,810
Boston and talked about this basically

00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:46,800
this is the idea of when you have got a

00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:48,750
new idea

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,300
how it reaches the marketplace and so

00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:53,250
we've got basically about two-and-a-half

00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:56,100
percent of the market or over in this

00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:57,420
innovators area and maybe twelve percent

00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:01,320
total in the innovators and early

00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:02,670
adopters section here and then the late

00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,079
majority like that's when people are

00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:06,839
like okay this Linux stuff is really

00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:10,380
catching on and then eventually you know

00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:12,120
down there so this stuff the early

00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:14,100
majority late majority and all that like

00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,440
this is what enterprise distributions

00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,839
are for people who are in that area need

00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,300
long term support and not just long term

00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:25,529
maintenance something like distributions

00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:27,000
like that that have a lifetime for three

00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:29,940
years but don't necessarily give you

00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,410
full support don't necessarily cover

00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:35,040
what people need so this is something

00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:37,410
that fedora as a community like that big

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,029
area is probably off-limits to us

00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:41,610
because we don't have the resources to

00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:45,899
cross that chasm that doesn't mean that

00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:47,430
we don't want to succeed but as part of

00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:50,519
our charter of fast-moving and

00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:52,680
innovation basically we live in this

00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:55,170
space here this innovator is an early

00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,970
adopter space and one of the things I

00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:58,170
really like to push because it's

00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,520
something I've heard from a lot of

00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:02,279
people here in this community is that

00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:03,899
fedora isn't just the bleeding edge like

00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:05,160
we often hear bleeding edge and I kind

00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:06,959
of would like to cross that off of

00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,760
things we say about fedora the bleeding

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,620
edge is right up here and it's only a

00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,010
few people and things don't work very

00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,839
well

00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:14,520
fedora really wants we want to cover

00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:15,930
some of that but we don't want to be in

00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,610
this early space where there are people

00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:19,200
who are actually using it because we

00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:20,940
want to have an impact on real people's

00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:23,160
lives and we want to make sure that

00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:25,200
technology gets tested and used and

00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:27,029
actually is doing things for people it

00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,220
isn't just the bleeding we want to be in

00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:31,800
the leading area but not completely

00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:34,709
bleeding and we also would like to you

00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:37,320
know go as far that way into making a

00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:39,810
larger market as we possibly can given

00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:42,390
the limitations of basically being fast

00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:47,490
moving and having limited resources in

00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:49,769
doing what we are so the thing about

00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:51,449
this is that this leading-edge doesn't

00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:53,640
just sit there we can't just say okay

00:14:51,449 --> 00:14:56,520
we've invented fedora and now 14 years

00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:58,620
later we're doing the same thing there

00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,640
are a lot of pressures on this from both

00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:02,200
sides basically pushing in

00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,960
from from that bleeding edge we have

00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,460
things like core OS doing containerized

00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,020
operating systems you even crazier

00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:10,630
things like rancher OS which runs the

00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:12,700
whole operating system in a container we

00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:14,500
have things like raspbian that are

00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:16,390
basically all the IOT innovations

00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:19,780
happening on a different platform from

00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:21,340
fedora on the desktop there's solace

00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:22,960
which is a very popular enthusiast

00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:24,850
desktop there's arch which really does

00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,440
try to stay on the bleeding edge arch

00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:29,170
people are awesome their documentation

00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,790
is wonderful there's a lot of change

00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:32,350
going on and how desktops are put

00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:34,570
together right now we've got flat pack

00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:35,710
and snappy and flat hub and all those

00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:38,170
things and those are pushing the

00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:41,050
innovation curve on things that we need

00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:42,760
to keep up with but that's not the only

00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:45,430
direction that that change is coming

00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:48,250
from so coming in sort of from the early

00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:50,530
adopter side in those side traditionally

00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:52,660
we've been able to in fedora to rely on

00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:55,570
the fact that a lot of people will use

00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:58,750
fedora because our downstreams are too

00:15:55,570 --> 00:16:00,880
slow people who are using rel can't get

00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:02,230
the latest stuff so they finally say ok

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,870
well I'm gonna make the trade-off

00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:06,370
I'll go bleeding edge and take fedora

00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:07,480
stuff because I know it's newer

00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:09,400
even if it doesn't give me all the

00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,470
things I need I just need that newer

00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:15,340
kernel I need that newer GCC I need all

00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:16,840
those things but Red Hat has tried to

00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:18,670
solve that problem for their customers

00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,770
because they need that with things like

00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:22,750
software collections which are basically

00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:25,150
meant to bring newer things in to fedora

00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:27,070
in - in Tyrell so we don't necessarily

00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:29,170
get for free just that just because we

00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,760
have newer things people consider us to

00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:32,290
be innovative so we need to do something

00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:36,640
a little different than just say ok we

00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:39,550
package stuff faster and again along

00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:41,650
those lines in rel 74 that has an

00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:43,510
updated version of genome so a lot of

00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:45,700
people like well I could never run cent

00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:47,230
OS on my desktop I'd never run rel on my

00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:49,870
desktop because the desktop environment

00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:51,190
is just so ancient crufty that's not

00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:52,870
going to necessarily be the case anymore

00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:58,110
so we can't necessarily rely on we just

00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:58,110
have the latest things again so

00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:09,860
basically it feels like we've got this

00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:13,490
big machine that is Fedora that puts

00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:15,620
things together and you know we work on

00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:18,199
this crunch kind of cycle to try and put

00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:20,089
the fedora together and we have this

00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:23,630
idea we've got this big machine of

00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:24,829
fedora that we're working on and so we

00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:26,480
have to figure out how are we going to

00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:27,860
get past this flattening how are we

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,380
going to make sure that Fedora stays

00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:32,960
relevant how we can stay in that early

00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:35,030
adopter innovation niche and how we can

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,770
scale all that up and because taking

00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:40,040
machines I'm just making the machines we

00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:41,480
have bigger and bigger is basically not

00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:44,270
going to get us there because it can

00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,830
scale to a certain amount but just as we

00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:48,560
get bigger and bigger we've got you know

00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:50,270
whatever 17,000 packages in fedora and

00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,880
we're using infrastructure that was

00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:54,350
meant for you know thousands of packages

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,600
and the lower ends of thousands and so

00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:59,000
we have things where like a composed

00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,860
basically putting together a release

00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,179
that can be tested from all the packages

00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:07,640
takes 12 14 16 hours to do as long as

00:18:05,179 --> 00:18:10,610
everything goes right and a lot because

00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:14,030
it's so old and meant for things that

00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:17,330
meant for a smaller set of fedora it

00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:19,670
often breaks so this big machine is not

00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:24,170
really doing what we need anymore

00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:26,300
so basically what we need to do is set

00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:27,890
things on fire in a good way we need

00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:31,760
that this is for Steve Gallagher here

00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:35,030
this slide we need to make friends with

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:37,490
the robots not just because the graphic

00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:39,260
is cute but we really need to find a way

00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:42,020
to automate what we're doing in fedora

00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:45,890
and we need to make big awesome changes

00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:48,230
that will put us into where we need to

00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:50,510
be for the next decade of fedora rather

00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:52,370
than there are some things like someone

00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:53,870
on the develops said why are we doing

00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:55,940
all this blowing things up when we've

00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:58,460
got this basic things we need to do to

00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:01,580
make a rust packaging better now doing

00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:03,410
better rust packaging is awesome but it

00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:05,480
is just baseline in the kind of things

00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:07,280
we need to do we need to really focus on

00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,470
these big changes and the rust packaging

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,970
can wait because actually the rust

00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:13,640
people using rust don't even care that

00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:14,540
we package things so let's focus on

00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,940
stuff that has

00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:18,080
robot size impact rather than the

00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:23,360
incremental changes because it's not

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:25,490
going to get us very far so some of

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,020
those things we've got a couple

00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:29,510
initiatives that have a lot of talks

00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:31,760
here at this conference one of them is

00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:33,380
project atomic and specifically the

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,890
project atomic continuous integration

00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:39,860
initiative so continuous integration is

00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:41,660
a specific kind of testing where instead

00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:43,790
of doing validation testing or in

00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:46,160
addition to validation testing you

00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:48,710
actually test every change as it's made

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,810
in an environment that is like the

00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:52,490
production environment so this is

00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:54,770
something we've never really done in

00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:56,300
Fedora we do a lot of Awesome QA and a

00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:58,220
lot of testing and a lot of people here

00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:00,320
are deeply involved in that but

00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:02,660
generally that testing happens either at

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:05,210
the like I made a package okay the pace

00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:07,580
of basic tests pass in kind of unit

00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:08,960
testing kind of things or at the very

00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,520
end when we put all to get thing

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,140
everything together the big compose a

00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,730
big compose comes out the end and then

00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,870
people pick it up and start looking at

00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:16,730
it to see if it works

00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:19,580
so the idea with continuous integration

00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:21,710
is whenever we make a change to a

00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:23,510
package we automatically get an artifact

00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:26,840
at the end that gets run through robotic

00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:29,000
automatic testing and if your your

00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:30,230
change would break something you get

00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,140
told about it right away

00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:35,420
and in fact we want to get to the point

00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:37,730
where your change is actually rejected

00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:40,250
so if you submit something that now

00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:42,710
Fedora doesn't boot anymore because of

00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:45,290
the thing you did you can't do that

00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:48,020
thing it will say sorry please fix this

00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:49,550
before it gets into fedora so that's

00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:51,320
kind of exciting and that kind of that

00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:52,730
level of automation behind that is

00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:56,090
what's going to let us get to the next

00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:59,090
level of things so this is the way we

00:20:56,090 --> 00:21:00,500
produce Fedora two-week atomic now kind

00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:03,200
of this is actually the plan I put

00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:07,130
together for that from people's ideas

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,360
like two or three years ago now and you

00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:10,580
don't need to pay attention to what it

00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:13,070
actually says the key thing is this was

00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:15,950
a bunch of new components that require a

00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:17,690
lot of manual work to happen and this is

00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:19,580
actually working fairly well although a

00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:21,800
lot of it relies on people actually

00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:23,090
manually pushing buttons moving things

00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,980
around and things like that that it

00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:27,500
should be more automated than it is and

00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:28,190
again this only does validation testing

00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,980
we run it through out

00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:32,659
testing but basically when it's done to

00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:36,230
see if it's okay to release not at the

00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:39,230
development side so here's a new slide

00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:41,809
from Steph this morning which I haven't

00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:43,580
had time to actually digest but this is

00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:44,929
what you should go to his talk on

00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:46,850
Thursday to learn what this actually

00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:48,919
means this is basically where we're

00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:51,799
going with this instead of having

00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:53,149
something that is bolted on the side but

00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:55,809
actually integrated into the environment

00:21:53,149 --> 00:21:58,789
using the factory 2.0 stuff to actually

00:21:55,809 --> 00:22:01,129
and new new pipeline to actually

00:21:58,789 --> 00:22:03,980
automatically test things as changes are

00:22:01,129 --> 00:22:05,480
made and I don't even know why there's a

00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:09,669
ghost on here but it's awesome

00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:11,419
so that again more automation and

00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:12,950
producing things in a way that we

00:22:11,419 --> 00:22:17,240
haven't before that's going to let us

00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:19,610
move this faster and scale up and do a

00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:21,259
lot more things because we're working

00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:26,629
together with the robots rather than

00:22:21,259 --> 00:22:29,389
fighting them so modularity is another

00:22:26,629 --> 00:22:30,970
big thing and this is what I think may

00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:33,379
have tipped over the edge for the

00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:37,419
everything is on fire on tavella list

00:22:33,379 --> 00:22:40,490
modularity is basically an idea for

00:22:37,419 --> 00:22:42,799
taking I kind of like to think it as

00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:44,629
making the comps groups like super comps

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:47,659
groups basically selections of packages

00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:49,370
groups of packages that you can install

00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:50,750
it's not just installed a web server but

00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:53,720
you install the whole environment around

00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:55,700
the web server but with this we can make

00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,169
those artifacts so they can install on

00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,850
different bases and move at different

00:22:57,169 --> 00:23:01,789
speeds so we can say the web server

00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:03,649
comps group it has a patch e 2.4 and

00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:05,840
that will install on whatever version of

00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:07,940
fedora you want to run it along stall on

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,169
CentOS oh don't stall and rel and you

00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:12,710
can have that same version that'll build

00:23:09,169 --> 00:23:13,940
on a lot of different things and this is

00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:15,679
there are a lot of different

00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:17,149
documentation and pictures on modularity

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,669
I think this is one of them one of the

00:23:17,149 --> 00:23:22,309
nicest ones basically again with the

00:23:19,669 --> 00:23:25,159
automation theme you have one module and

00:23:22,309 --> 00:23:26,330
then that can be made by robots to

00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:28,340
deploy in a lot of different

00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:29,720
environments so you don't have to worry

00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,039
about I'm gonna need to make a container

00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,509
version of this I need to make a flat

00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,309
pack version of this we're working on

00:23:32,509 --> 00:23:36,169
infrastructure to automate that part of

00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:38,000
it and also to automate the testing of

00:23:36,169 --> 00:23:40,279
it so that when you make your changes

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,809
you can make your module and then people

00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:45,619
users can deploy that

00:23:41,809 --> 00:23:47,619
in a lot of different ways so I think

00:23:45,619 --> 00:23:50,629
that's very cool

00:23:47,619 --> 00:23:54,259
also related to that this is another

00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:55,999
dinosaur graph this is something that's

00:23:54,259 --> 00:23:58,039
important to stress about the impact of

00:23:55,999 --> 00:24:00,700
fedora so I was saying earlier something

00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:03,710
like you know half a million people

00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:06,469
using fedora something like that that's

00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:08,269
not the limit of our impact so this is

00:24:06,469 --> 00:24:10,969
the Fedora operating system the blue

00:24:08,269 --> 00:24:12,649
line and then Apple the extra packages

00:24:10,969 --> 00:24:14,749
for Enterprise Linux which is you know

00:24:12,649 --> 00:24:16,729
fedora stuff that we've taken and we

00:24:14,749 --> 00:24:19,539
build it so that it'll run on rel and

00:24:16,729 --> 00:24:22,219
CentOS and scientific Linux and so on

00:24:19,539 --> 00:24:24,440
about you know five years ago that

00:24:22,219 --> 00:24:26,179
excited exceeding the fedora base

00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:29,719
operating system in popularity and then

00:24:26,179 --> 00:24:31,009
oh that's has basically gone off the

00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:32,719
charts I don't know what's happening at

00:24:31,009 --> 00:24:33,979
the top we'll call those dinosaurs with

00:24:32,719 --> 00:24:36,409
that bump bouncing up there but

00:24:33,979 --> 00:24:38,210
basically this has gone off the charts

00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:40,309
in growth and continues to go that way

00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:42,710
so this is another area where fedora as

00:24:40,309 --> 00:24:44,359
a project has a gigantic impact that is

00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:46,999
outsized from the people who are running

00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:48,589
Fedora as the base operating system so

00:24:46,999 --> 00:24:51,320
this is one of the things where I think

00:24:48,589 --> 00:24:53,749
modularity has a big ability to make a

00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:55,940
lot more impact because right now

00:24:53,749 --> 00:24:58,190
these packages are done by a manual

00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:59,629
process where somebody says ok I'm going

00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:01,849
to decide to make my package available

00:24:59,629 --> 00:25:04,009
for Apple and then I'm gonna commit to

00:25:01,849 --> 00:25:07,309
maintaining it for 10 years and all this

00:25:04,009 --> 00:25:09,440
kind of thing and it's again very

00:25:07,309 --> 00:25:11,509
popular but it's kind of ragged and is

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,729
not as great as it could be I think with

00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:16,070
modularity we have the ability to make

00:25:13,729 --> 00:25:18,769
packages available to this market that

00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:20,839
really really wants them in a way that's

00:25:18,769 --> 00:25:22,879
a lot less work for us we can offer them

00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:25,099
on different life cycles we can say yeah

00:25:22,879 --> 00:25:26,929
you can run this on Apple but I'm not

00:25:25,099 --> 00:25:29,479
promising to maintain this for 10 years

00:25:26,929 --> 00:25:30,979
because that's crazy I'm a volunteer I'm

00:25:29,479 --> 00:25:32,749
not going to maintain the same thing for

00:25:30,979 --> 00:25:34,879
10 years but I can you know keep this up

00:25:32,749 --> 00:25:36,859
as I'm doing Fedora updates and you can

00:25:34,879 --> 00:25:38,899
keep running it on your CentOS space so

00:25:36,859 --> 00:25:41,149
you can have the thing you want to move

00:25:38,899 --> 00:25:43,820
fast moving at the speed you want to

00:25:41,149 --> 00:25:45,379
move it at even if you have a stable

00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:49,099
base and so that's a way that we as

00:25:45,379 --> 00:25:51,739
Fedora have a big impact beyond just the

00:25:49,099 --> 00:25:54,649
fedora based operating system and it's

00:25:51,739 --> 00:25:55,820
also really worth noting that it's not

00:25:54,649 --> 00:25:57,500
just these extra package

00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:59,750
is that our impact from fedora but

00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:01,670
actually CentOS itself and rel itself

00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:04,100
comes from fedora and comes from our

00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:06,710
work so even if we have a small number

00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:09,980
of individual users our impact is

00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:11,390
outsized to that so that is also

00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:14,510
something good and something to be proud

00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:17,210
of but I still think that we also want

00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:20,960
to keep growing the base fedora as it is

00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:21,380
in order to really fulfill what our

00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:26,390
mission is

00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:29,030
I switching tack a little bit this is a

00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:30,970
blog post I wrote a couple weeks ago or

00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:33,530
week ago did anybody read this blog post

00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:34,790
all right like four people read this

00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:36,650
blog post thank you

00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:39,230
I would like more people to read this

00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:40,730
blog post so this isn't about making the

00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:43,220
operating system itself this is about

00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:46,490
what we do as a community to bring the

00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:48,230
operating system to users so we have an

00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:49,790
organization as part of fedora called

00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:52,160
the fedora ambassadors how many people

00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:54,200
here are for our ambassadors alright a

00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:56,420
lot more people than read this post

00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:59,090
please go I posted it to the fedora

00:26:56,420 --> 00:27:01,460
investors mailing list and it is on the

00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:03,280
community blog basically this is a

00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:05,690
proposal for what we should do with

00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:08,150
basically our strategy for spending

00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:11,150
fedora money and our effort in in the

00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:11,960
ambassadors to basically show fedora to

00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:15,380
the world

00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:17,540
and traditionally ambassadors have done

00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:19,370
a lot of things like going to Linux cons

00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:21,650
and Linux shows and setting up tables

00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:24,830
and talking to people about fedora which

00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:27,440
is good and going to Linux users groups

00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:29,900
and those kind of things but the impact

00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:33,470
of that kind of thing is not really

00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:35,630
gigantic because people people at in

00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:37,400
analytics con basically know what fedora

00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:39,950
is and a lot of people if you go to a

00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:42,380
like a local Linux fest like you will

00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:44,930
talk to people who are like you know I'm

00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:46,640
a linux mint for life person and I'm

00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:48,500
talking the conversation with them like

00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,540
maybe you could persuade them to choose

00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:53,330
fedora but it's not really having a

00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:55,010
gigantic impact on things so we've been

00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:56,600
saying for a while at the fedora council

00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:58,580
and leadership levels we'd like the

00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,290
ambassadors to focus on other things

00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:03,980
that can maybe bring in new users and

00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:05,150
focus on things that are going to kind

00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:07,580
of make a difference for the future of

00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:09,120
fedora and the ambassadors who come back

00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:10,980
to us and said

00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:14,460
okay that sounds good but we don't know

00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:16,620
it specifically that means so I have I

00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:18,270
called it a modest proposal but Brian

00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:21,090
told me I should not refer to eating

00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:25,020
babies as my suggestion so I have a

00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:26,760
regular proposal that for the basically

00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:29,010
the future when we want to spend

00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:30,900
ambassador money on events we should

00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:32,430
pick things that are directly connected

00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:36,090
to something is called a fedora

00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:38,160
objective so right now a modularity and

00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:40,050
this atomic CI thing are two of our

00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,520
objectives this is part of our Fedora

00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:42,750
leadership structure in the Thoreau

00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,360
Council that's why I've got the round

00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:47,040
table picture here the fedora council

00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,050
has a mix of people like me who are

00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,700
hired to work full-time on it and people

00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:51,990
who are appointed by different

00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:54,960
committees and people who are elected

00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:57,090
and in addition to that we have these

00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,460
objective leads who are people who have

00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:01,170
we select something that is proposed to

00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:02,820
us as important modularity and the

00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:04,770
atomic sea I came to this in this way

00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:07,140
and we said okay this is something that

00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:08,640
is important the future of fedora and

00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:11,190
that person gets a seat on the council

00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,360
and has we can basically send the

00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:14,490
message this is something that came

00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:17,610
actually from flock when we were in

00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:19,590
Prague there was kind of a yeah the

00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:21,570
Fedora Board says we want to do things

00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:23,400
but nobody kind of feels like that's an

00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:24,900
official statement so we wanted to make

00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,820
sure that like when we have something

00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:28,500
that we select as an objective we

00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:30,090
empower the people who are working on it

00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,950
to be at the highest you know levels of

00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:33,630
fedora leadership and can kind of have a

00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:36,540
voice for that kind of thing so we've

00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:37,980
got these objectives so my proposal

00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,910
coming back around to what I was talking

00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:41,970
about five minutes ago

00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:43,800
my proposal is we should do things for

00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:45,570
the ambassadors that directly support

00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,580
those objectives so when we have

00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:49,650
something you know that is automation

00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:51,630
related we should go to automation

00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:53,580
conferences we should talk to those kind

00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:55,710
of things we should talk about when we

00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:57,270
have mud we have modularity as an

00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:58,770
objective and we want to you know sell

00:29:57,270 --> 00:30:00,360
that to people who are using slow moving

00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:02,700
distributions we should go to where

00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:05,790
those people are and talk to them and

00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:07,920
then also as part of this we have the

00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:09,420
Fedora editions we have a workstation

00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:11,820
which is aimed at software developers

00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:13,740
we've got fedora server we've got fedora

00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:15,750
tonic this container thing we should go

00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:17,760
to the audience's each of those has an

00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:19,770
identified specific audience and some

00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,300
user personas that are identified we

00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:22,950
should go to the conferences where those

00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:24,779
peoples are people are we should go

00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:26,789
developer conferences rather than Linux

00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:28,230
conferences and talk to be a little out

00:30:26,789 --> 00:30:31,019
why they should use fedora so I think

00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:33,090
that we should focus ambassador money on

00:30:31,019 --> 00:30:34,500
those kind of things I would really

00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:36,149
encourage you to read this post because

00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,610
I put a lot a lot of time into writing

00:30:36,149 --> 00:30:41,190
it we're gonna have a conversation this

00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:43,679
afternoon about the budget I will be

00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:45,450
there and I can basically rehash

00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,919
everything I said out loud for people

00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:50,639
who don't have the attention span for

00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:53,850
reading which is fine sometimes I'm that

00:30:50,639 --> 00:30:54,870
way as well and yeah so I think this is

00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:58,669
gonna be an important thing for

00:30:54,870 --> 00:31:00,539
basically fedora spending in the future

00:30:58,669 --> 00:31:07,710
now I've been talking a lot need a

00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:10,799
glassblower here's my basic recap we've

00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:14,190
had a lot of growth but now things are

00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:15,990
flattening off we really need to live in

00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:17,760
that innovation space and we need to do

00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:20,490
the things that make sure that we live

00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:22,590
there even if it feels like it's

00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:24,960
uncomfortable like we things were going

00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:27,120
well why are we lighting on fire when

00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,649
things are going well and that you know

00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,389
that's the time we should light a fire

00:31:28,649 --> 00:31:32,279
because we need to keep living there if

00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:34,350
we start feeling like oh this is a

00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:36,539
comfortable easy thing to be doing we're

00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:38,399
not really doing what we set out to do

00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:40,980
properly so yeah let's light something

00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:43,139
on fire all right

00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:46,289
I showed dinosaurs for the mirror stats

00:31:43,139 --> 00:31:48,149
I have a piece of Swiss cheese here

00:31:46,289 --> 00:31:50,159
because my next stats are about fedora

00:31:48,149 --> 00:31:53,130
contributors and I've gotten these stats

00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:56,429
from Fed message fed message is a data

00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:58,559
bus that basically when you do certain

00:31:56,429 --> 00:32:00,960
activities in Fedora a message goes

00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:02,460
across this bus and robots or humans can

00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,830
react and do things if you've gotten

00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:06,809
fedora badges ever most of those badges

00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:08,639
come from your activity on the Fedora

00:32:06,809 --> 00:32:10,139
bus that's how the badges system knows

00:32:08,639 --> 00:32:14,039
hey yeah this person should be awarded

00:32:10,139 --> 00:32:15,870
this little virtual bling so anyways

00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:18,419
I've mined this for some contributor

00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:20,760
stat so this covers if you've edited the

00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:22,980
wiki it's counted here if you've made a

00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:25,289
package change if you've submitted

00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:27,510
updates of feedback update and Bodhi

00:32:25,289 --> 00:32:29,130
that's counted here and then also if

00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:30,990
you're hanging out on IRC and give

00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:34,230
somebody a cookie that's username plus

00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:35,460
plus I count you as active here so this

00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:36,310
is how I kind of counted this is our

00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:38,470
people active

00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:40,770
in fedora so I called this Swiss cheese

00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:43,450
because there's a lot of holes in this

00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:45,790
translations aren't counted organizing

00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:47,650
flock isn't counted all that ambassador

00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:50,200
effort other than editing wiki pages

00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:53,200
isn't really counted writing for Fedora

00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:54,880
magazine like just so much stuff is not

00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:58,450
encountered in the things I'm about to

00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,980
show so here however is that graph so

00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:05,110
this basically is good data going back

00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:07,120
to 2015 and so I there's there's some

00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:08,770
noise in here obviously but basically

00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:11,050
this is per week the number of people

00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:13,510
who have showed up and the blue line at

00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:15,730
the top is people who anybody who's

00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:18,190
anybody whose username I see regardless

00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:20,590
of the amount of activity that week the

00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:23,650
people and the solid colors I only count

00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:25,120
if that person has also been seen 13

00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:27,100
other weeks throughout the year so

00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:29,080
basically if you if for the last year a

00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:31,000
quarter of the weeks you've been active

00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:33,520
I count it there so you can see there

00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,560
there's you know basically froth at the

00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,970
top of people who are dropping in and

00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,680
some of those people may be actually you

00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:41,980
know every year they show up and make a

00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:44,020
big big contribution a one one week it

00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:47,680
could be that but a lot of it just kind

00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:49,720
of drive-by kind of things but anyways

00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:51,160
the red at the bottom and I didn't

00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,720
actually mean this to look evil but

00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:54,670
that's you know it's not it's not bad

00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,590
that's our old-school contributor is

00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:59,170
basically that's people who've been seen

00:33:56,590 --> 00:34:01,210
at that week they've been active for at

00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:03,430
least two years before that data point

00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:06,250
so you can see that we've got a pretty

00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:10,030
good consistent base of around 225

00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:11,440
people every week who are also showing

00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:13,450
up throughout the year to work on Fedora

00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,340
so that's pretty huge that's a large

00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:16,780
number of people and the other thing I

00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:18,700
think is nice as we see that the

00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:20,560
intermediate and the new users the green

00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:22,480
is people who have been active their

00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,010
first act of just this year but again

00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,750
they've been active for at least 13

00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:27,910
weeks in this year so we can see that

00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:29,740
even over the past two years we do have

00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:31,810
a pretty good influx of new contributors

00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:33,700
and those new contributors flow into

00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:35,920
being intermediate contributors and we

00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:38,860
don't have a trickling away of people

00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:40,660
it's not going down there's a lot more

00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:42,580
data analysis I could do on this and I

00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:45,040
probably will in the future like you

00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:48,250
know how we're too old people go how

00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:50,050
long do they stay that kind of thing by

00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:51,760
old people I didn't didn't

00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:56,650
mean anything dan dan wall she was

00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:59,500
offended last time yeah I I'm counting

00:34:56,650 --> 00:35:01,180
myself as an old person here too I the

00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:03,160
dips here by the way our Christmas

00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:04,870
vacation I think that's awesome

00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:06,520
you can it also starts here at the

00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:08,800
beginning as well every year um

00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:10,630
Red Hat goes on vacation everybody else

00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,070
goes away some of the baseline stuff

00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:14,080
still keeps going a lot of people are

00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:15,580
still involved you know like 150 people

00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:18,760
still doing something over Christmas

00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:20,290
break but there's a clear dip when it's

00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:22,090
the holiday is there that I think is

00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:25,360
kind of fun that's that's not a data

00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:28,690
dinosaur that's that's real in that job

00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:30,220
I would though like to see this graph

00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:31,840
going up as well I don't think we need

00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:33,580
exponential growth and the number of

00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:35,980
contributors we probably can't handle

00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:38,230
that having a solid base is good but I

00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:40,210
would like to see a year or a year you

00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:41,890
know upward slant to this and this is

00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:43,690
something again that ambassadors is

00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:45,340
something I would like to help work on

00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:47,020
bringing in new contributors and all of

00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:51,220
us you know working how can we bring new

00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:55,000
people into Fedora why is my next slide

00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:56,170
blank I don't know that's awesome this

00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,810
is actually the end of my presentation

00:35:56,170 --> 00:36:01,180
so it's okay that my slide is blank but

00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:02,710
I had another recap slide here putting

00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:05,920
everything together but I can go back to

00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:07,960
my other recap basically everything is

00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,630
on fire yeah that's probably how things

00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:12,280
should be I know somebody's feels like

00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:13,420
everything is on fire not in a good way

00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,460
and we really want to make sure

00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:17,650
everything is on fire in a good way

00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:19,720
here we are at flock this is supposed to

00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:22,570
be a do session where we try and

00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:24,160
actually hack on things where this year

00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:26,200
we're really emphasized actually they're

00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:28,240
actually working rather than just talks

00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,920
so let's find some of those things I

00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,720
feel like they're on fire in a bad way

00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,280
and figure out how we can make them be

00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:35,800
on fire in a good way because we don't

00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,630
want the fire to you know caused things

00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,490
to go the wrong direction we want the

00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:41,770
fire to be propelling us rocket ship

00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:44,050
robot rocket ship like into the future

00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:45,610
so let's figure out where those problems

00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:47,740
are and make sure we get those solved

00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:49,900
and let's figure out what kind of

00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:52,630
awesome automation things we can do to

00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:56,080
make next generation of fedora be more

00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:58,230
awesome and continue growing and there

00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,230
we are

00:37:02,589 --> 00:37:10,390
the next missing slide says does anybody

00:37:05,329 --> 00:37:10,390
have any questions so yeah

00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:34,100
yeah we went right to a hardcore

00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:38,090
technical question awesome yeah I will

00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:40,070
repeat it the question was so we have

00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:43,160
got a lot of metadata involved in

00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:45,140
updates and that is basically when every

00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:47,180
time you want to do like DNF update or

00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:49,130
go to the software center to update your

00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:51,350
system there's a bunch of stuff in the

00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:53,000
background the metadata that tilton

00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:55,490
describes all of the packages and all

00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:58,400
the app updates available and that is a

00:37:55,490 --> 00:38:01,340
gigantic blob of hundreds of megabytes

00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:04,040
of data and as Fedora grows that grows

00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:06,650
more as we add modularity modularity has

00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:08,119
its own metadata and it gets to the

00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:10,070
point where if you have a small

00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:13,460
container that's maybe you know just

00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:16,250
runs a web server or whatever your

00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:18,680
metadata for package updates is way

00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:20,330
bigger than the container itself like an

00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:23,420
order of magnitude bigger than the

00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:25,460
container and that is ridiculous that is

00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:27,050
a good question I don't know what we're

00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:29,990
doing about that that would be something

00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:31,310
to talk to you about the DNF team about

00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:33,980
that because I think we need a solution

00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:43,700
a different problem ok different problem

00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:54,700
right oh and my chart ok sorry not that

00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:54,700
at all ok yeah right

00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:03,640
okay yeah so okay well let me redo the

00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:05,230
reset I misunderstood the question

00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:07,510
although this is something I'm concerned

00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:09,220
about as well this is basically if

00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:11,230
people are using containers now they

00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:13,450
have on their system like five different

00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:15,310
containers each of which is a separate

00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:16,990
like little kind of mini virtual machine

00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:18,970
doesn't that inflate the count

00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:21,220
the answer is since that's coming from

00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:23,290
the same ip address to the mirrors

00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:25,810
it only gets counted once just like if

00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:27,820
you do DNF update 17 times on your

00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:30,430
system it only gets counted once so

00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:33,400
that's at least smooth it out in there

00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:35,170
on the other hand maybe we should count

00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:37,690
like look at this all this container

00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:47,680
usage is going up we're not really

00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:50,050
measuring that very well switch right

00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:52,050
there's some stuff we can do we would

00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:54,040
like to see in DNF to help us

00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:56,080
distinguish between running in a

00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,490
container running Fedora workstation

00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,800
running for our server those kind of

00:39:57,490 --> 00:40:01,330
things

00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,040
DNF people here will corner them and

00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:14,040
talk to them about that later

00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:14,040
other questions yeah mo what maybe

00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:29,260
can I go back to a certain graph this

00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:29,260
one the this one yeah yeah

00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:40,130
fed up yeah so that was Fedora 21 or 22

00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:47,450
so somewhere in the middle of the green

00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:49,490
yeah yeah yeah so right we have made

00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:51,770
right we have made the upgrade process

00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:53,690
go a lot easier recently which is

00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:56,210
awesome and so that definitely

00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:57,620
contributes to more people being on the

00:40:56,210 --> 00:41:01,070
most recent and releases rather than

00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:03,200
hanging out on older releases yeah right

00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:04,820
so that actually this this graph which

00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,320
hasn't broken down individually there

00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:08,420
yeah that kind of shows like that's why

00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:10,730
the uptake curve for each one is faster

00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:15,650
now than they used to be you might even

00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:18,080
be able to see that like I think the the

00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:21,290
blue curve here f21 is before that and I

00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:23,600
think f-22 is the first one with it so

00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:28,610
blue 2 you can see the uptake going more

00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:31,790
smoothly there okay yeah right yeah yeah

00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:33,200
so updates faster updates are a lot

00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:35,840
because people have worked and made

00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,920
updates more awesome so that is good and

00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,870
that's oh that yeah that definitely

00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:41,540
influences these how popular each new

00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:47,420
release is but again but the overall

00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:49,970
total in this graph here you know it's

00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:51,530
like this is a stacked graph so older

00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:53,980
releases and newer releases all pile on

00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:53,980
there

00:42:02,589 --> 00:42:10,430
right yeah yeah the theory is that good

00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,230
upgrades make it easier to say okay I'll

00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:14,539
just stay the new the new fedora rather

00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:16,520
than saying oh I have to replace this

00:42:14,539 --> 00:42:18,380
why don't I replace this with new shiny

00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:20,450
distro instead of fedora so yeah I agree

00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:23,349
the upgrade work has been really

00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:31,430
valuable in making fedora more sticky

00:42:23,349 --> 00:42:35,960
other questions yeah a world map of

00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:37,670
users yeah no we do not have a world map

00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:40,970
of users and actually that is another

00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:43,730
dinosaur in this data because this sort

00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:45,890
of data basically assumes that people

00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:47,539
are on the internet with reliable

00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:50,059
connections and checking in every day

00:42:47,539 --> 00:42:51,559
and people in a lot of places in the

00:42:50,059 --> 00:42:53,089
world cannot count on that

00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:55,640
so plate parts of the world which are

00:42:53,089 --> 00:42:58,069
underrepresented in you know always on

00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:59,900
low-cost broadband internet are

00:42:58,069 --> 00:43:01,910
underrepresented in our data so there

00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:05,029
may be a lot of fedora users there that

00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:07,400
are not very well counted as well and I

00:43:05,029 --> 00:43:09,619
sort of for that same reason using this

00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,970
to put together a world map of fedora it

00:43:09,619 --> 00:43:13,910
doesn't give our very representative

00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:16,940
world map I think we did a little work

00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:19,400
on that but it it didn't seem to be

00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:23,089
showing us very much so we definitely

00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:24,319
know from you know the people we see and

00:43:23,089 --> 00:43:25,849
the discussions we have that there are

00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:29,410
people using fedora all around the world

00:43:25,849 --> 00:43:29,410
but I don't have good numbers on that

00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:36,490
next

00:43:33,309 --> 00:43:36,490
Smoochum or

00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:51,319
Yeah right right

00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:04,740
yeah you see I made Fedora eight be a

00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:08,099
separate color on this graph it's the

00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:11,640
light blue because I I still if you

00:44:08,099 --> 00:44:14,130
search for Fedora on Amazon ec2 Fedora

00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:16,619
eight image still comes up first so

00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:18,510
that's some some reason there still some

00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:20,520
Fedora eight hanging on but it's also

00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:24,540
also a mystery yeah so the basic

00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:27,750
question was if we are if our space is

00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:29,490
this space here is is that Pluto a

00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:33,480
natural plateau and the limit of

00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:35,040
basically what we can achieve I think

00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:37,710
that the numbers we're seeing are too

00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:40,650
low for that I think that we've got a

00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:42,150
we've got a much bigger addressable

00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:56,160
market than we're we're handling

00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:57,690
basically right so one issue is we're an

00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:00,180
operating system innovator not an

00:44:57,690 --> 00:45:01,859
applications innovator the number of

00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:05,430
people who care about operating systems

00:45:01,859 --> 00:45:07,470
for their own sake you know some of the

00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:19,190
people in this room are in that set but

00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:19,190
it is a exclusive club right

00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:27,020
yeah right so the it does like we can't

00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:30,740
grow forever there's not exponential

00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:32,480
growth forever I think that the numbers

00:45:30,740 --> 00:46:10,460
we're seeing right now are slower than

00:45:32,480 --> 00:46:12,950
they could be right right yeah so the

00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:14,630
comment is the way we do Fedora with

00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:16,850
everything moving quickly with that huge

00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:19,940
metadata I talked about with a lot of

00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:21,680
high rate of change that basically

00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:24,230
excludes a lot of people who do have

00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:27,020
poor internet connectivity so that's

00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:29,930
kind of a something that we can address

00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:30,950
and I think that again with our mission

00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:34,700
refinement

00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:38,800
there are definitely room for parts of

00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:41,570
Fedora like a fedora spin or a fedora a

00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:44,120
version of Fedora which is more tailored

00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:46,100
at those kind of things I think there's

00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:50,000
room for that

00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:51,860
I think also some of the stuff we're

00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,600
doing like batching updates and things

00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:54,920
like that we're going to address that a

00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:58,810
little bit more hopefully but some of

00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:58,810
the modularity stuff will help Steve

00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:39,200
right yeah yeah so the question was

00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:41,750
basically is that strategic should we

00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:43,130
care I'm making that more cruel than it

00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:44,329
was but like that's basically the idea

00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:45,769
is this something they should focus on

00:47:44,329 --> 00:47:48,910
and I'm going to go back to my blogpost

00:47:45,769 --> 00:47:52,039
about objectives for this because again

00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:53,990
the the point of the objectives is for

00:47:52,039 --> 00:47:55,700
us collectively and on the council to

00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:57,559
talk together about things that we do

00:47:55,700 --> 00:48:00,710
think are going to advance fedora and

00:47:57,559 --> 00:48:02,539
make Fedora grow and we've got room

00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:04,519
basically Byard the Charter to have

00:48:02,539 --> 00:48:07,010
between two and four of those we've got

00:48:04,519 --> 00:48:09,589
two right now so there's room for more

00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:11,990
and basically if you are somebody who

00:48:09,589 --> 00:48:14,480
thinks this is an area where fedora

00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:16,400
really could grow put together that

00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,809
argument bring it to the council and we

00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:20,180
will talk about it and take it seriously

00:48:17,809 --> 00:48:22,069
and I know people have been kicking

00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:24,710
around the idea of university students

00:48:22,069 --> 00:48:27,230
we should maybe that's a area we should

00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:28,940
grow the way to do this is to put

00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:30,650
together an objective proposal and then

00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:36,769
that will know that that is something

00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:39,349
that we could focus on right yeah right

00:48:36,769 --> 00:48:44,029
so what about the reverse if it's not an

00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:45,829
objective do we not do it we this is a

00:48:44,029 --> 00:48:48,019
volunteer community people are going to

00:48:45,829 --> 00:48:49,160
do what they want to do and should do

00:48:48,019 --> 00:48:50,359
what they want to do and do what you're

00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:52,460
interested in if there's something you

00:48:50,359 --> 00:49:01,940
think is important awesome you should do

00:48:52,460 --> 00:49:03,799
that yeah yeah right yeah right but I

00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:06,079
think it's yeah so I I do want to take

00:49:03,799 --> 00:49:07,670
it to that if this is something that is

00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:10,910
you know in conflict to one of our

00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:12,740
objectives if we if we would say we have

00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:14,809
an objective or in the next 18 months to

00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:16,849
really make Fedora appeal to low

00:49:14,809 --> 00:49:19,759
bandwidth users and somebody has a

00:49:16,849 --> 00:49:23,029
change which you know destroys Delta

00:49:19,759 --> 00:49:25,490
rpms or something like that we would we

00:49:23,029 --> 00:49:27,140
would prioritize fixing that and say you

00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:28,580
know this is we can't we can

00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:31,190
do that right now this is the objective

00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:33,410
we're focusing on and again this is all

00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:34,850
you are saying with the spending if it

00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:36,890
is something that we've identified as an

00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:38,870
objective we should spend money on it if

00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:40,640
it's not something we've identified it

00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:42,200
as an objective when we go to you know

00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:44,420
do the ambassador budget and things we

00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:46,790
should say okay that sounds important

00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:48,620
but we don't have money for that right

00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:51,890
now because we're focusing on these

00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:54,830
other things so yeah it does mean if

00:49:51,890 --> 00:49:58,570
focus naturally means there are things

00:49:54,830 --> 00:50:04,430
are outside of the focus which don't get

00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:12,860
things that big one yamo okay more

00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:15,170
statistics questions yeah so the

00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:17,510
question is we don't have I didn't do a

00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:19,400
breakdown of Fedora Editions and spins

00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:23,510
and those kind of things do I have an

00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:25,970
idea of that we do not have a super good

00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:28,160
idea of that again because the metadata

00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:29,420
like the data we get doesn't distinguish

00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:32,000
between those kind of things we have a

00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:34,550
long-standing request for a DNF to

00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:37,910
include some basic information like that

00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:40,220
which would make it very helpful I think

00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:42,440
that the best we have is kind of

00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:44,090
interest in the download pages the web

00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:46,490
page is like which part you know people

00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:48,920
look at me they'll get Workstation

00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:51,380
versus get server kind of things and I

00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:54,830
from that I kind of get the sense that

00:50:51,380 --> 00:51:00,380
it's somewhere around 80% desktop and

00:50:54,830 --> 00:51:01,970
20% server and atomic with the fedora

00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:04,850
workstation genome has been being the

00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:08,330
lion's share and the other spins being

00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:10,220
somewhere around 10 percent but I again

00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:15,410
we don't really have solid numbers on

00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:17,360
that so that's right yeah so great and

00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:19,070
that's yeah and some of the stuff like a

00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:22,370
you know I know that a very large

00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:24,470
company is using atomic for something in

00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:27,410
production that is pretty awesome and

00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:29,120
they've got a large scale deployment of

00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:30,980
it and that doesn't show up in our

00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:33,290
numbers for atomic at all which seemed

00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:35,120
to be very low so some of the stuff

00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:38,410
doesn't get counted very well so yeah I

00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:38,410
wish I knew more but I don't

00:51:40,150 --> 00:52:07,380
more questions yeah yeah yes yes there

00:51:57,370 --> 00:52:15,580
are it wasn't really a question yeah

00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:18,390
yeah yeah a lot of people the question

00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:21,730
is a lot of people are on old releases

00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:25,000
what should we do about that

00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:26,620
I don't know I try and gently encourage

00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,690
people to upgrade I think the work we

00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:30,940
put into making upgrades easy and kinome

00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:32,980
software or fed up the DNF system

00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:35,950
upgrade really helped because it's not

00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:38,890
such a scary thing to upgrade and

00:52:35,950 --> 00:52:40,930
actually I don't have it charted here

00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:44,380
but if you look at current releases over

00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:46,900
time more and more people are on the

00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:48,970
newer releases so actually right now a

00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:51,640
majority of people are on supported

00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:53,740
releases and that wasn't the case say

00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:55,620
four years ago four years ago a majority

00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:58,630
of Fedora users were on old releases

00:52:55,620 --> 00:53:00,490
which is kind of a sad state but now

00:52:58,630 --> 00:53:06,070
it's not just a majority it's a pretty

00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:08,260
solid majority but yeah it'd be nice to

00:53:06,070 --> 00:53:09,760
do more about that but I don't know what

00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:19,480
more we can do other than making

00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:20,890
upgrades easier Yeah right I we did that

00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,610
there is a package which isn't isn't

00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:23,590
there anymore

00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:26,110
but we had four all called system auto

00:53:23,590 --> 00:53:27,910
death which would disconnect your system

00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:30,520
from the network after the release was

00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:32,980
not no longer supported that actually

00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:34,510
wrote for use at universities because we

00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:35,710
had a lot of people installing systems

00:53:34,510 --> 00:53:37,810
and then ever updating them and then

00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:39,850
they were security problems later I

00:53:37,810 --> 00:53:42,430
stopped maintaining that because I kept

00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:43,870
getting angry people saying I installed

00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:50,470
your package and now my system doesn't

00:53:43,870 --> 00:53:56,740
work well yeah it's probably not the

00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:59,140
best general approach anything else okay

00:53:56,740 --> 00:54:01,150
so we're gonna do a little bit of a

00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:07,090
break do you want to come back up and do

00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:08,860
logistics talks stuff Brian them 15

00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:16,650
minutes for everybody in this room to go

00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:16,650
