Title: Flock 2017 - Get Together with Local Fedorans: A UX Design Case
Publication date: 2017-11-20
Playlist: Flock 2017
Description: 
	Tuesday August 29, 2017 2:00pm - 2:30pm @Grand I Suzanne Hillman (with Mo Duffy) will explain and summarize the user experience work around the social aspect of Fedora Hubs (part of a completed Outreachy internship.) Regional Hubs is a planned future feature of Fedora Hubs meant to help co-located Fedora community members to find each other and set up local events and meetings - a tool that would help power Fedora Ambassador efforts. We will talk about the design processes we used, what we learned, the designs, and our future roadmap for the feature. This talk is a great case study for anyone trying to understand the UX design process from an inkling of a feature idea, to competitive analysis, to user research / interviews, to iterative design using mockups and remote prototype testing. The design process outlined in this talk can easily be applied to any Fedora projects looking to improve user experience.

cool thank you I will now set press play

00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:13,320
excellent hello my tiny crowd in a huge

00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:15,960
room thank you for coming my name is

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,699
Suzanne Hillman Moe is mostly here for

00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,990
moral support but she also will be able

00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:22,830
to answer questions that maybe I won't

00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:27,630
be able to answer this talk is about the

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:30,029
original fedora hubs piece of the fedora

00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,300
hubs project that you may have already

00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:38,309
seen presentations on earlier in the

00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:41,610
conference I did the UX for most of the

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:45,360
process as part of outreach II with Moe

00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:48,809
as my mentor and I am NOT going to go to

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,899
the overview so the override overall

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:52,789
idea of this talk is all right we have

00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:54,960
to start out with some information

00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:56,370
otherwise you basically can't do

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,750
anything but then from there you've got

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,870
to figure out what else do we need to

00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,980
know and how do we figure that out so in

00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,809
this case we're going to find out what

00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,330
do we know in terms of the background of

00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:08,460
the project of the context of the

00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:13,880
constraints things like that and what

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:16,890
are the goals of this project of this UX

00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:19,500
design process if you don't have any

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,479
goals you're not gonna get anywhere even

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,590
if you start doing research you're not

00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:25,200
gonna know how to interpret it so you

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,600
gotta have goals the next thing was okay

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,180
what do we need to learn in order to get

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,240
further with this process what do people

00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,530
already do whether there's somebody in

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,509
the community that we have whether

00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,509
they're our competitors I think my

00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:40,619
entire slide is not actually visible

00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:42,689
maybe I'm missing I think something is

00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:45,299
missing but what's that's fine anyway so

00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:47,850
what are they what do they do we need to

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:50,250
know that so we know what kinds of

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:51,780
things we can do to make things easier

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,240
what kind of things are already being

00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,460
done that might be useful that might be

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,719
really terrible ideas that's the kind of

00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,240
thing you want to figure out in this

00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:03,630
section and then once you've got a bunch

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,729
of information what do you do with it so

00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:08,280
you've got to figure out how to

00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:09,690
summarize it how to understand what it

00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,150
means and generally you want to have

00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,230
somebody else to bounce ideas off of to

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,420
discuss it so that you

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:17,430
got multiple perspectives sorry

00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,519
microphone multiple perspectives on the

00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:21,959
idea as you have more ideas and more

00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:23,970
thoughts on the process trying to do a

00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:26,280
UX alone is generally a terrible idea

00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:28,290
it's really hard to do and in most cases

00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,970
you don't have enough information so

00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,739
that's kind of what the analysis part is

00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:34,650
I think the part that I can't currently

00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:36,390
see for some reason is the okay what do

00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,870
you do with the information you you you

00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:42,120
have analyzed what do you do now and in

00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:44,790
general what that means is all right I

00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,799
know that we want to go into this

00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:49,230
particular subsection of what it is we

00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:52,019
figured out and with that information

00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:54,420
start making some sample beginning

00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:56,010
designs have some feedback on most

00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,530
designs whether it's from somebody else

00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:00,239
in your UX group whether it's developers

00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,640
you talk to or eventually with a usage

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,500
usability testing with your actual users

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,989
so that's the kind of stuff you end up

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,250
doing and then I'm gonna be saying you

00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:09,629
can ask questions things like that I'm

00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,910
not sure why this slide is missing part

00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:15,030
of itself but that's fine so the next

00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:18,109
thing I want to talk about is the

00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:20,430
general idea of how the UX process works

00:03:18,109 --> 00:03:21,660
so as I was sort of saying earlier

00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,459
you've got a lot of research you've got

00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,200
a lot of research to figure out what are

00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:27,870
you starting out with what do you know

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,400
now you've got to research what people

00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,380
are doing that you may not already know

00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,200
and then you've got to figure out what

00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:35,579
the information you get means now you

00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,349
might find that when you're now

00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:39,209
analyzing your data if you have more

00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:41,280
time you say wait this seems a little

00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:42,900
weird or confusing maybe I should go

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,269
back and do a little more research which

00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:48,540
is why it's a two-way street similarly

00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:49,829
you might say okay my analysis says this

00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,799
is the best way to go with my design

00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:54,120
great let's go make some designs

00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:55,680
something seems a little off here maybe

00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,480
we need to look a little closer and find

00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,239
other things you don't know yet so it's

00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,430
always gonna be in this circle you tend

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,410
to do research and analysis design but

00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:06,120
you might jump around like once you've

00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:08,700
got a design you might say great this is

00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,829
our first first iteration or we're gonna

00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,660
publish this and then you're gonna have

00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:15,060
people say hey this this is hard or this

00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:16,769
is really cool or this is missing if

00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,180
it's gone into production and you

00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:19,949
haven't done there haven't found that in

00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,479
testing then you're like okay more

00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:24,690
research is needed so you got to do all

00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:26,880
those things as part of your process

00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:33,870
first question as I was saying earlier

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:37,560
what do we already know this is a lovely

00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:40,040
visual design of a possible oh sorry I

00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:43,500
know this actually this is the original

00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:46,740
ticket in pug or about what I was going

00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,690
to end up doing this that is what I

00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:51,030
started with exactly I started with this

00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:54,150
ticket and from that ticket I needed to

00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:56,010
say okay let's read what this says let's

00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:58,620
figure out what they're actually trying

00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:00,540
to do here cuz like it's sort of hard to

00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,790
say whether what somebody's asking for

00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,890
is actually what they need so I needed

00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:06,180
to take a look at that and just figure

00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:07,830
out what they're asking for or figure

00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,780
out what the problem actually is and

00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:12,080
then go from there with some feedback

00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:15,510
other people to figure out okay how do I

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:18,090
potentially approach this and that's why

00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:20,280
the next thing you do is what do we need

00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:24,060
to learn in order to be able to actually

00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:27,780
do what that ticket asked for because in

00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:28,920
general you have constraints you have to

00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,890
have constraint if you have no

00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:33,390
constraints you can't do work people

00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:34,920
sometimes say hey constraints are bad

00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:36,750
cuz then you get stuck in things yeah

00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:40,110
but how else do you know what your

00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:41,400
boundaries are so you figure out what is

00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:44,610
the project I'm working on where there

00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,230
is constraints what do other sites do

00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,030
what are their constraints what are they

00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:49,860
trying to figure out just figure out

00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:52,200
that kind of things in this case around

00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,790
things like events and meetups because

00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,960
the goal of the ticket that was probably

00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:57,810
hard to read that I should have told you

00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:01,620
about then was to make it possible to

00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:03,980
have local Fedora meetups and local

00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,420
events and maybe integrate with other

00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:08,670
events locally that aren't specifically

00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:11,160
for Dora we could be a presence at that

00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:12,540
was a general idea of that ticket so the

00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,180
question is okay where does that mean

00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:17,460
what do we mean by local events what do

00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:19,470
we mean by finding people nearby what

00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:22,200
does that actually mean until then I

00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:28,080
went and looked at you end up looking at

00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:30,710
other sites and in this case go know you

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,069
know go that was weird

00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:34,919
so

00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:38,430
the first thing we needed to know

00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:40,649
because I was new to hubs was what does

00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,849
how to do what are its what are its

00:06:40,649 --> 00:06:44,369
underlying programming language

00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:46,649
constraints what does it have for a

00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:47,129
general structure for my design process

00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:49,229
what

00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:51,240
what does helps do why is it doing it

00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:53,399
what are we not sure about yet because

00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,969
it was also it's it was also still on in

00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:59,699
process so it wasn't it wasn't finished

00:06:55,969 --> 00:07:02,490
and with the where does it do now what

00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:04,800
what are we assuming because while it

00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:06,599
can be it's fine to make assumptions but

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,539
you need to know what the assumptions

00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:11,939
are because if you don't know what they

00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:13,199
are then you might end up having it bite

00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:16,199
you in the butt later you were like oh

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,759
wait I assumed that that this group of

00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:19,409
people was relevant where it might have

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,300
been a bigger group so what you you have

00:07:19,409 --> 00:07:22,499
to look at your assumptions if you can

00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,610
find them you can't always find nobody

00:07:22,499 --> 00:07:25,979
used to look at them if you can find

00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,169
them and say okay this might be part of

00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:29,189
what we have to look at in our research

00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:30,270
if you want to look at your assumptions

00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:31,050
and you want to look at the questions

00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,729
you have to ask

00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:35,699
that's about the defining of project

00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:38,180
scope the next question as I was saying

00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:40,529
earlier is what everybody else to do

00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:42,860
which choice do we pick why do you pick

00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:46,949
them that's your competitive analysis

00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:48,990
finally what people do right now how are

00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:51,899
they organizing events how are they

00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:54,689
finding people to go how is it handled

00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:57,269
right now and what is the most painful

00:07:54,689 --> 00:08:03,659
part of it that's called a contextual

00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:07,219
inquiry so the problem with this is it's

00:08:03,659 --> 00:08:09,930
where did where did hopes go so

00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:12,809
fascinating for some reason it decided

00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:14,969
it wanted to be animated we found it

00:08:12,809 --> 00:08:16,949
it's back we're good so further 4-door

00:08:14,969 --> 00:08:19,499
hubs the the point of hubs is that it

00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:22,439
has as you might guess lots of hubs or

00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:23,789
groups and we had the ticket and people

00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:26,580
had already thought that what would make

00:08:23,789 --> 00:08:29,399
the most sense is regional hubs or

00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:30,509
groups were a type of hub it's not like

00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:32,190
we're doing something crazy and

00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:36,120
different on hubs it's still part of the

00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:38,579
underlying infrastructure of hubs the

00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,769
idea behind Fedora hubs for those who

00:08:38,579 --> 00:08:43,139
may or may not have watched the the

00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:45,120
earlier talks is that you're trying to

00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:46,020
get a place where you can see what's

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,330
going on

00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:50,730
across Fedora projects that you are part

00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:52,860
of and your teams as well as what you

00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:54,990
what is showing up in your own stuff

00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:57,090
like there's a whole lot of information

00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,620
and fed message so it's good to have it

00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:05,160
organized in some way and that's a large

00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:07,080
part of what hub's does it has widgets

00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,060
along the sides and then it's got the

00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,740
mainstream along the middle and you

00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,820
didn't watch any of their talks oh I'm

00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:15,000
sorry I'm not going to go any further

00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:17,280
detail than that so for the regional

00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,580
hubs specifically as you can see up here

00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:23,460
is a particular kind of hub and the

00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:26,610
context is one particular location in

00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:29,730
the world rather than a team or a

00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:33,030
project a place and within that place

00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:36,990
okay how do we help people become more

00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:39,390
involved in local meetups local events

00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:42,360
maybe hackathons if you can find them

00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:44,310
different spaces that are for working on

00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,790
open source projects whatever it is you

00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:50,280
might have locally to you how do we make

00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:52,380
it easier to find those and plan those

00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:55,410
and otherwise just be involved locally

00:09:52,380 --> 00:10:01,230
that's the general idea behind regional

00:09:55,410 --> 00:10:03,510
hubs and then you should go no no you

00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:05,160
should go I'm guessing it's trying to

00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:07,380
animate things that I just didn't remove

00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,910
the animation that's all I can guess but

00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,680
so this this is what I actually meant

00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:15,780
earlier when I was talking about the

00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:17,550
visual design of the sample hubs sample

00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:20,100
regional hubs might look like so you've

00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:21,450
got the title you've got a brief

00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,950
description and then you've got a bunch

00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:26,580
of things that are happening in that

00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:29,340
group and that's sort of the general

00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:30,930
idea of how it might look once it

00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:33,900
becomes real because this is this is

00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:38,070
very much pattern after other hubs in

00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:39,360
Fedora hubs too many words got it so

00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,800
that's more or less what it looks like

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,000
if you would be interested in doing

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:48,180
design work for Fedora hubs Moe is the

00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,470
one to talk to but this is sort of the

00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:54,480
kind of thing you might be expecting to

00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:56,520
be working with so when I did the

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,880
competitive analysis to figure out okay

00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:02,220
what are people doing now we did

00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,630
locos because they were very much like

00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,680
the idea of regional hubs they're

00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:07,860
basically a-okay

00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:09,569
local group local local community local

00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,519
group that's what it was so it was like

00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:13,529
okay they're very similar I want to see

00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,949
what they're doing why they're doing it

00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:19,110
how much of that I can also use I also

00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:21,389
want to look at meetup because meetups

00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:25,050
are really really well-known meetup

00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:26,610
based interface I didn't want to only

00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:28,350
use those two because it wasn't enough

00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:31,560
things to use for comparison so I went

00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:32,759
and looked to for some idea of you know

00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:37,620
what I don't have one of I don't have

00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:40,139
one of those yes because we have we have

00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:42,300
letters and and I'm sort of in the

00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:45,690
middle of one of those so on the back of

00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:47,639
the page we've got a nice nice table we

00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:51,600
have letters to try and help you follow

00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:53,730
where we are in the basically on the

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,220
back of this page is a table where I

00:11:53,730 --> 00:12:00,029
attempted to give summaries of the

00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:02,670
various steps you might take in a user

00:12:00,029 --> 00:12:03,569
experience case study like we're doing

00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:06,630
here

00:12:03,569 --> 00:12:10,529
and so what I just noticed is that I was

00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:13,800
talking about the a the Tupper upper

00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:16,769
this is left upper left coordinate where

00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:18,959
it talks about okay research new product

00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:22,949
in this space and so I'm talking about

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:24,360
the yes the first bullet point where I'm

00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:26,519
talking about competitive analysis oops

00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:29,430
be back in front of this and so the

00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:31,889
point of this was okay get a general

00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:33,540
idea of these pay of these websites find

00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:35,430
the parts that are relevant to us okay

00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,930
what do they do around events what do

00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:39,930
they do around meetups how do they

00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:42,240
communicate within people on the site or

00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:46,470
don't they some of them didn't how do

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:48,389
they support the ability to suggest a

00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,740
meet-up or create your own meter or

00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:51,779
whatever it is you might want to do

00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:55,680
around events and meet up just to get an

00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:58,350
idea of the overall structure and ideas

00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,029
like some places were like I don't want

00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:01,860
it to be a very easy thing for anybody

00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:03,329
to talk I want them to only meet in

00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,310
person and the city of socializer

00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:07,199
was very much in that vein they were

00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:09,269
very little discussion online basically

00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:11,960
impossible to do but they had a lot of

00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:14,150
go out and do things together and that

00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:17,110
sort of the point of their site whereas

00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:21,380
big-tent oh I found those two on a

00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:25,010
useful meetup event-based things search

00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:26,570
so a big tent was just a site that

00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:29,060
seemed to be focused on making it really

00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:31,630
really really easy to create groups and

00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:34,430
events so the creation process was great

00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:36,290
but but trying to read some of the sites

00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:37,940
was like I don't know what I'm looking

00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:39,560
at because there was no real structure

00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:42,200
they weren't really thinking about the

00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:45,170
end user who wanted to actually find a

00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,580
meetup event so there were lots of

00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:48,110
different aspects to each of these

00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:49,640
things and I use a spreadsheet as you

00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:50,960
might expect to just sort them out and

00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,870
figure out what's going on so with that

00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:57,170
information I was able to say okay this

00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:59,120
is what's going on right now what does

00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:03,200
that mean when I want to talk to our

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:05,840
current users and so the main question

00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,520
is what did they each one of the each

00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:10,040
categories of things that they wanted to

00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,780
do events meetups etc and how do they

00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,370
organize it and all that and so what

00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:15,260
kinds of questions do I want to ask I

00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:19,820
want to know what people for door right

00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:21,620
now are doing relating to planning

00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:23,390
events finding events attending events

00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,890
finding people to help out with events

00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:26,300
all the kinds of things around event and

00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:29,690
whatever else they thought was relevant

00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:31,820
along those lines and so we found

00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:34,070
ambassadors because ambassadors often

00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:37,280
plan events but not always and we were

00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:39,140
trying to include all of the regions

00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,210
just because I expected that things

00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:42,590
would vary depending upon region so we

00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:44,990
have people as you can see some of whom

00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:46,400
were actually in the room who were who

00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:48,890
were on this list I went in and

00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:53,840
interviewed using remote interviewing

00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:55,280
tools so the main goal there right sorry

00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:57,290
so I just told you mortals what we found

00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,850
what we looked for what we found was

00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:00,830
actually fairly extensive and detailed

00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:03,320
so trying to summarize it might be a

00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:05,150
little difficult but overall the major

00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:08,120
problems seem to be there wasn't really

00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:11,600
under any underlying structure already

00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:16,340
existing in a consistent location people

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:18,710
to use to organize plan find etc events

00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:20,000
in people so that seemed to be one of

00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:21,860
the major issues there was just not

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,100
anywhere to do it so you couldn't find

00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:25,870
information

00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:28,029
then that's and that's the kind of

00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:29,139
things we I sort of found while I was

00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:31,449
looking at my interviews and then the

00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:32,980
question was okay we know this what is

00:15:31,449 --> 00:15:34,269
what are we want to do with this what do

00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:39,250
we want do all the details that I

00:15:34,269 --> 00:15:43,000
collected as I say a lot of data what

00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:47,470
does it mean so myself

00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,759
and Moe and Matt Miller I'm like I'm

00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:53,050
t-shirts Miller but now I can't remember

00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:55,060
um met up to discuss what it was that I

00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:56,740
found I had done a reasonable amount of

00:15:55,060 --> 00:16:00,399
summarizing so they just had we just

00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:03,759
discussed combinations of what it was

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:06,279
that I found what was that fedora was

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:08,380
already thinking around these various

00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:12,060
topics and doing around these various

00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:14,620
topics and some ideas as to how we might

00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:17,740
maybe address these things so we had a

00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:19,930
lot of information flying everywhere and

00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:21,490
after that session was done I we were

00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:23,860
like alright so what are the questions

00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:25,600
we have to what are the problems we what

00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,699
might want to solve we're not gonna

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,740
solve all of them you can't solve all of

00:16:27,699 --> 00:16:31,540
them we'll need to organize them and

00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:34,839
figure out which ones are relevant so I

00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:36,399
made a big list of problems and when I

00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:39,939
went ahead and did something called

00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:41,410
affinity mapping where you take in this

00:16:39,939 --> 00:16:44,769
case a bunch of problems that are on

00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:47,199
sticky notes and you sort them now

00:16:44,769 --> 00:16:48,880
sorting them sort of just happens like

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,170
like it's not gonna be the same patterns

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,120
you used when you first started

00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:54,100
analyzing your data its summarizing it

00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,990
it's gonna be between the two of you or

00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:58,509
however many of you there are where do

00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:00,370
we think there's logic to the sorting

00:16:58,509 --> 00:17:02,259
and then once you've got things sort of

00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:03,610
settled out in the sorting you might

00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:06,189
want to label them just so it's easier

00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:10,299
to refer to the pieces in this case we

00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:12,490
ended up with six different general

00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:14,140
categories and so from there you're like

00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:17,679
alright we know what the categories are

00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:19,750
but which ones do we focus on at that

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,880
point where we say okay we need to

00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:25,120
prioritize these things best way to do

00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:26,919
that is to make a grid and just in this

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:31,059
case go by how many people are affected

00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:32,559
by it and how bad the effect is and so

00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:34,030
we discussed back and forth what we

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,440
thought for each of the groups which

00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:37,120
ones made the most sense in terms what

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,840
what who affected we're affected by it

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,120
and how bad it

00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,070
they were affected by it ended up with a

00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:47,620
couple things in the most important

00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:49,480
section to look into further we ended up

00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:51,429
with that we just dope

00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,940
we found out that one of the two prior

00:17:51,429 --> 00:17:58,210
highest priority sings ended up being

00:17:53,940 --> 00:18:00,070
not well enough not concrete enough it

00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:02,230
was more it was too nebulous to address

00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:04,570
right then so we're like okay we'll keep

00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:07,090
this in mind as important but we're not

00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:09,010
gonna actually do anything with it for

00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:12,070
the most part now and for the other one

00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:14,140
the local resources resource scaling is

00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:15,610
finding and scalability which is pretty

00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,899
much what I said earlier finding things

00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:19,179
and figuring out how to do things with

00:18:16,899 --> 00:18:22,360
them we went into a really deep dive on

00:18:19,179 --> 00:18:24,279
that and said okay given that we want to

00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,169
look into this let's look at each of the

00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:27,460
sticky notes we had in there aka each of

00:18:26,169 --> 00:18:29,950
their problems that were in there and

00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:31,840
just investigate them further figure out

00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:33,130
what we think these things mean what

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,570
they might mean in terms of actually

00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:36,940
implementing them or what they'll affect

00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:38,890
that kind of thing so that's how we got

00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:41,409
the first ideas of what you might want

00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:42,700
to translate into a design cuz in

00:18:41,409 --> 00:18:44,080
general most the things you want to

00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,700
discuss it here are going to be fairly

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,500
visual things you're talking about in

00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,360
words so trying to put them into a

00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:52,059
design structure it makes it easier to

00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,520
talk about and understand and it means

00:18:52,059 --> 00:18:56,799
you can say hey this is what I think is

00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:59,260
true and somebody else I feel like oh

00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,909
that's nothing like what I was thinking

00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:03,580
about wait a minute so then you have

00:19:00,909 --> 00:19:05,409
something to compare against to say hey

00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:07,179
okay so what do we actually mean what

00:19:05,409 --> 00:19:08,770
we're saying what where where are we

00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:10,590
differing and what are we similar on

00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:13,630
then we can just use that visual

00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:15,549
interest raishin of it to adjust

00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:17,860
appropriately so it's really important

00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:19,179
to translate your understandings into a

00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:23,620
visual representation so that you

00:19:19,179 --> 00:19:27,010
actually end up on the same page right

00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:29,380
now translating into designs so as I was

00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:30,909
saying we we were like okay so what do

00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:32,679
we do with information during our

00:19:30,909 --> 00:19:36,159
brainstorming session we said all right

00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:39,640
we need to know what is our main goal

00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:42,640
with this with this particular category

00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:44,110
what's our goal we want anybody trying

00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,830
to find information that that's local to

00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:48,700
them about fedora to use hubs to find it

00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:50,260
basically I mean it's longer than that

00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,860
out there but that's the basic idea and

00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:54,410
so okay okay what

00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:56,420
that mean what is what is the way we can

00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:58,370
tell that's happening if people are

00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:00,320
looking at hubs to find the information

00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:02,570
they need for local resources as a

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:05,450
matter of course if that's where they go

00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:07,910
or we did what we needed to do that's

00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:11,270
pretty much the the success measure and

00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:13,309
so in order to do that we said all right

00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:15,049
from what we were seeing we need to have

00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:19,190
lists of information that can be

00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:21,799
searched and sorted about people for the

00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:23,780
remembers events as I was saying earlier

00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:26,270
and although we didn't get to this part

00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:27,710
a master list original hubs you can find

00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:31,340
how it's related to what you want to do

00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:32,570
or be where you are or whatever and so

00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:35,090
from there I'm gonna go into a

00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:37,220
particular mock-up set because otherwise

00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:40,130
it's going to be way too long so in this

00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:43,400
case I went into a really important part

00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:46,549
of this entire concept is locations if

00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:49,309
you don't know where an event or a

00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:51,020
person is there's no way you can make

00:20:49,309 --> 00:20:52,669
regional hubs work it's just not gonna

00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,919
happen you need to know where they are

00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:57,790
and where everything else is so this is

00:20:54,919 --> 00:21:02,870
a very early mock-up of my attempt to

00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:05,600
figure out how to get people to either

00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:08,690
confirm or provide their location

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,470
information to hubs as you can see it's

00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:11,809
fairly sketchy

00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:13,070
there's a bit of uncertainty and a bunch

00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:15,049
of questions but that's kind of what you

00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:16,669
do you don't start with a perfect thing

00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:19,250
you can't it's not gonna work and it's

00:21:16,669 --> 00:21:21,950
easier to adjust things with feedback if

00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:25,040
they're very basic mock-up type stuff so

00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:26,450
that was my first one and then I was

00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,740
talking to Moe and she was like hey

00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:29,030
maybe you don't want to be doing these

00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:31,040
certain things that I was doing because

00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:33,080
they were sort of confusing and then

00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:36,290
after a little bit of more discussion we

00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:37,820
ended up with the one on the right

00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:39,919
making sure it was right on both streets

00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:41,960
with the one on the right where it's no

00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:44,120
longer about things you can like click

00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,830
to go away it's just a nice little boxes

00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:48,230
that are structured prettily and that's

00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:49,340
the kind of of change you might see you

00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:51,169
go from this we just sort of

00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:52,280
weird-looking and this is a little

00:21:51,169 --> 00:21:53,840
better and that one looks more

00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,730
structured and easier to use so that's

00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,740
the kind of thing you see as you get

00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:59,990
feedback and discussion and all that

00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:02,030
kind of thing obviously the one that

00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:04,210
that's now is even better than this but

00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:05,570
so then we ran into this problem

00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:07,580
locations are

00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:08,869
really complicated especially when

00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:12,200
you're talking about international

00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:14,960
locations sometimes there states

00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,639
sometimes as provinces sometimes there's

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,779
nothing sometimes there's other things I

00:22:16,639 --> 00:22:20,509
can remember the name of right now there

00:22:17,779 --> 00:22:24,799
are so many possible things between a

00:22:20,509 --> 00:22:27,019
city and a street so you can't easily

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:30,739
just make a solution that will succeed

00:22:27,019 --> 00:22:32,690
for an entire international stage at

00:22:30,739 --> 00:22:35,450
least not easily so in our case we're

00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:38,119
like okay we need to address this and so

00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:40,039
we'd had a long discussion so long it

00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:41,720
was good for the long discussion and

00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:45,049
we're like alright so what do we

00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:47,629
actually need to know do we care about

00:22:45,049 --> 00:22:49,909
street addresses honestly no not really

00:22:47,629 --> 00:22:52,820
because we're talking about near each

00:22:49,909 --> 00:22:55,129
other which can mean a city or maybe

00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:56,720
even a county I mean it doesn't need to

00:22:55,129 --> 00:22:58,369
be to the level of street addresses so

00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,710
we just said okay we're not gonna ask

00:22:58,369 --> 00:23:02,269
that we don't need it no privacy issue

00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:05,059
by not having it good we can get rid of

00:23:02,269 --> 00:23:09,529
that how about the weirdness between a

00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:11,929
city and a street or a city and a

00:23:09,529 --> 00:23:15,979
country like where how do we handle that

00:23:11,929 --> 00:23:18,139
uh we're not sure oh hey we can put it

00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:20,210
on a map and people can just know by

00:23:18,139 --> 00:23:22,009
looking at the map what the name of the

00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:24,710
state or province are whatever it is

00:23:22,009 --> 00:23:27,129
they're actually in is they don't need

00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:29,749
to type it in if you tell to use the GPS

00:23:27,129 --> 00:23:31,729
it'll figure it out and show you this if

00:23:29,749 --> 00:23:34,159
you don't there are other ways we we

00:23:31,729 --> 00:23:35,840
handle this we did a bunch of ways to

00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,549
try and handle that but that's the kind

00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,919
of idea behind it we just completely

00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:43,429
changed the interface to ask people

00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:45,440
where they are and then the question was

00:23:43,429 --> 00:23:47,059
alright where did the developer think of

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,769
this all because of course you don't

00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:50,779
want to say hey make this thing and then

00:23:48,769 --> 00:23:52,970
be have it impossible to make you got to

00:23:50,779 --> 00:23:55,759
talk to your developers interestingly

00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:58,789
locations came up again in a different

00:23:55,759 --> 00:24:01,249
way so in this problem the question the

00:23:58,789 --> 00:24:05,599
question that ever had was okay but how

00:24:01,249 --> 00:24:07,849
is the hub's going to be able to handle

00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:09,019
suggesting that people who are we were

00:24:07,849 --> 00:24:10,940
thinking about having people who were

00:24:09,019 --> 00:24:12,019
near each other after certain our people

00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:14,119
near each other are suggesting that a

00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:15,739
hub for a gional hub should be created

00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,519
and he's like I don't know how it would

00:24:15,739 --> 00:24:18,620
even do that

00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:19,970
like I don't understand the concept

00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,740
I didn't we didn't go into it in detail

00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:22,760
then but that's one of the things that

00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,830
needs to be addressed again later

00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:27,590
because it's a potential significant

00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:28,730
issue without being able to suggest hubs

00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:31,309
they suddenly gets a lot more

00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:33,980
complicated to make regional hubs so

00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:36,200
then the question after we got the we

00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:37,669
feedback from the developer is okay we

00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,049
need to trust us out on users because

00:24:37,669 --> 00:24:41,000
you always want to have two out on users

00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:43,340
no users you don't have any idea what's

00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,650
going on so users are good but the way

00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:48,169
to do that you have to plan it out in my

00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:50,600
case we needed to plan out the session

00:24:48,169 --> 00:24:52,700
based on the kinds of things that I had

00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,289
in my mock-ups which I turned into

00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,480
prototypes okay what what can you

00:24:54,289 --> 00:24:58,220
actually do on this screen right if you

00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,720
don't know you can't make a task but

00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:01,909
once you know what the possibilities are

00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,919
you say okay I can do these things on

00:25:01,909 --> 00:25:06,260
these different prototypes which ones

00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:08,029
are most important right now use that

00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:09,919
same little grid thing from earlier and

00:25:08,029 --> 00:25:11,809
figure out how to how to prioritize them

00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,000
and then figure out which which

00:25:11,809 --> 00:25:15,980
particular pieces and which tasks you

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,770
come up with you actually need to know

00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:20,360
now in this case I was having a little

00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:23,299
bit of a hard time freezing things which

00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:26,809
mo was great at and so I sent her a task

00:25:23,299 --> 00:25:29,330
for one of my prototypes again with

00:25:26,809 --> 00:25:30,919
locations and and she's like alright

00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:33,020
this is a better way to put it to make

00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:35,299
it easier for your user to actually know

00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:37,039
what you're asking them to do so you

00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:38,929
will often need to adjust how you phrase

00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:42,679
things just so it's less confusing to

00:25:38,929 --> 00:25:44,510
your user and then after I did a bunch

00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:46,520
of usability sessions we had some

00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:48,529
interesting says this is one of the

00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:53,029
prototypes that I used and in this one

00:25:48,529 --> 00:25:55,789
the question was okay I have no idea if

00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:57,529
I know any of these people I can't tell

00:25:55,789 --> 00:25:59,360
about looking at the screen if the

00:25:57,529 --> 00:26:01,490
question and we were a little talking

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,230
about what's going to Berlin and trying

00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:05,149
to find somebody to talk to and visit up

00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:07,399
while you're there and you don't know

00:26:05,149 --> 00:26:09,679
who you know already that can be really

00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:12,320
hard to do like well who do I know who I

00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,730
want to hang out with or who would be

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,350
fabulously interested in meeting up

00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:17,000
somewhere they don't already know can't

00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:19,250
tell that either so there were some

00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,529
major issues with okay how do I select

00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:23,240
somebody from this screen and that's the

00:26:21,529 --> 00:26:25,190
kind of thing as I found out as part of

00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:27,020
these ability session is just like

00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:28,850
really important stuff that I had not

00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:30,260
thought about it at all and that's the

00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:32,120
kind of thing you might find out in your

00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:33,350
own usability sessions I have forgotten

00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:38,480
to continue updating you with with

00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:41,120
letters I'm sorry and so there we have

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:43,790
we got to the point of doing these

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,740
ability sessions looking at the data I

00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:47,510
found and doing a little bit of analysis

00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:50,690
unfortunately we out Russia ended right

00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:52,490
then and so the questions now are okay

00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:55,310
what do we do with this information do

00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:57,050
we do a little more research do we start

00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:57,980
doing some some updating probably

00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:59,600
updating the designs with the

00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:01,460
information I found them and then more

00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,620
ease ability maybe but the question is

00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:05,900
what are we doing with what I have and

00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:08,720
the answer is probably all three of

00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:11,750
those things more research more design

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,030
and more other things I have forgotten

00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:16,100
if my brain isn't working

00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:17,450
analysis that that thing analysis so

00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:19,220
that's that's the kind of thing that we

00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:20,750
would go go from here it's it's I'm not

00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:23,300
sure yet which direction we'd go because

00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:25,730
we sort of stalled out because a our Chi

00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:28,130
ended and B hubs is still in process so

00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:31,970
that's how far I got with that project

00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:34,820
and I talked really fast but thank you

00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:37,550
if anybody wants to help out in general

00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:38,960
with hubs or with design help is

00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:43,160
obviously up there if you want to reach

00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:45,200
it go to it my portfolio relating to

00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:47,810
fedora hubs is a link on the front page

00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,640
the handout I gave we actually have a

00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:56,650
little bit of time left so I didn't do

00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:56,650
too badly is anybody have questions yes

00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:02,250
yes yes

00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:13,270
we were building it on top of the ticket

00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:18,270
was specifically about adding to fedora

00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:21,580
hubs the ability to have local stuff so

00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:23,200
we were trying to leverage it into the

00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:26,170
existing fedora house but Fedora hubs

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,810
itself is in process so I not sure if I

00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:33,430
answered your questions I'm not sure how

00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:35,980
directly yes we did also we I mean so

00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:37,480
the way that the design works is when

00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:40,540
you sign up for a Fedora accountant of

00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:43,690
in the fast system we actually do have a

00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:46,900
way to store a user's GPS coordinates so

00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:48,790
some of the map location stuff that is

00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:51,370
in the design is based on storing the

00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:52,930
coordinates there so we would we would

00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:55,660
use that data store that's been in place

00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:57,370
for years and fast so we did we did use

00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:58,630
existing infrastructure where it existed

00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:05,830
and a lot of the new stuff is just

00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:08,830
because it didn't exist figure out the

00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:11,230
location stuff is fast asks you for your

00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:13,540
longitude and latitude and not your

00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:15,330
address because it locations are so

00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:28,870
annoying

00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:30,040
so anyway more questions yes so the

00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:32,260
question was we're talking about events

00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:34,330
are people in my particular case the

00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:37,360
stuff that I showed you was mostly

00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:42,940
people but it's both I just didn't have

00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:44,950
time to cover everything yes I do want

00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:46,750
to point out Suzanne's portfolio link is

00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,490
on the handout she wrote a series of

00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:50,260
excellent blog post sort of walking

00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:52,360
through the design as she went through

00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:54,640
it and those are really great narratives

00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:57,250
like that really dive dive a lot deeper

00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,050
into each aspect she talked about today

00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:02,800
that goes both into the design and the

00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:06,070
design process the blog posts are

00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:08,140
separate from my portfolio but but there

00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:10,660
are links within the portfolio and there

00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:17,020
is also a link to my blog on the main

00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:25,970
page of that site anyone else

00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:28,750
did I go too fast go ahead I'm sorry

00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:28,750
what is the question

00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:33,950
know about them so that was a good

00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:36,289
question because we had a hard time with

00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:38,179
it ourselves we are probably not

00:30:36,289 --> 00:30:40,640
initially going to try to figure out

00:30:38,179 --> 00:30:42,910
events that are not in fedora because

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,520
finding them and pulling them in is hard

00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:49,010
we are going to be trying to integrate

00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:50,179
stuff that is integratable but mostly

00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:52,940
we're thinking that people will be

00:30:50,179 --> 00:30:54,230
creating the events in hubs and that

00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:57,350
will automatically propagate it

00:30:54,230 --> 00:31:08,390
throughout hubs because yeah that's a

00:30:57,350 --> 00:31:09,679
very good question anyone else okay well

00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:12,280
thank you very much for coming in for

00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,280
