Title: Flock 2017 - Get Together with Local Fedorans: A UX Design Case
Publication date: 2017-11-20
Playlist: Flock 2017
Description: 
	Tuesday August 29, 2017 2:00pm - 2:30pm @Grand I Suzanne Hillman (with Mo Duffy) will explain and summarize the user experience work around the social aspect of Fedora Hubs (part of a completed Outreachy internship.) Regional Hubs is a planned future feature of Fedora Hubs meant to help co-located Fedora community members to find each other and set up local events and meetings - a tool that would help power Fedora Ambassador efforts. We will talk about the design processes we used, what we learned, the designs, and our future roadmap for the feature. This talk is a great case study for anyone trying to understand the UX design process from an inkling of a feature idea, to competitive analysis, to user research / interviews, to iterative design using mockups and remote prototype testing. The design process outlined in this talk can easily be applied to any Fedora projects looking to improve user experience.
