Talk: Freshmaker
Presenter: Jan Kaluza

Description:
With all the new cool combinations of content (RPM packages, modules, Docker images, ...), the dependencies between artifacts are starting to be much more complex. When you update a .spec file, you need to remember to rebuild modules containing that .spec file. When you rebuild a module, you need to remember to rebuild containers that include that module. This is a lot for anyone to handle!

Fortunately, we have an answer - the Freshmaker system. In this talk, we will cover:

- What are the problems Freshmaker is trying to solve for you.
- How Freshmaker works and interacts with other Fedora services.
- What is the current state of implementation and what are the future plans.
