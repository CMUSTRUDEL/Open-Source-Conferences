other yes let me see what we will see

00:00:44,769 --> 00:00:58,259
today I wanna talk about sort of

00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:58,259
splitting of the marketing activities I

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:10,470
want to talk about doing an intro and

00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:18,970
talk about the tasks we we do in in this

00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:23,140
last release I want to see what is

00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:28,590
marketing for a private company and also

00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:35,610
compared with the Fedora marketing

00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:41,080
organization I have some ideas about the

00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:46,540
the marketing but he is only my idea so

00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:54,520
I want to discuss with you about about

00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:57,820
my dears well starting with we we know

00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:02,380
at the moment we are so few people

00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:06,390
working on marketing so is difficult to

00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:06,390
reach us is it true

00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:17,760
well we can be reached in the Milan list

00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,400
is marketing list for the project Paul

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:26,640
dot-org

00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:30,840
our channel is federal and K TG an

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:38,939
impeller for the tickets each request

00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:42,930
people have to do well this is the

00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:49,139
extract from the wiki our wiki say

00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:51,769
exactly this kind of thing develops and

00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:57,480
executes marketing strategies

00:02:51,769 --> 00:03:05,430
the main program of a marketing well we

00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:11,430
are doing almost nothing of that our

00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:20,000
workflow has three four main points to

00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:20,000
follow tasks for each release there are

00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:37,379
all the tasks and we have to attend the

00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:44,159
meetings for each release and we have to

00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:52,319
be ready for the deadline we don't have

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:56,269
any blocking issue for the release then

00:03:52,319 --> 00:04:02,010
in the wiki page we have a some of the

00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:07,579
other tasks we have to do of course red

00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:07,579
rings means page and are not edited yet

00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:15,320
then we have the peg or track so we can

00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:18,320
take care of the request we are

00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,320
receiving

00:04:19,819 --> 00:04:28,650
at the moment we counsel asks us to

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:36,990
report the state of Nativity the last

00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:44,069
and the only who was given by Edward and

00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:50,909
Brian is right we should update the EOP

00:04:44,069 --> 00:04:54,150
pages but is hard when we work in three

00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:58,439
four people is very helpful all the

00:04:54,150 --> 00:05:06,360
things also we have to update the wiki

00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:11,330
page but wiki page are so much too much

00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:19,610
to be forward and updated there are

00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:19,610
thousand of pages I don't know how to do

00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:30,900
to become a member of marketing group of

00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:38,669
course is not you but registration in

00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:42,750
fest is Israel is a worthwhile also

00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:48,539
joining the mailing list not so frequent

00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:50,849
in in the last time introduce yourself

00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:55,919
in the mailing list I joined the

00:05:50,849 --> 00:06:00,210
marketing group if s of course the

00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:04,259
meeting we have weekly in federal

00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:08,879
marketing channel and then people can

00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:12,810
start contributing contributing is

00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:16,860
important because a couple of year ago

00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:19,349
we decided then that after a series of

00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:23,669
contributions the main the membership

00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:28,409
will be approved because marketing is

00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:32,280
ever been a group where people a pair

00:06:28,409 --> 00:06:33,960
the disappeared and so on so we asked

00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:38,820
or a contribution a constant

00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:48,030
contribution come to coming to an AB

00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:52,710
marketing abstraction this is sort of is

00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:57,960
not every company as his own marketing

00:06:52,710 --> 00:07:01,950
structure so I take the one more similar

00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:05,750
to the federal project we have of course

00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:09,050
marketing we have a section dedicated

00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:14,720
research distributions and sales

00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:14,720
customer service and advertising

00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:26,550
marketing receive input from the Board

00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:30,770
of Directors he it I it has definite

00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:37,260
targets from the board

00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:46,740
porpoise and then Brian budget Byron is

00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:50,570
not here now well this is the private

00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:53,760
company organization this is fedora

00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:58,380
well marketing research we don't have

00:07:53,760 --> 00:08:04,950
any marketing research oh we we have but

00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:09,800
not common marketing yeah a distribution

00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:13,440
says ambassador the comparation

00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:19,500
customer service yes ask adora or fedora

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:21,090
channels in Europe and advertising we

00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:24,410
don't have any campaign over the

00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:24,410
advertising at the moment

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,860
you

00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:34,849
okay okay

00:08:39,209 --> 00:08:50,610
in my vision improving federal marketing

00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:53,339
is not easy because we need people we

00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:58,860
have to change our organization chart

00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:59,760
because at the moment we are free for

00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:10,440
people

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:18,029
adjusting how much are we free we have

00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:23,339
we need targets and goals from you are

00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:27,660
you a man we have to collect data for

00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:31,829
case studies collect data is not easy we

00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:34,470
discussed in the past about bass adorn

00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:40,260
collecting data from their events and so

00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:45,200
on is not easy in Peru connection among

00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:50,190
outreach groups because marketing for an

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:56,910
advertising campaign needs design needs

00:09:50,190 --> 00:10:07,350
doc needs to be connected very very hard

00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:13,250
I don't command this time to reach goals

00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:18,029
this is important a deadline council FPL

00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:23,070
cake how to say well in March I wanna

00:10:18,029 --> 00:10:29,100
have the know the cover with the

00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:34,339
ambassador's Ireland just for example so

00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:39,829
and these starts the marketing campaign

00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:39,829
improve recruitment ah this is a

00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:47,629
several years I think about this thing

00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:52,749
but I know have so much solution at the

00:10:47,629 --> 00:10:52,749
moment Diane

00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,910
yeah

00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:34,440
yes man you know there is a surprise we

00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:36,450
will see later one of the main purpose

00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,420
of marketing is to keep updated

00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:44,700
ambassadors about features and news of

00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:49,140
the new version of fedora when when we

00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:53,850
have done until this is the work well

00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:57,930
well due to lack of connections among

00:11:53,850 --> 00:12:02,030
the true ambassador have a meeting for

00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:09,150
each region so if we are if here I am

00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:14,610
anemia is difficult for me attend the

00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:17,700
APEC or the NA meeting so it's difficult

00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:22,920
to be present in the meeting for saying

00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:28,710
things anything taking points the most

00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:30,930
important marketing tasks actually the

00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:35,270
key point I frequently snap led by

00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:43,290
ambassador is not a marketing problem

00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:48,900
yeah is ambassador is easy you open the

00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:50,970
wiki page and read the talking points in

00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:53,870
this moment they can do this

00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,870
it's not difficult

00:12:57,329 --> 00:13:00,329
yeah

00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:38,410
lack of people in the marketing group of

00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:43,910
course ambassador don't care about

00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:54,820
marketing yeah this right is right just

00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:54,820
in European yeah of course okay

00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:23,630
yeah and a problem is of course when we

00:14:19,009 --> 00:14:27,690
fought the magazine from the marketing I

00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:36,019
didn't expect that almost all the people

00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:45,860
in the - I thought some people rest in

00:14:36,019 --> 00:14:45,860
marketing but this didn't happen well

00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:58,350
this is my idea my ha structure where

00:14:54,769 --> 00:15:03,709
marketing itself follows the release

00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:03,709
tasks of course and activated all the

00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:09,769
sub-project subgroups in industry -

00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:20,910
talking going back to the private

00:15:17,819 --> 00:15:22,260
company we said there is a market

00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:26,600
research

00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:30,240
well combs and ambassadors can do that

00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:35,579
from a point of view distribution said

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:40,829
ok ambassadors they are our guns in the

00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:44,490
in the world against Ubuntu customer

00:15:40,829 --> 00:15:50,930
service ok as Fedora and IRC channels

00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:57,149
fedora advertising yeah we need absolute

00:15:50,930 --> 00:16:06,920
design team because we if Matthew we

00:15:57,149 --> 00:16:13,560
recall we spoke some time ago about the

00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:19,319
upgrade of Dora we had t we have noticed

00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:20,399
a ticket opened in design he don't know

00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:25,220
anything

00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:25,220
else from from the design stack

00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:14,030
yes but sometimes we we should have the

00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:18,079
power sometimes we we should have the

00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:25,250
power to say no don't go forward stop

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:30,679
here and push out the future because we

00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:32,720
have a plenty of people having ideas one

00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:36,890
more one more one more

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:41,720
neverending story yeah of course

00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:45,520
marketing social media social media

00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:49,660
social media for me as more like

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:52,580
magazine stuff because it's more

00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:55,429
connected with magazine the social media

00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:57,760
but he's not a problem is not this a

00:17:55,429 --> 00:17:57,760
problem

00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:04,669
keep the release task and social media

00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:06,890
ask as they are okay we said process

00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:09,500
marketing research along with commas

00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:12,980
ambassador we said before keep

00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:16,580
ambassadors sales and i reinforce keep

00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:19,880
as fedora and year see channel as mean

00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:23,330
at desk i I wanna say help last is not

00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,980
the quarter of course planning

00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:28,190
advertising campaign along with

00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:33,799
marketing and design this is my

00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:40,190
structure this kind of thought I don't

00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:47,330
think it needs so many people so we can

00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:48,570
do with two three four maybe people join

00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:54,679
anything

00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:58,309
a pro communication meeting okay

00:18:54,679 --> 00:19:04,610
stop keeping ambassador self-managed

00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:05,720
okay what I mean ambassador is a group

00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:08,580
[Music]

00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:11,009
disconnected from the rest of the they

00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:17,880
are their release parties they are they

00:19:11,009 --> 00:19:20,610
their events and they they don't give

00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,679
feedback this is the question

00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:27,450
they don't give we know there is a

00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:29,090
release party we know there is well not

00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:33,600
the main event

00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:38,580
just like first day and so on

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:42,320
they literally haven't they are not

00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:42,320
tracted at the moment

00:19:51,390 --> 00:20:01,990
yeah but yeah we're blog they're open

00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:07,410

[Music]

00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:40,429

00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:46,309
personal computer a laptop with a form

00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:48,830

00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:58,759
[Music]

00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:26,920
there is the mindshare you know so we

00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:30,720

00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:13,710

are okay with this

00:56:12,530 --> 00:56:15,799
