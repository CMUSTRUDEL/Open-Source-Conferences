Talk: System containers: Concept, Creation and Usage
Presenter: Jason Brooks, Yu Qi Zhang

Description:
In this session we will introduce the concept of system containers: containerized systemd services using runc on a Fedora Atomic Host. We will explore use cases for system containers in the containerized world, focusing on etcd/flannel/docker/cri-o on a Fedora Atomic system. We will also learn how a user can create such a container themselves and use system containers to expand host functionality. We will wrap up with some discussions about a more containerized Fedora moving into the future.
