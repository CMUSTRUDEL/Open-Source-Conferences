Talk: Automate Building Custom Atomic Host with Ansible
Presenter: Trishna Guha

Description:

The talk demonstrates the Automation of the entire workflow of Creating Custom OSTree and Building Atomic host for personal use with Ansible.

Project Atomic hosts are built from standard RPM packages that have been composed into filesystem trees using rpm-ostree. Atomic Host comes with certain packages pre-installed. It does not allow installing packages randomly, to introduce and maintain the only-container workflow. But Atomic Host allows adding RPM packages to OSTree to build an Atomic Host which boots into its own OSTree. In order to achieve customized Atomic host it follows a number of steps is to be executed manually.

The talk provides a solution to automate the way of customizing packages on OSTree which includes adding/deleting packages and creating OSTree compose and rebasing to it on the Atomic host with Ansible.
Fedora 25 Atomic Host will be used in the Demo.
