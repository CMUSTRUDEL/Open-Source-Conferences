hey everyone my name is Justin I'm Jeff

00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:15,809
Lori 7 and this is so this workshop

00:00:13,459 --> 00:00:17,849
presentation is mostly a quick dive into

00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:18,929
the community operations team and we're

00:00:17,849 --> 00:00:20,970
going to try to teach some of the

00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:27,179
metrics tools that we have available in

00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:28,470
the fedora stack so we'll generally

00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:29,669
start with a quick introduction to come

00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,289
ups and then we'll dive in some of the

00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:33,060
metrics and we'll talk about some of our

00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:34,649
as we move closer to the animals start

00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:38,030
doing more of our our hack session

00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:38,030
topics that we have planned at the end

00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:45,480
so the metric session should be about 90

00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:47,190
minutes after this but just as a and

00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,420
then with that the latter part will also

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,449
be like a hack session for some of our

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:54,420
tickets that we have - so as a quick

00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:56,609
deduction for comm ops what is what is

00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,070
community operations what is what is the

00:00:56,609 --> 00:01:02,250
comms team so come ups first came up

00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,899
around November 2015 and it was part of

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,489
this idea that the Fedora project is

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,020
huge and there's so many different

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:09,390
corners of the project that it's almost

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,680
impossible to keep up with all of it at

00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,900
once there's so many different things

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,880
happening and the development side and

00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,650
the design team with the ambassadors

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,110
it's almost impossible for any one

00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,240
person to know what's happening in

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,950
Fedora at once so part of the vision for

00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,020
the community operations team was to

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:28,799
bring heat and light to these different

00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:30,570
areas of the Fedora project so it's kind

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,640
of if you can think of as marketing as

00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,409
kind of this outreach community

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,290
operations is maybe a little bit more

00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:39,420
like in Reach so some of the things that

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:42,030
we helped work on is like the community

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:44,820
blog which is the platform that we use

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,680
to help deliver Fedora new or news for

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,180
Fedora contributors across the project

00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,799
you can go there and you can see

00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,090
different blog posted and written by

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,030
different contributors across the

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:56,850
project we also work with a lot of the

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,039
metrics and data tools I think this year

00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,869
we also had some we've had some G sock

00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:02,520
or google Summer of Code slots in the

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:06,299
past to work on some of these tools as

00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:08,520
well as some other projects as well but

00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:09,840
we kind of do it like a mix there's two

00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,640
different sides to the community

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,430
operations team one of which is more of

00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,819
working with the the quant or the

00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,680
quantity

00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:18,930
native tools like the metric stack like

00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,389
fed message data grepper and some of the

00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:23,430
others and sachin is more informed on

00:02:21,389 --> 00:02:24,689
those things than me and then on the

00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,579
other side it's also a little bit more

00:02:24,689 --> 00:02:27,870
non-technical so we look at some of the

00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:30,269
other things going on in the community

00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:32,219
one of the current tasks that we're

00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:34,530
working on that we have Scott our plan

00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:36,120
for a little bit later we have this

00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,969
ticket for a fedora Appreciation Day

00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,650
which does kind of take a I was

00:02:38,969 --> 00:02:43,290
partially motivated by what do bun to

00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:45,150
has they have a bun to community

00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:47,030
Appreciation Day which is a really

00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,319
simple idea that one day a year

00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:51,389
everyone's encouraged to say thank you

00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:53,040
to each other in the in the contributor

00:02:51,389 --> 00:02:55,769
community and thank people for their

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,079
work and the project if you ever heard

00:02:55,769 --> 00:03:00,540
of the site happiness packets it's kind

00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:02,219
of a similar idea of just taking some

00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,359
time to say thank you to all the people

00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:05,189
who are putting their time into the

00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:08,849
project so towards the end we'll go a

00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:10,469
little bit more into that but now I

00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:14,730
think you want to talk a little more

00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:17,730
about that all right so one of the major

00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:20,250
part of comm ops is what we do we we do

00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:23,040
a lot of metrics so when you say it's

00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:25,620
metrics we you know it can be even

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,870
metrics it can be badges metrics it can

00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,180
be no reports of annual reports of

00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:34,620
various teams a lot of stuff like that

00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:36,689
so we have something cool we have

00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,430
something called a comm ups toolbox so

00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:41,370
this is this is a part of the wiki where

00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:48,479
we have a list of awesome tools it's

00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:52,019
just cool yeah so this is our toolbox so

00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:54,540
we have things like we have the we have

00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:58,979
IRC BOTS that py that that pulls data

00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:01,290
about messages from IRC we have a annual

00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:05,159
gripper tool which gives you early

00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:09,120
statistics that is the gripper that we

00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:11,759
use to pull data from from thermal HTTP

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,069
server fat messages is our central

00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:17,310
messaging hub that that you know holds

00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:19,530
all the messages and and this is a tool

00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:22,500
I was working on for my previous G sock

00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:24,810
so what this tool does is it will take

00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:28,050
you know a list of user names and it can

00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,530
pull data about it and about about that

00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,960
person

00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:33,240
and you can generate statistics like the

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:38,580
ones you saw during the keynote

00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:41,160
presentation then there is stats cache

00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:44,040
which is a tool that that is built to

00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,800
you know have data cached locally so you

00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:50,010
can have faster transactions and then

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:53,070
this is one awesome tool as well by Remy

00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:55,740
so what it does is it can take meeting

00:04:53,070 --> 00:05:01,590
logs and it can build you know beautiful

00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:17,220
word clouds yeah so these are some tools

00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:19,680
we use okay so our metrics 101 so if you

00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,480
if you're interested in building any any

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,660
metrics tools for fedora or if you want

00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:29,510
to generate some people's data you you

00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:29,510
will want to start with data crapper so

00:06:19,469 --> 00:06:25,419
yes so this is data gripper so this is

00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:28,539
this is the one tool we have which is

00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:31,060
used to no pull data about people so if

00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:32,860
you so the length is apps not federal

00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:35,919
project at odd slash data gripper

00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:38,499
so what you can do is you can you have a

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,840
you know specific set of get requests

00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:42,819
you can make and you'll get JSON

00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:45,000
responses or HTTP responses based on

00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:47,289
what you ask for so let's say I want

00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,240
this is a quick clarification for the

00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:51,580
video too this is all pulling message

00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,990
for our data from fed message if you're

00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:55,680
not familiar with fed message this is

00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:57,849
like the federated message bus of

00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,289
everything happening in the project you

00:06:57,849 --> 00:07:02,590
can almost think of this as almost like

00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:05,139
a raw firehose of data of everything

00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:07,779
happening in fedora all at once so this

00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:10,659
is things like someone got a badge

00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:14,259
someone made a commit to a pager repo

00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:15,879
someone submitted a koji build someone

00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:17,620
wrote a blog post for the fedora

00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:18,909
magazine or submitted something to the

00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,169
fedora planet there's all these

00:07:18,909 --> 00:07:22,689
different kinds of things that are

00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:24,430
emitted onto this bus of things that are

00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:26,289
happening in the Fedora project one

00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:28,659
thing I think is really cool just to see

00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:30,939
on freenode there's a channel Fedora -

00:07:28,659 --> 00:07:34,110
fed message and you can just see

00:07:30,939 --> 00:07:36,879
everything coming out all at once it's

00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:38,469
by itself it's impossible to make sense

00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:40,629
of because it's just so much data you

00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:42,699
have just lines flying across your

00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:44,919
screen but once you can use a tool like

00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:46,659
yeah actually like this so by itself

00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:48,550
this is impossible to make sense of but

00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:49,960
you can kind of get this idea of these

00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:52,629
are all things that are happening in

00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:54,699
fedora right now and this is like the

00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:56,740
live feed that you're seeing Fedora move

00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:58,330
and happen right now in front of you and

00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,430
it's when you start using tools like

00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:02,830
data gripper that you can take this this

00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:06,779
raw fire hose and start filtering it

00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:09,069
down into meaningful impactful

00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:12,250
conclusions and you can start forming it

00:08:09,069 --> 00:08:14,500
to actually work with it and start

00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:16,770
manipulating it to ways you want to work

00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,770
with it

00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:31,650
the mirrors no so this is all tied to

00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:33,329
Fedora user accounts or for the fedora

00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:39,029
account system it's like if you go back

00:08:33,329 --> 00:08:40,320
to the channel really quick that might I

00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:42,360
think that would like there's also

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,010
ansible playbook runs will also go in

00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,510
here and you can kind of see like most

00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:47,040
of these if it's not a bot there might

00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:49,140
be like a fast user name that will come

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:53,399
up like as stalter started a new build

00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:55,740
on the for testing copper so I get is

00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:58,110
mostly tied around like username based

00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:00,180
data with like with the fedora account

00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:02,940
system but there's also other things too

00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:04,860
like you can see a bunch of tasks a Tron

00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:10,380
results from QA they're coming out right

00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:12,690
now to the answer the question so a bit

00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,820
more into it so what fed message does is

00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:16,740
it has a I know a central message hub

00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,570
that listens to all the messages so we

00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,510
have a lot of web apps right so we have

00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:23,399
agar we have copper we have we have like

00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:25,380
lot of great repose so what it does is

00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:28,140
when someone does some kind of an

00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:30,000
activity in that web app it puts out a

00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:32,339
message to fed message so we do a

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:38,640
subscribe to it and we can pull messages

00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:40,740
from fed message all right so our data

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,899
grapple is this tool that you can use to

00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:46,110
actually you know get historic messages

00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:48,740
from this so what you can do is so this

00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,740
is the syntax

00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:27,680
all right so this is the basic syntax

00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,940
for pulling data I use it so what it

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,470
does is you can go to apps that fit our

00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:32,570
project or arcs that's data gripper

00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:34,430
slash draw so you you want the wrong

00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:36,530
messages so you go to this URL and you

00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:39,920
can give you a fast user name there all

00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:41,990
right so can anyone of you give your

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:49,990
fast user name I can I can show you

00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:53,230
sorry II

00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:53,230
[Music]

00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:23,870
Allen it's it might just be the network

00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:23,870
I just refreshed it it's it's loading

00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:10,620
should be back up in a while so this is

00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:13,560
how it works so if you were wondering

00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:16,010
how where I got this data from there is

00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:44,910
a awesome reference tab that you have in

00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:47,150
data this might require a restart of

00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:47,150
data

00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:18,690
so I wanted to show you the API calls so

00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:21,480
these are like a few things you can do

00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:23,730
so if you have a user you have a user

00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,890
tab which you can use to get data about

00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:27,959
the user and if and that will give you

00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:29,790
like all the data user has it will give

00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:32,010
you all this meeting logs it will give

00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:33,329
you a are see messages it will do a lot

00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:35,190
of stuff so if you if you want to

00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:38,010
fine-tune if you want to go deeper into

00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:43,320
it so you can do something like hey I

00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:45,540
want only the meeting stuff so you can

00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,430
do a category is equal to meet Bart and

00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:49,290
it will give you messages only about the

00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:51,510
know me bought messages that were

00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:55,440
generated for that user so this is like

00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:59,070
I won my data and I want data that know

00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,810
only only you know subscribes to the mid

00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:02,339
board so if I was in a meeting it will

00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:04,800
give my give me all the data which was

00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:07,260
coming from the meeting board and this

00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:11,820
also has you know a really cool thing

00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:13,320
called Delta so a delta is of something

00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:15,690
you can use you know to fine-tune the

00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,390
result even further so if I have you

00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:22,050
know if I want data for one week it

00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:28,410
would be the time stamp in epoch time so

00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:31,829
it would be 24 into 60 that would that

00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:33,449
will give you for one day and this would

00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:35,750
you know you can just you can just do

00:14:33,449 --> 00:14:35,750
the math

00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:52,310
oh I think those are not caught by a

00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:56,330
data group data gripper but you have a

00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:58,370
channel for it so it gives you it's it's

00:14:56,330 --> 00:15:00,680
for fedora - I know see it gives you

00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:04,820
messages like here this is down and

00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:06,440
they're swap values are low I don't

00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:10,070
think this goes to data Grapher though

00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:12,970
you cannot search for this because yeah

00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,970
it's a different deal

00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,510
all right so this is a sample response

00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:40,210
you will get from any message so you

00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:42,100
have arguments it will show how many

00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:44,440
pages are there in your response you

00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:47,680
have rows per page how many messages are

00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:49,150
there on one page and you have things

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,620
like wrong messages wrong messages are

00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:52,210
actually the stuff that you know you

00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:54,700
will require so category

00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:57,340
they'll be certificate that's that's not

00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,900
required and little it will have a

00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:00,550
signature it will have a timestamp of

00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:02,020
when this happened and and that is

00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:04,500
something called topic that comes from

00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:08,290
fed message so a fed message has this

00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:10,290
you know really good naming convention

00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:13,450
so you'll have this this is going to be

00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:15,490
this part is going to be same for almost

00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:17,260
all the messages so it is like forever

00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:19,600
project a dog and you have this is

00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:22,480
unprotected so if you if it's on staging

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,430
it will it will be dot STG and you'll

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,520
have stuff like if it's on IRC you will

00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:29,470
have all that Fedora project or prod RC

00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,820
and you'll have whatever comes after

00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:38,100
that so if someone gives me

00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:38,100
I know karma just show you that

00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:09,450
no I think all right so the Delta I was

00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:11,250
talking about you can filter using start

00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:13,470
time and end time so if you if you

00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:15,930
specify a start date you you can get you

00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:17,880
know you can get data from that date and

00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:20,310
if you specify an end date you will have

00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,080
like you know time range where you can

00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:24,450
get data so this is what we use for

00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:27,060
getting data about an even so let's say

00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:29,460
I want to gather data about flock 2017

00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:32,120
what I will do is I'll go to the badges

00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,120
project

00:17:44,409 --> 00:17:49,659
so this is justin's profile on badges

00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,909
yeah so we have this bad so this badge

00:17:57,529 --> 00:18:02,090
is given to all the people who are in

00:17:58,909 --> 00:18:04,639
flock so what we'll be doing is we'll be

00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:06,229
scraping this this website and we'll

00:18:04,639 --> 00:18:08,419
pull all the usernames from there so

00:18:06,229 --> 00:18:10,820
let's see that these people who have

00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:12,619
clay in the bat so far so we'll be

00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:14,989
pulling all this data and we'll be

00:18:12,619 --> 00:18:16,249
taking this and writing a script putting

00:18:14,989 --> 00:18:18,679
it in data gripper so it will be like

00:18:16,249 --> 00:18:20,570
I'm gonna be pulling data from data

00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:22,899
gripper for each of these uses and I

00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:29,080
will be generating graphs out of it

00:18:22,899 --> 00:18:29,080
sorry you can there's a QR code on your

00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:40,190
so if you if you scan that QR a QR code

00:18:37,429 --> 00:18:42,109
you will get this badge so using these

00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:45,080
data I can you know maybe pull data

00:18:42,109 --> 00:18:47,659
let's let's say I was I just pulled my

00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:49,580
data from yesterday or probably for five

00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:51,229
days and I can figure out what I was

00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:54,200
doing so let's say there were poker

00:18:51,229 --> 00:18:57,349
comets and there were no I was an IRC

00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,929
giving karma to someone so those people

00:18:57,349 --> 00:19:02,179
would have that done something right so

00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:06,220
you can gather a lot of data from that

00:19:02,179 --> 00:19:06,220
so I have a few sample reports

00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:42,740
all right so what I did is I pulled data

00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:45,150
of all the cops members for one year and

00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:47,430
so this was pulled by one of the tools I

00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:52,470
made I'll get back to that in a while so

00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:55,950
let's say I want data of Justin I'll go

00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:57,030
to his folder and ok that's this JSON

00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:00,660
data right now

00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:03,090
so that won't make much sense right so

00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:05,820
this is going to be an endless list of

00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:08,220
what he did and it's going to be a list

00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:09,990
of all the you know things that are

00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,670
mentioned in JSON so I want to clarify

00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:14,070
this I want I want to make sense out of

00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:20,580
this so what do I do I write scripts for

00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:24,320
this so I have I have the weekly data of

00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:24,320
commas and I have generated

00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:44,690
so this is the tool I was talking about

00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:46,460
this is the tool I built for my G sock

00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:49,010
so what it does is it it takes messages

00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:50,930
from data gripper and you know you can

00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:53,540
build graphs using it so how it works is

00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:55,970
it's a Python script so you basically go

00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:57,770
ahead and enter the username you want so

00:20:55,970 --> 00:21:00,380
it's going to be an eye arsenic so let's

00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:02,080
say it's a floury I'm sorry it's a it's

00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:04,220
a fast account name so it's gonna be and

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:08,480
just for a quick reference this is in

00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:10,400
phaser dot IO /g sock - starts stats

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,280
it's also in the comm up s-- - a box

00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,290
that we showed earlier

00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:17,030
this takes arguments of username so this

00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:19,790
user is going to be this is the file's

00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:22,130
username and i can specify the mode so

00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:25,220
if it's mode can be jason it can be PNG

00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:27,170
it can be it can it can be like most of

00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:29,960
the image things you use so I'll just go

00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:37,070
with SVG right now and I'll grab this

00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:39,710
data for two weeks so what it does is it

00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:42,830
initializes a background process for

00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:45,580
polling data from data gripper it's it's

00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:45,580
slow because

00:22:08,659 --> 00:22:11,659
okay

00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:00,850
this was built from the Jason I showed

00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,620
you earlier so you know this takes takes

00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:05,110
up to all the messages it it parses it

00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:08,049
into graphs and you get to see what he

00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:09,880
was doing so let's say he was he he has

00:23:08,049 --> 00:23:12,090
he was working there were two thousand

00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:15,490
two hundred and eight messages on wiki

00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:17,080
he he was tagging the packages I mean

00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:28,929
there were he tagged three thirty six

00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:33,100
packages this is for last year so he he

00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:43,480
had 178 messages on github mailman

00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:45,250
track yeah so he was working on for

00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,570
quite some time he he was an IRC he

00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:50,500
doing something he was probably giving

00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:52,210
karma to people and this is hemant so

00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,409
you can even filter out things like if

00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:59,639
you don't want wiki you can just click

00:23:53,409 --> 00:23:59,639
on it and it'll go off yeah those are

00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:07,269
yeah so topics are basically the entire

00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:09,429
string so it's going to be all good

00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:11,350
federal project a dog it's not something

00:24:09,429 --> 00:24:13,360
so that's a topic so if you want to go

00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:15,490
into specific categories like IRC dot

00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:17,710
Karma you can also do that so it's gonna

00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:20,230
be a subcategory of the category it's

00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:22,269
like IRC is the parent and it has a lot

00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:25,450
of styles like IRC karma like IRC

00:24:22,269 --> 00:24:34,750
meeting and stuff like that I think I

00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:37,110
also have stats for that I mean if I if

00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:37,110
I had

00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,960
you

00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:04,170
yeah so this is I I went into the stuff

00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:07,500
and here you can see how what he was

00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:11,450
working on in packer so he was he opened

00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:15,630
a new project so that was like 22 person

00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:17,160
pull requests issues he was working on

00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:18,900
something on issues so it might be

00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:23,010
creating issues it might be editing it

00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:26,400
and this is good so this is maybe he

00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:36,540
made gate pushes comments and there was

00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:50,760
one pull request I guess yeah so this is

00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:54,900
part of so so he had 109 messages out of

00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:58,710
that he had like 60% where something to

00:25:54,900 --> 00:26:00,390
deal with the shoes and stuff in this in

00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:01,530
this example used raw percentages but

00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:03,630
you'd still be able to get the raw

00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:07,080
numbers out of the lab data grabber for

00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:08,490
that anyone have any questions so far or

00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:13,130
anything they want answer before we keep

00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:13,130
going cool

00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:21,800
and there's something you can you can

00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:23,390
also generate markdown reports so let's

00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:25,370
say if you want to push your reports to

00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:26,630
github you can you can generate a

00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:28,780
markdown report so it would look

00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:32,230
something like this you can basically

00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:46,490
see what he was doing it's on wiki page

00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:48,650
ok that's a lot yeah so this is the

00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:50,510
specific things he was doing so he was

00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:55,430
like commented on a ticket he edited the

00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:57,200
priority and he tagged tickets so these

00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:59,780
are like specific things he was doing so

00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:02,990
this is the graphs we show you I have

00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:05,570
there is a visualization of this there's

00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:13,310
also something called the GAO's report I

00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:14,720
I don't have it right now but so a GAO's

00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:16,940
report is something really cool it's

00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:20,000
like a live visualization so if I if I

00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:22,310
pull data for one year and if I run the

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,660
GAO's visualization it would show you it

00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:25,580
will show you a really cool graph of

00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:28,160
what's happening and how much messages

00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:38,510
were there each week and stuff so I I

00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:41,230
could have shown that but let's see if

00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:41,230
that works

00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:36,580
we actually do have a post a few posts

00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:40,130
on the comm blog that actually shows a

00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:41,450
three part series on gorse let me see if

00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:44,800
I can just pull these up and I'll show

00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:44,800
them on my laptop really quick

00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,700
you

00:29:54,990 --> 00:30:00,370
so gorse is it's a visualization for

00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,530
some of the development history it uses

00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:04,929
a version control system and will

00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:07,150
animate it when two active animations

00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:08,409
like video yeah here we go so you might

00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:11,440
have seen something like this before

00:30:08,409 --> 00:30:13,059
so gorse is actually taking all of the

00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,460
activity I guess in this case it's for

00:30:13,059 --> 00:30:21,130
the fedora calendaring system and this

00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:22,720
is going through all of 2015 and let me

00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:26,549
see if we can put these links up to the

00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,549
community blog there's actually a tag

00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:36,039
it's community blog dot Fedora project

00:30:32,169 --> 00:30:39,940
org slash tag slash gorse

00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:41,799
actually again yep that one this is we

00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:44,860
have this a three part series about

00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:46,179
Michael I contributed now what and this

00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:48,190
is this was something that we did about

00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:50,140
a year ago which was trying to go deeper

00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:52,210
into why people contribute to the Fedora

00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:53,650
project and it was using gorse as kind

00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:56,020
of the tool to make some of those

00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:58,210
conclusions with the data that it was

00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,980
pulling from could you may go and play

00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:04,150
one of those two that we have I can't

00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:06,309
what we did in this one in part one you

00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:08,380
which one was this for is that all three

00:31:06,309 --> 00:31:11,799
of these did different topics in the Fed

00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:16,470
message bus iscandar which ones are

00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:19,840
which so this was I think was this

00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:22,600
always this all a Fed message for 20 so

00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:29,230
yeah this is all the fedora in 2015 for

00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:30,880
everything IRC sure track this is kind

00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:34,059
of like a cool way to get a

00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,530
visualization out of it and and in this

00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:37,150
case the the series that's on the comm

00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:39,070
blog actually just tried to make sense

00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:40,900
of what all this is it's not just - I

00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:44,230
mean it's kind of cool to watch anyways

00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:46,299
but there actually are some ways you can

00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:47,650
use this to try to do I mean you can

00:31:46,299 --> 00:31:49,690
kind of see a visualization - like all

00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:51,580
these hot pockets of where all this

00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:53,590
attention and where a lot of activity is

00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:55,120
and fedora and you can also kind of see

00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:56,440
- there's a lot of areas that probably

00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,480
aren't going to be well represented

00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:00,100
there like for example the ambassadors

00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,840
are the developer the development side

00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:03,399
of fedora is obviously getting you can

00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,250
see some of the hot pockets with like

00:32:03,399 --> 00:32:07,929
the track and phaser repos but on the

00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:10,299
other side you also would probably see a

00:32:07,929 --> 00:32:14,080
a lot of either if they're smaller areas

00:32:10,299 --> 00:32:14,980
it might be like a event report but

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,450
there's things that aren't well

00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:18,730
represented in the Fed message bus as

00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:20,710
well that's something that is we're

00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:23,350
trying to think more about and try to

00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:25,149
find ways to get that get ways to

00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:27,669
represent that activity into the Fed

00:32:25,149 --> 00:32:30,580
message bus but it is a little more

00:32:27,669 --> 00:32:32,379
challenging because it is more soft soft

00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:35,580
kind of activity it's not something you

00:32:32,379 --> 00:32:40,899
can track with get get push pull request

00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:43,779
meeting end meeting start so it is kind

00:32:40,899 --> 00:32:46,570
of a nice way to see that too in this

00:32:43,779 --> 00:32:53,619
case part three and this was from part

00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:54,850
three this was the aggregate which yeah

00:32:53,619 --> 00:32:56,440
so if you look at all the blog posts

00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:58,570
here you can see activity from fedora

00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:02,110
elections the infrastructure get repos

00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:05,139
kernel regression testing IRC karma and

00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:06,999
the Fedora calendar as well which is

00:33:05,139 --> 00:33:09,940
also nice if you're if you have your own

00:33:06,999 --> 00:33:11,769
project that's in Fisher and if you want

00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:13,749
to build visualizations like this you

00:33:11,769 --> 00:33:15,220
can actually create these so the tool

00:33:13,749 --> 00:33:18,789
that's used to make these is actually

00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:21,999
called fed message to gorse can you pull

00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:23,490
that repo up really quick too and this

00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:27,490
is a tool that you can actually use to

00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:31,389
take data from fed message manipulate it

00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:35,159
with data grepper if I'm right and then

00:33:31,389 --> 00:33:38,470
you can actually yeah I guess it's on on

00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:40,330
Ralph's github we should probably move

00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:43,899
that to for sure now that I think about

00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:45,850
it but this is a tool you can use you

00:33:43,899 --> 00:33:48,100
just use image magic fed message of

00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:50,950
course some of the fedora infrastructure

00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:52,509
packaging for fed message you can choose

00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:54,159
just like you we were doing earlier with

00:33:52,509 --> 00:33:56,110
data gripper you can see that you just

00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:58,029
run as a Python script you use the

00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:59,889
amount of days that you want to use and

00:33:58,029 --> 00:34:01,090
then you can also filter it down with

00:33:59,889 --> 00:34:04,539
some of the different topics or

00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:06,249
categories in picture as well you can do

00:34:04,539 --> 00:34:08,409
this you can either use this as a

00:34:06,249 --> 00:34:10,629
standalone tool to generate data from

00:34:08,409 --> 00:34:13,089
fed message or you can integrate it with

00:34:10,629 --> 00:34:15,429
your own program so let's say I wrote my

00:34:13,089 --> 00:34:17,980
scripts and my scripts was initially

00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:20,169
just PNG s and s VG's so I wanted to

00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:21,669
extend that so I use this so I just use

00:34:20,169 --> 00:34:23,859
this as a Python wrapper

00:34:21,669 --> 00:34:26,619
and I integrated this code into my code

00:34:23,859 --> 00:34:29,230
base so the score is available and this

00:34:26,619 --> 00:34:31,389
also has a Python API so you can just go

00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:33,279
ahead and include that in your your own

00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:36,179
code base and you can generate beautiful

00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:36,179
girls graphs out of it

00:34:43,589 --> 00:34:50,579
right so I'll give you a quick

00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:50,579
walkthrough of what I've been doing

00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:43,150
so for this tool I actually took some

00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:45,579
time to you know add a help menu to it

00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:47,619
so what you can do is you can do a lot

00:35:45,579 --> 00:35:49,839
of stuff with this so the thing is this

00:35:47,619 --> 00:35:52,150
requires a mandatory username so that's

00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:53,769
kind of obvious so if you want to you

00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:56,440
know pull data of a specific user let's

00:35:53,769 --> 00:35:59,259
say I want to pull data of Justin I'll

00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:02,499
just specify - you or - - user and I'll

00:35:59,259 --> 00:36:04,210
give the first username and let's say if

00:36:02,499 --> 00:36:06,249
you want to pull all the data for a

00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:08,799
category so you will be mentioning - you

00:36:06,249 --> 00:36:10,599
all so that's like all the user names

00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:13,380
and there's something called category

00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:15,400
you can use that is like IRC or peg or

00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:18,069
whichever category you want to pull data

00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:20,049
from and then there's start date and end

00:36:18,069 --> 00:36:21,880
date which you can use that that's going

00:36:20,049 --> 00:36:23,410
to directly go to Fred message and gonna

00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,930
pull data for only that amount of time

00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:27,970
and there's going to be a group

00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:29,499
statistics so what this is going to be

00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:30,849
helpful is let's say if you want to

00:36:29,499 --> 00:36:32,890
generate a report for the federal

00:36:30,849 --> 00:36:35,619
council meeting you can just go ahead

00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:37,569
and run this tool and and gather your

00:36:35,619 --> 00:36:39,489
data for an year and you can you know

00:36:37,569 --> 00:36:41,440
generate graphs out of it and for the

00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:43,150
report you can say hey we did this we

00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,400
had so many messages in Pilger and we

00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:48,039
did so so we did closed out so many

00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:50,410
tickets and stuff and then there's a

00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:52,210
logging mode where you can dump the JSON

00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:53,859
so if you if you want to write any other

00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:56,980
specific metric tools you can go ahead

00:36:53,859 --> 00:37:00,009
and do that using the log the log method

00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:02,349
and mode is the type of output so let's

00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:05,200
say if you wanted an SVG so you just

00:37:02,349 --> 00:37:07,720
type - m/s wheezing and if you want it

00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:10,089
in PNG you will just - minus M and PNG

00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:12,910
and it's going to be there are going to

00:37:10,089 --> 00:37:15,220
be weeks so you can specify - - weeks or

00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:17,289
- W so if you want to pull data for like

00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:18,940
three weeks or four weeks in this go

00:37:17,289 --> 00:37:20,680
ahead and specific hey I want data for

00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:23,230
only four weeks so this is going to give

00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:25,660
you data for weeks and there's also this

00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:27,519
mode called interactive mode so if you

00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:29,619
run this tool with - I it's going to

00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:31,509
power Pascal 8k what's so user name you

00:37:29,619 --> 00:37:33,910
want to pull data for so I'll just type

00:37:31,509 --> 00:37:36,039
in my username and like is there a

00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:38,499
specific length for which you want data

00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:40,700
so it's like you can specify number of

00:37:38,499 --> 00:37:42,920
weeks so you can specify a date

00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:44,450
so you don't have to like script it so

00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:46,549
it will it will do all the hard work for

00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:49,960
you it will prompt you to enter stuff

00:37:46,549 --> 00:37:49,960
and yeah

00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:59,680
this is a really bad time for data

00:38:33,310 --> 00:39:01,360
Grapher to be down all right so I talked

00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,890
about all the nice things data Grapher

00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:05,080
can do but there are some limitations of

00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:07,360
data gripper so the first thing is it's

00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:09,580
not very reliable as you can see right

00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:12,070
now so you will need some kind of a

00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:13,810
local stash that you will know you will

00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:16,060
need to store all the data so let's say

00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:18,490
I want to generate this data you know

00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:19,840
like maybe after 2 years or maybe after

00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:23,470
3 years I will have to pull all the data

00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:25,330
again so we came up with so the in

00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:36,540
fedora infra rapport we have something

00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:36,540
called stats cache it's

00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:51,980
yeah so this is a tool that works with

00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,810
data gripper so this is going to pull

00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:56,420
data from data gripper and it's gonna

00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:57,920
store in local database so so this is

00:39:56,420 --> 00:40:00,050
going to be a one-time process so if you

00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,300
pull data once you can pull data from

00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:04,300
2013 to 16 and you can store it locally

00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:06,740
so the next time you wanna you know

00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:08,510
generate data for a user you don't have

00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:10,819
to go to data gripper and pull data you

00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:13,670
can just directly communicate with SATs

00:40:10,819 --> 00:40:16,400
cache and you can know like build

00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:18,920
dashboards out of this so this is I

00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:21,740
don't think this is like quite not

00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:25,310
maintained so no Bex found out this

00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:27,230
really cool tool called possible so that

00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:29,270
is by meteor team so I was going through

00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:34,579
that so that that looks like quite

00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:37,369
interesting yeah so this is the tool I'm

00:40:34,579 --> 00:40:39,020
talking about so what this does is this

00:40:37,369 --> 00:40:41,300
integrates with a lot of services so we

00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:43,550
have we have instance of hyper cutting

00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:48,170
we have get we have a lot of git repos

00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:50,750
so instead of you know doing a get

00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:52,970
request for all the things what we can

00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:55,970
do is we can build a fed message wrapper

00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:57,920
around this tool and this list basically

00:40:55,970 --> 00:41:00,200
runs on the L track so it's elastic

00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:03,319
Starck elastic search log stash and

00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:06,290
Cabana so elastic search is is the place

00:41:03,319 --> 00:41:07,910
where you dump all the data log stash is

00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:11,109
the one that provides the data and

00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:15,790
Cabana is the dashboard so what I have

00:41:11,109 --> 00:41:15,790
said this app I'll give you a quick demo

00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:53,740
all right so this is a sample code for

00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:57,579
getting data from hyper kitty so hyper

00:41:53,740 --> 00:42:00,430
kitties is their friend and for the

00:41:57,579 --> 00:42:03,369
mailing lists so what you can do is you

00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:05,500
can specify the URL of the hyper kitty

00:42:03,369 --> 00:42:08,770
here so it's like I'm pulling data for

00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:10,839
federal join and then you can you know

00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:12,430
mention where you want to archive it so

00:42:10,839 --> 00:42:15,670
I'm going to store it in some place call

00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:17,890
archives and then you can you can

00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:19,089
specify a date time here from where you

00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:20,890
want the messages so it's going to be

00:42:19,089 --> 00:42:23,980
like from message in report fetch I'm

00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:31,290
going to fetch all the data from from

00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:31,290
our archives from 2014 so when I do that

00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:40,059
it's gonna store everything and

00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:43,089
something called inbox format so this is

00:42:40,059 --> 00:42:46,680
this is going to be archives of I know

00:42:43,089 --> 00:42:50,230
all the Mail's from 2014 to 2017 and

00:42:46,680 --> 00:43:00,309
then there's something called a mailbox

00:42:50,230 --> 00:43:02,530
plugin yeah so what this does is it it

00:43:00,309 --> 00:43:04,510
kind of parses whatever is in mailbox

00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:09,880
and it will give you data out of it

00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:13,569
so this this is actually a JSON format

00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:15,790
so this is going to print let's say the

00:43:13,569 --> 00:43:18,490
raw JSON so if you want stuff than that

00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:20,880
let's let's see what what are the stuff

00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:20,880
in there

00:43:50,830 --> 00:44:06,310
I have a problem with one thing that I

00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:08,260
think is worth clarifying too about

00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:10,390
we're showing you all these like these

00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:12,400
really cool visualizations and data and

00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:13,990
that's all there and it's there for you

00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,090
to work with and access but then it's

00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:18,070
kind of like so what it's here you can

00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:19,660
see it what's the point of having all

00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:21,880
this data what can you actually do with

00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:23,920
it what can you use it for there's kind

00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:27,670
of this one of the things with comm Ops

00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:29,260
is one of our kind of the motivations

00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:31,960
that we have is this idea of

00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:33,670
storytelling and when you look at a

00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,870
project like fedora you have all of

00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:37,240
these different corners that are all

00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:38,590
doing their own thing but at the same

00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:41,620
time we're still part of this bigger

00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:43,930
project and when you can see understand

00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:46,750
what's happening in your community in

00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:48,490
your project it makes it a lot different

00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:49,930
when you're thinking like I don't really

00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:51,550
know what's happening over here I don't

00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:54,670
know what's happening in this place when

00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:57,010
you can take this data make sense out of

00:44:54,670 --> 00:45:00,100
it and make interpretations make

00:44:57,010 --> 00:45:02,200
conclusions about like what we did was a

00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:06,190
talk at last year's flock that went into

00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:08,230
like it was like a analysis of the

00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:11,110
lifespan of a contributor and in this

00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:13,960
case we actually saw that in a year in

00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:17,470
2016 of the people that entered the

00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:19,300
Fedora project a majority of the people

00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:21,550
that entered fedora only stayed in the

00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:22,750
project for three months the majority of

00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:25,960
that some of them would continue

00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:27,430
contributing others were active for for

00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,870
less than three months but a majority of

00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:31,720
them were active in the community for

00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:32,980
three months and by using these tools we

00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:34,660
were able to see that we would never

00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:36,700
have been able to no understand like oh

00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:38,530
hey people started dropping off like

00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:40,300
they attended less meetings and then

00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:41,770
there was just this drop-off towards the

00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:44,410
end where they stopped contributing to

00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:46,660
the project and in this case if you have

00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:48,280
your own project in Fedora or you have

00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:51,240
something that's in the Fed message bus

00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:54,130
you can actually use this data to try to

00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:56,740
make interpretations and conclusions

00:45:54,130 --> 00:46:00,580
about things happening right in your own

00:45:56,740 --> 00:46:01,900
and your own part of the project - and

00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:04,900
when you can take this and actually make

00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:07,650
sensible interpretations and conclude

00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:11,079
it lets you the project maintainer or

00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:12,579
part of a community team actually have a

00:46:11,079 --> 00:46:14,440
better understanding of what's happening

00:46:12,579 --> 00:46:16,780
and find ways you can improve on how you

00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:19,450
engage with people in your project like

00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:20,619
for example like the design team if you

00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:22,150
have some of these data are some of

00:46:20,619 --> 00:46:23,950
these tools you can better understand

00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:25,960
maybe weak points and maybe your

00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:27,280
onboarding process or maybe there's a

00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:29,470
point where you see people get started

00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:31,240
like with fedora badges and then they

00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:32,859
drop off after a point well what was

00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:35,079
that blocker when you know that that's

00:46:32,859 --> 00:46:37,329
the point where people drop off then you

00:46:35,079 --> 00:46:39,099
can dive deeper and you can understand

00:46:37,329 --> 00:46:40,480
like oh this is what we might need to

00:46:39,099 --> 00:46:42,970
look at a little bit more I didn't

00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,770
realize people would make one badge and

00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:45,880
then they would drop off was it there

00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:47,260
they didn't feel like they were really

00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:49,900
contributing or was there something that

00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:52,089
was a disconnect there with this data

00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:54,070
with these statistics that's what kind

00:46:52,089 --> 00:46:56,020
of gives you the base to go off of when

00:46:54,070 --> 00:46:58,420
you know what the when you have an idea

00:46:56,020 --> 00:47:00,099
of where that cut off or what problem

00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:02,230
there is then you can actually start

00:47:00,099 --> 00:47:03,520
making a plan you can make you have an

00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:06,420
idea of what's happening and you can try

00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,420
to fix a problem

00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:41,180
yeah so yeah so the question is is

00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:49,070
mirror data available in the Fed message

00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:51,290
bus for you to view and work with so

00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:56,990
okay so to get the mirror data into the

00:47:51,290 --> 00:47:58,550
Fed message bus yeah so if you wanted

00:47:56,990 --> 00:48:00,950
metadata I think you would you would

00:47:58,550 --> 00:48:04,550
want to talk with the infra people

00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:08,270
because I don't think normal people have

00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:10,460
access to the server so as oma DM said

00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:13,100
there are no trackers that we use to

00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:15,980
identify user so all we have a specific

00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:17,660
set of IP addresses so obviously for

00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:19,700
obviously cuz we cannot give out IP

00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:22,790
addresses of peoples and that would be

00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:26,350
problem so if it's a public IP then no

00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:26,350
that would be if it'd fall into them

00:48:49,790 --> 00:48:53,810
yeah I definitely think there would be

00:48:52,460 --> 00:49:00,380
ways I'm assuming this is like mirror

00:48:53,810 --> 00:49:02,060
manager right is the software for yeah I

00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:04,280
mean I think there would definitely be a

00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:06,410
way to get fed message integration or

00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:08,900
some kind of support for collecting data

00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:09,920
and demure manager like sachin mentioned

00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:12,280
we would have to be a little bit careful

00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:15,410
about what kind of data we're collecting

00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:16,640
but i think there would be a lot of

00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,840
these these are all libraries like all

00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,670
these applications in fedora

00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:22,970
infrastructure are using the fed message

00:49:19,670 --> 00:49:25,400
libraries to to send messages to emit

00:49:22,970 --> 00:49:27,290
messages on with the bus so i know it

00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:28,730
would be possible to probably get i

00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:31,190
don't know the mir manager project that

00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:32,750
well but i definitely think it would be

00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:34,250
possible at least get some try to get

00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:36,080
some kind of meaningful data out of that

00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:38,000
i think that would actually be probably

00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:40,490
a really valuable place to try to get

00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,800
some data to understand more about our

00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:43,700
users instead of just our contributor

00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,800
community too

00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:47,420
specifically i don't know how to how to

00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:49,250
go forward on that but i know that the

00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:51,200
the possibility for integrating it and

00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:54,350
working with fed message is definitely

00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:56,990
there so this is one part of the

00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:59,390
possible tool so this is using mailbox

00:49:56,990 --> 00:50:01,490
and hyper katie so what it does is it

00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:03,050
pulls all the data from the archives and

00:50:01,490 --> 00:50:04,970
this is a one-time process right so if

00:50:03,050 --> 00:50:07,100
you put the data once it's going to be

00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:08,660
archived in your local stash and you

00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:10,940
won't have to ever connect to internet

00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:12,700
again to gather statistics and this is a

00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:15,080
good thing because you know it's your

00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:17,270
saving bandwidth and you don't put

00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:20,330
stress on servers like I did on the data

00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:23,810
Grapher all right so these are the stuff

00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:25,910
you can grab from the mailbox so it's

00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:27,380
going to be UNIX from and there's going

00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:30,620
to be a content type it's it's not

00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:33,440
really was to gather statistics on you

00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:35,240
have from to subject you have the body

00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:39,020
or if it's a reply it's it in reply to

00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:43,070
and then you have the date so I I just

00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:44,990
grabbed the from field from the messages

00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:46,310
and it looks something like this so this

00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:48,950
is just plain text this is I'm just

00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:51,620
printing this in Python so what I can do

00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:55,130
is I can I can go ahead and I know store

00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:57,500
this somewhere so I will put that in

00:50:55,130 --> 00:51:02,900
stats cache I mean sorry I'll put that

00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:04,699
in log stash and so log stash is this

00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:06,859
tool like

00:51:04,699 --> 00:51:08,299
no stats guys that I mentioned so it's

00:51:06,859 --> 00:51:10,190
what it's gonna do is it's gonna

00:51:08,299 --> 00:51:12,890
gathered all the data and it's gonna in

00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:14,900
race the data so let's say I have from

00:51:12,890 --> 00:51:17,719
and and let's say I have sent five

00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:19,160
messages so you know this to a possible

00:51:17,719 --> 00:51:21,859
tool is not very intelligent to

00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:24,799
understand these are same so what it

00:51:21,859 --> 00:51:26,690
does is it puts into log stash and logs

00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:29,239
test is going to categorize stuff

00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:30,890
together let's say I have like messages

00:51:29,239 --> 00:51:32,660
from Eskimo that Fedora projects so then

00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:34,069
there are five messages so that's going

00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:36,579
to Club it together and it's going to

00:51:34,069 --> 00:51:36,579
enrich the data

00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:05,930
yeah so this is the tool that actually

00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:08,599
you know you can use to build dashboards

00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:13,000
from what data we have so I have added

00:52:08,599 --> 00:52:17,050
that data in in into a Cabana and

00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,050
there's this tab called visualize

00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:27,750
so what you will be ideally doing is

00:52:26,279 --> 00:52:30,599
you'll be adding a new visualization

00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:32,910
after so I have added all the mailbox

00:52:30,599 --> 00:52:35,279
data into this so I can choose what

00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:38,819
graphs I want so let's say I want to do

00:52:35,279 --> 00:52:42,740
a pie chart and then I'll click on

00:52:38,819 --> 00:52:42,740
mailbox so that's the data I added

00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:35,640
yeah

00:55:08,830 --> 00:55:13,910
so the question was we have all of these

00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:16,340
tools we have all this data but what's

00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:18,440
kind of the next step for where we're

00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:20,840
going to go with the project for making

00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:22,640
this and do consistent actionable data

00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:25,610
that we can make sense out of and try to

00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:31,810
use to make real plans and actions in

00:55:25,610 --> 00:55:34,550
Fedora yes

00:55:31,810 --> 00:55:36,650
all this while we have been using you

00:55:34,550 --> 00:55:39,260
know a lot of custom metrics like we we

00:55:36,650 --> 00:55:41,510
had a lot of Python scripts to generate

00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:43,310
data so that is something we cannot you

00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:45,230
know actively maintain because it's it's

00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:48,080
gonna be either lost in some federal

00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:50,180
repo or it's is this not you know

00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:52,190
reusable right so what we are going to

00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:54,020
do is we are gonna take all the fad

00:55:52,190 --> 00:55:56,570
message data and we're going to put it

00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:58,910
into this tag we're gonna use possible

00:55:56,570 --> 00:56:00,950
on it so the long-term plan is you know

00:55:58,910 --> 00:56:03,650
to write a plug-in for percival that's

00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:06,680
going to gather all the data so what you

00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:08,980
can do is possible have has this tool

00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:08,980
called

00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:21,010
no right now a will have support

00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:23,830
for ass bored they can gather data from

00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:27,250
good github there's hype ok t0 and stuff

00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:31,960
like that so maybe in around five to six

00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:36,609
months we'll will have a and yeah this

00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:38,710
is so you can use these things you know

00:56:36,609 --> 00:56:43,000
to pull data so let's say I I have I

00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:45,340
need to pull data for let's say a sport

00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:47,619
so I can just write scripts for this I

00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:49,480
can write a plug-in for it and I can put

00:56:47,619 --> 00:56:51,210
all this data into dashboard and I can

00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:53,590
know build dashboards on the fly and

00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:55,060
let's say I want Fred message we don't

00:56:53,590 --> 00:56:57,040
have you know specific things for Fred

00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:59,350
message yet so I'm you know I'm planning

00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:01,869
to contribute to this project and write

00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:05,530
a phat message plug-in for this so you

00:57:01,869 --> 00:57:07,720
could do something like percival space

00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:10,210
fred message and then you can specify a

00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:11,980
category i it's gonna get all the data

00:57:10,210 --> 00:57:14,230
for that category and you can build

00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:17,950
whatever you want on Kabana like as you

00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:20,050
can see here i mean i think the data

00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:22,390
bridge is not refreshed and it requires

00:57:20,050 --> 00:57:24,850
quite a lot of internet so what it does

00:57:22,390 --> 00:57:26,410
is you can go here you can select what

00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:28,690
you want so let's say this is like m box

00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:30,700
data and this kind of requested refresh

00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:35,320
but i don't have the bandwidth to do

00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:37,780
that right now so this is you know this

00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:40,630
has everything in mail box from this is

00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:42,940
Federline archives from 2014 to 17 so

00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:45,520
this has all the data so if you want I

00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:46,900
know let's say data from 2016 to 17 you

00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:48,400
don't have to write a special script for

00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:50,109
it so you're just going to go here

00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:52,660
select the dates and there's going to

00:57:50,109 --> 00:57:54,700
build a graph for you so we'll have this

00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:57,010
the you know dashboard you know probably

00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:58,720
in our infrastructure and anyone can go

00:57:57,010 --> 00:58:01,359
there and build dashboards and share

00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:02,740
with the community and just to kind of

00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:06,609
add on top of that it's kind of like

00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:08,230
this like so what you can see I can in

00:58:06,609 --> 00:58:10,150
this tool specifically it has a lot of

00:58:08,230 --> 00:58:11,890
support for all these different hooks

00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:14,830
and backends that we are already using

00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:16,150
in fedora and it is kind of big idea

00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:18,550
that we have all this data and we don't

00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:20,890
want to ask the ambassador's we don't

00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:23,830
want to go to the Ambassador like hey if

00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:26,560
you want to have a fancy charting graph

00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:28,600
you can come write your own metric stack

00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:28,990
for ax or Metra or your own dashboard

00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:31,450
for

00:58:28,990 --> 00:58:33,730
we don't want to make it hard for other

00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:35,290
people to get this information so part

00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:36,940
of this go like why these tools like

00:58:35,290 --> 00:58:39,700
Gabbana and you might know other ones

00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:42,369
like Griffon ax as well what they are

00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:44,470
really great at doing is making sense of

00:58:42,369 --> 00:58:46,450
what all this data is really doing in a

00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:47,650
really easy to understand format like

00:58:46,450 --> 00:58:49,119
you can see you can have all these

00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:52,230
different kinds of charts you can have

00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:54,430
like a pie chart vertical bar graphs a

00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:56,500
gauges and there's all these different

00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:58,630
ways that you can visualize this data

00:58:56,500 --> 00:59:00,250
and turn it into something that and you

00:58:58,630 --> 00:59:02,800
can point anybody to look at and be like

00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:05,200
oh I understand this this makes sense

00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:07,599
this isn't a giant JSON blob file that I

00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:09,460
can't read so that's why like this is

00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:10,930
part of like the the next step of how

00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:13,330
we're going to get there and do this

00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:15,490
because it's really taking it from this

00:59:13,330 --> 00:59:17,140
point where we have all this data and

00:59:15,490 --> 00:59:18,430
we're writing all these manual reports

00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:20,260
and it's really hard to kind of

00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:22,359
bootstrap people into this and it's

00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:24,280
really confusing this is kind of this

00:59:22,359 --> 00:59:27,790
platform or we can start pointing people

00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:31,830
to and be like hey here's your dashboard

00:59:27,790 --> 00:59:35,050
for comm ops or for a specific project

00:59:31,830 --> 00:59:36,640
it's really kind of the the next step

00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:39,580
for how we're going to actually make it

00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:41,500
easy for anyone in Fedora to make sense

00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:43,570
of this data because it is like a lot of

00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:45,490
this right now is like writing your own

00:59:43,570 --> 00:59:47,830
Python and plugins and scripts to pull

00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:49,630
this data out and we know like not some

00:59:47,830 --> 00:59:51,190
people if you're all if you're all about

00:59:49,630 --> 00:59:53,710
that we would love to have you come by

00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:55,780
comm ops and spend some time with us but

00:59:53,710 --> 00:59:57,730
if you're not we want to try to make

00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:59,440
that easier for other people in the

00:59:57,730 --> 01:00:02,440
project to understand and that's

00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:04,780
ultimately what the goal of Cabana of a

01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:06,940
visualization of dashboards that's what

01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:08,560
the big picture of this is so this is

01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:10,480
kind of how we're trying to make sense

01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:13,089
of all this and make it easy to share

01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:15,160
with the rest of the Fedora community so

01:00:13,089 --> 01:00:17,470
that way you don't have to be the Python

01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:21,070
wizard to make sense of what's happening

01:00:17,470 --> 01:00:22,690
in your own sub project if that's not we

01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:26,099
want your feedback but we don't want to

01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:26,099
make you write Python code

01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:59,650
yeah actually we have some people in

01:00:58,450 --> 01:01:02,920
carbs who are interested in building

01:00:59,650 --> 01:01:05,320
stuff like this so like three people I'm

01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:08,080
working with so we recently build you

01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:09,760
know a graph which would show ambassador

01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:11,500
locations by activity so that's

01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:14,080
something we recently did so we have

01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:15,820
people do you know work on Python and

01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:19,210
you know when to build the fad message

01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:21,250
plugin so maybe next year Matthew will

01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:22,690
not know how to write the scripts and

01:01:21,250 --> 01:01:27,310
run it for 16 hours you can just go to

01:01:22,690 --> 01:01:28,750
this dashboard and he can justify I

01:01:27,310 --> 01:01:31,210
think an action item that we definitely

01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:32,800
do have on our plate is to start

01:01:31,210 --> 01:01:35,080
conversations with people and/or

01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:36,630
infrastructure to start basically the

01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:38,830
same things we're dealing now I

01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:40,270
definitely recognize the need that we

01:01:38,830 --> 01:01:42,400
need to have cross collaboration and

01:01:40,270 --> 01:01:43,570
pollination on these ideas so I

01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,430
definitely that's probably one of our

01:01:43,570 --> 01:01:49,330
biggest action items right now is to

01:01:45,430 --> 01:01:51,280
start those conversations and try to get

01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:53,530
some support from other people in the in

01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:55,720
the project community to help us build

01:01:53,530 --> 01:01:57,850
those tools so we do have some we kind

01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:59,380
of do have some group of people in cops

01:01:57,850 --> 01:02:00,940
working on that but I would like to try

01:01:59,380 --> 01:02:02,800
to cross pollinate it out to

01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:04,300
infrastructure so I'd say that's

01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:07,840
definitely I can action item that we are

01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:12,430
it's it's on the table they answer the

01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:15,700
question stuff like I think that's also

01:02:12,430 --> 01:02:17,620
taken care of by fedora hubs so if I'm

01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:20,160
not wrong that's the feature you also

01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:22,360
have let's say we have something like I

01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:25,090
need to get the batch for making

01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:26,710
thousand Vicki edits and so I we can

01:02:25,090 --> 01:02:28,090
have something like how many have made

01:02:26,710 --> 01:02:35,500
and how many to go so it's like you are

01:02:28,090 --> 01:02:37,360
50 person the goal so I think it's

01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:40,690
already there on hubs I think sign is

01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:43,000
here so you you have a progress thing

01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:45,940
right like you have you are like so many

01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:48,510
messages away from this badge I saw that

01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:48,510
in the mock-ups

01:03:12,510 --> 01:03:17,740
so just to get that clarification - so

01:03:15,579 --> 01:03:19,569
for the grimore or for the Cabana kind

01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:22,720
of visualizations it's more of focusing

01:03:19,569 --> 01:03:24,700
on the community-wide for do our project

01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:27,609
holistic view whereas there is some

01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:29,559
support already in fedora hubs at a more

01:03:27,609 --> 01:03:31,690
individualistic contributor level like

01:03:29,559 --> 01:03:34,390
the example was I'm this many messages

01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:36,190
away from getting like a mailman badge

01:03:34,390 --> 01:03:38,829
on this many commits away from getting a

01:03:36,190 --> 01:03:40,720
perjurer badge that would be more like

01:03:38,829 --> 01:03:42,849
the individualistic level which is what

01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:44,799
support or it's in progress for hubs

01:03:42,849 --> 01:03:47,289
this is more of like at the holistic

01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:55,480
big-picture view for the entire Fedora

01:03:47,289 --> 01:03:58,450
project so does anyone have any other

01:03:55,480 --> 01:04:00,039
questions or ideas or feedback on

01:03:58,450 --> 01:04:01,779
metrics or anything that they you came

01:04:00,039 --> 01:04:03,190
here you were like I really was curious

01:04:01,779 --> 01:04:05,140
about this then you didn't hear it

01:04:03,190 --> 01:04:13,390
answer or you're still wondering about

01:04:05,140 --> 01:04:14,349
all right so I think from this point on

01:04:13,390 --> 01:04:17,859
we're kind of going to go and switch

01:04:14,349 --> 01:04:19,240
over to a hack session since there's a

01:04:17,859 --> 01:04:21,039
decent amount of people in this room I

01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:23,019
think it'll be really great I don't know

01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:24,190
how many of you have I mentioned it at

01:04:23,019 --> 01:04:27,460
the beginning of this session about this

01:04:24,190 --> 01:04:31,869
fedora appreciation day ticket that

01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:33,039
we've had for a while so I think that

01:04:31,869 --> 01:04:35,769
might be one thing that we work on from

01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:37,539
here on out and a few other things I

01:04:35,769 --> 01:04:38,500
just need to pull up we had some we

01:04:37,539 --> 01:04:39,819
haven't either pad with some of these

01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:41,769
tickets highlighted but I think from

01:04:39,819 --> 01:04:44,940
here it'll be a little bit more I'm

01:04:41,769 --> 01:04:44,940
