alright break up

00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:14,110
what Heights right hello I'm Michael i'm

00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:17,380
here to present today the state of the

00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:20,080
server group so many you probably don't

00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:23,410
know me i work for IBM I'm recently on

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,779
the server working team and I happen to

00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:27,340
be one that was coming to Poland and so

00:00:25,779 --> 00:00:28,810
I could help present this because

00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:32,110
there's been some changes on the group

00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:34,720
lately so i might not be the deepest in

00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:42,640
all the areas um what will work through

00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:47,280
that so we're going to just start with

00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:50,969
what's been happening since the last one

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,770
and what Fedora 23 we've been seeing

00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:59,800
some things going in for the server

00:00:53,770 --> 00:01:04,089
roles the free IPA the cockpit first

00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:07,090
release what the media install did we

00:01:04,089 --> 00:01:11,200
get some of the other ones no let's go

00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:12,819
back so I work for IBM I'm a secondary

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,130
our cheese guy so a couple of them that

00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:17,890
I care about that i didn't get on here

00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:19,780
is that we were able to deliver

00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:23,920
secondary or primary for the first time

00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:26,170
ever thank you Peter one of the other

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,390
things that I care about this from where

00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:31,509
we're coming over is on the whole open

00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:34,330
QA effort so open QA is running in the

00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:37,790
primary arches one of the things i want

00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:41,180
to do is find Adam is Adam in the room

00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:42,680
it's not here at old okay site I really

00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,670
want to get that running on secondary I

00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,920
want to get that running everywhere

00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:48,110
because I think it's a great thing

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,300
anytime we can get automated testing we

00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:52,130
can get scripts going then we can focus

00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:54,140
on the harder areas I think that would

00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:58,670
be great so we've gotten some really

00:01:54,140 --> 00:02:01,790
good things done but the most of the

00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:05,830
attack will probably be more about other

00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:08,149
changes later so in 24 they change the

00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:10,910
default layout there's no more home

00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:14,110
partition they're going to grow the

00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:18,020
space the free IDPA a cockpit update

00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:20,170
starch d replacing you this those sorts

00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,170
of things

00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:31,900
Oh in here here's a couple of things we

00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:34,120
were able to do is we were able to add

00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,760
docker images or able to add cloud

00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,880
images and bit by bit we're adding more

00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:43,180
to that I'm hoping as we get these outed

00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:44,530
my emphasis is actually on power what

00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:47,890
I'm always hoping we get things done

00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:50,860
that you know the arm can use it yes 390

00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:56,740
can use it once routing it for one let's

00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:59,380
make sure that's available for all so

00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:00,850
then this is where we're hoping we can

00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:03,850
get a lot more interaction get some

00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:05,709
ideas where is the server going what do

00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:08,020
we want this to do over the next few

00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:15,700
releases till we meet again will it be

00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:18,820
some focus areas so Stephen was working

00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:23,050
on a roll kit we can keep that going we

00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:25,540
need volunteers there's talk we could

00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:30,790
use open shift and get a lot more with

00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:34,239
containers go that route and then the

00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:36,190
server Edition and modules so that's

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:41,530
during the leading to the modularity

00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:44,320
talk Langdon is here this is going to be

00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:47,530
a plug go to his go to use workshop

00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:49,480
when we were meeting on IRC this looked

00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,799
like something that was very positive a

00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,290
lot of people could see how that would

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,959
be working maybe we can get a lot of

00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:57,940
energy around it we have a base runtime

00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:01,500
stack to boot the system we have modules

00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:04,299
we can install since code update them

00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,989
and then we have the other down here so

00:04:04,299 --> 00:04:10,630
we're going to have a working group on

00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:13,930
friday hope many of you can attend bring

00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:15,730
other ideas supposed to be very

00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:17,859
collaborative we don't want to just

00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:20,820
dictate or it goes I certainly don't

00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:20,820
know where it's going

00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:31,379
so here's a slide a little bit more

00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,940
about the modularity and again it would

00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:36,599
be marriage motives talk to get the full

00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:39,650
thing the idea is is to allow such a

00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:42,419
code to be added in easily to have

00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:44,699
ninety percent of your release be very

00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:46,470
very stable but the part you want

00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:48,629
cutting-edge part you want to be

00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:51,060
updating all the time and using you have

00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:52,830
a way to do it so this kind of outlines

00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:58,800
some of the major bullet points for how

00:04:52,830 --> 00:05:00,539
we would do something like this and as

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,000
you can see he's at it that they're

00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:05,069
looking on delivering something maybe by

00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,669
you have 26 and you'll be able to tell

00:05:05,069 --> 00:05:11,400
you about that and start making the

00:05:08,669 --> 00:05:14,870
server and modular working group much

00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,870
tighter get there

00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:28,690
so going over this again the questions I

00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:31,570
had is just how do we install manage

00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:33,790
configure it what do we want on it or

00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:36,370
the file systems two people know how

00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:38,170
they're being used wine things I'd like

00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:40,210
to get a better grip on is do people

00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:42,910
know where fedora servers are being used

00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:45,370
out there do we have used cases do we

00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:47,200
know what we should be focusing on do we

00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:48,850
have the right file system on there do

00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,810
we have the right dis petitioning on

00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:54,880
there it's modularity away we want to go

00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:58,060
I think the server or guru would love to

00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,680
hear from people about it on there are

00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,120
some open positions on the server

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,730
working group if you'd want to

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:09,190
participate with us that way it would be

00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:13,600
awesome and the session is going to be

00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:18,240
at one thirty in the room just down the

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,240
hall on friday so that would be great

00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:23,290
documenting where the roles are again

00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:25,180
like the big thing I see you different

00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:26,740
between like the roll and roll kick and

00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:29,380
what I've heard about modularity of you

00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:32,770
will see different it is the install

00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:35,950
versus install and config and saw how do

00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:38,820
we get that stuff going what are we

00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,820
going to do about it

00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:46,990
hi I'm Steven Gallagher think most of

00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:48,700
you probably know me I was formerly on

00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:52,200
the server working group i took I've

00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:55,180
taken some time off to find myself but

00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:59,980
John Buckley coach sorry you found

00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:01,560
yourself BB code yeah yeah you don't

00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:03,889
wanna know what's back there

00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,509
so

00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:08,030
when we started it on the server working

00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:11,379
group well we started on the 3 edition

00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:13,789
split each of the additions really was

00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:16,310
also trying to find itself now you know

00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:18,620
we built the workstation as not just a

00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:20,330
full of ego of fully featured desktop

00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:24,139
but it was specifically going to be a

00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:25,849
desktop for getting stuff done with the

00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:28,909
cloud with the cloud we wanted a space

00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:30,560
where we be able to explore some of the

00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:32,270
really cool new technologies that were

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,599
coming along the atomic stuff the desk

00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:36,770
at the end the cloud the doctor stuff

00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:42,139
even justice you know enhancements in

00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:44,060
virtualization with server at first we

00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:46,520
were a little less certain about exactly

00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:48,250
where we wanted to go we wanted we knew

00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:54,650
we needed something that was going to be

00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:56,810
closer to fedoras historical developer

00:07:54,650 --> 00:08:00,199
base which was a fedora red hat linux

00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:01,939
those things were started by you know

00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:04,039
admins who wanted to get something done

00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:06,650
those were video and that was our

00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:08,990
original constituency and then over time

00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:10,550
we kind of moved towards being more of a

00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:12,680
desktop distribution and a lot of that

00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:14,180
traditional audience felt it was feeling

00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,279
sidelines and we wanted to build the

00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,300
server to be a place for them to feel

00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:22,569
part of the community

00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:24,520
and also we wanted to have a place that

00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:28,110
was more closely attuned to what our

00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:30,430
major our major financial contributor

00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:32,140
his doing is doing with red hat

00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:34,959
enterprise linux we want to make sure we

00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:37,570
weren't taking fedora to a place where

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,190
it wasn't going to be helpful in

00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:42,969
producing that next level of enterprise

00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:44,290
distribution so we came on we have we

00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:45,700
had the server edition we took we decide

00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:48,360
that that's where we want to go and then

00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:52,240
we we spent quite a few weeks after

00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:54,779
flock in Charleston figuring out so what

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,269
does that mean what what exactly does a

00:08:54,779 --> 00:09:00,910
an admin a server administrator a data

00:08:58,269 --> 00:09:04,449
center administrator need out of a Linux

00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:06,040
system and what the end what are we

00:09:04,449 --> 00:09:07,959
already doing and what are we doing well

00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,279
and one of the things that we identified

00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:12,240
that we really did weren't doing well

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:15,100
and that nobody was going well was

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,899
deploying solutions we were really

00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,420
really good at getting packages on to

00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:22,350
your system we were really terrible at

00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:25,660
helping you make them do anything useful

00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:26,949
and that's and different distribution of

00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:29,890
had different solutions for that for

00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:32,260
example the the arch linux the project

00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:33,579
has absolutely beautiful documentation

00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:35,199
whatever else you want to say about that

00:09:33,579 --> 00:09:37,350
to that project they have amazing

00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:40,320
documentation

00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:41,730
we didn't some of that has been improved

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,070
over the last few years and I actually

00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:46,070
think that's despite our best efforts

00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:46,070
but

00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:53,260
with the server edition what we decided

00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:55,780
was that we wanted to be able to reduce

00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:58,240
the barrier to entry for a lot of a lot

00:09:55,780 --> 00:10:00,040
of people to make it easier to do common

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,740
server tasks with the least amount of

00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:05,290
effort so we developed this kind of

00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:07,150
concept of server roles and we built

00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:09,730
want that you know and implementation of

00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:11,830
what we got that look like now serve

00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:14,020
over the role was basically that the

00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:17,020
high level concept of it was to be able

00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:19,600
to point to a server and say you you're

00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:21,850
now a domain controller thank you you're

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:28,800
a database server for a lamp stack and

00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:31,900
you I don't know what you I'm sorry but

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:34,330
the idea would be that for the most part

00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:36,850
you would just be able to say okay I

00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:39,060
want you to be this and more or less out

00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:41,230
of the box get something that does this

00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:43,640
the least amount of human interaction

00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:45,560
possible

00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,870
that you know if we want to build a

00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:50,750
domain controller we bring up free IPA

00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:53,660
and its dns server and we asked you only

00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:55,640
to provide the admin password everything

00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:58,220
else will set up before you had our best

00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:00,320
effort and we can't we get later if it's

00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:01,820
not quite to your needs but out of the

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,950
box you should be able to essentially

00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:09,290
hit a button and get a working system so

00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:11,990
as a basically as a prototype and then

00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:15,110
later close to production project we

00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:17,000
both role kit which was basically just a

00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:18,230
simple Python wrapper around the

00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,290
installers for a variety of different

00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:23,420
product of projects that just took just

00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:27,620
took it and applied what we considered

00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:30,800
common sense secure to false and we

00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:32,150
built it up as an API which had a CLI

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,950
most that was originally mostly for

00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,600
testing but nobody ever consumed the API

00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:38,060
so it ended up being a primary

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,800
interaction and had I know that was

00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:41,710
going to happen definitely would have

00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:44,310
involved a designer

00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:44,310
but

00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:53,269
it worked it it wasn't all a pretty in

00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:55,069
Duncan code but it worked you know I

00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:57,680
know a number of people who have been

00:11:55,069 --> 00:11:59,779
struggling for example and Alexander

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,459
would back me up on a lot of people have

00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:03,199
trouble installing for yet again it's a

00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:06,230
complicated piece of software and

00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:08,060
there's a lot of stuff even-even that

00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:11,029
just needs to be in place before you run

00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:12,470
the Installer that I think we were able

00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:14,470
to fix with roll kids yeah we were able

00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:18,120
to tweak some of the empty Ozzie hosts

00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:20,220
mess and all that just to ensure that

00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,390
yes you hit this button and at the end

00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:27,620
of it you're going to get something that

00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:31,160
works that employment okay

00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,160
we found out

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:40,620
we will look with the car work it is

00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:43,350
funny how often that gets rediscovered

00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,940
yes I'm sorry for the sake of the great

00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:46,769
for the sake of the recording the comic

00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,390
for the audiences during free to the

00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:50,310
free at gay development it was

00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:53,000
rediscovered that no one reads

00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:56,100
documentation so we have probably

00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:03,089
fetuses the communication on the full

00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:07,380
route simple those around he certainly

00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:10,290
gave this stuff and people still have

00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:12,870
trouble sentient beings up because

00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:16,140
nobody reads that mental patient and

00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:18,089
he's a good dog yes yes and I use most

00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:21,180
of it when you have an hour which

00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:23,850
emotions come from a variety of

00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:28,139
backgrounds yes cool

00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:31,290
of my data for all proprietary systems

00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:34,440
like Microsoft Windows environment so

00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:36,959
they have less understanding the you

00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,700
know about how to manage it but they are

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:42,720
less understanding

00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:44,670
the technology of I promise I agree that

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,790
you know it won't be a moment cuz that

00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:52,770
was loss to be row homes you jumped

00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:56,400
ahead to my next topic okay so this was

00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:57,900
not directly part of the a server

00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,880
working group discussions but just prior

00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:02,700
to its instantiation I'd had a number of

00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:04,560
conversations inside of red hat where we

00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,960
were doing essentially we call it gap

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,050
analysis figurative figuring out what do

00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:12,330
our competitors do better than we do and

00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:14,250
first and foremost I said well besides

00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:17,070
everything at that point this was team

00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:20,940
this was years ago now but from user

00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:22,860
experience perspective install if you

00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:25,110
installed microsoft windows server and

00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:27,240
turned it on the very first thing it did

00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:29,040
was loaded graphical environment and

00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,950
give you a list of things you might want

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,060
to have this mission you do you were

00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:34,590
loaded with red hat enterprise linux

00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,640
server and the first thing you did when

00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:37,350
you go when you print powered it on

00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,150
let's get it was it was getting black

00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:41,580
and white screen but they go with a you

00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:43,380
got login prompt and not and once you

00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,940
got your login prompt once you enter

00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,680
your login you got a black and white

00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:49,170
screen with a you know a dollar sign

00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:52,320
next to it and no clear indication of

00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:54,570
where to go next so that was part of the

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,880
the reason why we when we formed the

00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:59,160
server working group we pretty much all

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,590
agreed right out the gate that we wanted

00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:03,010
to meet that gap want to find a place

00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:05,620
where

00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:07,720
build a system that a person could bag

00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:09,480
would get useful information right from

00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,860
the get-go and be able to do something

00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,090
useful do it now then we looked at

00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:15,250
around and we saw the glue that the

00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:18,640
cockpit project was getting a lot closer

00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:21,520
to that and so what we decided pretty

00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:23,290
much you know you know unanimously was

00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:27,220
okay we're going to make the cockpit

00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:29,710
project the official GUI or through our

00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:33,340
server and then what we would try to do

00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:34,510
is build our capabilities these roles in

00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:36,730
such a way that they will be deployed

00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:40,410
with my cockpit have cockpits all that

00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:43,020
same first install problem where

00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:45,580
nowadays if you start up at our server

00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:47,460
we can add that login prompt you also

00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:49,480
get a notice for the graphical installer

00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:51,790
connected to this a draft of this IP

00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,680
address colon this depend of this court

00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:56,380
and you will get cockpit you can do a

00:15:53,680 --> 00:16:00,640
great deal of stuff in a discoverable

00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:02,230
way and people absolutely love this and

00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,910
I remember hearing an awful lot of

00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:08,140
people saying how soon can we have that

00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:12,870
in grow and I think I think as of 73

00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:12,870
they can now but it took a while

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:21,640
you know I think I think oh say that so

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:23,860
I just gotta tease 1700s years yeah I I

00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:26,170
was pretty sure it was at least that was

00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:30,940
out just so I got the number one by

00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:32,860
August thank you threatening so you know

00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:35,410
and then we were going to try and try

00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:36,910
and take this rolls concept and make it

00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:38,320
so that it could be deployed by cockpit

00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:41,830
and that unfortunately never really

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:46,420
materialized and then as time that time

00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:48,279
passed that project didn't get thee it

00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:51,690
didn't get the ND collaboration we

00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:53,800
needed it didn't hit critical mass and

00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:56,020
the two people that were working out I

00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,790
both got hold on to other projects so

00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:59,920
it's now kind of in life support I'm

00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:01,480
personally basically maintaining it so

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,980
if anybody discovers a series of ugh

00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,860
I'll hatchet but

00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:09,069
any more active development right now

00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:10,299
unless we decide to reinvest in it so

00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,709
one of the things that came up in a

00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:14,740
recent server working group meeting was

00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:17,429
ok the concept is sound we still

00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:20,589
certainly want to have the ability to

00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:23,500
apply useful services to a machine and

00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:25,600
have them work so what is the mechanism

00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,939
that we're going to use to do that one

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,490
one that came up was ansible another

00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:32,080
that came up was built open shifted

00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:37,240
build open shift or new look you little

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:40,120
applications look at puppet for things

00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:43,870
that might integrate with satellite also

00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:47,559
you know vague ideas we want to hear

00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:50,770
what makes sense what can you do there

00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:52,750
and what will work with cockpit so

00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:54,340
that's one of the things we were hoping

00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,990
to have as far as part of this

00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:58,960
conversation and this should be a

00:17:55,990 --> 00:18:01,000
conversation so how do we how do we

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,070
solve these problems how do what is the

00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,480
best approach going forward maybe it's

00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:05,950
staying with world kin everyone in this

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,940
room is suddenly going to decide I'm

00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:10,980
going to pick it up and help contribute

00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:10,980
right now throw hands

00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:22,960
but well I got one thing but

00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:25,090
realistically it was a good try we can

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,150
do better learn from our mistakes and

00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:28,760
figure out what's the next step so you

00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:31,430
want to

00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:34,340
well no I mean I like everything you say

00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:36,860
being a little newer doll that's getting

00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:38,540
back to your point I I personally work

00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:40,430
better off of examples so if there's

00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:42,560
anything ever that can come up start

00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:43,820
configuring it I can see at work and

00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,620
then I go through start learning about

00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:49,760
tweak setting by setting I mean that

00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:51,200
always appeals to me so we'll have to

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,000
work through that because the other

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,010
downside is we give you the fault of

00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,110
their crappy defaults right now you're

00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:59,990
not going to be happier you get bit but

00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:04,940
sure wanting some for another example

00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:07,030
might be right about that makes you get

00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:09,880
on the corner yeah

00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:14,230
so for those who don't know me and

00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:16,030
that's probably a majority here my name

00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:19,870
is Alexandra Burke oh boy I'm Morgan

00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:24,850
free AV and samba sssd know this

00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:28,750
identity mess that we created over 30 40

00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:33,310
years and so one thing I wanted to talk

00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:37,270
about it is in IPA we encounter it a

00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:39,400
problem it's fine you set up a role as

00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:43,210
the main controller you have this shiny

00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:46,180
fedor a server that runs and words and

00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:47,740
fine and then you have machines that

00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:53,700
needs to connect with this domain

00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:57,760
controller and those are ax hp-ux and

00:19:53,700 --> 00:20:01,900
salaries and old bread machines and all

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:05,160
khadora machines so you have to kind of

00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:08,980
back port the knowledge that you have

00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:12,640
incorporated within the shiny fedora to

00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:16,120
those old environments and it's not just

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,590
a code sometimes it's a change in what

00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:20,169
software you

00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:24,279
use their or totally different things so

00:20:20,169 --> 00:20:26,650
what we came in with the idea that you

00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:32,230
can generate on a server because server

00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:35,289
knows its own state a sort of advice how

00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:37,480
to configure those all the qualities and

00:20:35,289 --> 00:20:41,529
we created a system that's called ID

00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:43,990
advice that right now is favorable

00:20:41,529 --> 00:20:46,270
limited in the sense that it only allows

00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:48,789
you to generate that wise is how to

00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:51,640
configure these old clients against

00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:55,000
itself but the advice is effectively

00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:57,940
what you ask it for is the example how

00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:02,320
to take these settings that are in the

00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:04,510
server and apply them to other machines

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:10,720
whether they are servers or clients or

00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:13,179
whatever taking that knowledge in the

00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,860
advice with this setting this might be a

00:21:13,179 --> 00:21:18,340
template it might be something more

00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:19,180
smart than just a template for the

00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,190
config

00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:22,990
I can see it be very interesting to

00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:25,300
build that into it and s cap

00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:27,670
implementation steps exactly sometimes I

00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:29,890
just generator I have to apply to the ax

00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:32,980
which has its own escape invitation s so

00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:36,160
two families with ax it might be

00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:40,930
actually apply the knowledge that you as

00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:43,720
a developer might be a site as about how

00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:46,810
ax configuration should look like which

00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:49,930
does not mean that admin managing that

00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:52,450
ax necessarily has this idea how

00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:54,550
securely it should be configured or

00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:57,820
might have some problems and we actually

00:21:54,550 --> 00:22:00,300
configure them so this would be probably

00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:03,580
an interesting topic for this or room

00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:05,800
because it's not a role applying on the

00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:09,790
server itself it's the role that the

00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:13,540
server wants to put all the clients

00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:17,400
connect to the server and it might not

00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:21,450
be just a IPA and being but a night

00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:26,270
they have this good position that we

00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:29,220
know much about the how your

00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:31,500
infrastructural part is actually

00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:34,190
configured for something how it's

00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:37,350
pumping the blood of your enterprise

00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:40,740
because identities and all these details

00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:43,890
and that we can actually take it and

00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:46,830
apply it some other place it's a small

00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:50,720
idea but again this idea actually proved

00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:56,160
to be very helpful for the actual

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:59,160
ministers for important thank you

00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:01,050
yeah I think I saw you were taking notes

00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:06,870
which is great yeah that should probably

00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:09,750
come up in the next week or so we

00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:11,970
planned on this being about half of the

00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:13,990
accession being a catch-up of where we

00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:17,020
are

00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:18,419
Q&A section basically being throw some

00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:21,179
ideas at us let's see what

00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:23,489
is what you guys have because i think i

00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:25,259
was saying something about before basic

00:23:23,489 --> 00:23:27,720
concepts of meritocracy is the best idea

00:23:25,259 --> 00:23:29,279
wins however the implicit in bio

00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:33,769
requirement of that is that all the

00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:33,769
ideas are planted so

00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:39,710
please help us figure out how do we how

00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:39,710
do we reach these goals

00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,940
and

00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:55,170
yeah I don't

00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:00,630
stop

00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:09,309
the windows

00:24:05,879 --> 00:24:11,919
adventures in server and example the

00:24:09,309 --> 00:24:19,230
cloud Dominique and the summer version

00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:21,100
is mostly the carvings design reviews so

00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:25,389
actually at present we don't actually

00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:28,239
offer a server cloud image but it's been

00:24:25,389 --> 00:24:30,820
talked about that we may actually swap

00:24:28,239 --> 00:24:33,460
the swap out the the current base image

00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:35,860
with the server image and then just have

00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:39,309
server and atomic which do serve

00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:40,840
different needs though is also talked

00:24:39,309 --> 00:24:42,669
about making this about having the

00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,409
server image also be running that

00:24:42,669 --> 00:24:48,700
project they also be no a straight face

00:24:44,409 --> 00:24:52,359
so short answer is we don't really know

00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:55,570
what what the right need is there I mean

00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:58,269
they the cloud image as it stands right

00:24:55,570 --> 00:25:00,100
now is basically trying to solve a

00:24:58,269 --> 00:25:01,799
problem that we decided we weren't going

00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:04,480
to try to solve a server which was I

00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:07,480
want the absolute minimum possible stuff

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:10,239
on mice in my system and I'll build the

00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,999
rest from there that when we put

00:25:10,239 --> 00:25:15,369
together the circuit of the server prd

00:25:11,999 --> 00:25:17,739
we agreed that was an on goal for the

00:25:15,369 --> 00:25:23,430
server our server edition was was meant

00:25:17,739 --> 00:25:25,440
to provide a known platform not a

00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:26,370
you know not not that green sheet of the

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,510
light but you know that you get into

00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:30,240
Legos that you filled out everything you

00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:33,420
built the house on top of we wanted to

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:36,180
we wanted to well to you is one of

00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:37,680
Matthew's excellent metaphors with with

00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:41,700
Legos we want to go and build them and

00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:43,920
give them a kit not not just in a bucket

00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:46,050
blanket books make it with instructions

00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,760
yes I get kick and the instructions met

00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:49,800
me know that would be not not like you

00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:54,390
got to get the yard sale or just get the

00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:57,780
block the bricks so it was a specific

00:25:54,390 --> 00:26:02,100
goal of fedora and server that you would

00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:03,990
get more than just the minimum set it's

00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:05,460
not it's not new we knew that we were

00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:08,100
going to alienate a certain subset of

00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:10,470
the population but we were also hoping

00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:13,170
that by providing something that works

00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:14,340
out of the box as opposed to you built

00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:16,440
it into something that's functional

00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:18,540
would be something that would be more

00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,419
likely to gather new contributors new

00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:22,639
users if they

00:26:20,419 --> 00:26:25,519
can just do something right from the

00:26:22,639 --> 00:26:27,230
get-go when they get more than more

00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:29,720
experience is absolutely nothing

00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:32,090
stopping them from tinkering the Fedora

00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,739
project always allows you to use the net

00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:36,350
install them do that building four

00:26:33,739 --> 00:26:38,330
blocks so our specific goal was give

00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:40,190
them something that is a complete system

00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:45,409
you know similar to the way Microsoft

00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:47,119
does it Microsoft Microsoft gives you a

00:26:45,409 --> 00:26:52,419
complete operating system and a stand a

00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:52,419
large number of AP is digitally

00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:56,100
look at the server

00:26:57,170 --> 00:27:03,320
you actually it's not just it's genocide

00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:05,510
like ass Microsoft will give you an

00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:09,290
essentially minimal or standardized

00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:11,090
install graphic I yo X which night was

00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:12,470
you to configure a divine control right

00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:14,210
and that's it right and that's exactly

00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:16,790
the law that was exactly the model we

00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:18,800
were trying to match was that you know

00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:21,920
everybody fittings barrack that you can

00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:24,140
configure advise using this guy's voted

00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:26,240
to get Adam and control rather database

00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:28,550
servers right using just you know at

00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,440
core which is yeah the cloud-based

00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:35,000
images very vain is basically at core

00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:36,680
and cloud and cloud in it that's a very

00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,200
different case from I'm going to provide

00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:41,450
you the platform necessary to apply

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,250
anything else on top of it and that was

00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:45,800
what we were trying to go for with

00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:48,530
server and it ultimately it wasn't a

00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:50,960
whole lot more than well you get the

00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:53,990
minimum yet firewall d you get system do

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,940
you get you get roll kit and you get

00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:57,410
cockpit you know that those are really

00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:59,240
the only things on top of the minimum

00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:00,680
image but they were things we wanted to

00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:05,050
be able to say you are guaranteed to

00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:05,050
have these you can rely on this as API

00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:12,740
why would be here

00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:17,040
might be identical good with all these

00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:20,820
playbooks develop the major the major

00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:22,200
reason why it's a non top of the list is

00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:24,630
because it's like with my country

00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,820
support and right now we've actually

00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:29,910
matched to get the server I think it 25

00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:32,370
they finally got Python 3 out of samba

00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:34,860
so I think we're not black white another

00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:38,570
time I don't have a peyote name ID if I

00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:38,570
DD we steal

00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:47,950
we're close though and we've been we've

00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:49,600
been driving very hard towards getting

00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:51,519
Python 2 out of the basis of the

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,559
standard install actually it's a lot in

00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:55,509
the sand installed because that we don't

00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:57,850
include sano-sama out of the box or

00:28:55,509 --> 00:29:00,789
something now that we have an easy way

00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:03,970
to get it but I don't believe we I think

00:29:00,789 --> 00:29:05,590
you well actually we might have

00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:07,240
something the sum of client because it

00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:10,509
because it's I think it's pulled in by

00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:12,519
the default is set up on top of the

00:29:10,509 --> 00:29:14,889
building Roderick was study yeah just go

00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:16,419
sit in my people divide us SSD that

00:29:14,889 --> 00:29:19,029
doesn't have to be we could actually

00:29:16,419 --> 00:29:23,590
exclude that part will stalk not

00:29:19,029 --> 00:29:25,750
inherently the packaging allows it and

00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:27,370
we just are already pulling in the acne

00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:29,170
kit components or we could just switch

00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:31,030
to having relative pull those in

00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:34,200
so we could get it off we could

00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:34,200
theoretically get back country out of

00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:41,710
wood all this rule also winners as they

00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:46,360
watch history it wasn't even in this

00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:48,010
horrible hitting you so what feels right

00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:50,440
and then maybe we have these are

00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:52,600
enjoying here right well what were

00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:55,360
probably tired building is going back to

00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:57,670
the answer was also has all these

00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,920
different things but you still went up

00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:02,620
at eight explored in front and have to

00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:05,110
manually run all right Brad I need you

00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:08,440
added so that trying our I say that

00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:11,530
changes when tell get some souls and we

00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:13,390
can ship tower and that one but also it

00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:17,500
also again we can put it if we can put a

00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:20,680
plate of implementation t25 yeah yes

00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:23,940
sorry for that apron limited uses the

00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,940
target of you says he on the other

00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:30,220
pesos

00:30:26,179 --> 00:30:30,220
above 40

00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:38,920
right now Cerberus seniors but that

00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:40,630
mostly targeted group of small media

00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:43,320
business exactly about forgetting to

00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:45,550
give give from a single machine

00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,870
orchestration we need to know about

00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:49,620
lemurs

00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:55,550
somebody needs to people

00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:55,550
just singleship and miserable

00:30:55,590 --> 00:31:05,700
that's yes yeah Rutledge's how you would

00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:05,700
deploy particular machines highly

00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:11,180
some of them might be a real hardware

00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:14,180
some

00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:16,010
yes yeah it would that's all that's not

00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:17,690
reduce case we're told me about here

00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:21,170
we're talking about taking a single

00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:24,050
server and having made the ability to

00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:26,300
say give me a lab stat on that single

00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:27,800
server at which point the ansible play

00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:30,800
balls will do that very very

00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:34,040
convincingly very very easily as a

00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:36,860
single server a single device sure you

00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:39,230
can use ansible to manage entire sets of

00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:42,470
infrastructure but you also use it to

00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:45,500
configure a single box out of the box we

00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:46,910
have things straight so close that means

00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:52,370
that directive and run but i'm not sure

00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:56,110
ansible could install three idea because

00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:58,820
I check my boobs on themselves but not

00:31:56,110 --> 00:32:00,590
central because I me know whether

00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:04,509
classic check IP a server install it

00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:06,070
wasn't even

00:32:04,509 --> 00:32:08,469
would make it very difficult to use and

00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:09,669
that purpose so it's quick read that

00:32:08,469 --> 00:32:11,049
some luck there's a lot of people

00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:13,360
interested in advance

00:32:11,049 --> 00:32:15,899
historic reasons why it wasn't most of

00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,899
the server working

00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:21,260
it sounded like

00:32:19,539 --> 00:32:23,000
a fun

00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:24,350
that was that was the major reason why

00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,970
it hadn't been bumped up to the front of

00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:27,950
the list it was certain still attention

00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:29,300
and if I thought to is still stuck there

00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:32,860
for other reasons maybe it's enough

00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:32,860
water further reporter

00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:39,670
well no the other the other kid the

00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,870
other items on the list were other

00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:43,450
things that people were interested in

00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:46,050
working on so the other one that that

00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:48,970
Mike mentioned was that we talked about

00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:52,180
possibly switching roles over to be new

00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:54,220
fuel / which open shipped applications

00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:55,809
to divert it's a tie better into the

00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:57,820
efforts we had that we've done by part

00:32:55,809 --> 00:33:01,060
of time that

00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:06,210
project here's heard of a project FAO

00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:10,470
yet yeah fedora fedora

00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:10,470
which is like

00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:17,539
yeah that's the current that working

00:33:15,269 --> 00:33:17,539
title

00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:25,860
I don't know yeah I was just not too

00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:25,860
quiet

00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:32,520
so you know with the with another large

00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:34,710
set of the subset of the project working

00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:36,450
towards that we thought maybe that was

00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:38,910
something we'd approach as an option

00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:41,580
also is used a Cooper netting

00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:43,200
space-based employment system that could

00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:46,590
theoretically video if we designed it

00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,540
right be migrated into a private atomic

00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:50,220
world that broke when you when you're

00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:51,960
when you're yeah when you grow past one

00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:53,790
or two servers and you want start

00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:56,460
orchestrating and make it trivial to

00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:59,750
migrate into a cloud into a yes anatomic

00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:59,750
environment as opposed to a

00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:05,710
one environment

00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:08,649
traditional traditional environment so

00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:11,609
that was that was at the moment that was

00:34:08,649 --> 00:34:11,609
high at the top of my list

00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:21,210
classes whatever anyway legacy I don't

00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,560
care the terms the terms are meaningless

00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:28,230
is that we don't agree with all the

00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:29,310
definitions so but anyway at the time we

00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:30,630
were discussing this there were more

00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:32,400
people around who were talking to who

00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:34,920
were interested in talking about atomic

00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:36,780
and Devon containers as us today as a

00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:38,670
contender solution so that kind of got

00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:43,970
bumped up to the forefront though nobody

00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:43,970
was actively advocating for ads time so

00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:49,129
as brightening the spot of saying he

00:34:46,759 --> 00:34:50,450
writes the patch wins the argument the

00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:52,099
people who were present we're talking

00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:55,509
about this other thing so that was the

00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:55,509
bottom you that was gaining steam

00:34:56,349 --> 00:35:01,299
so people have people here once you

00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:03,849
start contributing playbooks that then

00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:05,920
maybe we write days and we start working

00:35:03,849 --> 00:35:08,289
on writing up you know in d bus rappers

00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,920
of the cockpit you talk to them because

00:35:08,289 --> 00:35:10,920
it on the gas supply

00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:19,770
well or is it guys to CLI I explained

00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:22,260
all since a book I think basically

00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:24,869
that's what talent one of those of town

00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:26,819
provides I had neither a long way from

00:35:24,869 --> 00:35:29,130
tower themselves well in supporting red

00:35:26,819 --> 00:35:31,470
pack well that was then why generate

00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:33,300
incredibly your hand if you want to

00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:35,220
inscribe instruments right with a true

00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:39,900
towel because it has

00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:43,170
that I the last I heard on the open

00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:46,040
sourcing of towels about festival

00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:49,530
I said it will happen at some

00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:52,700
but I don't know what I think yeah I

00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:54,770
think maybe the meantime

00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:57,050
rats API

00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:59,510
they're probably already is out there

00:35:57,050 --> 00:36:00,980
something along those lines and and

00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:04,120
suddenly there's a lot of work to be

00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:08,600
done to sort of put together a world

00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:11,060
orchestrated set of labels that

00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:14,770
which would be then consumed whether

00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:14,770
it's callable some other time

00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:19,359
so it show hands who would want to

00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,480
contribute to that project if we keep it

00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,480
up

00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:26,030
alright so I got one I got two and a

00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:28,530
half that's that's better that's better

00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:30,810
and if it was the origin and if it was

00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:34,320
origin based cuckoo ladies orchestrated

00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:36,770
tiny containers johansson very different

00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:40,680
audience from the last time

00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:43,110
so okay so yeah I think that you take

00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:47,240
that certainly back in bed let's talk

00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:47,240
about that more piya how dope certainly

00:36:49,319 --> 00:36:51,319
I

00:36:51,569 --> 00:36:57,220
we're gonna make

00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:57,220
very surprised

00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:05,650
yeah I was annoyed by that too and I

00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,020
started trying to put one together to

00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:09,609
roll kid felt it was really kind of

00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:11,320
inconvenient that the script I had to

00:37:09,609 --> 00:37:14,230
write to a turn cloud those are less it

00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:16,930
alarm so I brought your son well that's

00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:19,270
what I was over image in neighboring now

00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:26,580
it doesn't have microscope Dunn that's

00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:29,100
how healthy yes SP it has to be simple

00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:32,040
I think I didn't really that's really

00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:35,060
okay we advise I take a doctor that baby

00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:37,430
an initiative like that's a perfect

00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:40,950
maybe scratch something else to Tara I

00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:47,390
fragrance certain image and in able

00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:56,349
within the bills Matt's argument

00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:56,349
and we ship anything but a ball

00:37:56,479 --> 00:38:02,910
so Langdon has volunteered to work on

00:37:58,979 --> 00:38:06,749
the Baker fridge or Google or 30 see you

00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:10,789
got the experience kind around a lot of

00:38:06,749 --> 00:38:10,789
that sorry if I have rounds

00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:20,109
sure the scenario

00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:30,660
it is supported by the technology has

00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:32,339
consisted today it was a fish newest our

00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:35,630
official ruling was that it was never

00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:38,190
required to be tested together and the

00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:39,960
way that we were actually implementing

00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:42,059
it was that we built the possibility of

00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:44,640
those allowed i have being able to

00:38:42,059 --> 00:38:45,839
explicitly conflict with other roles so

00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,339
we knew that they weren't going to work

00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:47,960
on the same street machine they would be

00:38:47,339 --> 00:38:48,920
allowed

00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,859
would be allowed to install the one

00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:53,029
sanction yeah

00:38:51,859 --> 00:38:55,249
if you have two different the deuterium

00:38:53,029 --> 00:38:57,499
plantations of say might would be able

00:38:55,249 --> 00:39:01,999
to install a school and variety chem

00:38:57,499 --> 00:39:04,549
saying she didn't but technically okay

00:39:01,999 --> 00:39:05,740
and then we only promised to QA we can

00:39:04,549 --> 00:39:09,100
want

00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:11,080
combinatorial tests we promised them

00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:13,330
that they only ever had to test what is

00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:16,740
important role on the server but the

00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:16,740
technology permits it just

00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,100
these are on the computer

00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:27,960
the server

00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:34,050
there were as

00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:36,110
we keep trying and we keep in then it

00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:39,860
keeps not being high enough priority

00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:42,150
management managed to get it was pretty

00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:43,650
but at this point at this point I've

00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:45,180
told them not today I told them to just

00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:46,830
take it out of the Attic to do list

00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:49,740
until we figure out what's what is going

00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:51,240
to replace wolcott because it's become

00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:53,160
pretty clear that ok it was not the

00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:55,520
right who is not the right hammer for

00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,520
that sperm

00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,859
what

00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:06,660
you can you could do that or no you can

00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:08,790
even we had whoo-ha we had broken or

00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:11,720
will control deploy and made welcome to

00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:11,720
roll control technician

00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:18,960
for the three roles that we ever

00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:21,570
actually managed to release all three of

00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,670
them actually did it completely

00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:25,140
you actually did get back to basically

00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:27,990
the exact same system crab before which

00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:31,250
was which was actually not an explicit

00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:31,250
goal but managed to work out

00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:40,120
so

00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:44,020
I've got a question for the audience

00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:46,990
does anyone hear that a system admin in

00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:50,880
there getting their day job all right

00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:50,880
thank you coming

00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,069
what

00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:57,599
well actually the other guys are such

00:40:56,069 --> 00:40:59,489
question first are any of you using

00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:04,780
fedora server in your production

00:40:59,489 --> 00:41:06,430
environment okay

00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:08,500
those of you who have to go ahead your

00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:12,930
gamma rays in the first question and not

00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:12,930
in the same question what would it take

00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:27,540
well as well but well let me ask that

00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:29,300
question I was out because you answer

00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:31,380
what you answered with was not

00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:33,250
yesterday's do with a specific

00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:36,559
implementation

00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:39,430
description of the problem solves what

00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:39,430
about k support

00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:48,800
what's that implies me and what is not

00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:48,800
that starting

00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:58,980
I would like to

00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:02,210
sorry buddy

00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:04,850
for us

00:42:06,779 --> 00:42:09,919
this is

00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:17,870
ok

00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:23,150
so maybe you were not specifically right

00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:25,530
audience

00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:28,710
let's assume hypothetically this are at

00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:30,780
breaking sorry if I could stay I started

00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:33,090
out with food or servers I'm a system

00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:35,930
administrator first school we started

00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:38,910
out with fedora only arm servers and

00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:42,330
maybe about five years ago we migrated

00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:44,370
most of the first Angeles over the last

00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:48,350
few years I have certainty point

00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:51,480
interview the door service mainly for is

00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:54,570
beautiful for what thank you why get it

00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:56,550
up in the documentation I at least read

00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:58,730
read no I gotta say I thought that I got

00:42:56,550 --> 00:43:01,470
myself in a hole I know he's beautiful

00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:04,380
okay so I do appreciate it so many

00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:06,420
appreciate it but one of the things that

00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:08,390
I know we one of the main reasons we

00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:11,760
switch from Cobra when I said to us was

00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:15,090
was the update site upgrade cycle was

00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:17,520
just insane and what you say no I'm

00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:20,460
talking for our client right well I want

00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:23,130
to know what game what's the great cycle

00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:25,680
insane okay sorry what it meant to me

00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:27,060
was I had I had he was it because the

00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:29,730
upper wasn't because after the upgrades

00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:30,660
things broken absolutely upgrades things

00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:33,210
were broken out again we're talking

00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:34,740
ancient history very wet well because

00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:36,570
again I like to write here what the

00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:38,760
actual problem is not only nothing

00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:42,630
symptom of the problem no that's all

00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:44,359
right I would do upgrades and we have

00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:46,759
things not working

00:43:44,359 --> 00:43:49,460
take a number of hours maybe a few days

00:43:46,759 --> 00:43:51,259
for me to track down what was going

00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,970
along and get it sorted out which is not

00:43:51,259 --> 00:43:56,390
the greatest thing when you're working

00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:58,880
with production servers sure so we

00:43:56,390 --> 00:44:02,690
switched it sent to us again it's in

00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:04,970
switching type EI and in running federal

00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:08,329
on the service that we had like a on

00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:13,579
they have run really really well I've

00:44:08,329 --> 00:44:16,819
gone from I'm of 21 up to 23 on one

00:44:13,579 --> 00:44:19,640
school's systems I just a couple weeks

00:44:16,819 --> 00:44:22,220
ago set up a brand new like a server

00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:24,829
offered or 24 / totally different school

00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:26,900
that I helped out and and it worked

00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:30,739
beautifully so I've been really happy

00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:35,269
with fedora over the last couple of

00:44:30,739 --> 00:44:38,720
releases I don't know the one problem i

00:44:35,269 --> 00:44:42,589
did running two more recently was with

00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:43,670
overt i was running over to on fedora

00:44:42,589 --> 00:44:47,150
and then there came

00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:50,000
where I think it was basically not

00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:52,220
really supported strongly recommended

00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,020
switching their situation I think

00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:56,109
they're still recommended mr. off your

00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:56,109
order

00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:02,940
and

00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:13,430
right well there was a bunch of stuff

00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:13,430
from harsh side

00:45:16,369 --> 00:45:19,779
and now

00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:26,280
I don't like 30 times

00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,950
that we're open

00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:36,270
so

00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:36,270
my name is cooperation

00:45:36,509 --> 00:45:41,569
responsible

00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,569
Austin

00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:49,990
access

00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:49,990
you will have problems

00:45:50,589 --> 00:45:55,800
responsible what

00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:57,420
you get more interested in

00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:59,940
well I think I think one of the things

00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:02,370
that we as fedoras Cole much a server

00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:04,550
got a lot better at than since four or

00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:04,550
five

00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:10,890
we have a pen we still move fast and

00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:13,670
break things but we usually tell

00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:13,670
the brave discover

00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:17,840
we've got a lot better at letting people

00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:19,510
know

00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:23,070
the following things

00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:26,420
may be relying on are going to change

00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:29,619
here's how he hears what is changing so

00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:33,069
that has helped a lot but

00:46:29,619 --> 00:46:35,619
Cara Thank You Brendan for bigger

00:46:33,069 --> 00:46:36,759
illusions right well yeah sometimes they

00:46:35,619 --> 00:46:37,990
really read release notes and that's

00:46:36,759 --> 00:46:41,559
where we try to stick to some of this

00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:43,150
stuff I mean Cynthia at lunch what I did

00:46:41,559 --> 00:46:47,859
finish it as the thought of timing

00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:49,599
before about the upgrades one of the

00:46:47,859 --> 00:46:51,039
things that people kept coming to us I

00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,749
want to first start the surfers things

00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:55,630
but we really need for you is long maybe

00:46:52,749 --> 00:46:59,019
I was a long term life cycle and when

00:46:55,630 --> 00:47:02,410
asks a big wood duck down behind times

00:46:59,019 --> 00:47:05,799
out of ten sorry nine times out of ten

00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:08,980
what they really meant was we want to

00:47:05,799 --> 00:47:10,029
know when we got grades than we want to

00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:13,150
know that things are just going to keep

00:47:10,029 --> 00:47:14,890
breaking out from under us and so what

00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:16,599
we said was that well the longer life

00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:18,519
cycle isn't necessarily the only

00:47:16,599 --> 00:47:20,799
solution to that the better system that

00:47:18,519 --> 00:47:23,200
is will love our own fate testing and

00:47:20,799 --> 00:47:24,999
make sure that upgrades are clean yeah

00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,650
when you upgrade it should be more

00:47:24,999 --> 00:47:29,859
likely when you agree fedora we want to

00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:31,980
be more like going from rel 62 263 than

00:47:29,859 --> 00:47:34,580
from going from

00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:40,140
interesting way in the rail seven stop

00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:42,119
the dude from 70 to 71 72 is probably

00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:46,440
about the equipment of junk and fedora

00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:50,850
20 10 or 20 to 22 or 23 server editions

00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:52,530
because there is a lot more motor in the

00:47:50,850 --> 00:47:56,280
relative things in working a lot faster

00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:57,480
I believe that my time is now up a nut

00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:00,300
was supposed to be telling me that but

00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:02,100
my watch is doing it thank you very much

00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:04,350
for coming and supposed to be

00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:07,430
participated as well I appreciate it

00:48:04,350 --> 00:48:07,430
