	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,990
structure by providing tools resources

00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,430
utilities for the different project

00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,410
areas and subgroups to increase

00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,240
communication and participation across

00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:11,070
the project which is kind of a mouthful

00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,250
but we have nine different primary

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:16,740
methods that we use to kind of the nine

00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,720
different methods to the madness so

00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,880
these are all the different areas that

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,650
we help contribute towards messaging is

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,970
regarding specific marketing initiatives

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,760
and outreach that coordinate across

00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:29,539
subgroups some examples of this was the

00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:32,130
recent Python Fedora loves Python

00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:34,920
marketing campaign which was a cross

00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:42,600
subgroup collaboration between design

00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:44,579
marketing and pom ops we helped when the

00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:50,670
idea was coming forth yourself the

00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:53,940
marketing side of it it was in commerce

00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,110
with the marketing team and then the

00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,789
storytelling is dealing with

00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,949
communicating the story of contributors

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:00,660
store contributors particularly with the

00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:03,600
community blog is the best example of

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,400
that badges we helped handle with the

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,159
strategic planning administration of

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,630
fedora badges an example of that is

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,060
going to be the onboarding series which

00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:14,430
I'll get to in a minute pedorra hubs

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,990
which is the eventual helped with the

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,729
eventual administration intending to

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:20,310
fedora hubs and that's definitely going

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:22,259
to be a large area of impact going

00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,420
forward for bringing in new contributors

00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,430
and helping retain them and tying all

00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,490
the different parts and fields of Fedora

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:31,110
together for the wiki we also help

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:34,590
garden the lucky and take requests from

00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:36,869
other teams and so guarantee like I'm

00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:40,110
building with joy to identify the

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:41,340
attending pages in magee so most of the

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,369
pages in bikini

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,929
same information and across different

00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:48,509
pages so I am trying to be like you to

00:01:45,929 --> 00:01:53,280
identify those pages using some sort of

00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:56,219
matrix let's see and then we also work

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,049
on metrics which is the next topic so we

00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:01,979
try to generate matrix to understand a

00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:03,990
community so tell now like I work on

00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:07,079
some metrics to understand the impact of

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:10,500
attending like federer events on the

00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:12,739
activity of contributors and also

00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:16,530
generated some metrics regarding like

00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:18,959
women in fedora and outreach II and

00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:21,480
other g-shock indian statistics here so

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,640
there's another team member like sachin

00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:27,510
common is working on the intern step

00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:29,819
stool so and then there was a year in

00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:33,090
review report for different kind of feel

00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:34,799
so we work on matrix for that so yeah so

00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,900
we basically generated matrix to

00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:40,709
understand the community then there's

00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:44,280
elections so we also help the federal

00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:47,850
release manager it for monitoring will

00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:50,160
be elections like basically with all

00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:53,459
sort of stuff like hosting across

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,980
channels wiki and whatever health needs

00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:58,889
and then there's some other

00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:02,310
miscellaneous stuff which just doesn't

00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:03,510
fit into any an example for that one was

00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,239
recently there was an issue between

00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:07,530
communication about the design team had

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,030
some frustrations vomiting design

00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:10,169
resources and the ambassador's have

00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,790
frustrations while getting design

00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:13,709
resources so there was a bit of a

00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:16,169
communication breakdown for that and we

00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:17,910
helped we're looking at trying to find

00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:20,280
ways to improve communication about that

00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:21,959
and we helped write the guide that will

00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,380
hopefully eventually be used in other

00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:26,940
ways too for a long term vision to help

00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,489
make it easier for ambassadors getting

00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:32,880
assets for things like banners resources

00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:35,269
and different art assets that we need in

00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,269
the field

00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,530
oh and then also the culture side of it

00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,319
as well we help with the diversity team

00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:44,940
with the work that they're doing over

00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:48,569
there one of the recent events was the

00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:51,120
fedora Women's Day that was one of the

00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:54,569
events that happened just actually the

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:58,620
earlier in July we helped with the

00:03:54,569 --> 00:04:02,940
planning the reporting and assisting

00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:05,069
with that and so there is a view back in

00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:08,730
June there was a full council report

00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:10,260
meeting with a full come out report and

00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:11,970
that's all on YouTube but since that's

00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:14,970
about how long panel would be it's like

00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:17,790
I think a 15 minute video we will watch

00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:19,859
it right like you can check it out yeah

00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:24,090
the link will be available i'll make

00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:25,229
sure to share that so why are we here so

00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,729
the two things that we really would like

00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:28,800
to talk about the most is looking at

00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:32,039
onboarding for new areas of contributing

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,900
in fedora looking at the different areas

00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:35,699
that people find success in as well as

00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,110
the areas that people aren't finding

00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:40,020
success in and ways that we can improve

00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:42,630
that sharing some of those frustrations

00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,070
and then finally if you can support each

00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:47,280
other with bringing in new members and

00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:48,600
keeping them in the project as well and

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,580
we also like do a little bit of planning

00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,500
for the future regarding elections as

00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,360
well as getting idea for future tasks to

00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,660
incorporate new a future calm opsworks

00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:00,870
our fab or virtual 52 and to help kind

00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,400
of freak the vision for the future as

00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:06,139
well and we'll also have an open floor

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,139
for anyone to bring ideas to us as well

00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,170
two different levels

00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:23,159
so for the onboarding process we'd like

00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:24,749
some of the work that we've been doing

00:05:23,159 --> 00:05:26,490
is helping create guidelines and

00:05:24,749 --> 00:05:28,229
directions for newcomers to get involved

00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,939
in different parts of fedora and the

00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:31,050
objective of doing that is to prevent it

00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:33,029
from being too overwhelming and

00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:34,590
confusing as well as unclear about how

00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:36,360
to move forward for new contributors

00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:38,699
some of the work that we have been doing

00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,499
already is with the we started with our

00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:42,150
own team we've also been assisting with

00:05:40,499 --> 00:05:43,919
the modularity working group and we're

00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:46,770
working with infrastructure now to

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:49,069
identify clear pointed steps to bring

00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:51,090
those new contributors in as well as to

00:05:49,069 --> 00:05:53,939
help make it easier for them to get

00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:55,169
started so we also we're working through

00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:56,909
that with helping sub-project

00:05:55,169 --> 00:05:59,969
identifying steps to becoming involved

00:05:56,909 --> 00:06:02,580
converting those steps and use with

00:05:59,969 --> 00:06:03,960
resources like badges newcomers can pick

00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,669
up and it makes it easier for

00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:18,659
subprojects to gain new contributors and

00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:20,900
also to keep them practice who have the

00:06:18,659 --> 00:06:26,000
infrastructure team have been talking to

00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:26,000
how the coordination happen

00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:36,210
so for that with infrastructure they

00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:37,320
have their process lined out for like

00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:39,120
the steps that they have for

00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,470
contributing getting started with

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,470
infrastructure it's all there's a

00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:49,050
Patrick David talk on it last year and

00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:50,730
so we're looking at their steps and we

00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:53,790
identified a few series of badges that

00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:55,380
particularly deal with kind of a general

00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:59,010
area of contributing so there's one

00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:02,700
called looks at manless activity another

00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:04,800
looks that get commit sin bisher and

00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:08,630
those would fit into a kind of a

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,630
step-by-step process for infrastructure

00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:14,640
and so I think we originally reached out

00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:18,090
to Patrick who provided us with some

00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:19,680
resources for from like last year's

00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:21,390
flock about the getting started with

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,360
infrastructure at the state state of

00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:25,530
infant talk last year and so those are

00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,240
some of the resources that we're working

00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:29,240
with to identify those steps

00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:47,730
special yep approach github yes so does

00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:52,990
we have action trouble in this area down

00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:55,300
so is it okay very stirring yeah what's

00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:57,550
the best way by command of us or a

00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:00,730
mailing list or a ticket is the best way

00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:04,180
for it to get on our agenda so like I'll

00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:06,580
show in a minute we actually have so

00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:09,540
part of what we've done for this was an

00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:12,640
example for the conops onboarding steps

00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:15,070
for context of what we're like the

00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:21,730
number order of events to become a

00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:23,320
member of the team and the example I

00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:28,570
wanted to pull up here with some of the

00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:33,840
work of a bargain yes sure I'm really

00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:37,020
surprised about how easy it is to join

00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:40,460
the infrastructure team that crazy

00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:45,720
like a self-service there's no

00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:48,200
dispensary that's all sorry sir that's

00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,200
by design

00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:57,470
yes that's the same so the thing I like

00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:59,290
to show is that there's a some of the

00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:04,520
discussion in the plan you've been doing

00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:09,410
on this so in this case we have varied

00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:13,930
the window over I might just make this

00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:13,930
mirror displays a little bit confusing

00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:22,260
yeah so we have this ticket here which

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,610
is kind of our mass or tracking ticket

00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,960
for all the different sub projects and

00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:28,800
the tickets that are on our agenda right

00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:30,120
now and so in this case we have the cops

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,130
one which we worked through first

00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,230
followed by the modularity working group

00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:38,070
and then the infrastructure team which

00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:39,960
is in also in progress and so you can

00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:43,430
kind of see that I think we documented

00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,430
in this one

00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,530
so we've been working with the teams to

00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:52,210
identify those steps like that when the

00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:53,350
modularity working group came to us they

00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:55,720
were trying to get started because

00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:57,220
they're relatively new so they were

00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,540
trying to get more people involved from

00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:07,120
current contributors the new

00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:08,650
contributors and so when they reached

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,510
out to us we work with them to identify

00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:12,820
the preliminary steps that people do to

00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:15,280
get involved with there with the working

00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:17,320
group and we helped work through getting

00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:20,920
them like a batch when someone's

00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:22,780
sponsored and you're fast food and so by

00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,930
doing that and then publishing where

00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:27,640
they have their steps online on there on

00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:28,720
the wiki right now but long-term they're

00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,150
probably going to be moved somewhere

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:34,300
else with fedora hubs which I'll get to

00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:37,330
in a little bit but now they have

00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,680
clearly defined steps for the modularity

00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:40,900
getting involved with the modularity

00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,260
working group that are relatively easy

00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,260
to find

00:10:56,899 --> 00:10:59,050
yes

00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:04,730
but um

00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:12,750
so that's some of the work that we have

00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,500
been giving him progress and some of the

00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,120
things that we've been doing for

00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,430
infrastructure are more general to the

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,130
entire project for enhancing the process

00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:25,320
overall like the prosciutto this one was

00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:27,240
for this one's for being added added to

00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,270
a contributor which I think this was by

00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:32,880
being added to repositories I think I

00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:36,840
guess that's the commits 101 actually

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,640
pushes yeah yeah and then hot topic is

00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,840
one for mailing lists and then license

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,180
to push I think that was the one for

00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,110
being added to a visionary pen and so

00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,790
the point of these is that they're not

00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:46,290
applicable just to one project because

00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:47,810
more than one team use it like more than

00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:50,550
just infrastructure you just put your

00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:52,590
almost every project sub-team or

00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:54,450
subgroup users mailing lists so all of

00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:55,800
these can be applied to any team and

00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:57,840
this also helps take a little bit of the

00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:00,810
work off the badges team because they

00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:03,270
already have hundreds close to hundreds

00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:05,160
of tickets that are open or in progress

00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:06,300
so if we can target like the kind of

00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,820
badges that we're doing to be

00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:11,970
nonspecific to a specific or to like a

00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:13,740
one working group or one team it makes

00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:15,630
it easier to apply like these ones

00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:18,750
they'll be applicable to almost anyone

00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:20,760
in the project so for mailing lists

00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:22,470
that's definitely an obvious one and

00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:25,770
professor or any development oriented

00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:27,360
groups that could have an impact until

00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:29,220
they fit into the greater idea of making

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,290
it easier for people to get involved and

00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:38,030
to figure out the different areas that

00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:38,030
they can get started with and so

00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:41,639
the things that we wanted to do was

00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:44,970
having a team specific onboarding

00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:47,369
process discussion we wanted to look at

00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:49,230
who's on the teams that don't have an

00:12:47,369 --> 00:12:51,389
onboarding process and if you do have it

00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:54,209
what is it and where is it how publicly

00:12:51,389 --> 00:12:55,739
visible is it any steps specific to your

00:12:54,209 --> 00:12:57,269
team that we could help you out and look

00:12:55,739 --> 00:12:59,399
into for bringing new people into your

00:12:57,269 --> 00:13:01,860
team or our sub group or cig or a

00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:03,299
working group as well as feedback on the

00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:06,089
existing process like what's working now

00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:07,709
and what isn't does your team have many

00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:09,509
interested newcomers or is retainment

00:13:07,709 --> 00:13:10,739
more of the problem with keeping people

00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:12,569
there after they introduce themselves

00:13:10,739 --> 00:13:14,850
and they get involved a little bit and

00:13:12,569 --> 00:13:16,949
then they drop off as well as any future

00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:19,860
suggestions for onboarding as well so I

00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:23,549
know what the Python work Python cig

00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:24,869
that was one that had I was trying to

00:13:23,549 --> 00:13:27,089
understand a little bit so you guys have

00:13:24,869 --> 00:13:28,829
like an onboarding process at all or is

00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:32,059
it like I'm just trying on a jacket

00:13:28,829 --> 00:13:32,059
looked into it too much every

00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:46,370
so you basically it's sad if you want

00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:51,080
introduce yourself on quite a fellow

00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:58,040
members and ask for being added but it's

00:13:51,080 --> 00:14:07,490
a / 6 such vital gotcha so nowadays you

00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:10,670
change the little bit so go down that's

00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:15,530
the final sick posture is about putting

00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:17,090
yes so when someone's first getting

00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:18,290
involved with the sig what are they so

00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:23,840
they do an introduction on a meaningless

00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:27,980
to let people now and then yeah don't

00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:29,720
know okay the problem was that there is

00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:33,440
five with Sigma leave us which is

00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:38,000
fighting about right but then a fast

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:42,890
really originated by go six paths group

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:45,470
and you can give commentators rights for

00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:47,030
our packages to get through it also has

00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:51,220
a kind of May

00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:54,200
lest the receipts all the box law and

00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:56,600
conveyances stuff like that right and

00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:59,270
people who are the faster you receive

00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:01,880
the emails through this list but because

00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:05,750
some security issues like CBE is being

00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:09,200
posted her as we decided that the list

00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:11,870
is going to be private and all that I

00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:15,350
just said was written on wiki and

00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:18,140
everybody was like let me enter this

00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:20,750
secret mailing list I want to know your

00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:22,700
secret discussions but there was no

00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:25,520
discussion happening it was basically

00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:29,240
just like collect this how will it

00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:31,070
emails but we communicated so now will

00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,800
be key there is no mention of the

00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:36,140
managers of all that I and a lot of

00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,480
that's a good thing or a bad thing and

00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:40,340
now it says if you make them at least 55

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,250
in packages and you want to be part of

00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:49,070
idealistic custard you can talk to

00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:52,130
sponsor and size for the stair go in on

00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:56,680
the list yeah okay but I'm not sure

00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:56,680
you're not sure this is the right way

00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:07,960
gotcha I thought more about it my rocher

00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:10,250
nice perfect ok so I think in this case

00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,900
having like numbered steps will

00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:14,630
definitely be one of the places you

00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:19,820
could probably reply start with so

00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:21,950
looking at pull up I just playing a

00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:24,310
better way to do this with the monitors

00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:24,310
but

00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,970
so probably one thing we could do is by

00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:49,320
having and one thing we can do right now

00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:50,670
to help this would be to have a creating

00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,980
idea of its own we could have it on its

00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:54,270
own wiki page for now I've like a number

00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:59,430
of steps we're getting involved in the

00:16:54,270 --> 00:17:01,320
Python soup and from there we eventually

00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:02,820
like the kind of the whole point of

00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,829
having these like numbered steps right

00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:07,560
now is that in the future with fedora

00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:09,060
hubs it's fedora hubs IV are you out are

00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:12,270
you familiar with what's going on yeah

00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:13,319
cool so when fedora hubs comes along

00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,520
it's going to be tying in all these

00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:16,650
different areas of the project together

00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,240
and there's gonna be different modules

00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:19,949
that are identified for that already

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,300
have been or in progress of being

00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:24,449
identified for all the different teams

00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:25,680
needs like there's going to be there's

00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:28,110
some specific ones like there's like a

00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:30,320
wikitree one there's also like yesterday

00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:32,460
there was a talk about the IRC chat 1

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,590
and so when it comes time to like

00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:36,720
looking at a specific team or a cig or a

00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:38,070
working group it's helpful the hub's

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,960
team if they its second an

00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:42,120
easy-to-understand way for the other

00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,460
people to get involved so short term

00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:46,500
like a wiki page is kind of the idea but

00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,990
long term the strategic idea is more

00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,370
towards fedora hubs and making tying in

00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:52,710
those things like the steps for getting

00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:59,190
involved with things like badges would

00:17:52,710 --> 00:18:01,050
tie in really easily two hubs and so the

00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:02,340
ultimate goal of which is being with I

00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,840
mean that's kind of thing with hubs in

00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:06,450
general too is it is supposed to make it

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,820
the the work that we're doing in fedora

00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:11,030
are much more visible and so having like

00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:14,160
the onboarding process and hubs and

00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:16,230
defining it now for being created and

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:19,470
hubs later on is something that will

00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:21,930
make it easier to bring those people in

00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:23,460
long-term but for another time being a

00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:25,980
wiki page is what we've been doing for

00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,330
creating the joint steps so I think if

00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:31,640
we could like I haven't either pad that

00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:31,640
I just spun up in good charter

00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:47,260
coming up sorry you say that if a person

00:18:42,909 --> 00:18:51,260
is maintaining five packages packages

00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:53,510
no no mailing list there is fighting

00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:55,820
develop anybody we join them in

00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:58,460
supporting male egos and then there is a

00:18:55,820 --> 00:19:02,090
second mailing list which is not used

00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:04,210
for communication and so we just hide

00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:07,220
that from people because they always

00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:09,559
thought that there were the secret is

00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:12,820
type in essence but there were no secret

00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:17,000
discussions at all in space where there

00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:19,760
is a faster you that you can assign for

00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,610
packages so you can say I am the primary

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:26,030
come back for respective but first group

00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:29,179
I can say is commentator and anybody

00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:32,150
from the fury can commit to this package

00:19:29,179 --> 00:19:34,220
and if there is mean bugzilla report for

00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:36,799
a package it tells you the list as well

00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:41,140
and that's it that's the only purpose of

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:44,380
the list yells about supposed to post

00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:46,750
running holster gets an email go to

00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:51,610
tighten the valve instead for discussing

00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:54,360
stuff or something but people saw the

00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:57,640
problems the bandhas was called privacy

00:19:54,360 --> 00:20:00,670
and your secret so everybody was like

00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:04,450
why am I so strange I you can open

00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:07,140
source project you are so secretive and

00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:10,300
stuff like that and we have promised to

00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:15,280
communicate communicate in this to your

00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:17,230
actual quiet and fans in fedora Dutchman

00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,630
we decided we go Highland information

00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:21,760
from wiki and we will not mention

00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:25,030
intelligence at all the only mention to

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:27,940
pass through and not everybody cuz they

00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:35,180
wanted mainly want to join classroom

00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:38,510
front back right under the bed yeah so

00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:43,660
five packages by the sponsor and I'm

00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:43,660
sponsored by a so just imagine

00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:58,070
sighs Michael modules I just quite

00:20:50,059 --> 00:21:00,740
emotional side it also yes but it

00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:02,900
doesn't say we have five you will end up

00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:05,350
with being in a group if you have any

00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,350
saga

00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:13,970
so you currently it says if you are

00:21:11,929 --> 00:21:15,740
interested and you could have these my

00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:18,200
pictures that's just a like a low

00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:20,809
battery or so everybody just wants it in

00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:23,929
there see putbacks us I want to be

00:21:20,809 --> 00:21:26,330
member of plan to say and then the

00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:29,720
personal attention is the total sponsor

00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:32,659
and explain why we will join when he

00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:36,980
says I want bad I don't think that's one

00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:42,200
reason I mean creating the badge for

00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:43,700
roots erroneous and so for the purpose

00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,470
of the badge would be more about kind of

00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,669
exposing the Python sick as a whole

00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,320
because when people flip through like

00:21:46,669 --> 00:21:51,620
the badges index and I see the Python

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:54,379
sick or elderly honestly the purpose of

00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:58,820
badge was so I can develop a shooting

00:21:54,379 --> 00:22:02,240
everything for lesser than that so am I

00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:07,309
seen other other groups have edges so

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:09,200
like 80 safe have a badge esse has a bag

00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:10,540
so i thought it's easy to create a

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,450
graphics i will just

00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:18,160
replace longer the final logo and i will

00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:22,180
create a quiet and see but right first

00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:26,440
and designing and proposing and it's

00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:27,400
kind of like it grows exponentially so i

00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,590
think what would be helpful right now

00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,990
for this one is if we do like a just

00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:33,700
walk through each so if you were a new

00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:34,810
person coming to the python sick or if

00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,040
you were looking at someone getting

00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:38,500
involved what would be the steps you'd

00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:41,440
want them to follow with as we getting

00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:45,220
definitely wonder why i would've shown

00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:48,610
in we would like to communicate this is

00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:50,230
not some like only because Saudi member

00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:52,360
of the same if you just end your

00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:53,950
language wiki right that's the first

00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,660
thing I'm sorry if you just want to be

00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:57,910
member of the state try to make us

00:22:55,660 --> 00:23:00,220
joined our to chill and you're into the

00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:03,520
week ep one or if you don't learn to me

00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:05,050
that you just like an informal member

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:09,520
and if you want to be a member of the

00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:12,100
faster you then you have to explain why

00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:15,640
and it's kinda like a proven packager

00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:18,130
for biking packages but only for those

00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:21,730
packages where the retailer's decided if

00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:24,520
they go like get rice say it's an

00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:27,040
automatically happening right so it's

00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:30,270
not so strong as fruit a paper but it's

00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:33,220
not so easy as being part of the island

00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:34,800
something else entirely yeah if you give

00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:37,680
I

00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:40,380
privileges in Mara like they can push

00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:42,630
through our people package messages so I

00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:44,880
think they'd at least have sponsored

00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:47,940
packages that's the process environment

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,950
and we we kind of decided who they're

00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:53,100
like half at least fight by the packages

00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:55,230
so you can look at them and see how you

00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:58,040
maintain it if you are fragile and stuff

00:23:55,230 --> 00:24:01,800
again we even have set of rules that

00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:04,550
says follow these ten steps in the end

00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:07,770
you will be definitely the cargo

00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:11,040
constant when people hit the back right

00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:12,810
okay so then I guess the first thing

00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:15,230
with that fit of it into you want to

00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:20,040
have an introduction on Manning list

00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:22,700
interruption Allah mailing was turning

00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,700
cars so

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,820
yeah and

00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:32,849
we don't apply to us directly by

00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:36,989
clicking a button you contact the

00:24:32,849 --> 00:24:39,679
sponsor in ask the sponsor to be added

00:24:36,989 --> 00:24:44,479
to the fast way to the fast food and

00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:47,999
sponsor the sides by whatever means that

00:24:44,479 --> 00:24:55,769
he will help you or not do you have any

00:24:47,999 --> 00:24:59,699
kind sorry masteress have mentors they

00:24:55,769 --> 00:25:02,279
are some rules these there are no

00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:04,709
results you i can say because we

00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:08,069
approach there were even less rules

00:25:04,709 --> 00:25:10,379
before we're trying to formalize it a

00:25:08,069 --> 00:25:13,669
little bit but we don't want me to like

00:25:10,379 --> 00:25:16,889
our clinical or purple is approached by

00:25:13,669 --> 00:25:19,829
regrets or bureaucracy idiocracy yeah

00:25:16,889 --> 00:25:21,869
you know like maybe chico blacks excel

00:25:19,829 --> 00:25:25,249
the store and then over the ticket and

00:25:21,869 --> 00:25:30,479
then yeah something that we won't be

00:25:25,249 --> 00:25:32,909
cozy and informal but still one mate so

00:25:30,479 --> 00:25:36,059
it doesn't so for example nobody would

00:25:32,909 --> 00:25:38,219
say how come you are on the same and i

00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:40,889
am not i completely to fighting for

00:25:38,219 --> 00:25:45,119
amorous is unfair and stuff like that

00:25:40,889 --> 00:25:47,959
and so we don't want this to happen it

00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:47,959
never happened

00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:52,000
so we'll probably helpful let me know

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,530
the things like what would you say are

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,960
like so when you're sponsoring someone

00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:57,370
with a cig what would you say are things

00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,870
that you're looking for like key like

00:25:57,370 --> 00:26:00,940
check marks that you're looking for for

00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:03,010
your activity or for their what they're

00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:05,740
doing in fedora with Python packages

00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:09,130
they are protectors if they didn't start

00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:16,660
packaging yesterday if they maintain a

00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:18,850
lot of fine packages they have been a

00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:21,310
package of my existing six months know

00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:24,100
that there is no Harlan is just right on

00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:26,950
in my head like I need to check if the

00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:30,280
person has any experience by the

00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:32,590
packaging and if I for example if I

00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:36,400
don't never I don't know who he is or

00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:40,750
she and I never met a person that I can

00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:45,460
move to the data and see oh he or she

00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:49,450
has been perfecting federal careers this

00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:52,630
is obvious I will take the person but if

00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:56,230
on the other hand I need the person like

00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:59,590
face-to-face yeah the person would have

00:26:56,230 --> 00:27:02,740
started today but it commenced me that

00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:07,150
is right person for you

00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:10,740
right so I still want to give this front

00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:14,770
of the room do you like these their own

00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:17,110
judgment but I don't want to get better

00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:21,910
so we don't but you didn't say this is

00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:25,710
unfair and non transparent process by a

00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:25,710
person wants to be a package of

00:27:25,779 --> 00:27:31,779
if they want to be my connection for the

00:27:28,309 --> 00:27:35,509
first time then there are two situations

00:27:31,779 --> 00:27:37,249
firstly start being painters at all and

00:27:35,509 --> 00:27:43,999
everyone is invited and able to package

00:27:37,249 --> 00:27:48,440
type of stuff just so they acting but

00:27:43,999 --> 00:27:52,309
they could possibly seek packaging

00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:55,879
sponsors in the vital city roof because

00:27:52,309 --> 00:27:58,999
it will make more sense they will end up

00:27:55,879 --> 00:28:04,849
with me again I guess and maybe there

00:27:58,999 --> 00:28:09,409
are other furniture or their respected

00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:12,559
recoges stuff for years but never

00:28:09,409 --> 00:28:15,469
finished anything in fightin and once

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:18,409
held again the person can reach back to

00:28:15,469 --> 00:28:21,769
say or TRS channel for example hey guys

00:28:18,409 --> 00:28:24,049
how do I do this I wouldn't make it five

00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:26,109
in TV and highly free compatible where

00:28:24,049 --> 00:28:29,899
do I lose the guidelines are messy and

00:28:26,109 --> 00:28:33,079
real give personal advice but the

00:28:29,899 --> 00:28:37,549
interface we want Evan to the fast food

00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:38,419
immediately but after we decide yet you

00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:48,739
know your

00:28:38,419 --> 00:28:50,359
business okay you think there again I

00:28:48,739 --> 00:28:51,590
guess there's different scales like the

00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:53,809
type of package is somebody we're

00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:55,340
maintaining and you'd have a simple so I

00:28:53,809 --> 00:28:56,869
put a number like the minimum number of

00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:58,809
packages or having like a number on

00:28:56,869 --> 00:29:01,460
Saturday applicable because you have

00:28:58,809 --> 00:29:02,720
people might have like 15 packages

00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:04,489
because it's really small like many

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,379
libraries and might have someone who has

00:29:04,489 --> 00:29:10,609
like three what are these like huge

00:29:06,379 --> 00:29:14,359
projects yeah okay sorry for poor

00:29:10,609 --> 00:29:18,289
vectors I believe it says you have to

00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:21,950
download we use high quality reviews and

00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:24,739
there is an actually voting process so

00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:27,289
unified he is not group manager and

00:29:24,739 --> 00:29:30,830
sponsors it's different it's different

00:29:27,289 --> 00:29:34,220
but they sorry this is yes voters as a

00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:38,179
director and other sponsors then they

00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:40,850
vote in the matter like in prime frame

00:29:38,179 --> 00:29:43,879
of week you need to collect the need at

00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:46,369
least three classes and be able to beat

00:29:43,879 --> 00:29:49,239
you have any more losses than the

00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:52,279
minuses and then you became become

00:29:49,239 --> 00:29:55,690
sponsor but this is possible because we

00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:59,090
have a lot of sponsors but when

00:29:55,690 --> 00:30:02,299
financing is like the past week has 20

00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:03,320
members and force converse so I don't

00:30:02,299 --> 00:30:07,390
think any

00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:07,390
is making any sense

00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:16,260
just as I can remember it exactly yeah

00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:19,450
here give me tricking deadly pretty yeah

00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:20,350
okay cool and so you definitely want

00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:24,310
them to have some kind of background

00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:25,860
with a unified front of course so you

00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:27,670
probably want to have that somewhere

00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:29,860
having that information on their

00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:31,990
userpage on the wiki or in the

00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:33,370
introduction to I would make it easier

00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:35,050
for you to like be able to tell of

00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:37,360
someone or like when you're reviewing

00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:40,630
someone to get into the cig like what

00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:44,020
things would definitely it helps me if

00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:47,080
they actually tell why people to join

00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:49,690
and by the same they should return if

00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:51,880
they are worse and then you can they get

00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:56,910
obviously lied you know we won the badge

00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:56,910
so you figure out something just yeah

00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:03,950
so you will lie about your life

00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:06,440
experience but then I can like smell

00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:11,330
this and see if you actually have some

00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:15,830
fun you can they fix it we get into

00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:23,450
another batch you try to fight and then

00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:26,090
everybody would just drive so you want

00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:31,310
the background why they want to join is

00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:33,590
their experience with me dejan ver not

00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:35,720
highly traveled this is mostly about

00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:38,540
private equity there they might be

00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:41,470
excellent five min developers but was

00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:41,470
your experience affected

00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:57,049
this brings you will talk about now

00:31:54,409 --> 00:32:00,970
having a hypoxic down for two hours

00:31:57,049 --> 00:32:06,289
right time we get we get cookie this

00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:07,970
having oh I think this is yeah I think

00:32:06,289 --> 00:32:10,840
now that like having this info and

00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:14,509
knowing about that definitely helps yeah

00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:15,500
yeah yeah so I think that this is

00:32:14,509 --> 00:32:18,830
something that we can definitely help

00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:20,149
with and actually um I kind of have some

00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:22,940
ideas that we could try to do to bring

00:32:20,149 --> 00:32:25,250
hey I think I'm on the development I

00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:30,139
think I've seen some of it are ya you

00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:32,600
posted when they yeah yeah didn't open

00:32:30,139 --> 00:32:35,169
up the ticket you know two kinds of

00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:38,029
Elvis that's how I knew about it gotcha

00:32:35,169 --> 00:32:40,279
unfortunately not not many tightly sick

00:32:38,029 --> 00:32:46,509
members for actually participating in

00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:46,509
the special so we convictions so yeah

00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:52,860
posted it on your own like lemon or a

00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:52,860
sweet heat

00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:01,430
so we originally planned click by not

00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:05,920
for the on forex please and then when I

00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:11,650
for the road still electrically

00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:13,240
I think a lot of user to see what else

00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:15,160
people wanted to bring up to with I know

00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,690
we have some people who are I mean I can

00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:19,480
see a number of you who were involved

00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:21,400
with ambassadors as well as marketing to

00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:27,580
that's one that I was kind of interested

00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:28,870
in as well because I think ambassadors

00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:30,430
is one that's always kind of interested

00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:31,600
me because I feel like that's one that

00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:33,400
could be improved for bringing in new

00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,780
people at least I think the way that

00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:37,330
they do onboarding is definitely

00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:39,280
different from I mean eggs with the

00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:40,780
whole mentorship process and then how

00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,940
you walk through the page like with the

00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:45,610
ambassador's list being private by

00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:46,870
default it's difficult for someone who's

00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:49,750
interested in being an ambassador to

00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:50,890
participate on that list or to

00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:53,140
communicate with other people who are

00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:57,280
interested or or want to help or so on

00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:59,320
and so forth well you have to be

00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,670
sponsored first it's publicly viewable

00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:05,490
but you can't participate in the

00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:05,490
discussion just subscribe to this yeah

00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:18,910
I don't want to join imagine the

00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:21,460
situation yeah seeking advice from

00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:23,470
ambassador is still avail to the making

00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:27,070
this that it needs to be moderated

00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:33,730
manually and who does that doesn't even

00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:36,760
happen I do it yeah but really because

00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:39,070
of so much spam you're easy to get lost

00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,850
and they're also comes the problem to

00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:42,250
that they're not going to receive

00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:43,929
replies unless they are explicitly cc'd

00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:54,910
on the email to or they're watching

00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:57,340
that's any other suggestions um so I

00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:59,560
think one thing that I like short term

00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:01,330
for fit for the ambassador's I think

00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:04,260
having like going through the wiki pages

00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:07,180
for getting involved is five or six like

00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:09,820
pages with paragraphs and paragraphs of

00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:11,560
information which is helpful for making

00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:13,240
sure that someone's really interested in

00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:15,130
understanding the full process of how to

00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:16,300
get involved but can also be just

00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:18,520
difficult to get through and I think

00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:20,290
having like where somebody wants to get

00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,520
involved with the with the ambassador's

00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:22,960
list there's no plate or for the

00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,390
ambassador's there's no place than the

00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,370
look and have like one two three four

00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:30,040
five things I have to do to be involved

00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:32,890
you have to go to me five or six

00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:34,000
different pages navigate through it all

00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:36,010
I mean it's not a very I don't think

00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,410
it's a very clearly defined process like

00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:40,330
publicly like you have to if you're in

00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:41,590
the ambassador's you know it or if

00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:43,510
you're going through the six different

00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:44,770
wiki pages it's clear so like one short

00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:47,800
term thing I think will be helpful for

00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:51,070
ambassadors is making the steps for

00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:52,839
becoming involved I can order series and

00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:58,450
having that on its own page with more

00:35:52,839 --> 00:36:01,210
tells but okay how can it be any soup

00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:03,489
well if you have you look at the content

00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:08,859
on the pages you have I mean it's just

00:36:03,489 --> 00:36:12,910
so much text and it loves this it's

00:36:08,859 --> 00:36:14,859
taking her speedy and now I know the

00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:16,869
person or group is another beginners

00:36:14,859 --> 00:36:18,819
movement if somebody's able to read oh

00:36:16,869 --> 00:36:19,960
BTW page with more than five paragraphs

00:36:18,819 --> 00:36:22,150
you shouldn't be an aggressive our

00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:23,920
pupils well sure but i think the point

00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:29,890
I'm getting at here is not that it's the

00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:31,539
best yeah attention span but like

00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:34,119
there's no like easy way to tell that

00:36:31,539 --> 00:36:35,349
from the outside I think selling is I

00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:36,489
think it can be made more clear for the

00:36:35,349 --> 00:36:40,960
steps to become involved as an

00:36:36,489 --> 00:36:42,609
ambassador because the pages are oh I

00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:45,849
don't still think that method works that

00:36:42,609 --> 00:36:50,190
well for being kind of compromise here

00:36:45,849 --> 00:36:53,079
when you can be like here are rough sets

00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:55,299
become an ambassador and if you know you

00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:58,630
can read it yet that's something I guess

00:36:55,299 --> 00:37:01,509
or less and if you are so interested now

00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:06,039
go and read the long thing right that

00:37:01,509 --> 00:37:08,380
will focus their attention and cross for

00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:10,509
example the pages if I'm not interested

00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:14,050
in being an ambassador but I'm just

00:37:10,509 --> 00:37:25,890
curious how that happens yeah the list

00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:28,120
I I'm not saying that the guidelines are

00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:30,280
incorrect that there are necessary I

00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:34,030
must save some steps I actually outdated

00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:36,880
or there's like you read credit for Dora

00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:42,880
we should just add the Romans in every

00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:44,830
day but these are just minor glitches i

00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:48,220
think it's not that process is

00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:53,110
completely broken and i don't think it's

00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:55,830
too complex at all might be because you

00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:55,830
are already

00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:02,570
we set a certain bar for reason yeah

00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:06,500
under the first that's why I'm saying

00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:09,650
keep it that way but made it too long to

00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:12,980
the brief version just where we can get

00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:17,690
a idea the click-through wizard is five

00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:22,120
pages time and actually there is there

00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:24,560
is an overview page that outlines this

00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:28,270
the process rated use a wiki page

00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,270
explore the federal project

00:38:30,609 --> 00:38:41,449
five steps and of course that create

00:38:34,759 --> 00:38:44,169
account button or us that is 51 yeah for

00:38:41,449 --> 00:38:44,169
some reason so

00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:53,260
if you now click through the village

00:38:55,060 --> 00:39:00,080
so

00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,080
two

00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:18,560
so basically you take the headlines of

00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:20,660
those and you sorry I left you get on

00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:23,680
one and go to take on taking then you

00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:28,790
will see it yes Abdullah speck yes

00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:31,100
that's weird dude out of it if you see

00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:33,590
that but there you have crazy bday over

00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:37,130
okay yeah that should basically be the

00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:39,290
disperse this one yeah yeah here you

00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:42,460
have five steps again that's your basic

00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:47,690
we think this is Grace and up when you

00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:49,400
this this starter stop yeah ok so I

00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:50,930
think also of having that many pages to

00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,040
a minx gardening it and maintaining it a

00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:54,080
little bit difficult with like some of

00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:55,490
the information that was on there so I

00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:59,480
think maybe bringing it into like a

00:39:55,490 --> 00:40:06,110
single place would also be else I have

00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:08,000
been well let's think it was designed

00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:11,950
like this for a reason and they're there

00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,950
a lot of work has gone into this

00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:19,099
the people to talk about talk to well

00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:20,810
goodness look at pages 3 attitude

00:40:19,099 --> 00:40:26,740
these conventions

00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:26,740
and ultimately the proctor is

00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:36,660
administration we as fans who also have

00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:40,020
some ideas from to improve

00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:45,869
process will restructure not like just

00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:48,359
change them yes but again I s as a

00:40:45,869 --> 00:40:51,619
council member who has somebody who's

00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:51,619
been around and the Empress

00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:58,769
years and go forward

00:40:56,049 --> 00:41:05,439
for years I wouldn't just go and do it

00:40:58,769 --> 00:41:07,089
talk to the elders right oh I mean yeah

00:41:05,439 --> 00:41:09,519
and I wouldn't be suggesting like this

00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:15,400
going forward and doing it right there

00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:19,239
would be discussion for it but so my

00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:23,170
precious on Mars is that the comp ops

00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:28,859
team is a little these are all groupies

00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:31,119
and they are very proactive well they're

00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:34,709
freshmen and they are very enthusiastic

00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:38,819
and you will go forward the pace and

00:41:34,709 --> 00:41:38,819
sometimes don't forget the right

00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:45,780
yeah you need to be whenever you do

00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:47,950
something and you're basically

00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:50,980
collaborating with all the other groups

00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:53,200
in fedora I think you need to be very

00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:57,190
careful and get in touch with the

00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:59,000
stakeholders as far as I can see it's

00:41:57,190 --> 00:42:02,150
something I mean this

00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:04,520
I would hear touching it for the simple

00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:09,970
reason I know how much effort into it

00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:13,100
how discussions about these things so

00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:15,740
and if you then come up with some group

00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:17,390
met suggestions they were the same come

00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:19,520
on we've been there we've done that go

00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:22,670
get up on the mailing list and we have

00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:25,810
to search through menus archives of

00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:29,250
Wales when you were still in high school

00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:31,760
years before you entered

00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:31,760
so

00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:38,220
yeah sometimes I think it's difficult on

00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:39,770
the one hand of course we want to get

00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:43,130
her eyes and open that

00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:48,760
be able to anticipate and put their

00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:52,060
stuff but on the other hand make sure to

00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:52,060
interfere with

00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:15,500
yeah sure they have food in politics and

00:43:13,309 --> 00:43:17,299
I mean I think the reason why I kind of

00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:18,859
like zoning on the ambassador's like I

00:43:17,299 --> 00:43:20,420
think I don't know if I necessarily

00:43:18,859 --> 00:43:22,190
agree with like kind of having the

00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:24,710
really high bar for him I mean not that

00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:26,329
what they're doing is and I mean I don't

00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:28,910
like the sponsorship the mentorship

00:43:26,329 --> 00:43:30,260
right I agree with that but like I think

00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:31,760
the process we're getting involved like

00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:33,950
I think ambassadors is one of like the

00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,299
greatest and easiest may not easiest

00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:36,380
with the group one of the greatest ways

00:43:35,299 --> 00:43:37,609
your people to get involved with the

00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:39,200
project because that's one of the ways

00:43:37,609 --> 00:43:42,410
it's I think bridging the gap between

00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:50,779
making users and bringing them into the

00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:55,750
project actually I would finally talk to

00:43:50,779 --> 00:43:55,750
you that then you

00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:04,300
project we had lengthy discussions that

00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:04,300
we should make

00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:10,460
CLA last one our group

00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:12,970
well some people even say we should have

00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:17,470
allowed any body to become an ambassador

00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:17,470
unless he or she has remember

00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:23,980
somehow a group so it's definitely not a

00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:26,680
beginners group we want so do quantity

00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:30,400
it's like it when you are in an event

00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:36,640
and people are really advanced questions

00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:40,320
you we don't want hand if it's just

00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:41,930
knowing improved I'm afraid that

00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:45,140
we don't know

00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:49,309
constantia but you may need for media I

00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:57,650
know you're in Berlin right but as far

00:44:49,309 --> 00:44:59,750
as I know in a problem no just a gentle

00:44:57,650 --> 00:45:03,380
that's going on for ages equally what

00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:06,680
celebs existed it's that you get a lot

00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:09,640
of Indian students to apply to become a

00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:12,800
photographer just to get a fedora

00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:15,589
protector or email address and to get

00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:18,380
the title because it looks like nice and

00:45:15,589 --> 00:45:20,750
their resume that's why the requirements

00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:23,150
for the Indian ambassador spectrum is

00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:25,790
stricter on one of these pages it says

00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:28,309
if you're from India please make sure

00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:32,050
that we require you to finish one

00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:36,280
project first it can be like G saw or

00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:36,280
taking part in the group

00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:45,480
you cannot be a message

00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:53,339
you can get an and you can buy this we

00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:57,089
don't encourage you to but you still get

00:45:53,339 --> 00:45:58,500
if you are a computer and someone's

00:45:57,089 --> 00:46:00,660
really if you have been around in the

00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:03,599
Fedora community for a year and helped

00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:06,030
in packaging or what or come off

00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:08,339
whatever rocks or something we certainly

00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:15,650
nobody I don't think a sponsor would

00:46:08,339 --> 00:46:15,650
reject you just because you're right

00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:32,130
but yeah me too right brother power is

00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:34,500
very high on purpose don't want to mess

00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:36,240
with critical infrastructure here our

00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:38,100
new beef but I also really like I would

00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:40,800
be like I would never reject somebody

00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:42,210
feel different but also on the other

00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,980
hand look at how easy it is to get into

00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:45,540
the infrastructure fi group the

00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:46,920
apprentice program like I really like

00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:48,450
that approach because it's a way to kind

00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:50,910
of get a taste of it and get involved

00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:54,060
with infrastructure without you know

00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:55,620
having our mrf rude you know I mean I

00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:57,390
think that's a great i really like their

00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:58,890
approach to doing that is if you want to

00:46:57,390 --> 00:47:00,660
get involved you drop an introduction

00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:03,270
you say hey I want to do this and you

00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:05,460
get read-only access to a handful of

00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:07,500
machines so you can see what's going on

00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:09,120
on there and you can kind of get get

00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:10,680
familiar with the technology kind of see

00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:12,510
what's happening behind the scenes and

00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:18,540
then you find a ticket that you want to

00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:21,960
work on and II the apprenticeship

00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:25,320
program I don't know when that is the F

00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:28,200
it's the FI group but basically that's

00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:30,360
it's like the preliminary step for

00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,710
infrastructure onboarding so when you're

00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:33,990
getting involved with infrastructure you

00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:36,420
first start as an apprentice and when

00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:38,010
you apply for that we do an introduction

00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:40,050
of manless and you want to get involved

00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:44,580
the things you want to assist with the

00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:46,950
usual things and so then that's me sorry

00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:50,849
yeah

00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:52,619
already had to report information on I

00:47:50,849 --> 00:47:55,260
mean if you tell them my one word that

00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:56,940
we need to know what exactly at that

00:47:55,260 --> 00:48:02,250
point here probably read more

00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:04,790
information than you will ever for the

00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:04,790
ambassadors

00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:17,290
so this is the the page that kind of

00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:24,880
explains the that's not really all I

00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:26,859
mean you cannot say yeah it is you

00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:29,920
cannot say well and you cannot say I

00:48:26,859 --> 00:48:32,589
want to work on meshing if you don't

00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:36,609
know how coji words and if the neuro

00:48:32,589 --> 00:48:38,849
management works right but but I kind of

00:48:36,609 --> 00:48:41,290
like about this though is that it's a

00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:42,520
beginning step it's not like if you want

00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:43,720
to be in the infrastructures like okay

00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:45,700
you have to do all these other things

00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:47,589
first to get involved you can come in

00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:50,380
without having any background in fedora

00:48:47,589 --> 00:48:51,400
it happens about every few weeks they'll

00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:52,750
be a new introduction on the mailing

00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,280
list sometimes they stick around they

00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:56,740
become active contributors other times

00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:58,270
when what happens is the every the

00:48:56,740 --> 00:49:00,099
beginning of every month an email goes

00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:01,450
out saying if you're in the

00:49:00,099 --> 00:49:03,820
infrastructure apprentice group please

00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:04,869
reply and it has questions and said what

00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:06,310
are you working on or have you tried

00:49:04,869 --> 00:49:07,960
logging into the machines and are you

00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:09,940
still you're still understood in being a

00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:12,040
part of it and if they don't if Kevin

00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:13,420
doesn't get a reply they get removed

00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:15,099
from the infrastructure group and they

00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:16,690
lose the read-only access but if they

00:49:15,099 --> 00:49:19,540
reply and saying oh yeah like I'm still

00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:20,950
checking this out or I'm involved or I'm

00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:22,750
still playing around with things trying

00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:25,450
to find a ticket to work on it can

00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:27,220
maintain the read-only access and

00:49:25,450 --> 00:49:29,440
they're working on an issue they can get

00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:34,510
support for that from the infrastructure

00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:36,760
team doing back so a lot of other

00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:38,430
programs like I know Mozilla kind of has

00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:40,960
their own approach to it but I think

00:49:38,430 --> 00:49:43,420
motivating students to do things on

00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:45,190
their own or lease and it isn't does not

00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:50,369
just students but like the ability to

00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:50,369
self-organize and not necessarily

00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:01,450
for the action on the floor and say

00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:03,700
things which I do not have any way so

00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:07,240
what does he say as an ambassador that

00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:09,309
has her up by our right right Trent have

00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:11,530
to be very responsible for her loss for

00:50:09,309 --> 00:50:14,890
words in use are not move right because

00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:18,299
and that will make any and what so a guy

00:50:14,890 --> 00:50:22,679
in unity terrestre and work

00:50:18,299 --> 00:50:25,430
put some ice machines did not hamper any

00:50:22,679 --> 00:50:27,559
public insensible

00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:31,819
sandbox but here what do you mean

00:50:27,559 --> 00:50:35,680
example see how do you they contain that

00:50:31,819 --> 00:50:38,619
person so that he works in a campaign

00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:41,240
appearance like but right here could be

00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:44,660
these actions of the federal facility

00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:47,210
has to be harmful right its associated

00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:50,030
the talking thing at that Eddie ideas

00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:52,160
back how do you translate that I get

00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:54,920
from favorite products structure in this

00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:56,869
tool and Beth are the engine this isn't

00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:58,460
the mentor program is similar but of

00:50:56,869 --> 00:51:01,010
this if we are trying to become an

00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:04,099
ambassador includes words of your mail

00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:06,020
folders that is easier than Ecuador away

00:51:04,099 --> 00:51:08,869
so it's not something you can go and

00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:10,550
play around in front of profit right so

00:51:08,869 --> 00:51:12,740
you have to be very much bottle but you

00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:14,030
can be safer they even victor over it

00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:18,050
with the

00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:22,700
and that will come only fifteen forty

00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:25,390
for a longer time right i am very if you

00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:28,910
can find some sample syndrome and wait

00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:30,920
it is good but i can see any sandbox

00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:32,060
environment for training and battles if

00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:35,480
they're just be the goal is just

00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:37,550
remember as in the voice all but if they

00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:41,030
want to be able to clearly and they're

00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:43,130
able to see teachers I put that if this

00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:46,650
message for every moving to

00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:48,990
activities that and bikes so yes

00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:52,140
my project and has to do something

00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:54,180
exciting bullet physics everyone can go

00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:57,510
out and speak because it be the medium

00:51:54,180 --> 00:52:00,420
and that's a little accident oh yeah why

00:51:57,510 --> 00:52:03,180
are you that we like speaking it like at

00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:04,680
a local environment and I having kind of

00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:06,270
some kind of experience before that

00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:07,350
whether it's like not as I thought our

00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:08,820
ambassador but let's say it's like

00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:10,740
getting a talk on something in fedora

00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:12,270
okay here's a suit that's what each

00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:14,010
supported like someone you have the

00:52:12,270 --> 00:52:16,530
concert it right well somebody to come

00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:19,530
to the operator or somebody like at

00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:21,930
least one packing to draw and he is

00:52:19,530 --> 00:52:22,320
exactly what we usually get automatic it

00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:24,840
won't

00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:27,900
miss Pearson like classmates or people

00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:29,910
right that's what gave the drug paya any

00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:32,100
other things then ambassador so that

00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:34,290
antique is really learning for that I

00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:35,670
had was Julius who started their careers

00:52:34,290 --> 00:52:37,710
as sponsored us because they are not

00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:40,560
good at programming but not the programs

00:52:37,710 --> 00:52:43,170
but this does it end like yeah so and

00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:45,630
they included when you announce it for

00:52:43,170 --> 00:52:48,110
your physical them and that transfers is

00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:50,790
very easy to become translucent granted

00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:56,840
but you do something for the community

00:52:50,790 --> 00:52:56,840
rate right so that's what I just

00:52:56,990 --> 00:53:02,800
and that's where I think the refs forum

00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,800
has gone wrong

00:53:04,859 --> 00:53:12,239
the other fencibles of the atoms of Burt

00:53:08,549 --> 00:53:14,210
bucks right I not say that well if you

00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:17,220
can finance and Watson normal doesn't

00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:19,380
like because windows not have so much

00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:22,470
time to go and like pink or it won't

00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:24,239
become ambassador right so but we can

00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:26,430
talk somewhere less hanboks environment

00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:28,710
he could have gotten ambassador in a

00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:32,599
college he can make it before he gets

00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:36,180
out of the college you can train someone

00:53:32,599 --> 00:53:38,609
taking like Chevy slow to make an

00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:40,289
excellent apology and by the time he

00:53:38,609 --> 00:53:43,019
graduates you can actually have an

00:53:40,289 --> 00:53:45,450
investment ready the campus but it's

00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:47,549
long is not that I team comes ambassador

00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:49,739
in the day or month ebooks through the

00:53:47,549 --> 00:53:51,630
training process and and that also

00:53:49,739 --> 00:53:58,430
depends at that editor has to be

00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:58,430
interested in if somebody's at 11 right

00:54:00,259 --> 00:54:05,099
taking can eat down with the sandbox

00:54:02,579 --> 00:54:07,200
never a process like how you can

00:54:05,099 --> 00:54:13,829
actually make quite readers and then

00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:16,980
come then to that right there is a very

00:54:13,829 --> 00:54:19,289
good someone conclusive any project it

00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:21,079
is supported by fedora and then slowly

00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:28,079
you see that there is between the pocket

00:54:21,079 --> 00:54:32,579
then awesome food and area I completely

00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:34,680
agree yeah it's a tough question because

00:54:32,579 --> 00:54:36,150
I mean really would only sandbox like

00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:37,499
everything I think of would be things

00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:40,859
that they're doing on their own locally

00:54:37,499 --> 00:54:44,249
not directly associated as pedorra but

00:54:40,859 --> 00:54:46,499
just local advis advocacy that they're

00:54:44,249 --> 00:54:49,589
already doing it but you know it might

00:54:46,499 --> 00:54:51,300
not be the best approach I know is what

00:54:49,589 --> 00:54:53,450
I people

00:54:51,300 --> 00:55:00,290
love because I know people who have

00:54:53,450 --> 00:55:00,290
granted places and they draw on it

00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:06,360
Jeffrey provincial by that yeah so you

00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:12,470
don't want to send people to kind of

00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:12,470
green right that has been

00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:21,690
a bank regional we also have some some

00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:21,690
even get some cases of

00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:30,720
and so on so it's not a lot for some

00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:34,590
yeast it's always staying in particular

00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:36,819
in here I don't know why that's why me

00:55:34,590 --> 00:55:42,970
as like

00:55:36,819 --> 00:55:50,290
certain things you just said session

00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:52,710
it's difficult to fight the right to

00:55:50,290 --> 00:55:56,230
make the power I are not reliable Oh

00:55:52,710 --> 00:56:01,510
like we recently managed to grow the

00:55:56,230 --> 00:56:03,279
Iranian community in quite a lot I think

00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:05,759
we are totally really

00:56:03,279 --> 00:56:05,759
invest

00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:09,809
our

00:56:07,569 --> 00:56:14,400
so for them

00:56:09,809 --> 00:56:16,979
vania vs strict but four of the other

00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:18,539
hand the india i would be more strict

00:56:16,979 --> 00:56:21,170
because we already have an established

00:56:18,539 --> 00:56:21,170
community

00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:25,880
so it's difficult that's why mystical

00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:31,480
microscopes

00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:31,480
I know that cops is doing a lot of

00:56:32,349 --> 00:56:37,749
other groups are doing a lot of

00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:40,349
automated tasks for example the email

00:56:37,749 --> 00:56:40,349
like Kevin's

00:56:41,319 --> 00:56:47,329
probably so yeah yes something like that

00:56:43,730 --> 00:56:48,890
but you cannot you still need at the end

00:56:47,329 --> 00:56:53,089
of the day a human mates to make a

00:56:48,890 --> 00:56:54,500
decision it's a gut feeling all right I

00:56:53,089 --> 00:56:55,940
think the human interaction for

00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:57,559
ambassadors especially seeing as the

00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:58,670
deals with so much human interaction i

00:56:57,559 --> 00:57:00,170
think that makes sense for that group

00:56:58,670 --> 00:57:04,940
I'm not saying like remove the

00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:08,869
sponsorship I don't know yeah I know you

00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:10,640
sing me if you're if you out what I

00:57:08,869 --> 00:57:12,049
wanted to say is if you're if you have

00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:16,430
suggested charged with improvement

00:57:12,049 --> 00:57:22,780
process go ahead do it but brace

00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:26,550
yourself for some people yelling it

00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:31,050
there will be people who

00:57:26,550 --> 00:57:32,869
has been around for so long

00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:38,210
us this newbie

00:57:32,869 --> 00:57:40,609
what's key to tell us and to some degree

00:57:38,210 --> 00:57:48,549
you can understand their point of view I

00:57:40,609 --> 00:57:48,549
mean your point of view whatever seeking

00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:57,209
Alice to be productive

00:57:54,019 --> 00:58:00,179
it's give me both sides also like the

00:57:57,209 --> 00:58:02,429
old fart sometimes are too narrow minded

00:58:00,179 --> 00:58:07,140
it has always been like this that we

00:58:02,429 --> 00:58:13,160
keep it this way it's not a strike

00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:13,160
balance I not exactly on the barber

00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:19,810
because I was

00:58:19,869 --> 00:58:24,670
incidentally stop happening so actually

00:58:25,779 --> 00:58:33,890
frequency so we need to induce an

00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:36,349
evangelist adoro but first best pursue

00:58:33,890 --> 00:58:43,339
10 then connect to what is in us because

00:58:36,349 --> 00:58:46,789
it s in committee right how do we do

00:58:43,339 --> 00:58:49,069
that like perfect because I also

00:58:46,789 --> 00:58:51,589
eliminated on because I work on projects

00:58:49,069 --> 00:58:53,450
in the weekend so right but organized

00:58:51,589 --> 00:58:56,240
the corner to make because I see that

00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:58,339
 mom happens but aqua after but her

00:58:56,240 --> 00:59:02,750
heart is in college people volunteer and

00:58:58,339 --> 00:59:05,570
important one we have

00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:11,450
oh they're coming back from there but

00:59:05,570 --> 00:59:16,250
are there any people or not community we

00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:18,950
i do not see much faces for Tom Hanks I

00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:21,950
do not see that very few faces see that

00:59:18,950 --> 00:59:24,860
on and they ever done with it so how

00:59:21,950 --> 00:59:27,260
because we have the order and

00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:29,240
even like that right so right follow-up

00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:32,150
strategy that again like at least like

00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:33,530
what happens in eCollege acting

00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:36,560
different call this area so at least

00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:38,990
depends and show that like 10 person

00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:42,820
former college should come and speak of

00:59:38,990 --> 00:59:42,820
the community weight and horses cattle

00:59:56,670 --> 01:00:07,780
but something like that right because

00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:10,150
other with each other talking over is a

01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:12,010
that's only place for us either play

01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:14,550
music other words like what about

01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:17,140
spreading the number contributor face

01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:19,450
tracking one token of the invention also

01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:20,820
with that that you have to increase can

01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:24,390
be four

01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:25,800
every time even like that happens I but

01:00:24,390 --> 01:00:30,840
mostly the computers go there and they

01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:34,020
have to be there but life would happen

01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:39,660
to us as well right but how do is that

01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:41,880
we vc college professors local clubs in

01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:44,400
the college or release other corporate

01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:46,890
because many people in Corpus right the

01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:48,540
many people are not taken tops maybe

01:00:46,890 --> 01:00:52,770
they like and love the kind of like

01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:56,640
musically open source but what are they

01:00:52,770 --> 01:00:59,280
like how do best political apathy

01:00:56,640 --> 01:01:02,990
stentorian tangent not convince exactly

01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:02,990
like sprint message right yeah

01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:11,820
right for example that we have people

01:01:09,690 --> 01:01:14,310
that we can take seconds you can take

01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:17,460
the clocks and you can eat right now and

01:01:14,310 --> 01:01:20,670
all staff which students love but yeah

01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:25,050
we percent are not that equal person I

01:01:20,670 --> 01:01:27,330
can worthy stuff but let ya setting up

01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:29,610
communication presents from which they

01:01:27,330 --> 01:01:32,370
Cuellar's a Cuban salsa now I can do

01:01:29,610 --> 01:01:34,950
that from the gallon I'm not very the

01:01:32,370 --> 01:01:38,180
best for super bad but he has once the

01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:38,180
things are set up and like

01:01:41,319 --> 01:01:48,640
and your friends can do that in

01:01:44,739 --> 01:01:52,359
practical but yeah we this it starts on

01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:54,549
women because there any other very

01:01:52,359 --> 01:01:58,749
strict and the reason for that number of

01:01:54,549 --> 01:02:01,690
continuous of the derogatory doesn't but

01:01:58,749 --> 01:02:06,759
we want quality has the right so there's

01:02:01,690 --> 01:02:08,559
probably and the way that's communicated

01:02:06,759 --> 01:02:10,630
for people to get involved and then we

01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:12,309
were tame it also see this is what you

01:02:10,630 --> 01:02:13,449
said well combo the people changing

01:02:12,309 --> 01:02:15,339
all the time too so it seems like

01:02:13,449 --> 01:02:17,259
there's also an issue about containing

01:02:15,339 --> 01:02:20,739
our retained mention yeah keeping the

01:02:17,259 --> 01:02:22,569
same contributors to overtime so I guess

01:02:20,739 --> 01:02:24,849
the next step would be really kind of

01:02:22,569 --> 01:02:26,589
identifying like so what happens in the

01:02:24,849 --> 01:02:28,959
life cycle of a contributor like what at

01:02:26,589 --> 01:02:30,670
what point after the event would for the

01:02:28,959 --> 01:02:33,069
retainment side of it at least at what

01:02:30,670 --> 01:02:34,749
point would they become less active and

01:02:33,069 --> 01:02:37,329
was there in a certain event there's our

01:02:34,749 --> 01:02:40,269
certain time period that after so long

01:02:37,329 --> 01:02:41,380
they stopped contributing or they

01:02:40,269 --> 01:02:42,940
stopped being involved with the project

01:02:41,380 --> 01:02:46,539
or they just decrease what they were

01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:50,819
doing and then dropped off I see feel

01:02:46,539 --> 01:02:50,819
when you stop it I mean the work

01:02:55,580 --> 01:03:01,050
yeah I think we need to further go down

01:02:58,470 --> 01:03:06,140
that road but the first step for me was

01:03:01,050 --> 01:03:08,680
be so we figured out like fifty percent

01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:11,859
meeting up

01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:14,619
yeah so for me the first set was would

01:03:11,859 --> 01:03:18,940
be to identify what have they done

01:03:14,619 --> 01:03:25,750
before they if it turns out they're only

01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:27,940
edited the wiki okay yeah i'll give it

01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:32,760
just an example every turn oh they all

01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:36,609
be edited the week what does this pamper

01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:41,260
you should criteria for it if it turns

01:03:36,609 --> 01:03:43,000
out that this they have tried to enter

01:03:41,260 --> 01:03:45,190
this or that group it haven't succeeded

01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:50,020
that obviously we have a problem with

01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:52,359
the ongoing process there so let's try

01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:54,789
to kind of patterns I'm sure how much

01:03:52,359 --> 01:03:58,089
time to spend on the Iranian

01:03:54,789 --> 01:04:00,309
time you have to work that but if we

01:03:58,089 --> 01:04:03,189
figure patterns and also I like the idea

01:04:00,309 --> 01:04:05,769
of the survey somebody came up with the

01:04:03,189 --> 01:04:08,799
idea of survey yeah like we figure we

01:04:05,769 --> 01:04:10,989
realize you're no longer active Vinny

01:04:08,799 --> 01:04:14,769
freestyles and it makes it need to be

01:04:10,989 --> 01:04:16,800
like another survey only better but an

01:04:14,769 --> 01:04:20,010
email

01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:24,100
we would like to take part of the survey

01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:27,910
survey and give us an extra proof and if

01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:30,760
you have any problems that you like to

01:04:27,910 --> 01:04:33,220
discuss with the human here so you get

01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:36,480
for caucuses a conservative should be

01:04:33,220 --> 01:04:36,480
like me

01:04:43,470 --> 01:04:45,530
I

01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:54,150
so back on we start with small small

01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:56,760
events in various qualities on the area

01:04:54,150 --> 01:04:59,730
so that it's not the students consider

01:04:56,760 --> 01:05:01,260
that compliment but don't come so we

01:04:59,730 --> 01:05:03,480
walk into two parts of the country they

01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:05,670
also get inspired to come to my god

01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:07,890
which takes place in the city right so

01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:10,950
that even actually cause more people

01:05:07,890 --> 01:05:13,140
than just the people the corners or even

01:05:10,950 --> 01:05:15,359
is happening so we have got more the

01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:17,520
number so that people are getting a

01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:20,630
degree sorts of uses right people like

01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:23,369
journey d by puzzle movement right so

01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:26,010
maybe we can have that before part

01:05:23,369 --> 01:05:29,069
number and plants a series of us with

01:05:26,010 --> 01:05:31,349
you like one so like maybe some like

01:05:29,069 --> 01:05:33,690
that and people can they take turns and

01:05:31,349 --> 01:05:36,089
go places so they like to learn more

01:05:33,690 --> 01:05:38,190
better awareness and queens it cleared

01:05:36,089 --> 01:05:40,740
up pocket perform and have got bigger

01:05:38,190 --> 01:05:44,550
clear sense of students from different

01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:47,000
parts of the Twin Cities so that we also

01:05:44,550 --> 01:05:50,250
get me search the Google considers from

01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:52,859
because social media conference opponent

01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:54,510
who results already in a place you will

01:05:52,859 --> 01:05:57,180
go over there that we need to research

01:05:54,510 --> 01:05:59,420
the other cities like and say we again

01:05:57,180 --> 01:05:59,420
say

01:06:00,269 --> 01:06:08,890
these are two pieces which are which not

01:06:03,309 --> 01:06:11,470
aware about right right and kinetic

01:06:08,890 --> 01:06:13,480
small mac ravenstein qualities I'm

01:06:11,470 --> 01:06:16,569
appreciative for contacting you can

01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:20,109
produce public and yea ok Danny have a

01:06:16,569 --> 01:06:23,220
smoke cloud the door open in back oh I'm

01:06:20,109 --> 01:06:23,220
sure the number please

01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:52,910
so I think probably come up with a list

01:06:49,970 --> 01:06:55,270
of like action items from all this would

01:06:52,910 --> 01:06:55,270
be helpful

01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:58,240
I

01:07:39,020 --> 01:07:56,220
yeah yeah I think I think I think now

01:07:53,180 --> 01:07:58,020
yeah we're in the last 40 minutes so i

01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:59,430
think i'd like to spend the last 40

01:07:58,020 --> 01:08:01,260
minutes going over something like rating

01:07:59,430 --> 01:08:02,780
some action items out of this as well as

01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:08,240
covering a little bit with elections too

01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:08,240
I mean Diggy's back up again

01:08:14,370 --> 01:08:18,630
so some of the things some of the other

01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:19,980
last little things that we wanted to do

01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:21,390
would be so with all this discussion is

01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:22,920
coming up with action items like for the

01:08:21,390 --> 01:08:24,630
Ambassador discussion and the python

01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:26,130
snake discussion these were things that

01:08:24,630 --> 01:08:28,080
were kind released we're ambassadors we

01:08:26,130 --> 01:08:30,360
had we were aware they wanted to go into

01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:31,860
and pursue so now we kind of have the

01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:34,680
background we hadn't really started i'm

01:08:31,860 --> 01:08:36,020
looking at looking ambassadors yet we

01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:38,640
kind of have this background information

01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:41,030
i think adding to that with some of this

01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:43,890
discussion that we have today for

01:08:41,030 --> 01:08:47,400
creating a proposal or coming up with a

01:08:43,890 --> 01:08:49,800
way of going to tackle that one would be

01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:51,990
most helpful for ambassadors python sig

01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:54,600
putting that one on the agenda will be

01:08:51,990 --> 01:09:01,980
helpful that would be a little bit of

01:08:54,600 --> 01:09:03,420
brainstorming and tickets and that would

01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:04,800
okay so yeah those two i think are

01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:06,870
definitely by the biggest action items

01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:08,220
with condensing the information from the

01:09:06,870 --> 01:09:11,070
ambassador's discussion down into

01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:12,480
something that's like bullet points same

01:09:11,070 --> 01:09:16,290
for python sick i think we have that for

01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:18,240
python sick now and then once like to

01:09:16,290 --> 01:09:22,370
talk about two or we would like to talk

01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:24,510
about is the fourth fedora elections is

01:09:22,370 --> 01:09:27,440
that was one that we helped with in

01:09:24,510 --> 01:09:27,440
december or so

01:09:30,170 --> 01:09:39,690
was I think this was discussed in take

01:09:37,470 --> 01:09:43,859
the motor out right now in federal

01:09:39,690 --> 01:09:46,680
elections is feeling this so we'll do

01:09:43,859 --> 01:09:49,050
whatever I mean better but is it work I

01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:53,210
can and keep on dating given some of it

01:09:49,050 --> 01:09:53,210
in the current the summer cycle bed

01:09:55,880 --> 01:10:20,070
so but we were thinking about having

01:09:58,949 --> 01:10:22,440
some sort of dogs or surveys of us

01:10:20,070 --> 01:10:29,360
entertain reminder is or something it

01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:29,360
said there were seven yeah the next

01:10:33,469 --> 01:10:38,370
another coming up with ways I think also

01:10:36,090 --> 01:10:39,989
with improving greenish interaction

01:10:38,370 --> 01:10:42,750
between the candidates in the community

01:10:39,989 --> 01:10:43,679
so it's not so much as in some cases you

01:10:42,750 --> 01:10:44,969
know some people haven't crowd

01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:46,500
interviews but it's not as much as like

01:10:44,969 --> 01:10:48,300
oh do they have an interview I'm going

01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:49,800
to read it maybe they have follow-up

01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:51,600
questions like what ways could be

01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:52,830
improved how that's communicated and

01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:55,530
running people interact more with

01:10:52,830 --> 01:11:00,300
candidates and make it a more engaging

01:10:55,530 --> 01:11:02,910
election experience well some of the

01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:04,910
things that we did for so the one of the

01:11:02,910 --> 01:11:08,250
election that happened in December was

01:11:04,910 --> 01:11:13,530
the fourth most participated in election

01:11:08,250 --> 01:11:15,179
in all of ya and some of the things that

01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:16,949
we did were like improving communication

01:11:15,179 --> 01:11:19,350
which was one thing that had an impact

01:11:16,949 --> 01:11:21,270
with how often it was communicated using

01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:24,690
a community blog to publish the

01:11:21,270 --> 01:11:27,000
interviews I think I think the one thing

01:11:24,690 --> 01:11:29,460
I kind of picked up on at least in

01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:31,650
December was that the questionnaire for

01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:33,300
my meats on the wiki but I guess it's

01:11:31,650 --> 01:11:34,739
not how long is communicated as well

01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:36,840
that that's like that's a thing that's

01:11:34,739 --> 01:11:38,610
available and there unless you when you

01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:40,949
get the original email about election

01:11:38,610 --> 01:11:42,060
time you dig into it then you go like oh

01:11:40,949 --> 01:11:44,880
and then here's this page whether

01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:46,500
questionnaire I don't think it's going i

01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:48,360
think coming up with more engaging ways

01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:50,730
for people to put out their own thoughts

01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:52,110
for you know what questions they want to

01:11:50,730 --> 01:11:55,320
ask the candidates and what issues are

01:11:52,110 --> 01:11:56,880
at stake even whether it's like putting

01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:59,010
up a list of like things happening

01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:00,080
mentor would be affected by this

01:11:59,010 --> 01:12:01,460
election like so like

01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:03,650
it was a famous go one you can say

01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:05,720
here's like information aliso it's fosco

01:12:03,650 --> 01:12:07,370
and other things happening just some

01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:08,990
added context for that and then someone

01:12:07,370 --> 01:12:11,300
had questions relating to that like oh

01:12:08,990 --> 01:12:12,770
you know what is all this and how would

01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:14,870
this part work or they could submit a

01:12:12,770 --> 01:12:16,400
question it's like the interview

01:12:14,870 --> 01:12:19,490
questions for the past two elections

01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:23,470
were the exact same yeah yeah yeah we

01:12:19,490 --> 01:12:26,060
found find myself do I of course

01:12:23,470 --> 01:12:28,310
questions and then answer my questions

01:12:26,060 --> 01:12:31,070
yeah so I think that's kind of unfair

01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:33,140
right so and I think there's probably

01:12:31,070 --> 01:12:34,790
ways that we could try to better

01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:36,350
communicate the availability or even

01:12:34,790 --> 01:12:37,970
maybe a different method lightens up

01:12:36,350 --> 01:12:40,160
having like a wiki pages and especially

01:12:37,970 --> 01:12:42,350
now that the the wiki is CLA plus one

01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:44,150
with the spammers like that that's

01:12:42,350 --> 01:12:47,540
isolating a lot of people from I could

01:12:44,150 --> 01:12:49,820
trade that yeah getting getting the

01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:51,440
injuries out to people is the most

01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:54,220
important part and I think we have all

01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:57,850
you have already done a great job with

01:12:54,220 --> 01:13:02,170
whoever did it all up in our magazine

01:12:57,850 --> 01:13:05,360
let's prove things quite a lot I think

01:13:02,170 --> 01:13:09,830
one thing we did in the past were the

01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:12,080
town hall meetings yeah RC and that

01:13:09,830 --> 01:13:16,070
didn't really work out or at some point

01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:17,930
this time zones well this well as always

01:13:16,070 --> 01:13:21,230
with meetings you have times of issues

01:13:17,930 --> 01:13:24,310
even if you manage to but we solve that

01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:27,400
problem by having

01:13:24,310 --> 01:13:31,090
different Tom Horne's like at least two

01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:34,990
different pointers so we we are sure

01:13:31,090 --> 01:13:37,960
that everyone has at least one in which

01:13:34,990 --> 01:13:41,500
time zone but otherwise it's hard to

01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:43,210
find good source also the particular

01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:46,350
lecture Wrangler just goes ahead and

01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:49,840
says these are the two possible times

01:13:46,350 --> 01:13:54,270
please draw up if you asked all

01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:58,630
candidates that all be when is good for

01:13:54,270 --> 01:14:02,800
that will end up nowhere right and the

01:13:58,630 --> 01:14:09,430
turnover in terms of participants in the

01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:13,650
meeting was all so much yeah

01:14:09,430 --> 01:14:13,650
we say it's terrifying sighs fine

01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:21,400
so then

01:14:19,780 --> 01:14:23,230
I'm trying to think of some different

01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:27,420
ways that we could try to have people

01:14:23,230 --> 01:14:30,670
collaborate with any questions we could

01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:33,840
not sure if it works only if we have a

01:14:30,670 --> 01:14:38,050
policy and so using social media but

01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:40,060
there are community folks facebook and

01:14:38,050 --> 01:14:43,570
we propose the interviews there or we

01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:48,400
could make virtual questionnaires there

01:14:43,570 --> 01:14:50,570
yeah pole-sitter or facebook page we

01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:55,920
have to put our community

01:14:50,570 --> 01:14:58,320
this but I'm sure if we want to go down

01:14:55,920 --> 01:15:00,330
right the socially and plus it's a

01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:01,260
different audience to for this so I mean

01:15:00,330 --> 01:15:02,670
we do it we definitely have a

01:15:01,260 --> 01:15:05,670
contributor audience or two but it's

01:15:02,670 --> 01:15:08,610
also like the mass hordes of all the

01:15:05,670 --> 01:15:11,940
users too yes I like the idea though

01:15:08,610 --> 01:15:14,040
it's actually likely a deer again brace

01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:24,450
yourself for some people yelling at you

01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:29,580
yes how would we yeah I think we do this

01:15:24,450 --> 01:15:30,750
right definitely but then like my is my

01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:32,700
question that would be like what would

01:15:30,750 --> 01:15:34,110
we be taking to like what would be what

01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:36,180
would be the form of taking the

01:15:34,110 --> 01:15:37,260
questions like WordPress comments and he

01:15:36,180 --> 01:15:39,260
will be like comment with ideas for

01:15:37,260 --> 01:15:43,920
questions and just promote the article

01:15:39,260 --> 01:15:46,440
or sea foam and table rocky look without

01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:49,230
here or even more Facebook or whatever

01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:51,570
it's maybe share the link to the article

01:15:49,230 --> 01:15:57,579
and you can leave ideas for that would

01:15:51,570 --> 01:16:00,249
be one way to take it we probably

01:15:57,579 --> 01:16:04,959
we eat first then people can atilla or

01:16:00,249 --> 01:16:06,339
is it done by we here sending emails

01:16:04,959 --> 01:16:09,039
through the candidates for the

01:16:06,339 --> 01:16:10,869
questionnaires of the interviews for the

01:16:09,039 --> 01:16:12,789
questionnaires of the interviews the

01:16:10,869 --> 01:16:14,800
questionnaires the questionnaire is all

01:16:12,789 --> 01:16:17,079
in the wiki and then you just take those

01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:20,409
questions and answer them in there like

01:16:17,079 --> 01:16:21,490
nobody I think it's me Matt first and

01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:24,130
the random

01:16:21,490 --> 01:16:25,510
because otherwise we're just people were

01:16:24,130 --> 01:16:28,360
just probably what the previous guy

01:16:25,510 --> 01:16:31,260
candidate has said over the past two

01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:33,580
release cycles it's been taking the

01:16:31,260 --> 01:16:35,650
person publishes it we're not publishers

01:16:33,580 --> 01:16:37,840
everything they published the draft on

01:16:35,650 --> 01:16:41,830
the com blog and then an editor reviews

01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:43,240
it and then pushes it out and I feel

01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:49,150
like if somebody were copying blatantly

01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:51,400
like I feel like I'd be okay it was just

01:16:49,150 --> 01:16:54,850
it was over the past two release cycles

01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:57,430
it was mostly I mean it's up to the

01:16:54,850 --> 01:17:00,070
candidates it's up to their to them to

01:16:57,430 --> 01:17:01,030
log into the comlog in de mean it's it's

01:17:00,070 --> 01:17:02,470
the same for me cuz they're still a

01:17:01,030 --> 01:17:04,450
human interaction there they can't just

01:17:02,470 --> 01:17:06,070
log on to the blog it looks like publish

01:17:04,450 --> 01:17:09,490
it you're still like you're just like a

01:17:06,070 --> 01:17:11,020
green light that they go through so I

01:17:09,490 --> 01:17:15,330
guess it's just a different method to

01:17:11,020 --> 01:17:15,330
the same kind of the same way as before

01:17:15,510 --> 01:17:20,260
but I think we could probably aggregate

01:17:18,850 --> 01:17:22,500
like some of the commenting or having an

01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:25,510
aggregated in some place would be useful

01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:26,270
yeah also emotion is here so it holds

01:17:25,510 --> 01:17:27,890
the weekly

01:17:26,270 --> 01:17:30,490
the teams we would leave another

01:17:27,890 --> 01:17:30,490
wordpress

01:17:33,270 --> 01:17:37,070
this collection

01:18:00,309 --> 01:18:03,119
what

01:18:03,769 --> 01:18:06,769
Gary

01:18:09,870 --> 01:18:15,880
we trick would be something we are very

01:18:12,190 --> 01:18:20,680
specific with cycles if necessary

01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:20,680
a year of the food all

01:18:23,770 --> 01:18:30,710
this batch is missing on the list

01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:33,170
well I mean actually all seriousness

01:18:30,710 --> 01:18:35,929
having a badge for mode now is that we

01:18:33,170 --> 01:18:37,100
have I go to that no no and that was an

01:18:35,929 --> 01:18:39,080
interesting thing because i think i

01:18:37,100 --> 01:18:43,179
remember seeing on a list somewhere the

01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:43,179
reason why we don't have one is because

01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:54,830
right if you vote them to be a checkbox

01:18:50,570 --> 01:18:56,570
i am okay with getting a badge and

01:18:54,830 --> 01:19:01,730
private central disclose information

01:18:56,570 --> 01:19:03,199
that i have but the problem is like in

01:19:01,730 --> 01:19:05,960
the voting application that data is not

01:19:03,199 --> 01:19:07,370
even saved I think there's a list of

01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:09,620
well mean there's obviously an account

01:19:07,370 --> 01:19:13,159
with votive right but the information

01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:16,510
like like who you voted for is it safe

01:19:13,159 --> 01:19:20,030
so that's all right that's not enough

01:19:16,510 --> 01:19:23,290
courage I think to do this message that

01:19:20,030 --> 01:19:26,659
says this user voted in this election

01:19:23,290 --> 01:19:29,120
period you don't see who you voted for i

01:19:26,659 --> 01:19:31,790
think the the thing with that too is

01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:34,190
that well then like if someone votes and

01:19:31,790 --> 01:19:36,500
they get the badge I think they were so

01:19:34,190 --> 01:19:38,090
concerned about like I member this is

01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:39,530
the suggestion i read was that after the

01:19:38,090 --> 01:19:41,929
election so at the end of the election

01:19:39,530 --> 01:19:44,000
it's like a hook that's pushed where all

01:19:41,929 --> 01:19:45,320
the people who were voted would it would

01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,530
be triggered and everyone received the

01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:49,730
badge after the election window closes

01:19:47,530 --> 01:19:52,250
I'll try to remember what the with the

01:19:49,730 --> 01:19:54,110
privacy concern was with why like doing

01:19:52,250 --> 01:19:56,430
it at the end versus

01:19:54,110 --> 01:19:59,850
and you could actually see the data

01:19:56,430 --> 01:20:01,500
flows yeah I'm just public this is about

01:19:59,850 --> 01:20:03,540
my maybe didn't properly tools they will

01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:06,420
see them then you can see where the

01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:10,020
first fresco I think that some I like

01:20:06,420 --> 01:20:12,120
those like a lot of stuff anyway so I

01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:14,400
don't think that's a primary concern but

01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:17,970
Felicia if like pitching better software

01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:21,000
works as well right and we have to keep

01:20:17,970 --> 01:20:25,880
the information who voted because

01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:25,880
otherwise both spice so we happily

01:20:27,650 --> 01:20:32,400
actually voted for the dinner but write

01:20:30,870 --> 01:20:36,180
this book is more do you have that we

01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:38,790
have a fedora I voted sticker yeah

01:20:36,180 --> 01:20:42,180
people posted on their blog is so

01:20:38,790 --> 01:20:47,030
facebook page or whatnot so I guess I

01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:49,690
should be okay with getting a batch I'm

01:20:47,030 --> 01:20:52,060
concerned about privacy that I don't

01:20:49,690 --> 01:20:54,130
yeah i'm yeah and i think if it were the

01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:58,060
method like after the election closes

01:20:54,130 --> 01:20:59,440
then i don't i'm even an op s that could

01:20:58,060 --> 01:21:01,150
may fit in with the discussion about

01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:04,420
like we actually you want that you want

01:21:01,150 --> 01:21:05,890
the actually you want the best to serve

01:21:04,420 --> 01:21:09,640
immediately because you want to

01:21:05,890 --> 01:21:13,989
encourage others to vote yeah I fact

01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:17,560
that Mike yes of course if if someone

01:21:13,989 --> 01:21:19,810
sees the intermediate results if the

01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:23,230
intermediate results are public then

01:21:19,810 --> 01:21:26,260
after first reds and golds unity that

01:21:23,230 --> 01:21:30,870
are they are not coming how about we

01:21:26,260 --> 01:21:30,870
make like the earlier you

01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:43,190
seconds ago hello monitor for 60 day

01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:43,190
period is jay's

01:21:57,420 --> 01:22:08,100
yeah that would be cool oh well how much

01:22:05,910 --> 01:22:09,660
percent some day is like I'm the first

01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:11,460
day when elections open inside of the

01:22:09,660 --> 01:22:19,380
students highest and then during the

01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:21,300
week goes back up yeah have some kind of

01:22:19,380 --> 01:22:25,290
graphical representation I can

01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:26,880
kick-start sidebar Kristen only the

01:22:25,290 --> 01:22:30,360
first week the same with Kickstarter

01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:32,670
campaign you don't pay that other

01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:34,710
people's is throw money at you and it

01:22:32,670 --> 01:22:38,580
goes down and down and down and you need

01:22:34,710 --> 01:22:40,590
to prepare your audience entertained

01:22:38,580 --> 01:22:46,140
with constant updates so that's why I

01:22:40,590 --> 01:22:48,090
worry about the email they also some fun

01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:51,840
graphical representation please help us

01:22:48,090 --> 01:22:55,670
can be this far over x % like the next

01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:55,670
goal is x-ray people voted

01:22:58,910 --> 01:23:07,940
and having yet on a very prominent page

01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:12,820
i would say it started for our project

01:23:07,940 --> 01:23:12,820
at work at some connection

01:23:18,710 --> 01:23:23,900
I think we should have more often or

01:23:21,350 --> 01:23:24,920
product or we have I mean it's basically

01:23:23,900 --> 01:23:28,330
nuts an hour

01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:28,330
as we are

01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:35,230
in actually related

01:23:36,710 --> 01:23:39,400
right

01:23:42,380 --> 01:23:50,489
well it was simply a really prominent

01:23:45,030 --> 01:23:51,780
like for the elections i believe i think

01:23:50,489 --> 01:23:53,369
in december like we had like an

01:23:51,780 --> 01:23:55,619
announcement about the elections on the

01:23:53,369 --> 01:23:57,059
magazine but like what we found in the

01:23:55,619 --> 01:23:58,380
magazine is that when we publish like

01:23:57,059 --> 01:24:01,139
candidate interviews and those kind of

01:23:58,380 --> 01:24:03,780
things those are they like those are the

01:24:01,139 --> 01:24:04,979
lowest received articles there's a very

01:24:03,780 --> 01:24:06,269
low number of people reading and

01:24:04,979 --> 01:24:07,979
receiving a man just because it's a

01:24:06,269 --> 01:24:09,599
different kind of audience so with the

01:24:07,979 --> 01:24:11,159
magazine is so largely like kind of like

01:24:09,599 --> 01:24:12,599
i think i give your post on like the

01:24:11,159 --> 01:24:14,460
whole thing on facebook i come vote in

01:24:12,599 --> 01:24:16,079
the election kind of deal is you're

01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:17,280
you're communicating to a small subset

01:24:16,079 --> 01:24:20,969
of contributors but you're also

01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:23,550
appealing to a large amount of just

01:24:20,969 --> 01:24:25,170
general users which depending on how

01:24:23,550 --> 01:24:26,820
it's worded or the context of it like

01:24:25,170 --> 01:24:29,610
the election like the interviews i think

01:24:26,820 --> 01:24:31,619
is it the right finally the magazine was

01:24:29,610 --> 01:24:33,150
the right place for it but encouragingly

01:24:31,619 --> 01:24:35,219
having the resources like here's the

01:24:33,150 --> 01:24:36,690
elections here's what they mean here's

01:24:35,219 --> 01:24:38,639
how you can get involved would be more

01:24:36,690 --> 01:24:40,979
appropriate for like a social media or a

01:24:38,639 --> 01:24:42,570
magazine post and then like i do like

01:24:40,979 --> 01:24:45,210
the idea of using social media for like

01:24:42,570 --> 01:24:48,090
people proposing questions too because i

01:24:45,210 --> 01:24:52,139
actually I really like that idea well

01:24:48,090 --> 01:24:55,249
sometimes it book also i mean i see why

01:24:52,139 --> 01:24:55,249
we are separating

01:24:55,790 --> 01:25:04,340
users and punch people but what we could

01:25:00,510 --> 01:25:04,340
still do is like

01:25:08,550 --> 01:25:15,289
because often it's like

01:25:12,739 --> 01:25:20,110
for example again newspaper and they

01:25:15,289 --> 01:25:27,070
have this other thing for certain target

01:25:20,110 --> 01:25:29,749
user user group like Vicodin irving here

01:25:27,070 --> 01:25:32,690
newspaper that slightly also Google News

01:25:29,749 --> 01:25:35,030
fantastic and then they have a spin-off

01:25:32,690 --> 01:25:37,190
which is more bus speed light or

01:25:35,030 --> 01:25:40,519
something to attract younger readers

01:25:37,190 --> 01:25:43,280
right and they just use their front page

01:25:40,519 --> 01:25:45,980
to also promote their son that's the no

01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:49,519
no and then we will just seventies are

01:25:45,980 --> 01:25:51,619
very short awesome fortunately it

01:25:49,519 --> 01:25:56,210
probably will get that numbers in terms

01:25:51,619 --> 01:25:59,710
of depend on how I suppose just small

01:25:56,210 --> 01:26:02,360
teaser that pushes you over from

01:25:59,710 --> 01:26:04,039
community blog yeah we have something

01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:06,679
that we do on the magazine to or that we

01:26:04,039 --> 01:26:08,119
do do what the magazine is a little

01:26:06,679 --> 01:26:09,829
pointer posts or it's like a very like

01:26:08,119 --> 01:26:11,929
let's say we have a longer thing on the

01:26:09,829 --> 01:26:13,219
com blog will do like a very shortened

01:26:11,929 --> 01:26:15,320
and condemns quick summary on the

01:26:13,219 --> 01:26:19,909
magazine with a link into the dark quick

01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:21,409
point me blog and that's generally been

01:26:19,909 --> 01:26:23,719
received pretty well so than people who

01:26:21,409 --> 01:26:25,340
want to engage with it open it and if

01:26:23,719 --> 01:26:26,300
they just want to get a quick read it

01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:30,019
can get a quick sense of what's

01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:31,940
happening and it's promoting it but I'm

01:26:30,019 --> 01:26:34,610
pretty sure we did do that in december

01:26:31,940 --> 01:26:35,960
for the elections but I I don't think I

01:26:34,610 --> 01:26:38,329
got out I don't I was on top of it for

01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:41,900
june i know we didn't do an effort on

01:26:38,329 --> 01:26:43,659
june and the magazine which is something

01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:46,699
that i think would actually be pretty or

01:26:43,659 --> 01:26:48,230
being consistent about it would be an

01:26:46,699 --> 01:26:50,269
effective thing for encouraging people

01:26:48,230 --> 01:26:52,849
to bring her to at least raise awareness

01:26:50,269 --> 01:26:56,840
about the elections happening for users

01:26:52,849 --> 01:26:57,500
who are interested i think a bad would

01:26:56,840 --> 01:26:59,570
definitely be

01:26:57,500 --> 01:27:02,660
I voted badge would definitely be a

01:26:59,570 --> 01:27:07,160
tremendous impact on voting every

01:27:02,660 --> 01:27:08,630
election and probably one maybe one for

01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:09,860
voting every release cycle because then

01:27:08,630 --> 01:27:12,620
everyone's going to vote like in there

01:27:09,860 --> 01:27:14,570
one election and then they're just not

01:27:12,620 --> 01:27:19,360
going to vote again or they're all about

01:27:14,570 --> 01:27:19,360
guys it's no it's not as a big of a deal

01:27:33,830 --> 01:27:40,060
so oh and going back to the idea about

01:27:36,130 --> 01:27:41,930
sending out a survey after the election

01:27:40,060 --> 01:27:43,580
I'm trying to think about what would be

01:27:41,930 --> 01:27:47,150
the best way of collecting that I know

01:27:43,580 --> 01:27:49,100
the diversity team has like a lion

01:27:47,150 --> 01:27:53,560
survey or something they're using which

01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:53,560
is I know it's a closed tool but um

01:28:07,410 --> 01:28:11,400
and depending on what it is especially

01:28:09,750 --> 01:28:13,470
when it comes to collecting data I'm

01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:15,000
just trying to imagine like it's like I

01:28:13,470 --> 01:28:17,460
know great tools for it but it's like I

01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:19,020
know they're all closed or a prior Terry

01:28:17,460 --> 01:28:22,740
and I don't know what kind i don't think

01:28:19,020 --> 01:28:25,980
that would send that is it it's a touchy

01:28:22,740 --> 01:28:33,060
topic I guess I would just need a little

01:28:25,980 --> 01:28:34,820
bit of extra consideration and that

01:28:33,060 --> 01:28:36,810
would be one to follow up with not to go

01:28:34,820 --> 01:28:39,050
with the diversity team what they're

01:28:36,810 --> 01:28:39,050
doing

01:28:55,290 --> 01:28:57,860
so

01:29:07,070 --> 01:29:16,739
like the neil dog Lupo mometrix so i

01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:19,199
guess like the best example that i can

01:29:16,739 --> 01:29:21,869
think of its community metrics is be

01:29:19,199 --> 01:29:30,270
wrote a report on phaaze dhum 2014-2015

01:29:21,869 --> 01:29:34,079
and we do 2016 yeah different sample

01:29:30,270 --> 01:29:35,489
right so so she collected she looked at

01:29:34,079 --> 01:29:39,090
like the people who scanned the badge of

01:29:35,489 --> 01:29:40,800
austin 420 all three years and so she

01:29:39,090 --> 01:29:41,880
was able to tell that there's the number

01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:44,429
of people who already had the fast

01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:46,079
accounts before cause them and look at

01:29:44,429 --> 01:29:49,699
their activity or contribution levels

01:29:46,079 --> 01:29:56,040
before the event should we pull up the

01:29:49,699 --> 01:29:57,389
yes there is yeah this one and this is I

01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:58,949
think this is the kind of idea behind

01:29:57,389 --> 01:30:00,810
community metrics like the things that

01:29:58,949 --> 01:30:02,610
you all as contributors think would be

01:30:00,810 --> 01:30:04,230
useful especially I don't four

01:30:02,610 --> 01:30:06,210
ambassadors it's definitely the need

01:30:04,230 --> 01:30:07,530
with in terms of like trying to put

01:30:06,210 --> 01:30:09,800
numbers or something it's not a really

01:30:07,530 --> 01:30:12,810
number thing but it definitely can go

01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:14,460
far beyond just since we've already

01:30:12,810 --> 01:30:15,690
focused so much I'm ambassadors I mean

01:30:14,460 --> 01:30:20,960
there's definitely other places it could

01:30:15,690 --> 01:30:20,960
be applied towards yeah feel free

01:30:26,090 --> 01:30:48,690
activity and each patient's yeah so in

01:30:45,599 --> 01:30:52,050
poznan 2016 they were giving further a

01:30:48,690 --> 01:30:57,239
t-shirt so everybody could get their bag

01:30:52,050 --> 01:31:01,289
and I think he initiates the measurement

01:30:57,239 --> 01:31:04,829
analysis the registration is classic on

01:31:01,289 --> 01:31:08,519
this persistence paid and I liable so

01:31:04,829 --> 01:31:12,749
people were starting with the gala like

01:31:08,519 --> 01:31:15,809
50 I had the same comment like the brick

01:31:12,749 --> 01:31:18,360
at RIT here like this pause with the fam

01:31:15,809 --> 01:31:20,159
I think fast I really followed it by

01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:27,119
know fast is about to get a huge be

01:31:20,159 --> 01:31:28,800
right and fast three was coming when is

01:31:27,119 --> 01:31:31,889
that seven joy is coming and we do

01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:33,300
claims yeah and i think i would at least

01:31:31,889 --> 01:31:35,699
charge the application of this i think

01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:37,079
faster he'd be huge help because i had

01:31:35,699 --> 01:31:40,289
the same problem who are signing up for

01:31:37,079 --> 01:31:43,110
a fafsa column there like what is this

01:31:40,289 --> 01:31:46,260
like this is either just not intuitive

01:31:43,110 --> 01:31:48,269
or i think i'm not sure well no it was

01:31:46,260 --> 01:31:54,829
like that's well i had people like

01:31:48,269 --> 01:31:54,829
student I got you so yeah you're lucky

01:31:55,050 --> 01:32:01,270
in the early days of passage in the

01:31:58,869 --> 01:32:04,510
early days we needed to download the

01:32:01,270 --> 01:32:08,469
file the contributor license agreement

01:32:04,510 --> 01:32:10,239
sign it with the gpg key okay and I mean

01:32:08,469 --> 01:32:12,280
at that point basically already to

01:32:10,239 --> 01:32:16,239
exclude every person that doesn't have a

01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:18,730
deep into the engineer yeah so I mean

01:32:16,239 --> 01:32:22,000
these are some kind of matrix then I

01:32:18,730 --> 01:32:24,099
also compiled some matrix for comics

01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:25,659
like how we have been growing what sort

01:32:24,099 --> 01:32:32,369
of work we have been doing it was for

01:32:25,659 --> 01:32:32,369
the year into beautiful so then

01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:39,730
come on specific

01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:47,510
your first year it was

01:32:48,909 --> 01:32:51,539
here

01:32:53,910 --> 01:32:57,170
be pretty out here

01:32:58,520 --> 01:33:01,670
Alan Joyce

01:33:05,909 --> 01:33:09,679
who's this one or

01:33:16,360 --> 01:33:21,400
anyone to see ever since giving examples

01:33:18,940 --> 01:33:23,590
of matrix edible aquatic suggestions

01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:25,030
from you on what kind of metrics I

01:33:23,590 --> 01:33:27,190
should work on something you would

01:33:25,030 --> 01:33:33,040
really like to see so I think what it

01:33:27,190 --> 01:33:36,310
means absolutely idea no you would first

01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:46,270
say I we had a senora de story three

01:33:36,310 --> 01:33:50,920
priors badges for karma and I just not

01:33:46,270 --> 01:33:53,410
be able to get people like a bad foot

01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:55,270
and then the party release party there

01:33:53,410 --> 01:33:59,140
is already budget for organizing one

01:33:55,270 --> 01:34:02,080
less of a car oh yeah you can also have

01:33:59,140 --> 01:34:05,500
a badge I attended a party for that

01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:07,870
horrible range and an ingrown toe you

01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:09,760
know really want a different veggies for

01:34:07,870 --> 01:34:11,260
different occasions because then you

01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:13,960
have like hundreds and hundreds of

01:34:11,260 --> 01:34:18,700
babies to Prince parties but then you

01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:20,340
can i create the pure code and check how

01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:22,620
many

01:34:20,340 --> 01:34:25,230
we have a badge and after you give them

01:34:22,620 --> 01:34:29,520
as we will check click and you go get a

01:34:25,230 --> 01:34:31,000
username actually crave badge and give

01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:33,220
us information about

01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:36,670
people were coming to release parties

01:34:33,220 --> 01:34:38,590
are universal imagine Spain how many

01:34:36,670 --> 01:34:40,480
they created their personal stress

01:34:38,590 --> 01:34:44,380
because of death or they already have it

01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:46,900
and if they come you know if there is a

01:34:44,380 --> 01:34:49,439
next release party for next release it

01:34:46,900 --> 01:34:52,299
was the same for different people

01:34:49,439 --> 01:34:56,429
what can we do it what do you see it

01:34:52,299 --> 01:35:02,889
data record when somebody takes that I

01:34:56,429 --> 01:35:06,729
mean like the idea came from process

01:35:02,889 --> 01:35:09,789
today the past usual classical let's

01:35:06,729 --> 01:35:12,999
count leave a link to the badge yeah

01:35:09,789 --> 01:35:16,929
profile day yeah thanks already time

01:35:12,999 --> 01:35:20,469
today time to tell you something it's

01:35:16,929 --> 01:35:22,659
matter it's taking pumpkins okay well

01:35:20,469 --> 01:35:24,879
well within the time step should be able

01:35:22,659 --> 01:35:29,379
to tell them something about number of

01:35:24,879 --> 01:35:32,649
defense unless you have to commit I must

01:35:29,379 --> 01:35:36,119
get fluids barneys as a time yes but i

01:35:32,649 --> 01:35:40,469
would expect a careful release party

01:35:36,119 --> 01:35:43,359
well it should be it repeats when we

01:35:40,469 --> 01:35:44,790
when never saved the bachelor that is

01:35:43,359 --> 01:35:48,320
probably what

01:35:44,790 --> 01:35:51,660
then yeah he would do a nice graphic

01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:52,429
perspective peaks and put City same sort

01:35:51,660 --> 01:35:54,899
of

01:35:52,429 --> 01:35:57,899
and you can see that for example

01:35:54,899 --> 01:36:04,130
infernal everybody from the release

01:35:57,899 --> 01:36:04,130
parties from russia moscow so they like

01:36:10,930 --> 01:36:21,640
but generally but to see statistics

01:36:15,300 --> 01:36:24,760
based on geography by my life because

01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:28,440
like a day and it was account but can

01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:28,440
you can pass accounts

01:36:31,229 --> 01:36:38,110
there's a syndicate repair guide for

01:36:34,749 --> 01:36:54,190
shopping you can like when you deposit

01:36:38,110 --> 01:37:08,769
come you can specify this way yesterday

01:36:54,190 --> 01:37:13,150
so so that i'm working on this case and

01:37:08,769 --> 01:37:16,989
sort of the group global map and the

01:37:13,150 --> 01:37:21,219
number of you this punishment there

01:37:16,989 --> 01:37:23,619
actually is a map yeah me see if i can

01:37:21,219 --> 01:37:27,909
find it it's it's old it's really such

01:37:23,619 --> 01:37:29,949
an old well i'm trying to earth it's an

01:37:27,909 --> 01:37:32,050
infrastructure i think yeah well there's

01:37:29,949 --> 01:37:35,499
one of the week if you sir no it's like

01:37:32,050 --> 01:37:41,840
an act like it's at the world map

01:37:35,499 --> 01:37:48,739
there's like a whirling mass generation

01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:52,369
the fast here it is now I don't know

01:37:48,739 --> 01:37:54,949
this is based on yes that's very so fast

01:37:52,369 --> 01:37:57,170
but that's only a muscle only

01:37:54,949 --> 01:37:59,719
ambassadors i think it's i don't know if

01:37:57,170 --> 01:38:03,280
it's pouring from that like a sign you

01:37:59,719 --> 01:38:07,150
can insert your your gps coordinates no

01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:09,679
country well for those in those cities

01:38:07,150 --> 01:38:16,040
if i don't get to be honest with these

01:38:09,679 --> 01:38:17,420
oh yeah we need optic is our well i was

01:38:16,040 --> 01:38:18,830
thinking about this so like if you're

01:38:17,420 --> 01:38:21,650
getting here if you're like signing up

01:38:18,830 --> 01:38:23,480
for a fast account gps coordinates what

01:38:21,650 --> 01:38:24,739
if i'm wondering if like fast three

01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:26,869
would be a better idea to have something

01:38:24,739 --> 01:38:29,690
where they can specify their city of

01:38:26,869 --> 01:38:31,250
their from country out right and then

01:38:29,690 --> 01:38:32,929
you could obviously protect that they

01:38:31,250 --> 01:38:36,469
the privacy flag on for their account

01:38:32,929 --> 01:38:39,230
that won't be shared but that might be a

01:38:36,469 --> 01:38:41,690
powerful way to encourage people to put

01:38:39,230 --> 01:38:42,920
that information there I don't know why

01:38:41,690 --> 01:38:44,360
it's not rendering it might just be the

01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:48,440
network here because it was rendering

01:38:44,360 --> 01:38:52,330
for me before movies okay it might just

01:38:48,440 --> 01:38:54,580
be something on my laptop just funny

01:38:52,330 --> 01:38:56,830
I don't think so i guess just

01:38:54,580 --> 01:38:59,200
ambassadors if you go once i prefer the

01:38:56,830 --> 01:39:02,170
opportunity in vesicles it says choose

01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:04,450
the page and yeah we could choose how

01:39:02,170 --> 01:39:08,380
the ambassador's so obviously we want to

01:39:04,450 --> 01:39:10,330
farmers as well nobody ever did right

01:39:08,380 --> 01:39:11,440
i'm not sure where it's query and i'm

01:39:10,330 --> 01:39:14,080
still talking about words getting this

01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:15,730
information from yes but like I mean

01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:20,140
definitely fast but i guess it like is

01:39:15,730 --> 01:39:25,320
it GPS coordinates I decide yeah has to

01:39:20,140 --> 01:39:27,850
be I guess yeah the fields for it yeah

01:39:25,320 --> 01:39:30,040
hmm so may making that something a

01:39:27,850 --> 01:39:32,410
little more accessible for like putting

01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:34,660
that would be certain to follow up with

01:39:32,410 --> 01:39:37,000
in fast three would be to make sure

01:39:34,660 --> 01:39:38,710
there's like a the GPS coordinates thing

01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:42,100
or field is replaced with something a

01:39:38,710 --> 01:39:43,600
little more easily able to move yeah

01:39:42,100 --> 01:39:48,720
even like it interacted like it on the

01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:52,150
map or like Maps is kind of thing um

01:39:48,720 --> 01:39:54,340
that would be that would actually be

01:39:52,150 --> 01:39:56,620
really interesting and then so like

01:39:54,340 --> 01:39:57,910
where were you thinking Judy where were

01:39:56,620 --> 01:39:59,740
you thinking like so with this like if

01:39:57,910 --> 01:40:02,380
you had like and I like something like a

01:39:59,740 --> 01:40:04,450
map of like the global contributors of

01:40:02,380 --> 01:40:07,200
fedora what kind of data would you want

01:40:04,450 --> 01:40:07,200
to generate with that

01:40:11,010 --> 01:40:19,790
I met you always shows these like how

01:40:17,190 --> 01:40:23,520
many cool things that we have

01:40:19,790 --> 01:40:30,240
and for example foot

01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:34,050
teachers by enlisting to conduct into a

01:40:30,240 --> 01:40:43,950
countless or agency yeah I'm a twenty

01:40:34,050 --> 01:40:47,910
well maybe we can yes I'm any part where

01:40:43,950 --> 01:40:50,100
you can easily you know identified as

01:40:47,910 --> 01:40:52,860
someone is active and you can tell this

01:40:50,100 --> 01:40:55,590
those stadiums like by teachers like

01:40:52,860 --> 01:40:59,320
that styles and water for people who

01:40:55,590 --> 01:41:05,890
added quickly so you can easily

01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:07,760
completely sparkline bachelors like it's

01:41:05,890 --> 01:41:12,660
difficult to

01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:16,260
get a Gators requirement every time you

01:41:12,660 --> 01:41:24,480
are doing something ambassador II you

01:41:16,260 --> 01:41:26,670
will just stop it that message so one

01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:28,770
thing you can do is filter by fast room

01:41:26,670 --> 01:41:30,450
without locations and you can see like

01:41:28,770 --> 01:41:33,360
so like for this group it's like bode

01:41:30,450 --> 01:41:35,160
contributors you can see where they fit

01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:42,300
in or the number of contributors to eat

01:41:35,160 --> 01:41:45,120
fast food I I think it'd be answering to

01:41:42,300 --> 01:41:46,980
look at like globalization especially to

01:41:45,120 --> 01:41:51,600
see like communities that are active

01:41:46,980 --> 01:41:59,790
with translations of weather oh yeah

01:41:51,600 --> 01:42:05,460
yeah yeahs be there a little bit thank

01:41:59,790 --> 01:42:07,390
you mean just from a circle and boss

01:42:05,460 --> 01:42:10,490
boss everybody

01:42:07,390 --> 01:42:17,120
hey one more and I get my my rainbow

01:42:10,490 --> 01:42:23,360
cookie badge yeah yeah Patrick will

01:42:17,120 --> 01:42:27,350
probably get there first off so you have

01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:34,250
our partners i guess i hastily works

01:42:27,350 --> 01:42:37,040
climbing front like yeah yeah like I

01:42:34,250 --> 01:42:38,750
know it's like oh I'm on like I i can

01:42:37,040 --> 01:42:41,750
find my my study on there so i think

01:42:38,750 --> 01:42:43,730
it's still maintained or at least it

01:42:41,750 --> 01:42:46,340
functions but whether or not people are

01:42:43,730 --> 01:42:50,450
updating that or updated their GPS

01:42:46,340 --> 01:42:52,940
coordinates or I mean I got I've had the

01:42:50,450 --> 01:42:57,590
GPS coordinates and fighting on for

01:42:52,940 --> 01:43:00,860
years really they monitor in public

01:42:57,590 --> 01:43:02,900
there's only one on Posada the guy who

01:43:00,860 --> 01:43:08,180
was before me so it's like every six

01:43:02,900 --> 01:43:14,620
years oh yeah only this really old about

01:43:08,180 --> 01:43:14,620
each other kiowa far beyond

01:43:23,239 --> 01:43:27,079
I gotta be a cool one to do like if you

01:43:25,340 --> 01:43:28,579
look at translations and like if you

01:43:27,079 --> 01:43:31,400
have an active pocket that's like a

01:43:28,579 --> 01:43:33,289
really small consistent but it's making

01:43:31,400 --> 01:43:34,639
very small progress it'll look at that

01:43:33,289 --> 01:43:38,300
be like oh here's a community that's

01:43:34,639 --> 01:43:39,949
translating to Norwegian or you know

01:43:38,300 --> 01:43:41,030
whatever and if they visited there's a

01:43:39,949 --> 01:43:42,469
few people there that something you

01:43:41,030 --> 01:43:43,699
could know like there's a community here

01:43:42,469 --> 01:43:46,519
there's something happening here that

01:43:43,699 --> 01:43:48,670
could become a larger larger effort and

01:43:46,519 --> 01:43:51,079
it kind of would be something to direct

01:43:48,670 --> 01:43:54,949
attention to I guess I don't know that

01:43:51,079 --> 01:44:08,619
make sense I guess we probably are close

01:43:54,949 --> 01:44:14,239
to packing up their nails isolated

01:44:08,619 --> 01:44:16,889
speaking of matrix what matrix and they

01:44:14,239 --> 01:44:21,499
step quite a lot of things I like

01:44:16,889 --> 01:44:24,449
see I'm not sure if we already have them

01:44:21,499 --> 01:44:30,780
has any of your part of the chat here

01:44:24,449 --> 01:44:34,380
the company from pain or popular they're

01:44:30,780 --> 01:44:38,849
doing open source matrix they have all

01:44:34,380 --> 01:44:43,110
range of tools which are oh my god it's

01:44:38,849 --> 01:44:45,119
yeah yeah yeah I think they they once

01:44:43,110 --> 01:44:51,300
told me that they had spoken to bring me

01:44:45,119 --> 01:45:01,340
at least and very little broad or a hard

01:44:51,300 --> 01:45:11,140
rock matrix hopefully like my job

01:45:01,340 --> 01:45:14,000
I don't let doc does it thanks I think

01:45:11,140 --> 01:45:16,370
you have a dashboard where you have nice

01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:22,820
over like graphical representation of

01:45:16,370 --> 01:45:25,910
all day so pretend okay I'm like a lot

01:45:22,820 --> 01:45:29,630
of the architecture can input all kinds

01:45:25,910 --> 01:45:34,180
of crackers but don't think that they

01:45:29,630 --> 01:45:37,310
have ever integration or existing that

01:45:34,180 --> 01:45:39,260
would enable us to combine all these

01:45:37,310 --> 01:45:45,230
different sources like they already have

01:45:39,260 --> 01:45:47,390
breakfast forum let me just start saving

01:45:45,230 --> 01:45:53,240
money for camp walking around in any

01:45:47,390 --> 01:45:55,940
brand new magazine a customer yeah I

01:45:53,240 --> 01:45:58,430
mean at this point Gummer himself I got

01:45:55,940 --> 01:45:59,810
the same thing it's like always well I

01:45:58,430 --> 01:46:01,160
think in the beginning right in the

01:45:59,810 --> 01:46:04,610
beginning away from your leave like it

01:46:01,160 --> 01:46:06,830
is now like a house it's not like it

01:46:04,610 --> 01:46:08,840
overpowers marketing I got time you pull

01:46:06,830 --> 01:46:15,850
the magneri the marketing list she had

01:46:08,840 --> 01:46:15,850
Yeah right there is hope you saw

01:46:25,550 --> 01:46:32,579
that's different problems I might want

01:46:28,919 --> 01:46:36,479
to sit down over here sexy even a

01:46:32,579 --> 01:46:38,280
sulfate you only yeah vs 9 source they

01:46:36,479 --> 01:46:40,079
that's a nice yeah I think in the

01:46:38,280 --> 01:46:42,649
beginning they are letters or through

01:46:40,079 --> 01:46:42,649
the magazine

01:46:55,719 --> 01:47:16,599
I mean I was something I mean I'm never

01:47:15,070 --> 01:47:19,119
saying thank you type in the magazine

01:47:16,599 --> 01:47:20,889
does our time there for this guy and

01:47:19,119 --> 01:47:27,820
while it wasn't probably the case in the

01:47:20,889 --> 01:47:30,159
beginning so calm yes this is Frank

01:47:27,820 --> 01:47:34,329
what's changed since things started so I

01:47:30,159 --> 01:47:36,369
think I'm having single it's like is it

01:47:34,329 --> 01:47:38,499
I mean that it exists already there is a

01:47:36,369 --> 01:47:41,349
magazine list there is a magazine faster

01:47:38,499 --> 01:47:43,329
if it's it's all there in place so as we

01:47:41,349 --> 01:47:45,280
matter of pointing up dating a few

01:47:43,329 --> 01:47:46,929
starter or point our door bolted trying

01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:49,809
to migrate people from point A to point

01:47:46,929 --> 01:47:53,650
B and it's still be a pain i think but

01:47:49,809 --> 01:47:55,420
it's i think in the long run i I feel

01:47:53,650 --> 01:48:00,360
like marketing is all about there are

01:47:55,420 --> 01:48:00,360
more users

01:48:03,610 --> 01:48:11,139
yeah I'm kind of in the same boat there

01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:21,230
yes no no before really is using the

01:48:18,619 --> 01:48:23,900
vent the brewery you do have to have a

01:48:21,230 --> 01:48:27,429
match for it so make sure you have as

01:48:23,900 --> 01:48:27,429
