In the past two years, the Fedora Magazine has become a great success story. With hundreds of thousands of page views per month on an upward trend, we are reaching more Fedora users than ever. How is it created? What kind of ideas and articles are best? How can you get involved? This talk will answer these questions, but more importantly, it will discuss wider questions of how the success of the Magazine should affect our strategy for documentation, searchability, and per-initiative focus.
