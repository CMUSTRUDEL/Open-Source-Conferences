okay so this would be a rough interview

00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:13,590
and introduction on what happened in the

00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:16,650
last year and a little bit more even in

00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:18,090
the past in the Italian community now it

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,350
will be a brief introduction about

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:24,840
myself just to give a brief idea of it

00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:28,380
the state of the community Italian

00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:33,140
fedora community one year ago and my

00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:36,930
initial goals for for the last year and

00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:41,129
what problems we have encountered and

00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:43,920
what is currently the state of the

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:46,950
Italian community and obviously my plans

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,840
for at least the next year now first of

00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,960
all I would like to point out that the

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:55,289
fedora online the heat that we will

00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,420
mention sometimes it's actually the

00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:00,899
Italian fedora community official the

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:04,619
donor community so you know I sometimes

00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:07,740
use the online name but it's just the

00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:10,590
same thing so brief introduction of

00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:14,760
myself I'm a fedora user on and off

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:16,740
since fedora 11 and I have been a

00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,650
consistent to do a user since video

00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:23,610
ranking and I'm now ambassador packager

00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:26,490
and I also and profit other communities

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:29,700
but not very active at least not as

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:32,120
active as I would like it to be now i'm

00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:35,480
going to on my administrator fedora

00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:40,160
over thousands know what happened in

00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:42,920
August 2015 what happened was that

00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:46,160
actually we had a very old

00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:50,510
infrastructure the the cold part of it

00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:53,920
was ratty old and we were on a show

00:01:50,510 --> 00:02:00,410
hosting so kind of performance issues we

00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:03,620
faced and the many user many very active

00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:08,149
user of the door online actually have

00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:10,429
lacked recently and even more in august

00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:14,540
two thousand fifteen all administrators

00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:19,970
sat down there was like this kind of you

00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:23,360
know change of general generational

00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:28,190
change and that happen about one year

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:30,200
ago so in the general federal community

00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:32,870
there are a huge amount of italians

00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:37,370
participating in it and this is great

00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:40,280
but the big part of it is that the

00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:43,310
majority of those people actually do not

00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:47,090
identify himself in you know Italian

00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:50,300
speaking groups so we actually have like

00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:52,520
four people in G Lebanon that have

00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:56,390
contributed in the last two or three

00:02:52,520 --> 00:03:02,090
release cycles so pretty much no one I

00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:06,530
would say and also since in the fedora

00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:08,720
14 to fade or 18 kind of ciples there

00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:11,180
were a huge amount of translators we

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,520
have a huge amount of pages and you know

00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,020
of strings translated but the problem is

00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,290
that

00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:19,930
have not been updated since that it so

00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:23,500
we have a lot of stuff that is sealed in

00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:27,490
opa door 11 throughout 12 guides that

00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:30,370
have not been updated after that so we

00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:33,010
have a huge amount of governments that

00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:35,110
should be updated because has been

00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:37,060
translated in the first time and the

00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:38,980
first place but we don't have any more

00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:43,480
the people to actually keep those

00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:47,380
content translated so what were my girls

00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:49,180
one year ago info in the dome online

00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:52,480
that is the italian khadora official

00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:56,080
federal community update over the pieces

00:03:52,480 --> 00:04:00,040
because we had very very old stuff so it

00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:02,680
was not very safe to keep that way to

00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,480
move to a private / part and I be at

00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:08,170
fault circle because we had performance

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:11,380
issue as we seen before and to keep at

00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:13,750
least the same number of user and posts

00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:16,090
because you know you don't want to lose

00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:19,690
even more people then you have already

00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:22,150
lost in the previous years and to create

00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:25,240
in you administrative team because the

00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:31,480
previous one has just stepped down so we

00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:34,360
need that one and also I wanted to to

00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:37,630
have the inactive stuff people to decade

00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:40,630
because we actually had some stuff

00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:43,210
people still around but actually have

00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:49,300
not been active for like four or five

00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:51,250
cycles so the that means the inactive

00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:55,480
are means i think it's like not having

00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:56,820
admins so i think we should have had to

00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:00,550
wait to be in LA

00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:02,380
admin a decade after you know couple of

00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:07,270
cycles that they don't perform any

00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:11,200
administrative actions so in the general

00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:14,410
fedora community my personal goals were

00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:16,960
first of all create a list of Italian

00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:20,800
users in the US to know that they are

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:24,520
there so the the manor idea here was

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,860
that if you have a list of Italian users

00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:29,230
and by talents I mean people in Italy

00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:31,630
actually living in Italy when you do

00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:34,960
some kind of event you can actually bite

00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:37,210
those people to come out to come in i

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,210
would say person in the sense that you

00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:43,030
send them an email or a message or color

00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:46,000
instead of the more general i write a

00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:50,430
page on on the wiki and probably no one

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:54,640
will write about it and also i am

00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:56,620
advocating i was planning to advocate

00:05:54,640 --> 00:06:00,400
more family but at a straight a bit on

00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:02,560
the simpler and more consistent g11 and

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,200
tools that is translation and

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:10,050
localization tools because the current

00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:14,200
state is not the best one and say and

00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:16,510
also to reduce the number of pages that

00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:19,210
have been localized in the previous

00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:21,520
cycles but are not updated anymore

00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:24,490
because we don't have enough people now

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,340
this is necessary because you know you

00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:29,830
don't want to have very old information

00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:32,020
out there and maybe people thinking that

00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:35,910
are updated while they are not

00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:39,389
you know it would not be nice so

00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:43,750
obviously as usual things are not

00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:46,569
straight so you have a plan but the

00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:51,009
reality it's a little bit different that

00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:54,280
would say so in fedora line the first

00:06:51,009 --> 00:07:00,490
problem was that all the software we had

00:06:54,280 --> 00:07:03,970
we had firm SI website a wiki a planet

00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:07,990
mainly so four pieces of software that

00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:12,000
actually were very hookah together so we

00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:15,970
had a huge amount of custom code and

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,180
both for cooking those pieces are

00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:22,210
because I we don't have a federated user

00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:25,210
but we have the same user across all the

00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:27,039
platforms and how it was implemented was

00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:30,490
implementing in each one of those

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:33,190
software a piece of code to actually be

00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:34,810
able to share the password together but

00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:38,469
the problem is that this piece of code

00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:42,580
is not a model or plugin but it's it was

00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:45,699
just a patch on the core of the product

00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:51,159
so makes update pretty much impossible

00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:54,159
to do and even more the real problem is

00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:58,870
that the form that is actually the the

00:07:54,159 --> 00:08:02,139
base the database base of the whole

00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:07,060
thing is mainly written in PHP fuller

00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:10,139
and it has some kind of Hoops to work on

00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:14,080
PHP file PHP for has been deprecated

00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:14,990
three or four years ago now so it's very

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,020
very old

00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:19,910
kind of code and infrastructure and even

00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:23,750
more the real problem is that the

00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:25,910
upstream of the pole is that so we don't

00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:28,700
have any more updates we have some

00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:31,280
patches like security patches some of

00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:35,000
them has been developed inside some of

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:38,690
them outside the paternal line but still

00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:42,550
they are not really upgrades we have a

00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:46,340
huge amount of parts and for instance

00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:52,460
also the planet is that option that too

00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:54,380
that did not help and the so another

00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:57,200
problem we are now having with the phone

00:08:54,380 --> 00:09:00,890
is that a little speech before and PHP

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:04,310
fiber cooking stuff actually broke the

00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:08,660
email so we don't have the image sent to

00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:11,900
the users when you know at trial for

00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:16,280
metroid is updated so we are kind of

00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:17,890
also losing you know traction and that

00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:22,040
kind of stopped because engagement

00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:24,590
because people do not know when they are

00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:28,520
not need ified when there are new new

00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:31,600
stuff yes I thought I was like this is

00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,600
it specific reference

00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:38,709
yes because that's what Walker yeah I

00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:42,279
want to like a powerful government yeah

00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:44,140
this is about the Italian on but I has

00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:45,850
put in a lot with other local

00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:49,839
communities and they have the same

00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:54,730
problems so you know because in the end

00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:57,430
the the khador approach core product has

00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:59,320
a very strong infrastructure team and

00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:02,230
development team so thats easier there

00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:07,540
but all the local communities are

00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:11,010
usually very small as province said

00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:13,420
before intervening the mat and

00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:15,250
question-and-answer pack and he said

00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:18,430
that there were just 50 people

00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:21,459
translating padulla 24 so it's like in

00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:25,709
other languages total of fifty people so

00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:29,040
it's kind of a journal of planning and

00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:32,620
also updating mediawiki it's a nightmare

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,930
if you have a custom thing in fact i was

00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:36,640
being with Patrick because you know in

00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:39,060
the federal project we also have many

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:42,040
weekend I asked him how do you upgrade

00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:44,050
with a custom team and he said we don't

00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:47,200
have a custom team because we don't want

00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:50,589
to deal with custom team operating so

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,500
yeah probably not very wise to have a

00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:55,870
custom theme if you want to upgrade and

00:10:52,500 --> 00:11:00,700
also very big problem out there come is

00:10:55,870 --> 00:11:03,339
limited you know and I am not paid to do

00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:05,980
work on this so I have to do it in my

00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:09,339
spare time so obviously it's val very

00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:14,620
negative also in the general fedora

00:11:09,339 --> 00:11:17,860
community obviously Italian side we were

00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:19,490
speaking before about you know removing

00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,960
over

00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:24,660
translated stuff that is not anymore

00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:27,270
updating but it's in removing content

00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:29,700
and when you remove content you usually

00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:32,850
end up with a huge flame in the

00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:37,110
maintenance so this is what happened

00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:39,450
actually and we serve this like two days

00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:42,510
ago actually in the meeting on Friday

00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:43,980
and you know after six months

00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:49,710
probability that we are talking about

00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:51,960
this it's not so bad also g11 n seems to

00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:55,260
be a second-class citizen because you

00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:57,570
know packaging it's a big thing and also

00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:01,020
other groups like ambassadors are very

00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:03,930
very active jalanan aids you know and

00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:06,570
it'll be second-class citizen or at

00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:10,350
least that's how it feels maybe it's not

00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:16,580
but it's if it's that way and also again

00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:20,850
Tommy's million so the current state its

00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:23,940
first of all we are on a private machine

00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:26,490
with saline looks enabled so all the

00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:28,590
security concerns are limited at least

00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:31,020
down we don't still have all your

00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:34,740
software updated but at least now if

00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:37,470
someone has our planet it's only our

00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:39,780
planet that has security problems not

00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:44,250
the rest of the website that is not good

00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:47,070
but at this is better and mediawiki has

00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:51,000
been updated we managed to do it also

00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:54,220
with the custom team that was a user and

00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,460
that one of our use

00:12:54,220 --> 00:13:01,840
the community actually effort a lot of

00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:04,210
time to update the team and also we are

00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:06,580
ready to move from the planet that is

00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:09,310
the one that upstream to the Venice

00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:11,950
planet which is also the lab stream but

00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:15,820
it's okay because it's a static site

00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:18,370
generator so even if you know it's maybe

00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:21,160
not perfect we still do not have any

00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:25,330
security problem while the Bible planet

00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:29,890
is a dynamic website we have not yet

00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:32,320
been targeted by any serious attack this

00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:35,020
is good probably we are not good big

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,450
enough you know the night padova our

00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:40,660
project has been a major target of spam

00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:43,240
because the opportunity speak but we are

00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:47,260
not that big so that's great in this

00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:50,800
sense at least also they the problem

00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:53,170
email now is completely broken it over

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,210
the over the months every time it was

00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:58,270
like a little bit worse now it's

00:13:55,210 --> 00:14:01,150
completely broken so I'm going to work

00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:05,800
on this as soon as the the planet part

00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:08,980
is ended but it will be probably the

00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:11,290
only way will be to move to a different

00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:13,570
platform because the current one is dead

00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:18,100
upstream so you know you don't get any

00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:22,020
update and the the form equation pool

00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:25,720
it's actually under QA and testing it I

00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:29,080
have to some kind of script from the web

00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:31,990
and make it work for us it's not yet

00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:35,080
perfect we see the main problem we have

00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:38,350
is that we have a few users that in the

00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:41,260
migration lose their name that is kind

00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:44,410
of a problem you know but out of that it

00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:46,980
seems to be very good so we probably

00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:49,980
would be able to move and if

00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:53,670
the end of august or sep tember maximum

00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:56,699
and also we have a couple of new

00:14:53,670 --> 00:15:01,440
moderators which is good because you

00:14:56,699 --> 00:15:06,779
know starting from zero or 13 that i was

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:10,470
new at that point was yeah and also a

00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:12,899
lot of parts of our infrastructure use

00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:15,449
ansible which is also the standard for

00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:17,639
the Fedora project infrastructure we are

00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:20,910
trying to like copy the code or a

00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:23,610
project infrastructure team because I

00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:27,120
mean if it works for them it works cross

00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:28,949
and also it makes easier for someone you

00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,300
know in one group to help in the other

00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:37,949
one and help each other the two groups

00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:42,360
so in this is a graph of the post the

00:15:37,949 --> 00:15:44,639
post is probably our main metrics we can

00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:47,220
gather because it's easier to gather

00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:50,579
this is student by oles we SAT there

00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:53,699
actually to fedora play so it's we have

00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:57,930
a huge amount of history and as you can

00:15:53,699 --> 00:16:02,040
see we have had some releases like from

00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:04,769
10 I would save to 18 mainly which we

00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:07,470
had a huge amount of activity and then a

00:16:04,769 --> 00:16:09,930
downward trend now I would say the very

00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:13,410
good part is that this is Fedora 23 is

00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:16,620
the first up pick from you know this

00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:21,660
general trend so I think we are doing

00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:24,839
something right here and this is good we

00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:26,970
are still probably not good enough

00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:30,300
because if you look the optic it's like

00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:32,880
you know the dumpee here was huge they

00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:36,449
are peak here it's not so big but say

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,690
it's a beginning of the trial so I see

00:16:36,449 --> 00:16:41,650
in a

00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:44,650
in a good way and probably the fact of

00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:47,950
having new moderators that I wrote new

00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:51,100
ideas new you know the ways to engage

00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:54,010
people because the point is we can have

00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:56,320
the best technical solution agar that if

00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:59,400
we don't have any ideas you know to

00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:03,430
engage people will not engage people and

00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:07,270
also I am a little bit concerned about

00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:10,569
this data about the acuteness of this

00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:14,140
data mainly because our forum is mainly

00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:17,650
on support this is a fact probably

00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:21,100
ninety percent of those force are not

00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:23,740
support so one of the problems of fedora

00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:27,430
that I think we have is that could arise

00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:29,800
to good you know in fedora tan and

00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:32,790
remember you had a huge problems with

00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:35,350
the vgas and mojitos and whatever else

00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:38,920
now we don't have this problem so people

00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:41,290
do not reach the door are becoming

00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:43,660
community but also the other communities

00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:45,100
because they don't have problems so if

00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:47,650
they don't have problems they don't

00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:49,060
engage what they don't reach us and if

00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:52,780
they don't reach us in the first place

00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:55,930
did not engage so I think that as a

00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:58,480
general community and not only time and

00:17:55,930 --> 00:18:00,790
not only local communities or as a

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,310
fedora general community we should try

00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:06,250
to find different ways to engage with

00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:09,760
our our users because we end up with

00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:13,000
like Windows user or mac users did not

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:15,850
engage with the company and behind it

00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,370
you know they just are user but that is

00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:21,610
not the way we want to have users

00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:23,920
because we are a community so if they

00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:26,650
use fedora but the amount part of the

00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:29,080
community you know we don't have any

00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:32,140
advantage I would say from you know the

00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:34,680
presence of these people so i think we

00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:36,140
should really try to find new ways

00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:40,790
independent italian

00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:43,990
we had a couple of ideas over the years

00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:49,310
one was magazine that was actually

00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:53,060
mainly done by my girl and it was like

00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:55,580
PDF kind of magazine so that you know

00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:59,170
you kind of have a different way to

00:18:55,580 --> 00:19:04,340
communicate to people a good war and

00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:08,240
also we had for a few years some kind of

00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:10,640
contest in the forum that was generating

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:13,760
some kind of traffic and post and

00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,470
whatever but you know it's still the

00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,780
same problem because you have a very

00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:20,060
small amount of people that have a lot

00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:22,760
of knowledge and then a huge amount of

00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:26,200
people that just come when I come by ask

00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:30,950
a question get an answer and disappear

00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:36,140
so I think we should try to find new

00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:42,380
ways to you know to share new ways to

00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:45,650
engage people so in the general federal

00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:49,940
community we actually reached a

00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:53,300
consensus on what privacy to keep to

00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:56,450
keep pages and not now we have partially

00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:58,580
copied the French community the French

00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:01,910
community was purchased reckon this

00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:04,670
because I we do not want to have to

00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:08,300
translate animal with pages so we delete

00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:09,829
them all we are a little bit our voice

00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:13,019
is a little bit

00:20:09,829 --> 00:20:15,539
you know lose so we decided to keep

00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:17,969
between 20 and 30 pages because that is

00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:20,789
the amount of pages that we expect to be

00:20:17,969 --> 00:20:25,139
able to manage now we have at the moment

00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:29,070
about 300 pages so it will be very long

00:20:25,139 --> 00:20:32,789
now to choose which 30 pages of up top

00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:43,679
300 but I think it would be you know few

00:20:32,789 --> 00:20:49,529
months and yeah yeah well i have

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:53,339
actually an post a mailing list message

00:20:49,529 --> 00:20:57,179
that i was going to prepare during the

00:20:53,339 --> 00:21:01,619
flight my plight here let's see if i can

00:20:57,179 --> 00:21:05,070
move it here okay so for instance this

00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:07,679
is my least personally so it's really my

00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:12,239
point of view pages that i would keep

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:15,899
its like the anaconda this is like a

00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:18,179
page where it described how to do all

00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:21,149
the steps of anaconda so it's like a

00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:24,749
user page so it makes sense a thing or

00:21:21,149 --> 00:21:29,940
like stuff about documentation of the

00:21:24,749 --> 00:21:33,599
project the distribution the design well

00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:37,369
cover a large cities how to make a CD or

00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:41,959
USB drives the foundations for

00:21:37,369 --> 00:21:45,259
foundations act a little bit of epic use

00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:48,950
religious road maps search like user

00:21:45,259 --> 00:21:52,169
part and then those are the pages that

00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:55,109
well we have some pages that are

00:21:52,169 --> 00:21:57,929
actually any time for returning users

00:21:55,109 --> 00:21:59,640
and our historical pages like released

00:21:57,929 --> 00:22:03,810
party you know

00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:06,060
there are 17 and 25 21 responses so

00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:08,190
these are historic web pages we can keep

00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:10,080
them because you know they are not on

00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:13,890
going up they don't require ongoing

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:16,020
maintenance and and then we have a huge

00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:18,630
amount of pages that are actually in

00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:22,110
Italian not translated but just any time

00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:24,930
and we probably will need to rework

00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:27,600
those on it'll be because I would say

00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:30,590
the majority of those are just real

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:33,090
content double content and you know

00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:37,320
programming will need to update those

00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:40,500
and see a little bit about those and and

00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:43,230
then we have those two pages that are

00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,850
actually in Italian but our guides so

00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:48,620
probably should have those in english

00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:52,200
and then maybe translated but you know

00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:54,590
keep them in English also not on in

00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:58,380
Italian because we are how to create

00:22:54,590 --> 00:23:00,990
large cities and live USB you know maybe

00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:02,900
there is already a page there but we

00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:05,700
have to check if we have more material

00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:08,550
merge the two pages in English and then

00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:11,340
maybe translate those but you know it

00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:15,890
does have no sense to have a different

00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:18,510
Italian way you know and then we have

00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:21,090
those are the pages that as I would

00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:24,240
suggest you delete and are by categories

00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:25,740
I am sorry that it's in italian the my

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,590
comment because you know it would be

00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:31,320
sent in a meaningless so it makes sense

00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:33,240
but the idea is like odium of a muscle

00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:35,970
yourself it does not make any sense to

00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:38,070
plan a safe because you want your

00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:40,500
impossible to actually know English if

00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:41,389
they don't know English how can they

00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:44,450
will be able to

00:23:41,389 --> 00:23:47,629
engage with your oxygen community with

00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:50,359
your fedora community I mean they will

00:23:47,629 --> 00:23:53,089
be may be very good going to people as

00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:55,099
begin any onion with them but if they

00:23:53,089 --> 00:23:58,429
don't know anything about English how

00:23:55,099 --> 00:24:01,700
can they you know doing information from

00:23:58,429 --> 00:24:04,099
the Fedora project in so I think all

00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:06,529
those ambassador pages can just be

00:24:04,099 --> 00:24:09,109
dropped bug zappers it's like blood

00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:11,989
suckers are people that take care of

00:24:09,109 --> 00:24:16,129
pods if the download english how can

00:24:11,989 --> 00:24:18,619
they take care of bugs come on and then

00:24:16,129 --> 00:24:24,200
what we have few categories that provo

00:24:18,619 --> 00:24:26,690
you can drop also fpn packages how to

00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:29,329
create RPM packages if you actually do

00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:32,209
know no English how can you create an

00:24:29,329 --> 00:24:34,909
RPM package because also there is a huge

00:24:32,209 --> 00:24:37,429
process to create packages and it is

00:24:34,909 --> 00:24:40,129
like a confrontation process with other

00:24:37,429 --> 00:24:42,139
people in the community as an instant in

00:24:40,129 --> 00:24:44,450
English so it's like want us to

00:24:42,139 --> 00:24:48,469
translate those kind of thing I think

00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:51,169
and also translation we have translation

00:24:48,469 --> 00:24:53,599
translated documentation for translating

00:24:51,169 --> 00:24:55,429
stuff now I would say that if you are

00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:58,700
translating stuff you should know

00:24:55,429 --> 00:25:01,369
English at least you know so you

00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:04,339
probably don't need an Italian version

00:25:01,369 --> 00:25:09,079
of how to translate English content you

00:25:04,339 --> 00:25:12,619
know and infra same thing is I yeah it's

00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:16,039
okay to turns eight stock but if you are

00:25:12,619 --> 00:25:17,350
kind of in infrastructure side you

00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:21,960
should know

00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:26,049
because you know and then we have a

00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:29,380
bunch of stuff about helping invesco

00:25:26,049 --> 00:25:30,850
contribute to contributing that kind of

00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:33,730
stuff still if you are going to

00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:37,150
contribute in the Fedora project you

00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:39,640
know Koko dollar project you need no

00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:43,480
English so I think those pages are not

00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:46,120
very useful then test cases same thing

00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:49,330
if you are performing a test case the

00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:51,280
GUI is fine bugs and then open box on

00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:53,980
mozilla if you don't know any English

00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:58,360
you will have problems opening box and

00:25:53,980 --> 00:26:01,059
you know dealing with the people in the

00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:04,480
other side saying okay what exactly is

00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:06,370
the ball can we repeat those and that

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:11,100
kind of stuff and then very advanced

00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:13,390
topic like vectorization a year I'm

00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:15,940
architecture debt and yourself I would

00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:17,830
say the majority of people do trying to

00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:20,320
do that kind of stuff knows english

00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:22,330
because you know your transition is

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:25,059
pretty advanced topic usual you are

00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:27,909
sysadmin and if you have a sysadmin and

00:26:25,059 --> 00:26:31,240
he not only know english we are not very

00:26:27,909 --> 00:26:33,580
well placed also because in the late 90s

00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:35,500
beginning of two thousand we had a huge

00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:38,260
amount of books that were actually

00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:41,260
translated in Italian you know hand

00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:44,280
system administrator books but in the

00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:47,789
last few years not even the big

00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:50,639
corporation like Hawaii or

00:26:47,789 --> 00:26:54,149
play or whatever and did not even

00:26:50,639 --> 00:26:56,999
translate anymore they just import the

00:26:54,149 --> 00:27:00,499
English version and Santos because i

00:26:56,999 --> 00:27:02,940
mean it is only 50 million people and

00:27:00,499 --> 00:27:06,359
italian people speaking Italian it's

00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:08,639
like 50 million people you don't I mean

00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:12,659
like Spanish you have a lot of spanish

00:27:08,639 --> 00:27:17,820
speaker out gasping so let me have sense

00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:20,249
for them to Spanish speaker us outside

00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:23,460
Spain then it sounded yeah because you

00:27:20,249 --> 00:27:26,369
have a South American dead as yeah but

00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:29,190
Anita it's not like that it's like only

00:27:26,369 --> 00:27:33,029
talion seen it I speak Italy Italian so

00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:36,809
it's a very very small man sacked or so

00:27:33,029 --> 00:27:40,289
and then we have a bunch of pages that

00:27:36,809 --> 00:27:44,190
are actually to be archived because it's

00:27:40,289 --> 00:27:48,529
I fedora 12 13 kind of soft so that's

00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:52,889
mainly decorati i'm using it's a if it's

00:27:48,529 --> 00:27:54,720
something that you need some pages that

00:27:52,889 --> 00:27:56,999
you need to contribute to the federal

00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,950
project and your contribution will be in

00:27:56,999 --> 00:28:05,320
English it's funky click click translate

00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:08,470
the process yeah yes can I ask you

00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:12,240
that which would be put this Community

00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:15,520
Health determine if

00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,690
simple button somewhere because yes a

00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,240
lot of the writers of english-language

00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:22,240
material and natives the guests wish and

00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:24,520
they may reach for Indians or specific

00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:28,090
adjectives adverbs who don't work well

00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:32,470
on yes we have had done this color this

00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:36,330
kind of debate in our huge debate about

00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:39,910
keeping on deleting stuff and the

00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:42,760
general idea is that a lot of pages as

00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:45,580
are already written in a 30 plain

00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:49,660
English i would say some of them are not

00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:52,270
and the idea is to help you know making

00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:54,820
it more plain because i will not say

00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:58,360
simplified english but at least plain

00:28:54,820 --> 00:29:01,530
english not some idioms or kind of stuff

00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:04,660
because it's kind of program for

00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:07,600
non-native english speaker because we

00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:11,620
learn English in schools and in schools

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:15,040
they do not teach you videos so it's

00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:18,520
kind of room and another people at least

00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:20,710
literally had scholastic English because

00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:24,040
they have never used English outside

00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:28,030
school so at least we should keep i

00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:31,830
think i would say b1 b2 level kind of

00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:36,880
thing it's cambridge rabbits but so it's

00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:40,690
simply not very weird phrase is not very

00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:44,429
weird constructions and not really use

00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:50,559
not yet yeah there is

00:29:44,429 --> 00:29:54,610
I love my god a lot of English leaders

00:29:50,559 --> 00:30:00,610
use specific definitions of words yet in

00:29:54,610 --> 00:30:03,400
some cases is the last in American

00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:06,520
English yes so point those things out

00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:09,309
because the majority to find an American

00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:13,000
yeah the the program that would send in

00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:15,669
the week pages is that wiki is like a

00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,070
powers you know everyone can go there

00:30:15,669 --> 00:30:20,770
create a wiki page or edit a wiki page

00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:23,140
or whatever and you know it's as

00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:27,299
official as all the other wiki pages

00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:30,970
there and so it's like you know it's

00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:33,700
probably something that it's to be dealt

00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:35,890
with a technical from a technical

00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:38,080
perspective inside problem media week is

00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:42,070
not the best tool for that kind of job I

00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:44,110
think but we will see in the next few

00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:48,100
years if something changed from that

00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:51,970
side at least and also we have a charge

00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:54,880
a huge amount the rose lane in the list

00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:57,010
if you know you there is already a huge

00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:00,850
amount of pages that are already are

00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:03,220
tried and we have something like couple

00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:05,799
hundred pages that have already been a

00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:10,150
child because old stuff and if you want

00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:14,980
to attract those so something has

00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:18,250
already been done and so my plans for

00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:20,980
next year from fedora online so Italian

00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:23,590
khadora community first of all replaced

00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:25,630
mediawiki because updating in your week

00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:28,690
is a nightmare and you got an update

00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:30,580
every month and since mediawiki is the

00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:31,820
same software that is used by the

00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:33,980
wikimedia foundation

00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:35,720
although wikipedias there are a huge

00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:37,850
amount of people trying to do for

00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:40,970
security vulnerabilities in those

00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:44,540
softwares and you don't want to have the

00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:47,480
old mediawiki around Meek read the poem

00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:50,930
to SNF which is a simple machine for a

00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:54,620
different platform way more stable way

00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:59,390
more secure way more updated so which

00:31:54,620 --> 00:32:01,790
are shall we say and then add some more

00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:04,370
people to the south well actually three

00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:07,640
people active in the stuff i would like

00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:11,540
to see five to six people because you

00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:15,140
know and then serve the bass problem you

00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:17,870
know the what happens if I'm heated by a

00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:20,150
bus I'm the only administrator I am the

00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:24,170
only one with the keys of the server

00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:26,660
what happens if I am heated by bus well

00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:29,630
the photo Italian community will die in

00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:33,800
one now because you know the the pay and

00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:35,390
the service trademark me so but I think

00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:38,320
we should serve this program with the

00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:41,330
second nominee is recommended but and

00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:43,790
you know would be communities you don't

00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:47,540
have this problem in the fedora general

00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:50,690
community if someone in the in Fatima

00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:53,120
has some kind of personal issue and has

00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:55,520
to go outside the door operatives okay

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,950
we have plenty of those people so it's

00:32:55,520 --> 00:33:00,830
okay but in small communities kind of a

00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:03,200
great problem and I know that there is

00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:05,450
at least a couple of localized

00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:08,120
communities that disappeared from the

00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:11,450
web you know overnight just because

00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:14,720
there is a to did not pay the different

00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:17,900
we model servers so it's kind of a big

00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:23,420
promoting and in the general fedora

00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:25,820
community push for more you know we have

00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:26,490
the this thing where every single

00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:28,950
community

00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:31,380
your guys community has its own rules

00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:33,780
it's on best practices its own

00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:36,090
everything maybe we should share those

00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:38,760
are little bit more it's like this is

00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:42,000
also that of my talk it's like try to

00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:44,309
let's try to to speak with each other

00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,710
and say we are doing this what you are

00:33:44,309 --> 00:33:50,929
doing you know let's try to find a way

00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:59,520
to communicate more so that we have more

00:33:50,929 --> 00:34:05,640
you know consensus they're all so simple

00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:08,790
simpler g11 hand tools we actually have

00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:12,240
some kind of meeting on friday and i

00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:16,350
told them i guess i will be on plot next

00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:19,440
week so if someone has some kind of you

00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:22,710
know complaints or would see some kind

00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:25,800
of feature on jerry ehman tools please

00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:27,540
tell me so that i can report with people

00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:30,629
that are actually developing those tools

00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:33,750
and I have had a huge amount of you know

00:34:30,629 --> 00:34:36,179
points there so people are not very

00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:38,250
happy probably with the actual tools and

00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:40,800
also the fact that for instance the wiki

00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:43,020
do not actually use the natto we don't

00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:46,139
use sons are not elaborating we have

00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:50,580
since some stuff on transifex it's like

00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:54,600
a little bit of a master so maybe if we

00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:58,890
would be able to simplify things people

00:34:54,600 --> 00:35:01,619
will be happier was because I I tried to

00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:05,670
go regice insalata at that conch this

00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:08,760
year and I actually had to do it in two

00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:11,520
days and with Patrick held in between

00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:13,830
because I was not able to you know

00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:16,740
register to zanotta properly on the

00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:20,700
first time and I am actually I think a

00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:22,910
pretty savvy user as I if I have some

00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:26,480
comments there what will be

00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:30,079
the average standard user even at low

00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:33,650
scale you at low IT skills user and say

00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:36,319
probably need simpler tools and will

00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:39,859
similarly ngu eyes in more

00:35:36,319 --> 00:35:42,530
straightforward stuff and then as I said

00:35:39,859 --> 00:35:44,900
before most and Isles best practices

00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:49,220
among different two different teams

00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:51,770
because it's true that we have different

00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:56,089
programs you know German people are huge

00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:58,220
themes we are not so big there are teams

00:35:56,089 --> 00:36:00,410
that are even smaller than us so

00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:02,539
obviously we have kind of different

00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:05,900
problems but we still have the same goal

00:36:02,539 --> 00:36:08,569
so if we have the same goal I think we

00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:11,510
should be able to find you know best

00:36:08,569 --> 00:36:17,720
practices that fits all of them or all

00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:21,920
of us or at least partially so this is

00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:24,670
my review of the last year if anyone has

00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:28,940
some questions that has not been asked

00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:34,240
before yeah

00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:36,230
no liberate we have done so if

00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,300
infrastructure and I'm not making any

00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:40,640
promises on it instructions are a lot

00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:43,210
senses are going to happen this is my

00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:46,210
particular delusional

00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:46,210
if

00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:54,759
providing say a4a with a hyper kiddie

00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:56,589
install that you could then either one

00:36:54,759 --> 00:36:59,009
the localization that is provided by

00:36:56,589 --> 00:37:00,100
that upstream or health work without a

00:36:59,009 --> 00:37:03,190
civilization

00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:05,080
play so that you essence didn't have you

00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:06,560
as much will be in for work which you

00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:09,230
add in the world

00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:11,770
is that something Italian community to

00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:16,820
be responsive to or is the act of doing

00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:19,720
an integral part of p well and I would

00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:24,920
say the Italian community would be happy

00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:27,440
but well I'm speaking I have like an

00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:32,660
ongoing conversation with Patrick about

00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:34,910
this because I mean it in one hand the

00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:38,150
name for team does not want to have an

00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:40,910
overload of different platform different

00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:44,210
south and I always see their point and

00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:46,520
on the other hand we need something

00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:48,790
different from what fedora hats because

00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:53,060
I fedora does not have a forum anymore

00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:55,240
we move to ask for your you're saying is

00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:59,480
your burden to you write software

00:37:55,240 --> 00:38:01,580
consulting it has yes it's really close

00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:04,910
your eyes and French degrees and tumeric

00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:08,470
really not see yeses that death would be

00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:11,840
perfect that it's also my perfect

00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:16,160
perspective but i think we are frightful

00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:18,340
from there because first of all I was

00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:22,240
speaking with Patrick about asked

00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:24,770
specifically asked and there are some

00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:26,750
translated version of ask but if you

00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:30,800
look at those they are not really

00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:33,950
translated they are like how big kind of

00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:36,350
solution because the way we are doing it

00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:39,020
now is we had one installation of past

00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:41,870
and then when you go to a different

00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:43,850
local version you have

00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:46,910
template and that is why you have

00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:48,890
different you know strains there and you

00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:52,130
have different query in the database

00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:54,920
that will only query in theory your

00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:56,840
language now the greatest normally not

00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:59,660
perfect or ask is not perfect or

00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:02,450
somewhere in between so you don't

00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:06,380
actually get consistent results I would

00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:09,800
say so yeah that is one thing that we

00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:12,500
are working on no sir as a fedora online

00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:16,160
so Italian Pinot community we have a

00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:19,220
problem that is we study adoro free so

00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:23,030
we kind of have a very strong name at

00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:26,890
least in the dying community so it for

00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:31,010
us is ok to be more closer to the

00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:33,040
interim general federal project but we

00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:36,620
still want to have a little bit of

00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:40,070
naming their you know consistent names

00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:42,080
or consistent domain names that kind of

00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:45,620
stuff because you know we are known

00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:46,930
locally with that name right so as our

00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:49,610
world

00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:52,520
implementation but what I'm hearing is

00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:55,250
you need to be something that the

00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:57,800
community that's telling me it's still

00:39:55,250 --> 00:40:01,340
brand him so yeah and you can still say

00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:04,220
our region for me first quickies instead

00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:07,130
of ass or in our emails and stuff for

00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:09,470
others and so that it's not you must

00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:13,580
take these three pieces in yeah exactly

00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:15,200
because I mean obviously from a new

00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:19,640
first quarter point of view this means

00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:22,340
sport work and but I think that a good

00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:25,160
deal would be like I am actually journey

00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:27,320
but you have one half people are working

00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:30,530
on an Italian in car and we are okay

00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:32,810
joining the infrared so it would be yeah

00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:36,440
you have a little bit more work but also

00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:39,680
won a happy person or so it could be

00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:43,640
some kind of gear this way we are trying

00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:47,720
to you know to find a deal with with

00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:52,070
them too so that it works nicely but and

00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:54,890
also here I think that from the other

00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:56,990
the past community should be you know

00:40:54,890 --> 00:41:00,350
some kind of preach there because if

00:40:56,990 --> 00:41:02,600
it's just Italian on ok we are 1.5

00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:05,150
people but if it's like maybe the french

00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:07,610
one the german one and other communities

00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:09,860
as well you know it maybe be enough

00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:10,970
people to have this whole infrastructure

00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:13,450
up and run

00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:13,450
in working

00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:26,920
with when you say that there are very

00:41:21,619 --> 00:41:30,339
little group of power users and a lot of

00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:41,480
just people who make a question

00:41:30,339 --> 00:41:44,859
disappear maybe not tracking users I

00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:51,579
know the Mayday use the computer for

00:41:44,859 --> 00:42:01,520
designing or doing well Jose Cano swings

00:41:51,579 --> 00:42:06,559
maybe they won't just okay I mean a

00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:14,750
saloon in the middle not in the middle

00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:16,700
between user our users yeah what I would

00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:22,609
say that if we are able to integrate

00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:25,190
more with the epidural structure this

00:42:22,609 --> 00:42:26,930
will arrive because as I said in the

00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:29,450
beginning we have a huge amount of

00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:32,750
Italian people Italian speakers actually

00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:35,900
working on the Fedora project but not in

00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:38,480
the Italian side I would say but just in

00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:41,059
general one so if we are able to you

00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:43,220
know get closer to them being more

00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:46,160
integrated with fast for instance that

00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:49,309
you are account system and other stuff

00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:52,040
like that probably easier also to you

00:42:49,309 --> 00:42:54,740
know to get some of those people to also

00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:56,839
help out a little bit here and there in

00:42:54,740 --> 00:43:00,579
and some of

00:42:56,839 --> 00:43:03,410
people in marketing and web sites and

00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:05,809
packaging and so forth are actually time

00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:08,569
but we don't we never see those in the

00:43:05,809 --> 00:43:12,739
Italian side dr. the project so in the

00:43:08,569 --> 00:43:17,599
IOC you or formal attire going on all

00:43:12,739 --> 00:43:20,420
the foreman I think they know you see

00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:24,200
this is my perspective I think they know

00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:32,569
that they prefer to stay in the

00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:35,269
international side of it yes so vs zebra

00:43:32,569 --> 00:43:41,569
email as universal in our powers to

00:43:35,269 --> 00:43:46,519
delay of 0 precise date a layman we have

00:43:41,569 --> 00:43:48,290
an estimate in post I saw the person I

00:43:46,519 --> 00:43:50,750
wanted a spare my slide in

00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:53,570
how many people that was even if it's

00:43:50,750 --> 00:44:01,880
transients longer wife how large is I

00:43:53,570 --> 00:44:09,800
well we had on our film there is a

00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:16,490
little bit of statistics in the okay in

00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:19,220
the end it's 8300 users but this is the

00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:24,530
total amount you know because they

00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:28,130
created 235 darlin with some of you know

00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:32,480
people who at the door 10 yeah exactly

00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:36,530
so my section parts from waters

00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:38,590
does this community roll up through

00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:41,090
ambassadors for conversations

00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:42,609
successfully with

00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:45,880
come forward
