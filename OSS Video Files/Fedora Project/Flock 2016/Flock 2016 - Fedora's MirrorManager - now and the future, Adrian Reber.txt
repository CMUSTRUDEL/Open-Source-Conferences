Title: Flock 2016 - Fedora's MirrorManager - now and the future, Adrian Reber
Publication date: 2016-08-21
Playlist: Flock 2016
Description: 
	Since spring 2015 a MirrorManager re-implementation is running in Fedora's infrastructure to manage the mirrors providing Fedora to the end-users worldwide. This talk tries to summarize the current architecture and what changed from the previous MirrorManager implementation. This talk should/could also be the basis for a discussion what is needed in MirrorManager for the future.

welcome to my and talk about def been

00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:21,180
worried when she talks in the past I

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:26,099
think they were all done by a match who

00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:30,630
was the original also over yeah who

00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:34,920
wrote it Moon River yeah I looked it up

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:40,170
in engage so i can i can tell us one

00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:43,430
when it was not my idea of behind this

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:47,129
presentation together status what's

00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:49,770
currently available what this special

00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:52,770
chair changed the last year or the last

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:57,020
two years and what's currently running

00:00:52,770 --> 00:01:00,650
and maybe get a discussion doing what we

00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:07,010
to make it better because it has still

00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:12,830
some problems and something about about

00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:17,930
me and I'm actually I have a little of

00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:21,130
record not since 1998 so on a long time

00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:24,320
you're ugly and it's also how I got into

00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:27,530
mirror manager I'm maintaining also the

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,600
new manager instance for a confusion so

00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:37,130
if you download anything from there it

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:40,369
was it one of my skis and design we're

00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:44,030
all on altars I'm I and my part I'm a

00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:50,830
three-time I don't know and i'm working

00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:50,830
in something different hi control

00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:02,200
the levels are really no hero ha what

00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:04,690
government is there are different terms

00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:07,180
the worlds and what I mean then what

00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:12,790
powered is running within remember to

00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:15,360
and how it is used by Chinese by

00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:19,900
everybody is downloading any updates

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:22,780
then I will find out you were you

00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:28,570
telling us we currently have and I see

00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:30,620
and that we can have some ideas how we

00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:33,620
can

00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,620
hmm

00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:42,670
religion is basically a tool to redirect

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:45,790
a user to the best possible mirror for a

00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:49,900
better user in his cabinet with with us

00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:54,010
can appear dress and what was the best

00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:56,710
player we define the best mirrors the

00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:59,170
closest mineral because the probability

00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:03,520
is high that just might be the best

00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:06,190
mineral and the closest really and we

00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:09,940
try to find out personally try to match

00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:12,400
it same continent if it's on some

00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,830
research Network which might have better

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:19,360
connectivity then if it's the same

00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:25,080
country we try to match up autonomous

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:29,500
systems and if the rearming and effort

00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:32,220
net blocks which he believes is where I

00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,220
should be it

00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:40,980
responsible for all and we will redirect

00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:45,500
the user to get them to that Network and

00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:48,540
some of the features which manager s and

00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:51,780
it supports fashion yours or somebody

00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:54,989
wants only to know certain releases a

00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:58,250
fedora or certain architectures near

00:03:54,989 --> 00:04:01,530
manager can can handle this and we

00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:05,519
support multiple categories so we have

00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:08,190
federal lives and April and distance

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,880
categories we have a fedora archive for

00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:14,180
the were secondary and fizzle rock out

00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:21,030
those are the talent categories we are

00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:25,139
providing I don't know our telecast he

00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:27,510
has disappeared luckily F because it was

00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:28,470
really bad from the room just design I

00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:31,310
don't know

00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:31,310
and then we got ya

00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:38,300
okay because it

00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:41,330
yeah yeah

00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:44,240
there are two injured later it's and

00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:47,150
it's i think it was for three reasons it

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,580
was about 700,000 file yeah andrea

00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:51,800
manager pro all of them each time and

00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:54,050
just took forever this list we're at the

00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:58,310
point where a really worth the

00:04:54,050 --> 00:05:01,669
performance cafe circa home and we're

00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:03,889
really grow a lot of nervous because of

00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:07,060
the role of government anymore able to

00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:09,800
get the content from the month and

00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:14,860
what's what you read with no manager

00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:17,750
which which no other literary manager

00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:20,090
solutions provide the news that i have

00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:22,849
seen this product also an organization

00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:26,000
can say we want to provide a meal for

00:05:22,849 --> 00:05:28,819
all users but nobody else in the outside

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,680
should be able to access it and if the

00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:37,550
mirror is detectable by a hostname or IP

00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:39,200
your manager can then and redirect those

00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:45,340
users coming from this I

00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:45,340
he was certain aura and nobody else and

00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:52,250
& Wesson week is a service that in the

00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,520
face and I'm not every time sure too

00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:56,740
good a deal because

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,510
it gives the relative level flexibility

00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:00,070
because they can configure it all on

00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:02,380
their own they don't have to write

00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:05,800
emails and say please at this net blog

00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:07,750
is at this is and this country we want

00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:11,140
to block this and that so they can do

00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:14,190
all this on their own but they usually

00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:17,670
sometimes need some help to get it and

00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:22,420
configured correctly source has

00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:25,300
disadvantages I know that little energy

00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:28,030
is used by fedora perfect not confusing

00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:33,310
there were few attempts to get simple as

00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:35,470
running and manager but they didn't like

00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:37,270
it they didn't have time I don't know it

00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:39,900
there were original specials but it

00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,900
never went well

00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:55,150
but yeah for root or rather I don't know

00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:59,520
what celebrities there are our emerald

00:06:55,150 --> 00:07:03,660
managing solutions which reduces and

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:08,919
little bit it's accused by Babylon and

00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:16,150
super Apple Uranus is something which a

00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:18,849
lot of projects are actually living it's

00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:22,960
the verifier basinger and they are using

00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:26,759
it and you are and Vivian has just I

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:32,229
think two years ago will introduce a

00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:36,250
something similar also it works on HTTP

00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:38,650
regather happy then there was a real

00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:40,930
money which only check the single file

00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:43,249
so they only check if the time set fires

00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:46,939
up today and if it's activated

00:07:43,249 --> 00:07:49,879
of the moment always sensible mirror to

00:07:46,939 --> 00:07:53,329
make sure all the files or almost all

00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:56,829
files are up to date and then only even

00:07:53,329 --> 00:07:59,380
not only the times and fire and it seems

00:07:56,829 --> 00:08:05,440
every project has there

00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:08,310
Marrone managing framework to this

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,310
analogy with it

00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:23,460
and about your managers history looking

00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:29,840
at a video of the average curve it was

00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:32,250
started in January 2007 and is also

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,830
sometimes important to remember when

00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:39,270
working with the coalface even if it's

00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:42,810
now within something numerous it makes

00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:49,230
different assumptions about Mira sizes

00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:52,770
and and what time is required schedule

00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:57,530
it all because it was small it was

00:08:52,770 --> 00:09:00,540
initially admitted to the last

00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:02,940
experiences may 2007 when it was

00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:06,930
restricted to you but what what I hear

00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:10,020
from the good luck from capacity to run

00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:12,470
the same time has it the same time as it

00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:16,640
exists only in the favela infrastructure

00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:16,640
and the

00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:24,209
the co-pays were two years 1 by

00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:26,040
something base and packing this to

00:09:24,209 --> 00:09:29,279
something which one on the raw celery

00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:32,480
which was the targeted platform for

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:35,910
Fidel for the federal infrastructure and

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:38,759
require a rewrite of the co-pays in any

00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:41,540
case to something you li google news

00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:44,540
tool or a no

00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,540
or

00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:10,030
332 lot of platforms and

00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:21,360
2015 it was and actually moved into

00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:28,350
production systems Fedorenko structure

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:31,100
and adjust last month I move path of RPF

00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:36,510
users moment Joe infrastructure also to

00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:42,890
me romantically the changes for Fallujah

00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:42,890
to wear em it's now floss and SQL up

00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:50,520
we made a few changes to relative to

00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:54,000
paper the petroleum use to tell Eleanor

00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:58,340
us every time even if they took forever

00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:02,330
to declare we allowed and disable us

00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:06,960
which have persecuted for four years and

00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:11,460
we just maximum time of three hours to

00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:13,950
crawl member also a 38 hours north of

00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:16,680
reachable the computer disabled it to

00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:20,430
not waste our resources from scanning

00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:23,640
slogan loss and if it's automatically

00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:27,030
disabled where the a-team can do I think

00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:34,740
of America really good anytime he wants

00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:38,970
to but this this disabled Laura 13 us

00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:41,610
which were still active stamatis active

00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:44,430
but we're not updated anymore so this

00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:47,730
what again we was something which which

00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:52,020
helped us to the use the crimes that are

00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:52,769
loose but sometimes it seems and that

00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:55,559
the loo

00:11:52,769 --> 00:11:58,860
we set our too too too high

00:11:55,559 --> 00:12:01,739
because sometimes no else gets disabled

00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:06,839
two parcels might be a value which needs

00:12:01,739 --> 00:12:16,049
to be reevaluated and the nice thing

00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:17,549
about our agreement was that the systems

00:12:16,049 --> 00:12:19,980
which are given out the newest and the

00:12:17,549 --> 00:12:22,709
meetings and they use the same they have

00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:24,329
them at as no manager one so we were

00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:26,279
able to update the nearest service

00:12:24,329 --> 00:12:29,670
independently of the back-end

00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:31,350
infrastructure I healer no we use you

00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:36,480
how always connected in tournaments

00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:41,670
expired we also recently disabled and

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:45,379
reversed all an ftp lanes from database

00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:50,069
and the reason behind this was the

00:12:45,379 --> 00:12:57,500
particular is usually difficult for some

00:12:50,069 --> 00:13:01,380
clients and is often reasoning

00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:03,450
with a certain aura and the probability

00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:05,190
that the user would get an stp when he

00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:08,940
was already pretty low because it will

00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:12,000
be really polite HTTP and ftp we would

00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:16,070
usually always give out the HTTP link

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:20,970
and make sure where the remaining ftp

00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:23,730
ftp servers are often of the clients we

00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:26,130
remove all them from the database and we

00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:30,210
in blocked at inning after giving to

00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:35,220
database and what also really added

00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:42,090
support to specify someone someone only

00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:44,760
ones HPS off so if you actually change

00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:48,810
your link profile manually which you

00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:50,670
shouldn't then you could say that you

00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:51,470
only want HTTPS in the roads this is

00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:54,290
also something

00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:59,830
we would expect to be handled by by dnf

00:13:54,290 --> 00:14:08,870
directly that we can say i am referring

00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:11,300
https morose and no manager does a lot

00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:15,860
of scanning of its master server and our

00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:18,890
wines and we tried to get no intelligent

00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:20,960
by doing the scans not chromebase any

00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:23,270
more about it but message based animals

00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:26,570
in the right now so if you get a message

00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:28,790
to the newer question generated or we

00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:31,610
can message that the ventilation seed of

00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:34,870
the master of any only chinese can

00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:34,870
imagine or changes

00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:44,730
this is the current architecture of

00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:49,200
abnormal manager we have one central

00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:55,830
system band system and which handles all

00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:58,170
of data that's the it generates the

00:14:55,830 --> 00:15:01,050
delta which have allowed through illness

00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:03,990
our systems which the clients are

00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:06,390
actually talking to so if you are wrong

00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:09,450
dinner for young it's always only

00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:12,960
talking to those little system talking

00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:15,810
to to the other systems which which also

00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:18,360
exists exists the patent system

00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:23,370
generates generates the day college

00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:25,850
which is pkl generation and this

00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:29,449
generation they have been pushed

00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:33,050
each other and the data includes which

00:15:29,449 --> 00:15:39,250
rules are available and up to date on

00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:43,040
which country in which netlog HPS animal

00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:45,709
if they are on internet to or research

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,690
networks and this big has been pushed

00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:50,060
out to the ruinous servers they are

00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:55,449
started in the a.m stop serving the new

00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:59,269
data on the client the problems and only

00:15:55,449 --> 00:16:01,819
300 grains the cell service in customs

00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:04,850
for the administration's of the news

00:16:01,819 --> 00:16:10,389
when I can consider the mirror and the

00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:15,380
pass the URLs and everything else and

00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:18,050
it's also the system where that we

00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:20,810
provide some statistics what's what's

00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:24,170
been downloaded and the growers our

00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:25,360
systems which are crawling all the

00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:28,450
existing you also

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:31,029
connecting to each mirror and scanning

00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:34,570
each marrow if they have up-to-date

00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:38,800
content and the girl works using either

00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:42,720
right now either HTTP or I'll see and we

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:46,240
prefer all seen because HDPE campaign

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,459
after one two three hours and then it

00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,920
hits the limit already in the mirrors

00:16:48,459 --> 00:16:53,500
disabled because depending on the

00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:56,320
configuration after afterward it

00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:59,680
community it actually opens a network

00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:02,920
connection for each file we we are

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:05,679
hoping that miracles are procedural kita

00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:09,939
life so this reduces the number of of

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:12,760
HTTP of TCP connections but mr. you a

00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:18,010
lot of HTTP connections which is really

00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:20,829
not very efficient and with our simply

00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:24,160
see differences between scanning times

00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:25,959
between two hours with HTTP and also in

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,350
taste ladies five minutes or something

00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:31,210
like this because it's we open one

00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:33,110
connection get a complete list of all

00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:37,850
files and

00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:40,100
and then we can process the pilus

00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:43,480
locally without meeting to connect

00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:47,299
communicate with the server anymore and

00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:51,020
one thing I try to improve which which

00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:53,660
failure and attract to them and because

00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:56,270
we're the crawl right now is there are

00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:58,610
two balls they are both in the Fedora

00:17:56,270 --> 00:18:01,309
infrastructure or data center which is

00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:05,330
in Phoenix I think so all the meals are

00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:07,580
all from Phoenix which just doesn't seem

00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:10,100
like the best idea if the wheels on the

00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:15,169
other side of the world so I have swell

00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:20,150
idea that and we could fly north Europe

00:18:15,169 --> 00:18:23,480
for some for you and I implemented the

00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:27,559
feds are required to to trawl based on

00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:30,400
the continent and so a work but those

00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:33,010
for example

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,500
if you going all the install files

00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:40,330
downloaded in the corner tries to and

00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:42,430
prepare it with the database it reads

00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:45,340
the file information from the database

00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:47,950
which are still refuse then comparison

00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:50,860
with the values and Ozzy's any updates

00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:53,050
the database which is still seems and so

00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:55,240
yes actually travel so that the scanning

00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:58,270
was faster but updating of the database

00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:01,690
was slower so this means work out at all

00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:06,340
and I feel to make something like this

00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:08,620
work the patrol through it changed

00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:10,390
completely because right now it's really

00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:13,360
making local database connection for

00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:15,970
each violence and the optimal k is it

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,850
would have all the data from the

00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:24,550
database mentally and put them update

00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:28,060
information in one upload this didn't

00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:33,030
work so far I mentioned and statistics

00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:39,250
wheeler from the front end is also doing

00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:44,940
trying to draw diagrams of the

00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:44,940
trepidation of the daytime so the

00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:53,830
the winning bar is how many worlds have

00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:58,800
the up-to-date repomd xml file the

00:19:53,830 --> 00:20:02,140
correct one and the red bar is which

00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:05,950
Royals have the little Andy from the

00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:12,780
boxing and the worst two things and

00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:19,320
rabbits in order so we see this is the

00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:24,880
beach bar s all for us so we see what

00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:28,840
data signal to the master oh we already

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:30,850
have after about eight hours almost

00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:33,730
fifty percent of the lures have taught

00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:35,470
our content which i think is this one

00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:40,120
which time and then it usually

00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:41,980
stabilizes pretty class and I love I

00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:44,809
think there

00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:49,600
always out of date because they are just

00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:51,440
broken so this will be manual manual

00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:56,669
interaction with

00:20:51,440 --> 00:21:02,039
talk to them find our white broken this

00:20:56,669 --> 00:21:11,039
is for 22 years old this is from

00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:13,349
yesterday from right it's why is always

00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:17,039
difficult because of Gina so far so we

00:21:13,349 --> 00:21:18,809
are the wheels in which are mirroring

00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:25,159
rise or ago

00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:28,289
so and then the positive changes and

00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:29,970
right I thought yesterday that something

00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:35,669
isn't working because everything is

00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:38,549
rapidly should be why we do so right in

00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:40,580
his room or the normal rules correct but

00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:46,179
why all the others are wrong

00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:50,000
already this is from bitter afore we see

00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:53,390
motorcycles here between the update and

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,919
much higher number of updated mirror

00:21:53,390 --> 00:22:00,210
this concerns right now we have about

00:21:56,919 --> 00:22:02,310
100 together watch Mike if they rule

00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:04,620
which are work which due to be working

00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:12,110
from those managers perspective on

00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:12,110
correctly okay so much

00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:30,490
see so they were usually related with

00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:30,490
point of every day every 12 hours and 40

00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:37,130
lakhs if any in the draft price

00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,500
encourage Lewis this is a to insisting

00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:42,260
we have few years which are actually

00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:44,770
murals they are they have direct access

00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:46,840
to the mouth the rules and almost

00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:49,300
militant dinosaur

00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,950
in north to the rest which I'm intricacy

00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:54,940
of four hours already eight RS

00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:57,640
difference to get them updated and yeah

00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:59,770
and it takes forever yeah and that's the

00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:02,830
ball yeah it takes forever because

00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:05,310
enemies it's a lot of beta right now and

00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:08,320
and also running takes I don't know

00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:11,410
three hours to stand the mastery rare

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:14,380
and the math ability basically not be

00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:17,710
much more right now than making awesome

00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:19,870
flying that happy because everybody is

00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:22,090
trying to better information from their

00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:23,710
master server and it has been where

00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:27,940
professors and every time every time

00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:30,160
every time and i think the the file

00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:34,590
system of the most numerous is shared we

00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:39,400
are a message from the meta yeah so yeah

00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:42,700
customers are saying yeah so meta so all

00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:44,950
it does is you chat oh well yeah and not

00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:47,880
only where the times are you stats that

00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:51,360
we are also spending the same data and

00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:51,360
going to talk about

00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:57,380
catholics are connecting to the middle

00:23:54,980 --> 00:24:01,700
managers also from necessary or two days

00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:06,740
ago this is this is all excesses which

00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:09,520
are coming to more manager without any

00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:14,290
filters over it so if when i pea does

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:20,170
your successes it will offer the be here

00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:26,030
countries where architectures particular

00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:29,920
and this is repositories and not people

00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:29,920
and the door

00:24:33,909 --> 00:24:40,960
and I mentioned that anywhere else

00:24:37,869 --> 00:24:46,159
sometimes their abuse and mental health

00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:49,009
and i want to show you that it can be

00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:51,169
quite complicated to come to the point

00:24:49,009 --> 00:24:53,119
where you can actually edward the URL

00:24:51,169 --> 00:24:55,309
for your mirror so the first thing you

00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:57,049
have to do you have to play the side and

00:24:55,309 --> 00:24:59,659
then you can you create in the side

00:24:57,049 --> 00:25:02,179
multiple holes and then your hosts you

00:24:59,659 --> 00:25:04,759
can create multiple categories so

00:25:02,179 --> 00:25:07,609
holsters basically the rules if you have

00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:09,830
multiple Rilla then you can divide in

00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:13,039
there and then the category

00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:15,210
the loons that or secondary either an

00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:18,090
unreached category

00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:19,860
at the Urals you are providing an

00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:22,940
instant information the floral arrow'

00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:25,679
and and everything is else is using two

00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:30,409
terms the final data which has been

00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,409
pushed out to the realest killaz i did a

00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:38,960
kind of the database to see that we

00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:40,410
currently have and database so we are

00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,030
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:46,240
privately sites of the sites which I

00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:50,950
might not private and not available for

00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:55,690
father uses then we have been 383 public

00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:58,720
sites which on all of public and not try

00:25:55,690 --> 00:26:02,230
let the horse again can be private or

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,390
public again I never really listed by

00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:07,000
the side and the host can be private and

00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:09,760
they can be differently I guess it's the

00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,530
side is private and the hosts public is

00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:20,620
the work so in any case where and from

00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:26,010
8612 hosts and 305 puppy coasts and over

00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:29,890
elbows first we have 1100 categories and

00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:36,840
1400 URLs average through our database

00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:40,330
and 929 us HTTP we have 125 HTTPS and

00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:41,690
362 Halsey this is a recurrent we have

00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:46,340
in our database

00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:55,519
we'll hear from the from the queen

00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:59,090
returns there are 124 which are working

00:26:55,519 --> 00:27:01,429
I didn't have a lot of people are

00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:02,809
remembering April so this is just

00:27:01,429 --> 00:27:05,269
doesn't come out here in Buddhist

00:27:02,809 --> 00:27:08,419
diagram because I here where you see

00:27:05,269 --> 00:27:11,289
that access the lumber neuroblastoma

00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:11,289
coming service

00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:23,560
so where the front end which to the user

00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:26,410
whenever around is usually uses realness

00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:29,150
and whittling it's mainly riffling

00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:30,330
fedora and

00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:31,890
the

00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:35,250
you are a little something like the

00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:40,559
second line is coming you can specify

00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:43,320
the repository of the door 24 or updates

00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:47,010
released 24 and there's an architecture

00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:50,610
and those additional our rules can be

00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:54,450
specified you can you can I open specify

00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:56,700
the file that you want bye-bye

00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:59,130
repository in architecture Alton

00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:01,230
specified by wood by providing the foot

00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:04,639
path to the file and then will amend or

00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:04,639
repeal you a mirror

00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:13,889
your own chest has a file then you can

00:28:07,889 --> 00:28:17,940
we can for testing reasons and use our

00:28:13,889 --> 00:28:20,340
country on that blog or you listed here

00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:25,980
you can also say IP you can directly

00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:28,820
specify the IP which average middle new

00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:32,269
manager should and provides the metal

00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:35,149
new list and this is and helpful if

00:28:32,269 --> 00:28:38,779
somebody has a problem and you know the

00:28:35,149 --> 00:28:41,659
appeal of the problem then you can test

00:28:38,779 --> 00:28:45,230
it and see what the result is looking

00:28:41,659 --> 00:28:48,590
like and actually wrong broken and wrong

00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:51,350
correct and then there are versions in c

00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:52,920
see this is for our eyes important to us

00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:55,230
standard one point

00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:59,560
if you want only a specific number of

00:28:55,230 --> 00:29:02,560
protocols let's get enough of

00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,560
yes

00:29:04,539 --> 00:29:12,679
okay this is the realest listen Melanie

00:29:09,879 --> 00:29:18,169
so to the knowledge is basically only

00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:21,679
you say then your test is URL and you

00:29:18,169 --> 00:29:25,940
get a list of possible murals for four

00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:30,540
on your request and you stay in

00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:33,940
see what repository the architecture

00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:36,759
mechanically and this is a

00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:38,190
normal one global as a type of normal

00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:40,409
but all

00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:43,649
at this point in time for college debt

00:29:40,409 --> 00:29:47,700
and urgent it would be much longer but

00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:50,509
you can list off https insert a list of

00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:57,450
of the corner of each line at one go

00:29:50,509 --> 00:30:03,809
meddling is different between it in a

00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:09,070
file and it contains all the interesting

00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:12,580
and it contains information about rato

00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:17,409
and the xml file about trans thing about

00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:20,590
checksums it can contain up to three and

00:30:17,409 --> 00:30:23,309
Rico and D constants and check zones and

00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:28,529
the related on your confidence

00:30:23,309 --> 00:30:32,129
and then a dnf can connect to one of

00:30:28,529 --> 00:30:35,159
those verses about you and download the

00:30:32,129 --> 00:30:37,639
repomd file and then it can see if the

00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:42,269
reaper if I'm matches the timestamp and

00:30:37,639 --> 00:30:45,149
the hash and only if this works in s

00:30:42,269 --> 00:30:47,909
accepts the mirror as a possible client

00:30:45,149 --> 00:30:49,740
so with no you have no verification at

00:30:47,909 --> 00:30:52,529
all it just goes to one of the murrells

00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:56,129
down 15 with whittling you have a

00:30:52,529 --> 00:31:01,379
verification mr. file which is provided

00:30:56,129 --> 00:31:05,129
by the mirrors and actually the same the

00:31:01,379 --> 00:31:08,340
one Fedor told you to download and it's

00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:10,950
providing three files in certain

00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:13,559
situations and a little part about the

00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:15,539
oscillator and to make sure it is the

00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:18,929
worse what updated fast enough you're

00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:21,269
still gather and then the common wisdom

00:31:18,929 --> 00:31:24,629
of the mirrors our schedules two times

00:31:21,269 --> 00:31:29,999
obey and so the world can be up to date

00:31:24,629 --> 00:31:32,519
a lot but you cannot scan it so often

00:31:29,999 --> 00:31:33,860
the study work so we are providing

00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:36,530
multiple

00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:38,690
d checksums so that if you connect to a

00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:41,000
mirror in the newest as all the data I

00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:43,040
will still have a working update which

00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,410
is not always desirable situation

00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:50,780
because you might miss some security

00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:54,670
updates which what you use work it takes

00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:54,670
too long okay so

00:31:54,840 --> 00:32:06,190
yeah are you of those pillows so you

00:32:01,179 --> 00:32:08,740
will get you constantly scan for free no

00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:12,040
impress upon your hair yeah but why do

00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:14,620
you do that no environment en su

00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:19,740
perspective little manager that you are

00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:19,740
gay right yes I do

00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:32,769
ways of getting information about this

00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:36,730
later a bit more and justice this is

00:32:32,769 --> 00:32:38,529
specifically I knew about them young

00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:40,750
usually looking to where only your

00:32:38,529 --> 00:32:45,010
Camaro managed to find all things on it

00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:48,909
so if it goes to dns why i stopped

00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:52,120
because it's too complicated for me so

00:32:48,909 --> 00:32:55,269
this is there are literally that's nice

00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:59,830
so yeah your partner's is another tool

00:32:55,269 --> 00:33:06,039
which we provide and yeah here behind

00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:08,889
report neuron is through the bottom you

00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:11,169
right now half we cannot and scan the

00:33:08,889 --> 00:33:13,690
mirrors fast enough you provide the

00:33:11,169 --> 00:33:16,210
words a tool which they can run after

00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:18,190
the dowsing run to tell us the day off

00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:21,039
today so they're announcing after the

00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:23,260
mirror run with that middle and they

00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:26,049
update our database that they are off

00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:27,820
today and in the next generation of the

00:33:26,049 --> 00:33:30,279
date I which is send out the nervous

00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:33,250
Celestis mirror is not as up to date or

00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:36,440
more depending on the value

00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:38,120
we actually need the partner of a

00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:41,030
private nurse because we wouldn't have

00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:43,580
any chance to get information about

00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:45,890
stethoscope five years because we do not

00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:48,490
stand by the rules the Prophet probably

00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:48,490
can or

00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:59,110
one of the problems referred me rehearse

00:33:57,190 --> 00:34:01,570
it only skeletal director is a double

00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:03,970
ganger condom the choir scan for content

00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:07,390
directly without knowledge doesn't and

00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:12,360
this goes back to it was written 2007

00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:15,429
and at that time it was not the idea of

00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:19,450
person all know our means to run a tool

00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:22,300
which stats again all that the fires

00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:23,830
just after all things stats started all

00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:26,350
of the files it seems like a better

00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:31,440
world and people who look probably in a

00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:34,270
run and so we say Admiral right now only

00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:36,640
texts to director instead that actually

00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:38,980
scare me asleep that the world actually

00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:40,360
is up to date and then we have the data

00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:43,080
to the database which looks to

00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,080
situations

00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:56,950
the situations where this M for example

00:34:54,819 --> 00:34:58,210
is if they didn't actually update the

00:34:56,950 --> 00:35:00,430
mirror because they're all seen

00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:03,000
commander spoken w run report we roll

00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:06,640
their head all directories because they

00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,920
run it a successful one month ago there

00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:11,259
was no release so then and the right

00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:13,240
they say yes if you don't want when you

00:35:11,259 --> 00:35:17,220
for directories and we believe them it's

00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:20,880
up to date and be happy sometimes that

00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:24,309
girls are actually selling they are

00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:27,099
Republic tells our manuals up today so

00:35:24,309 --> 00:35:29,170
it's enabled and then the brawler comes

00:35:27,099 --> 00:35:31,240
over and says no no is not up to date

00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:33,069
i'm disabling it and this often leads to

00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:36,490
a situation where we get back repaired

00:35:33,069 --> 00:35:37,470
people say the wherever the work then we

00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:38,880
say

00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:41,580
and say you shouldn't have been

00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,050
redirected for disabled but because the

00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:45,060
real time difference between services

00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:50,750
this is already an existing problem

00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:53,990
which might have we were

00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:57,910
you want everything you have the file

00:35:53,990 --> 00:36:01,520
sizes and times what biblia up to you

00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:04,020
but you get the point is you can't trust

00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,970
yes this is physical separation you do

00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:08,640
is trust me residue don't sell yourself

00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:11,430
so we trust them somehow because they

00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:13,589
they serve all files button and this is

00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:15,720
also very point letters say yes if they

00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:18,630
ran without merit it's good enough for

00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:21,299
us this is when I don't want those

00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:27,630
listening for the Mafia that was telling

00:36:21,299 --> 00:36:30,210
you America's so other beers needs to

00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:34,020
feedback from the actual prada shoes

00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:35,789
yeah I guess nap but so now you actually

00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:42,170
then you can do a statistical thought

00:36:35,789 --> 00:36:42,170
people hope and we crawl the 10 response

00:36:43,579 --> 00:36:50,130
okay it still takes forever for

00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:55,109
less.dell each other so we if we were

00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:57,480
HTTP poop HTTP protocol pretending these

00:36:55,109 --> 00:36:59,880
files in each directory I believe this

00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:01,210
is also called another touch but I've

00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:04,500
seen comments and a case

00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:04,500
this No

00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:12,900
so I

00:37:08,829 --> 00:37:12,900
like a PDF themselves

00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,460
you know

00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:20,490
well you awesome

00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:25,640
you only

00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:29,870
perhaps for four arrows

00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:40,420
all of the Sun calls and notice

00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:44,460
oh no no

00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:44,460
wiley but

00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:59,810
with all undergo yeah

00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,810
all ideologies

00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:15,269
a socially are they drinking

00:38:11,549 --> 00:38:19,130
which is about your horse

00:38:15,269 --> 00:38:19,130
let's use

00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:34,080
Yeah right I think I'm always scared

00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:36,450
about Henry a manager thing because you

00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:42,560
could probably do not a lot with you

00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:45,780
just want to cause damage easy normal

00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:48,510
yeah I didn't get a Ramirez key in order

00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:51,060
to reports the worst you can do is bad

00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:54,720
data if you're already real mirror and

00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:57,360
then disable yourselves yeah okay you

00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:01,550
can play the leather rubber us and have

00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:01,550
a database and Ferb

00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:20,510
people were people were wildly nervous

00:39:23,289 --> 00:39:29,259
this one is very useful

00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:41,970
walk without you

00:39:43,509 --> 00:39:48,400
south

00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:48,400
I mean the difference

00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:59,620
you know when I was usually sleeping

00:39:56,230 --> 00:40:02,320
with any customer somebody shoot us

00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:04,220
going to that many customer or edits to

00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:08,900
the memo managing network

00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:15,250
it did not work but is provided and and

00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:18,349
it's they have notes in our roll roll

00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:20,599
romania in the other guy about them to

00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:22,640
go to the new manager and the ball

00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:25,040
started rolling and it always because

00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:29,720
the fees always ask well you know the

00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:31,640
message was all of the system so just

00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:34,330
assembled it all with all set up so this

00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:37,340
even asking you to cooperate for them

00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:39,530
but i had to tell him yes has to disable

00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:42,920
it and some point isn't it up to them to

00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:49,210
make sure that all their Arizona the

00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:49,210
same actually would be not sir

00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:15,170
yeah and he was was 12 I also saw him

00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:17,060
and Eddie and I've accepted i know

00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:23,480
because we will already sits below he

00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:26,090
was no tears the metal inc alternates we

00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:28,340
have traveled with them also there is

00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:32,240
and what i said we have up to three

00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:35,150
methylene and check sounds in there are

00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:39,110
three later Andy its Ann objects on the

00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:42,080
methylene and they are removed after

00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:44,060
person and we're cool undies which

00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:46,730
decide when there are checks are through

00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:52,520
with over three days this is the easy

00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:55,060
way this girl and the second most recent

00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:57,310
angle is overmatched population days

00:41:55,060 --> 00:42:00,850
which is to I

00:41:57,310 --> 00:42:02,770
to write and the last thing is with the

00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:06,460
variance of really easy to find it in

00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:07,809
the coach doesn't know where is this and

00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:11,170
then I remember

00:42:07,809 --> 00:42:11,170
regretful cocoa

00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:19,100
and so this is works most of the time we

00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:21,700
had a few pages where things were and

00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:25,010
i'm not entirely sure why it didn't work

00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:26,780
it could have been a delay if this could

00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:29,720
actually happened that the repo and he

00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:32,240
fire was in the master Lu available and

00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:35,780
then the singing other legal generation

00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:39,920
city where and it was changed back to

00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:43,550
the old fire and then the roof is

00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:46,790
already detected and check some grass in

00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:49,070
the database in three days your eyes

00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:51,020
will learn all of the database of the

00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:53,570
old file oscar there because it was

00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:59,420
reverse it somehow or react situations

00:42:53,570 --> 00:43:00,470
where we from you over this end but it's

00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:04,760
not really

00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:06,859
and clear how when it happens to the

00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:09,800
golden is correct for the ideas it's

00:43:06,859 --> 00:43:11,810
correct and but this sometimes happens

00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:18,530
and then we have to throw us a real

00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:21,050
scale of the movie stars the maximum is

00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:26,440
done by update masters are actually

00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:30,770
listing tool or we call it um dl and

00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:34,970
yeah many i mentioned often but nobody

00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:38,510
know what we do in the federal

00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:42,560
infrastructure the martinez mounted like

00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:46,369
a sub seriously the packet machine when

00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:51,619
we get a message from the dorothy class

00:43:46,369 --> 00:43:54,410
we start crawling the master Merlin S

00:43:51,619 --> 00:43:57,440
you do a lot of starts again we check

00:43:54,410 --> 00:44:00,800
each see time of each director Lee to

00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:04,520
see if it has actually changed it has

00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:06,800
changed we go into the directory we r DX

00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:10,970
now Omega checksum invited to the

00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:13,640
database and its really highly

00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:16,790
inefficient at one point of time when we

00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:18,890
were waiting for a miracle to degenerate

00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:22,490
really fast because something had run I

00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:24,950
was looking into with x-rays and it does

00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:28,089
so many stops it's unbelievable and so

00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:34,010
this is a really literally rewritten and

00:44:28,089 --> 00:44:35,599
they exist in rewriting here but we can

00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:37,380
put it wet in production because we are

00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:39,690
frightened

00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:42,210
and this is inside the ring we kind of

00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:45,090
really test in staging because we never

00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:46,800
know then goes it will always seemed

00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:50,130
probably correct that we never know if

00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:53,730
it's actually collect and in the corner

00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:57,120
behind it is that you need to reload the

00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:59,340
information about all files which we are

00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:00,930
pushing out the murders will be able to

00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:04,370
redirect the newest to the files

00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:07,020
correctly and this information exists

00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:10,920
separately and writing some database

00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:15,000
like some everything in the fire yes it

00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:16,740
is a break and to go a little and this

00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,630
is also defined really need to be much

00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:21,060
more intelligent how we scan the master

00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:23,490
world and probably offer over the

00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:27,270
existing rules yeah I don't know how to

00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:29,640
interface how women are highly romantic

00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:32,880
or interfaces with the Masters to

00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:34,440
survive I guess NFS mounting us yes

00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,170
there so you could you read the files

00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:39,540
off of me

00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:42,630
another process which does that but it

00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:45,070
only takes one I also take to update

00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:47,350
they want one

00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:51,340
yeah you're going to do only changes so

00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:55,350
a lot of minutes to rescan the entire

00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:55,350
thing what are my changes

00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:59,460
we have this

00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:27,380
because the you will

00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:32,960
so I can actually read the other three

00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:36,410
part of the

00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,410
using the concern

00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:42,260
lines running some time

00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:45,410
whatever

00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:55,920
what

00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:55,920
this save some time

00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:17,109
meiosis I ha I see

00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:26,960
the dimension

00:47:28,609 --> 00:47:35,049
this

00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:42,319
oh really

00:47:35,049 --> 00:47:47,510
all of those is eliminates what a goon

00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:50,230
stats flown the server side every time I

00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:52,040
white connects again

00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:54,020
to see what

00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:59,160
basically

00:47:54,020 --> 00:48:03,180
intelligent still are saying on servers

00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:03,180
the entire final three

00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:12,790
basically the problem is we all are same

00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:15,550
writings on said it's completely

00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:19,599
possible out separately dinner and a

00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:23,040
lace and then have the quiet simply

00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:26,040
valuable back and super fans actually

00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:26,040
burn

00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:34,890
our time it takes something the server's

00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:37,530
learned it takes got four hours to just

00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:43,530
horsing open at the HIPAA violence to

00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:49,430
start country instead by students

00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:49,430
teaching about whole time and then

00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:03,950
all the edges and this is a shelter very

00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:06,720
easy importunate written z energy shell

00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:09,720
that I should be a real

00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:09,720
while

00:49:13,579 --> 00:49:22,470
so I the shelter it needs nothing but

00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:24,810
arcing and set it off it does everything

00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:28,010
up to and including the fourth

00:49:24,810 --> 00:49:30,420
except that I have an input I can call

00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:38,270
which there's a pull request for back

00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:38,270
end and yet so it aloud 'is see wild

00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:49,980
no it's fine i'll change the conversing

00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:54,390
will be violence and those require

00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:58,470
saturn the one zg5 loss after each a

00:49:54,390 --> 00:50:03,570
file server and you hold every ten

00:49:58,470 --> 00:50:07,290
minutes or what which means and he works

00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:10,590
for subsidiary mirrors as well so too

00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:13,050
dear wonder is hold dear Jim Garrison

00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:15,440
holds mac as long as though you're

00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:15,440
wondering

00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:36,290
laughter

00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:48,970
but running successfully for din

00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:52,130
I and I got freedom here

00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:55,839
on the whole I run a full wall was

00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:55,839
paralyzed all three nerve

00:50:56,410 --> 00:51:02,050
four seconds

00:50:58,870 --> 00:51:05,770
if I changes well maybe it's time you

00:51:02,050 --> 00:51:07,040
left so and i do have complete list of

00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:11,180
every dignus

00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:14,450
I thought including times i can send

00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:17,359
just the directories like

00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:21,270
in a whole file that I hope they are

00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:25,080
rendered useless right now listen Ethel

00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:28,290
the go-to stuff out use that but at that

00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:30,450
point you have a mirror once you

00:51:28,290 --> 00:51:34,660
conclude successfully detects in and

00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:36,620
stuff so everything is pretty much

00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:40,120
it's always good

00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:40,120
exactly so

00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:44,910
some download

00:52:01,350 --> 00:52:10,200
quiet quiet side my fault

00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:12,349
the zone you say back then take

00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:14,410
off

00:52:12,349 --> 00:52:14,410
Oh

00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:20,200
the what

00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:24,710
but I long enough

00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:36,790
like it

00:52:37,619 --> 00:52:46,150
our

00:52:39,759 --> 00:52:50,269
right now is because it has incurred

00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:55,539
knowledgeable and it has this concept of

00:52:50,269 --> 00:52:55,539
