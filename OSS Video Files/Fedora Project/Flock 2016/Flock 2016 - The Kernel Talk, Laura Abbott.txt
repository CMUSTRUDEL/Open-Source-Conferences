I hit record all right so thank you

00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,420
everyone for coming to the usual fedora

00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,670
Colonel tab for those who don't know me

00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,950
I'm Laura Abbott I'm one of the members

00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,030
of the fedora Colonel team the food or

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,090
chrome team is part of Fedora

00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:20,279
engineering managed by Paul fields at

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,750
Red Hat it is my full-time job to make

00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:27,480
the Fedora Colonel to be the best it can

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:29,099
be so a general overview about what's

00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,480
going to be talked about here we're

00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:33,450
going to talk about who's actually

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,130
working on fedora colonel things we've

00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,160
worked on last year things were going to

00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,329
work on last year pretty simple several

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,579
things you're ready to hear about are

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,140
pretty similar to what you heard in the

00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,690
door approach complete your talk this

00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,239
morning all the same things I wrote mine

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,920
independently just have another way you

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,809
also hear several themes come up a lot

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:57,030
especially in terms of getting new

00:00:51,809 --> 00:01:01,289
contributors so who actually makes the

00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:03,270
colonel happen lwn the linux news site

00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:05,189
likes to put out a report peach release

00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:08,490
about who is actually contributing to

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:10,409
the upstream colonel project these days

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,140
most of the contributors to the upstream

00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,869
colonel project are paid contributors by

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:18,270
companies there are still Akane full of

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:20,189
non-paid contributors or just hobbyist

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,020
contributors but by and large most

00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:24,840
contributors to the upstream projects

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:27,960
are paid maintain errs I'd say the

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,430
Fedora Colonel follows a similar path we

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,310
don't get a whole lot of general

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:34,320
community contributions we want to

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,150
change this but the type of

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,150
contributions we do tend to see from the

00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:41,220
community tends to be things like my

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,320
heart my laptop isn't working for the

00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,689
specific bang problems that are very

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,480
specifically focused on individual

00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:49,030
hardware

00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,860
this is value we always appreciate these

00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:52,960
contributions especially when they come

00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:55,480
with a specific problem in a specific

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,220
patch any time I don't have to go

00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,470
looking for have Shore some provides

00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:04,020
that or even just brings a problem to my

00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:07,350
attention that helps to overall make the

00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,350
process better

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,710
so again we encourage you to make

00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:19,050
contributions I can't guarantee that

00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:22,050
every contribution will be accepted but

00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:23,850
bringing a problem or learning to us is

00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,340
a good way to get it to our attention so

00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:27,750
we in fact no problem exists so on thank

00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,420
you to everyone who has contributed to

00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:33,930
the kernel as a community the community

00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:36,270
over the past year okay so who else is

00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:38,610
making the colonel happen we work with a

00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:40,770
lot of engineers who have specific focus

00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:42,900
areas the colonel is a big piece of

00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:44,520
software the number of people who are

00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,890
familiar with all of it can be counted

00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,330
on one hand if that especially in the

00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:50,840
kernel you end up with people who end up

00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:53,310
with the particular area of expertise

00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:56,580
they work on a lot so we work with a

00:02:53,310 --> 00:03:04,080
handful of groups on graphics graphics

00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:05,820
is a big area where we get help graphics

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,730
are one of the most common places where

00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:11,250
we see problems graphics is broken down

00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:15,990
by teams we have different teams working

00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:17,160
on the high 9 15 info etc the same

00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:19,530
people who work on the user space

00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:21,360
drivers also work on pearl drivers this

00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:22,920
is why if you report a crew graphics bug

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,480
you'll often see the component change of

00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,940
something that looks like it goes for

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,410
userspace components this isn't us

00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,060
trying to get rid of the bug or just

00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:32,490
automatically or not care about it it's

00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,200
because it helps us do the tracking so

00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:37,100
gay for the graphics team to help us

00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,100
make things better

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,280
the another area we get help with is

00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,740
input drivers this is especially cure

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,340
for things like laptops laptop seem to

00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:53,110
have different quirks each time

00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,640
different inputs keyboard mappings

00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:57,040
something that seems to be breaking and

00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,700
one of the reasons why we really rely on

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,930
other people to have who have the

00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,970
special acknowledge to help with us

00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:06,340
because they know exactly where to go

00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:08,230
looking for things as opposed to me for

00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:10,300
example trying to guess where things are

00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,980
supposed to go so especially with input

00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,540
drivers you generally get people know

00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,489
exactly what file have changed to match

00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:18,940
on a specific piece eid generally helps

00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:21,609
make things better architecture specific

00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:26,320
fixes the Vittra protein has to work

00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:28,630
mostly on x86 it's just on how our

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,310
support articles there are a handful of

00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:34,860
other teams who helped to support other

00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:38,980
Fedor architectures arm arms 54 powerpc

00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:41,110
s390 the people who work on those they

00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:43,450
do a great job of pulling the fixes and

00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:45,580
make sure those are validated so thank

00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:49,600
you to everyone from those who are also

00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:51,160
working with you are Colonel team so I

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,040
basically talked about everyone except

00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,990
the actual fedora colonel team to

00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,240
exactly is on the team so there's three

00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:01,870
of us this past year there's been Josh

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,070
Moyer Justin Forbes and and me so I

00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:05,320
talked a lot about what everyone else

00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:07,890
does so probably I think what the rest

00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:10,690
of us tend to do whether time is

00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:13,419
releases this included your daily

00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:16,330
rawhide updates stable updates three

00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:17,530
bases we take the release kernel that

00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:21,040
comes from upstream and make sure it

00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:23,650
actually gets out to fedora when I was

00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,700
working on my goals for this year it's

00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,380
been a long time trying to figure out

00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,540
exactly how to describe the process of

00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,860
doing the updates when I describe it

00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,840
doing the updates it sometimes sound

00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:34,450
like you could replace me with a CI box

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,850
and just didn't completely I think we've

00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:40,180
concluded if you can't quite do that yet

00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:41,979
and I think a lot of what we do with

00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:44,290
releases and what we try and do is

00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:48,130
really we're tracking everything both

00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:51,250
what's in the kernel and upstream the

00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:53,410
three of us on the team we try and stay

00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:55,510
active on reading LT ml noon was out

00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:57,760
there so the hope is is that well

00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:59,410
familiar enough with what's out there

00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,630
when bugs are reported that would be

00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:04,780
able to have an idea about hey I think I

00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:06,940
saw a catch to make this work or I think

00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:09,099
I saw change that might broken something

00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:12,849
like this so really we're trying to help

00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:14,860
them set the direction the Federal

00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:16,780
kernel is moving and we're always trying

00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,849
to listen to everyone as well to find

00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:22,180
out exactly what everyone else wants

00:06:18,849 --> 00:06:23,410
fedora barrel the list thing is

00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:25,599
important because we don't just want to

00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:26,830
make decisions in a vacuum we really

00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:29,950
want to be make sure is that the colonel

00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:31,570
is moving and solving the important the

00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:34,260
same important problems the overall

00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:34,260
Fedora project

00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:40,100
okay so that's everyone who does things

00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:43,550
so what exactly are we putting together

00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:46,160
um we the colonel is still just a single

00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:49,010
project single does not mean simple

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,660
though there are about 10,000 lines of

00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:52,520
configuration current configuration

00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,710
options sitting in the package get

00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,240
directory the kernel of spec file itself

00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:58,760
is about two thousand lines when you

00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,900
take out the change log so quite a

00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:03,890
behemoth that a little bit in teammate

00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:05,570
intimidating we happens at guess we

00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:07,280
sometimes get questions about why is

00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:09,140
there only one kernel why is there not

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:14,780
something like Colonel plow Colonel

00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:17,060
server Colonel IOT whatever and I think

00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:18,770
the lot of the answers is that the

00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:22,670
colonel is complexed enough as is we

00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:24,020
have enough time dealing with the

00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:28,400
support we have without trying to edit

00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:32,750
complexity for some architectures like

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:35,570
arm and and x86 that have 32-bit

00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:37,310
variants we do offer pae variants para

00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:39,980
pc as a couple of architecture options

00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:41,990
as well and those are contraptions that

00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:44,060
we have already add to the complexity so

00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:48,110
the small amount that we do have four

00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:50,450
factions packages on add stuff as well I

00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:53,210
would probably say that if the footwork

00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:55,810
council came to us tomorrow and said we

00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:58,940
really want to drive this idea of

00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:00,860
different kernel packages here's all the

00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:03,970
resources you need to make it happen we

00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:06,860
could do that but until that happens I

00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:09,830
we're just going to be working with a

00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:11,330
single unified colonel but even if we

00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:13,240
can't have different packages what we

00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:15,960
are dedicated to doing is

00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:19,990
trying to enable as many options as

00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:22,660
possible if you driver can be enabled as

00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:25,259
module we want to enable it we want to

00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:27,759
have it available for people to use

00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:29,889
obviously this we can't enable

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,110
everything all at once we are eventually

00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:33,520
going to have to make some trade-offs

00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:35,469
when that happens we're ultimately going

00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:38,979
to be looking for what direction is

00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:41,620
fedora moving and who is this overall

00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:43,839
going to be benefiting so again this is

00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,850
where we appreciate hearing input

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,560
without knowing what people want we

00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:51,279
won't have any idea how to make these

00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:53,860
decisions okay let's talk about some

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:56,140
numbers sometimes we've talked about

00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:57,640
bugzilla numbers for various reasons I

00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:59,380
don't like talking about bugs ill

00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:03,070
numbers I don't think they're a great

00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:04,300
reflection of what we do so what I'm

00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:07,959
going to talk about is some stats

00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:11,529
related to actual commits to the package

00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:15,160
git repository I ran some numbers for

00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:18,640
one year from July first 2015 to jun 30

00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:21,700
of 2016 this range was kind of chosen

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,320
someone accidentally I that was this was

00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:26,110
about the time period when I started

00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,640
working on the presentation but it turns

00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:30,730
out I think this was a nice snapshot

00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:32,620
that shows the above flow of Fedora

00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:35,529
releases and where we end up spending

00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:38,140
most of our time on definitely one who

00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:40,060
wins a gol partway through the period at

00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:42,649
point two who went yoel towards the end

00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:44,420
of the end of this period

00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:45,889
was released during the middle of the

00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,779
period after a four towards the end and

00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:53,119
we're a high given as usual rollin

00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:55,249
release so a wide variety of releases so

00:09:53,119 --> 00:09:57,829
the basic stats this is the number of

00:09:55,249 --> 00:10:00,199
actual individual commits we made to the

00:09:57,829 --> 00:10:03,800
various branches this is everything bug

00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:10,429
fixes updates oops I screw that up

00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:13,129
commit before we see and I say this does

00:10:10,429 --> 00:10:14,899
a nice job of showing that the activity

00:10:13,129 --> 00:10:16,519
really falls out ports eol you can

00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:20,240
definitely tell that afternoon one has

00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:23,749
fewer commits than anything else if you

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,459
notice that f24 there has a large pretty

00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:27,559
large number of commits as well that's

00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:30,079
because some of the time period include

00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:32,170
at a time before rawhide came out so

00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,579
this just serves to re-emphasize that

00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:36,589
today's rawhide is tomorrow stable

00:10:34,579 --> 00:10:40,129
release so testing and reporting on

00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:41,660
rawhide is to is very important done for

00:10:40,129 --> 00:10:45,009
those who knew test or a high degree

00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:45,009
Bibles thank you once again

00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,750
so I led a little bit I'm going to look

00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:52,300
at some bugs on numbers but in a

00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:53,680
slightly different way this is the

00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:57,280
number of commits that were actually

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,660
tagged with the bugzilla numbers um if

00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,940
you know this has a slightly different

00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:03,640
for a queen three ended up with the most

00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:05,980
books illa tags over the entire course

00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:08,230
period on I think this kind of matches

00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:10,660
with what we saw in the state of fedora

00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:13,960
this morning's that there's an adoption

00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:15,820
curve so f 23 was stable for the longest

00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,620
during this period so therefore it had

00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:20,800
the most users and therefore you going

00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:23,320
to get the most bugs if you notice some

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,080
there's there's definitely a fall off

00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,310
there were bugs on towards as releases

00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,790
got me a while we definitely don't see a

00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:33,460
lot of activity there I was on vacation

00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:34,780
the week before after he makes a vol

00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,880
when it came back there were no bug

00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:38,410
reports for f 22 which was a nice change

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:42,550
from the usual flood of stuff in my

00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:44,860
inbox you also note that rawhide it has

00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:47,770
a few were not customer bugs and I think

00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:50,260
um I tribute this to the fact that

00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:51,490
rawhide has a smaller user base and

00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:56,400
therefore you just get cure people

00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:58,870
recording bugs so this is the number of

00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:01,590
actual updates we did this includes

00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:05,320
major updates going from example for dot

00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:10,030
524 dot six also the state of updates so

00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:13,360
for got five dot 12 for that 552 um this

00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:16,990
is again shows the curve a fall-off you

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:19,980
have almost half of each of them and

00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:22,570
again that are effectively for includes

00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:24,160
some of the work for rawhide and as you

00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:25,920
can see rohi definitely keeps us a

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:30,000
pretty busy and

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,769
active for what we contribute I the e

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,459
well fall off I'd like to talk a little

00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:38,490
bit of what we did for f-22 um so part

00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:42,110
of his releases go towards eol we have

00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:44,430
to figure out the right balance of

00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:47,100
pushing a new kernel update versus

00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:50,490
staying in an older release so about the

00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:53,459
time that f-22 was headed towards tol a

00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:56,060
long-term stable colonel was released

00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:58,199
for dot for it this is a kernel that's

00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:00,990
aesthetical gets that hidden support and

00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:04,050
updates for a couple of years and we

00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:06,420
decided to keep up f-22 on this

00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:08,670
long-term update and honestly I think it

00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:10,320
worked out pretty well what we were

00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:12,600
finding is that it was taking longer and

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,420
longer for the updates actually hid

00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,880
enough karma ability to actually go out

00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:20,040
so instead of actually having to try and

00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,260
wait for karma for big update we just

00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:24,630
wait for a smaller update and therefore

00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:28,110
f-22 was able to remain the stability so

00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:30,329
I think I'm evaluating one to do the

00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:31,980
updates as far as things go pol this is

00:13:30,329 --> 00:13:33,240
something we're going to continue to do

00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:36,380
to look at when it's appropriate to

00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,380
rebase procedures kita

00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:43,350
so this is the kernel versions that were

00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:45,780
covered during this time period so if we

00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:49,320
take these numbers feed typical for a

00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:54,990
federal release then this means during

00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:58,110
the rough life cycle of a fedora fedora

00:13:54,990 --> 00:14:01,850
if you'll probably get about four or so

00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:04,800
major kernel updates or about a year

00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:07,620
this is not too surprising if you look

00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,480
at things go the upstream colonel will

00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:13,650
gets released in a very very regular

00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:17,160
basis about every 80 days we aim to get

00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:19,080
a new crew releases out on roughly by

00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:23,700
the second stable I think that comes out

00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:27,810
which means roughly two ish weeks so for

00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:31,170
example for duck 7 was released a week

00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:33,330
or two ago and I expect them as I want

00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:35,130
to get back from flock one of the things

00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:40,370
I might be working on is moving that

00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:42,330
into an update for a 24-23 etc etc so

00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:46,980
that's what we want to try and do and

00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:49,010
then rawhide the numbers still there so

00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:50,790
okay similar what I just talked about

00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:53,430
some of those already mention is that

00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:54,960
older releases have a fall off not

00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:57,570
surprisingly there are fewer people

00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:59,550
reporting bugs there and therefore we're

00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:03,990
going to spend a less time trying to get

00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:05,790
them updates it's also worth noting is

00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:08,430
that where we are pulling in bug fixes

00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:10,320
in addition to what's going to stable

00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:12,540
and I think this is a positive sign for

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,330
us is that we are trying to be proactive

00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:19,459
and not just rely vez de veau updates

00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:22,790
but also bring into whatever

00:15:19,459 --> 00:15:24,829
come in often times may mean is that the

00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:27,499
patches were bringing in may have a

00:15:24,829 --> 00:15:29,360
short life they may just get replaced by

00:15:27,499 --> 00:15:31,550
the next day well dig but the point is

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,189
is that we're trying to get the fixes in

00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:38,149
and new features in as soon as we can

00:15:34,189 --> 00:15:41,600
and out to people rawhide also keeps us

00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:42,980
pretty busy um I did the math and it

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,429
really is getting about one commits a

00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:47,899
working day on average this is think

00:15:46,429 --> 00:15:50,899
happens to be heaviest during that

00:15:47,899 --> 00:15:53,689
two-week urge window for Carl but that

00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:56,990
rawhide really is on a big portion of

00:15:53,689 --> 00:15:58,670
our work and finally on your lisa is

00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:01,220
going to get several different kernel

00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:04,040
versions during its life cycle Fedora is

00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:06,230
a fast-moving distribution and I think

00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,029
this is a real opportunity to get a

00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:10,220
chance to make sure fodor's working with

00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:12,709
some new hardware and also pecans to

00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:14,569
report more bugs so it has a plus and

00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:16,629
minuses but I think it's great to work

00:16:14,569 --> 00:16:16,629
with

00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:25,170
so what have we learned over this past

00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:27,630
year I think we've come to internalize

00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:31,860
some lessons first people don't like

00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:33,270
bugs this really sounds obvious people

00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:36,420
want their hardware to work and when it

00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:37,770
doesn't um they get grumpy I'm the same

00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:40,170
way when my herd where doesn't work I

00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:41,520
get pretty grumpy but I think we've

00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:46,140
discovered the only thing people hate

00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:47,790
more than bugs is surprised bugs when

00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:50,640
something needs to work and like didn't

00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:55,410
that then it stops working on it gets

00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:57,540
it's not a great experience um I think

00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:59,520
the situation we ran into with some of

00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:02,370
the dell XPS sound hardware is a good

00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:05,430
example of this so the software support

00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:09,930
for the dell XPS on hardware was on the

00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:12,110
bleeding edge and the most reliable ways

00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:14,610
we found to be able to work involved

00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:17,850
kind of a hack of the colonel config

00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:20,430
option that had some conflict with

00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:21,870
secure boot home we turned it on because

00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:24,480
we wanted to try and get the hardware

00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:26,520
working but then eventually I decided I

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,390
wanted to try and turn it off so that we

00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,830
could see if we can get it working

00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:31,440
properly make sure that we could

00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:33,720
actually support it properly um didn't

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,630
really were unhappy when I pushed the

00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:39,660
update and things broke and I think the

00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:41,610
biggest mistake here was not realized we

00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:43,950
do not realizing that people would be

00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:45,330
happy will not be happy by this and even

00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:46,560
if it's possible later fix it with

00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:50,940
another way the experience of having

00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:53,340
something break is really not great so

00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,980
planning is key and i'll be talking to

00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:59,540
on the future by what we're going to try

00:17:54,980 --> 00:18:03,169
events things like this so as far as

00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:06,440
where bugs are coming from most of them

00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:08,660
are coming from the upstream project not

00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,130
for fedora itself I'd say this is good

00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:13,600
because while we're not reading any bugs

00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:16,490
but bad because it also means is that

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:19,240
there's it's a lot harder to figure out

00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:21,320
where the bugs are trying to come from

00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:23,660
several million lines of code and

00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,679
through people plus whoever else all the

00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:28,220
other people i talked about who are

00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:29,990
contributing it's a lot to manage um we

00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:31,910
really try and report the bugs of stream

00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:34,160
where we can we encourage encourage you

00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:36,770
to report bugs up streams as well the

00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,020
process isn't perfect though sometimes

00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:40,309
we get bug reports that for various

00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:42,140
reasons we can't do anything with

00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:43,970
sometimes we report bugs to maintain

00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:46,460
errs upstream and maintainers don't

00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:48,020
respond and it really is frustrating

00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:50,299
just because I think one thing at least

00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:52,160
I realize is that I like fixing bugs I

00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:54,770
like being able to close bugs with a

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:57,260
patch because I know it's helping to

00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:59,750
overall my things better so the colonel

00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:01,040
it's a big project that we really try

00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:05,230
and do the best we can in terms of

00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:05,230
fixing bugs and getting things out there

00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:11,770
finally we did my friend get more people

00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:13,750
involved we'd love to see people who try

00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:16,360
and propose fixes that they either

00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:19,090
friend create themselves or poor have

00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:25,120
found the colonel is a project for

00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:26,770
everyone so there seems to be this myth

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,120
with a kernel that you have to be X

00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:30,130
amount of Austin before you can

00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:32,080
contribute infernal um this is really

00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:33,430
not true if you want to contribute to

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:37,300
the colonel you could have argument the

00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:39,460
awesomeness level again not every

00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,900
contribution will be accepted but we

00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:43,450
want this to be a place where you can

00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:45,310
learn and have a discussion about what

00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:47,140
you try and submit if you have any

00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:48,850
feedback about ways you can help make

00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:51,480
this better for you contribute on I'd

00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:51,480
love to hear it

00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:04,070
uh goals so this is some of the stuff

00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:05,690
that we had four goals for last year so

00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:08,330
last year we talked about doing some

00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:09,740
work on power management um I said out I

00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:12,200
did some work related to power

00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:14,120
management I produce some graphs but I

00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,400
think ultimately we concluded that just

00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:20,059
saying make power management better in

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:22,160
the carrel it's not a great goal it

00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:24,890
doesn't have a clear deadline and I

00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:26,150
think what we decided is that on we

00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:29,179
certainly care about power management

00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:30,940
but what we're looking for is problems

00:20:29,179 --> 00:20:32,900
that have been identified as being

00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:35,000
specific to the colonel on not say

00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:37,640
caused by this behaving users based

00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,020
processes and also ones that can

00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,480
actually be fixed without support from

00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:43,070
the hardware vendor just because

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:46,010
sometimes power management problems can

00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:48,799
be linked to hardware vendors having a

00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:50,059
specific magic bid or making choices in

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,640
there for more that we can't actually

00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:54,620
think so again we carry about power

00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,600
management but this is some going to be

00:20:54,620 --> 00:21:00,520
one of our top priorities is here unless

00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:03,950
we come up with a specific goal um

00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:06,320
automation and testing so this is really

00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:08,240
I think been a high point for us on a

00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,070
lot of this work has been done by Justin

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,559
Forbes one of the members of our team

00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:14,870
here um he's put in a lot of work to

00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:19,570
make sure we're getting a regular builds

00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:23,000
and every time we push a build we

00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:25,490
nominate said apprentice was running and

00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,049
he's also working on a regression test

00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:29,299
framework so I talked about how people

00:21:27,049 --> 00:21:31,520
don't like surprise bugs what are the

00:21:29,299 --> 00:21:34,360
areas where we can tend to hell up

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:37,340
supplies bugs is third party modules

00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:39,320
nvidia modules damn where these are

00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:40,590
modules we can't officially support but

00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:43,710
people still want to run them

00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:46,440
and inevitably when they break people

00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:47,940
come to us and then we have to have a

00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,529
Beckworth about saying that's a

00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:52,320
third-party module we don't support it

00:21:49,529 --> 00:21:53,880
and then close the dog and a lot of

00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,100
times people are even if we can't

00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,890
support it people are still not happy

00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:01,260
that something they were using broke so

00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:03,809
the hope is that we can create a

00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:07,830
dashboard and do preemptive testing

00:22:03,809 --> 00:22:09,840
about the third party modules so that

00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:12,120
people will be aware of what's going on

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,799
and for example if they see that the

00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,750
next kernel update is going to break

00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:17,340
their VirtualBox lovers they may decide

00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:19,559
to hold off on updating the colonel

00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:21,120
until that can be fixed and if perhaps

00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:22,470
even if they see that something's broken

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,539
that can report it to the actual

00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:27,419
third-party maintained errs and maybe

00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:29,940
even get it fixed faster so the hope is

00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:32,130
is that overall this gives more

00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:34,559
information out to everyone to be able

00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:36,149
to and improve their experience and

00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:40,909
improve our experience with book Zilla

00:22:36,149 --> 00:22:44,010
and again that's all on Justin and a

00:22:40,909 --> 00:22:46,049
upstream so we always have a goal about

00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:48,390
working with the upstream frontal

00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:50,760
community the colonel community is a

00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:52,770
very individual relationship based

00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:55,350
community you've had much more success

00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:57,649
in the colonel if people know who you

00:22:55,350 --> 00:23:00,029
are because you're doing a good work

00:22:57,649 --> 00:23:02,279
this applies even to people who are

00:23:00,029 --> 00:23:04,289
working at companies like red hat the

00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:05,970
maintainers say repeated these we don't

00:23:04,289 --> 00:23:08,610
care what company you work for we care

00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:10,529
who you are so it's really the Fedora

00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:12,630
projects best interest to have people

00:23:10,529 --> 00:23:15,419
who are actively involved in the kernel

00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:17,880
community contributing and I'd say on

00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:21,210
each of us on the team has our own areas

00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:23,520
we like to work at so I have a lot of

00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:24,330
areas on I work on a few things related

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,580
to harm and

00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:28,320
well sometimes pocket memory management

00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:30,149
sometimes do a little bit of security

00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,500
work if you're interested in any of

00:23:30,149 --> 00:23:32,399
these areas in flexion or more i'm

00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:37,110
having to talk to you about it

00:23:32,399 --> 00:23:38,429
afterwards or over here and the criminal

00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:40,860
community also really likes it when we

00:23:38,429 --> 00:23:43,769
can submit bug fixes and by section

00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:45,720
results upstream so this is why it's

00:23:43,769 --> 00:23:47,580
also in our interest to make sure

00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:50,669
everyone is reporting bugs where they

00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:52,080
can up spring it helps to overall grow

00:23:50,669 --> 00:23:55,500
everything up there in the connections

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,820
there this is a goal that's never

00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,380
actually going to be finished I don't

00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:01,380
think we're going to say we're done with

00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:04,440
upstream for this year yay but um it's

00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:06,389
important to describe why we think this

00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,279
is important to keep saying doing it

00:24:06,389 --> 00:24:09,510
every year and it's a whirl because we

00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:11,250
want to make sure that by working

00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:13,730
upstream or giving Fedora the best

00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,730
experience possible

00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:21,240
um so this is some stuff that may have

00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:23,850
been hotter last year and is maybe less

00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:26,190
so this year last year there was a lot

00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:29,820
of talk about 32-bit being able decline

00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:32,310
on and see this year this is still the

00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:33,540
case and even the general community

00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:36,600
there's been a little bit more

00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:38,250
discussion about 32-bit bugs and how to

00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:41,790
find a test them because fewer people

00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:43,230
are actually testing and finding them an

00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:45,120
example to highlight this is that

00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:47,820
earlier in the year there was an issue

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,920
where the 32-bit live CD wouldn't

00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:51,960
actually brewed up it was bouncing

00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:54,360
around between the colonel bootloaders

00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:57,540
it it was sort of stalled out for a long

00:24:54,360 --> 00:25:00,630
time and eventually we had a few members

00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:02,190
of the community step in to help to do

00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:04,500
some testing and bring it to resolution

00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:05,970
and I think this sort of goat this

00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:09,960
continues to go with their strategy in

00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:13,130
the kernel of keeping 32-bit issues low

00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:15,690
priority and letting the community on

00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:18,840
how about with it so if you care about

00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:20,580
32 the issues on please make sure your

00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,470
testing and reporting them directly up

00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:24,450
spring and letting us know when you find

00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:27,060
the bugs again if you find out if you

00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:28,740
have on if you if you found patches that

00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:31,200
fix your problem there's a really easy

00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:32,940
for us to turn in so again thank you to

00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,029
those who do try and keep here to get

00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:39,639
alive for doing

00:25:34,029 --> 00:25:43,210
ah butterfish so but if it seemed to be

00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:45,219
a really hot topic last year and this

00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:47,139
year not so much we haven't got a lot of

00:25:45,219 --> 00:25:48,940
questions about it um I'd say our

00:25:47,139 --> 00:25:53,379
opinions there are still the same as

00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:54,879
last year butterfish is a is a solid

00:25:53,379 --> 00:25:58,419
file system that is not the right

00:25:54,879 --> 00:25:59,710
default choice for fedora those who have

00:25:58,419 --> 00:26:02,889
done their own research can decide to

00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:04,179
use it for their file systems but we

00:26:02,889 --> 00:26:06,129
don't think it's the right choice right

00:26:04,179 --> 00:26:09,070
now on we continue to monitor the

00:26:06,129 --> 00:26:16,179
situation and if something changes we'd

00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:18,339
be happy to let you know um generally so

00:26:16,179 --> 00:26:20,919
for the question is why do we think it's

00:26:18,339 --> 00:26:22,979
not right choice it's they're still

00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:25,570
finding bugs that can possibly affect

00:26:22,979 --> 00:26:28,210
production servers I think and the real

00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:30,339
thing is is that for most federal users

00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:33,309
are individual users who don't have a

00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:35,609
lot of duplication where as being used

00:26:33,309 --> 00:26:38,200
as in big companies like say Facebook

00:26:35,609 --> 00:26:41,889
where they have a lot more support to be

00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:43,089
able to deal with I'd say what possible

00:26:41,889 --> 00:26:44,769
file system issues where as an

00:26:43,089 --> 00:26:47,049
individual user you may just end up

00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:49,659
being out of luck and you've lost your

00:26:47,049 --> 00:26:51,309
data so it's it's it's it's certainly an

00:26:49,659 --> 00:26:52,929
option but I think for the community

00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:55,409
fedoras gone for it's not the right

00:26:52,929 --> 00:26:55,409
choice right now

00:26:58,179 --> 00:27:01,080
I really was

00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:08,850
is so that

00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,920
is not going to do that anymore this

00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:15,890
past time last year he said he was

00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:15,890
telling us know and conversation

00:27:16,659 --> 00:27:22,039
for the recording or camera basically

00:27:20,179 --> 00:27:23,330
the butterfish containers have actually

00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:25,010
come back to us and they have actually

00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:27,830
said no please don't make it the default

00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:29,600
as well so that's a another contributing

00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:34,669
big contributing factor so for why it's

00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:37,270
not the equal okay so KD bus um okay so

00:27:34,669 --> 00:27:40,460
this is actually had some great

00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:45,500
relatively new updates but um Katie bus

00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:47,510
was an internal IPC mechanism trying to

00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:50,390
bring d bus vide bus protocol into the

00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:53,600
kernel um the developers pushed it and

00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:56,090
it was not very well received there was

00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,710
a lot of back and forth people concluded

00:27:56,090 --> 00:28:01,280
that there were some security and

00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:03,679
performance issues and ultimately the

00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:06,020
king gave us Philip errs decided to

00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:08,480
withdraw patches and we drop them from

00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:10,190
rawhide and then we basically didn't

00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:13,669
hear anything about it for a long time

00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:17,630
and then this past week there was

00:28:13,669 --> 00:28:18,890
planning for Colonel summit in November

00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:21,350
where all the kernel developers could to

00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:22,730
get there and then want the K deepest

00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:23,720
developers as it has announced that one

00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:26,299
have a discussion about their new

00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:29,659
project called bus one so they're

00:28:26,299 --> 00:28:31,549
clearly out there and being active but I

00:28:29,659 --> 00:28:33,289
think they're trying to do things a

00:28:31,549 --> 00:28:34,880
little bit more transparently and

00:28:33,289 --> 00:28:36,650
actually work with community to get

00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,850
things out there as far as what it means

00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:43,850
for fedora I think the plan is just to

00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:45,110
take a week see approach if they come to

00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:46,610
us and say if we'd like you to break

00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:48,799
this into rawhide like you did for Katie

00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:49,970
bestforecast a certain be willing to

00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:51,860
have a discussion about whether it's

00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:54,799
right but until now we're just going to

00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:56,919
keep them be active and review exactly

00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,919
what

00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:06,110
ok so that was last year's then what

00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:08,090
we're going to do this year as mentioned

00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:10,010
before one make sure we're having good

00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:12,200
surprise is not bad surprises huh we

00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:13,760
want to make sure that it's just it's

00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,280
great when you're so hard where work and

00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:18,190
less when your hardware doesn't work so

00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:20,360
again I talked about the third party

00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:22,130
module regression framework that's

00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,770
definitely on our goals we also want to

00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:26,030
try and increase the variety of hardware

00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:27,980
we're testing on to try and find bugs

00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:29,690
them hopefully we want to try and find

00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:33,230
bugs before all of you in community

00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:35,810
findings um we also want to try and

00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:39,620
increase our communication in kernel

00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:41,210
developers or work is very focused and a

00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:43,400
little bit more insular in nature

00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:45,500
everyone depends on the colonel on that

00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:47,480
the colonel is needed to run but because

00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:50,630
of our way things work is that we don't

00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:52,790
end up communicating with a lot of

00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:54,470
people it's very easy for us to get

00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:57,410
absorbed in our own world and not

00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:59,570
actually sure what we're doing so what

00:29:57,410 --> 00:30:01,460
we want to fix this we want to find new

00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:03,500
ways to be able to share what working on

00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:07,190
and why we're excited to be at kernel

00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:10,220
developers all of us have blogs some

00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:11,480
time to write about things um I my blog

00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:14,480
I write about something to really be

00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:16,340
fedora sometimes I just complain but

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,780
it's the real thing so that sometimes

00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:19,340
it's hard to know exactly what to write

00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:21,290
about so if you have things in the

00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:23,420
kernel you'd like to see please let us

00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:26,950
know and we can possibly turn it into

00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:26,950
something for that

00:30:28,169 --> 00:30:32,519
we'd also like to we're also important

00:30:31,019 --> 00:30:34,559
to try and work to improve that tooling

00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:36,570
so we're a small team of full time to

00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:40,139
kernel developers and a small team

00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:42,720
doesn't scale to a growing Kennedy but

00:30:40,139 --> 00:30:45,149
what does scale is better tools to be

00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:48,059
able to make dealing with cronies here a

00:30:45,149 --> 00:30:50,039
good example is a my by section as a

00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:52,230
bisection script so I've had a pet

00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:55,200
project about having a set of Python

00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:58,230
scripts to be able to make bisecting the

00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,239
colonel easier and the people that have

00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:02,009
used it have found it on really useful I

00:31:00,239 --> 00:31:04,649
gotta another one today with some

00:31:02,009 --> 00:31:06,570
feedback I need to look at but the point

00:31:04,649 --> 00:31:08,570
is is that this is on its tools that

00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:11,369
make it said that the community can

00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:12,960
solve their problems easier without

00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:18,269
having to do as much back and forth as

00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:20,399
us through bugzilla so this summer we

00:31:18,269 --> 00:31:22,619
had an internal 3d outreach program in

00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:24,929
the gal who's been working on trying to

00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:27,529
help improve some of the scripting that

00:31:24,929 --> 00:31:29,970
we've had floating around the script um

00:31:27,529 --> 00:31:31,559
he's been doing a great job and my hope

00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:33,659
is that by the end of the summer

00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:35,879
there'll be some scripts that will be

00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:39,570
useful for things like building the

00:31:35,879 --> 00:31:41,999
colonel and applying patches on none of

00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:43,649
this is saying is that we don't want you

00:31:41,999 --> 00:31:46,200
to interact with us but it's really just

00:31:43,649 --> 00:31:47,970
to help reduce the time to solve your

00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,799
problems and make it easier to reduce

00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:52,889
the back and forth and get to actually

00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:54,570
solve any issues and again if you have

00:31:52,889 --> 00:31:56,700
suggestions for toolings you could make

00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:59,269
your life easier for the colonel I'd

00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,269
love to hear it

00:32:00,029 --> 00:32:04,979
finally once again we really do want to

00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:07,169
get more people involved you heard me

00:32:04,979 --> 00:32:08,369
mention this several times by now but I

00:32:07,169 --> 00:32:09,539
really want to emphasize that just

00:32:08,369 --> 00:32:12,090
because the colonel gets a bad

00:32:09,539 --> 00:32:13,919
reputation for being difficult to work

00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:17,879
with and we really want to work to

00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:19,469
change that generally when you hear

00:32:17,879 --> 00:32:21,859
about the colonel is that you generally

00:32:19,469 --> 00:32:25,409
here upstream first upstream first and

00:32:21,859 --> 00:32:26,999
it's true we do want people to interact

00:32:25,409 --> 00:32:29,009
with the upstream but realistically the

00:32:26,999 --> 00:32:30,210
first experience most users are going to

00:32:29,009 --> 00:32:34,830
have with the colonel is probably going

00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:36,059
to be there distro so therefore we want

00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:40,919
to make sure we're having the right

00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:42,359
environment so we want to expand them

00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:44,369
what we've done for outreach e to help

00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:47,099
make it so that make it easier for

00:32:44,369 --> 00:32:48,710
easier for new contributors um so come

00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:50,700
try things out with us ask us questions

00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:55,950
we really want this to be a positive

00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:58,919
environment where you can learn and be

00:32:55,950 --> 00:33:02,399
able to grow your own knowledge and help

00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:05,070
help us as well again we are here for

00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:07,109
the further communicate yeah we are here

00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:11,039
to help the community so participation

00:33:07,109 --> 00:33:13,830
and helping you with part of our job see

00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:16,710
finally um that's a link on the fedora

00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:18,239
practically p for some more of our early

00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:22,169
goals and details if you have any more

00:33:18,239 --> 00:33:24,739
questions and i think that's it so

00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:24,739
questions

00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:33,330
yes so back in your side and they went

00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,330
through number it's

00:33:33,639 --> 00:33:37,450
over the course of that here you have a

00:33:35,109 --> 00:33:39,040
500 right yeah but i just wanted to

00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:41,770
point out

00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:44,580
it's to the door OH

00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:48,210
but actually each one of those commits

00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:51,350
represents a multitude

00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:51,350
so I want me

00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:55,330
right now the 14 Hertz windows open

00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:56,460
every single one of those commits came

00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:58,720
back to life

00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:02,919
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:05,470
it gives a little bit more impact

00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:07,299
exactly what those competitors and it

00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:10,260
goes down from there even some of the

00:34:07,299 --> 00:34:10,260
stable girl of these

00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:18,470
numbers seem small like why was the

00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:20,750
animal and handles them single is all

00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:26,179
but actually in reality are very large

00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:29,380
cheese it's good fun the questions yes

00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:29,380
yeah I thought

00:34:33,319 --> 00:34:38,980
who goes on a curl one of the things

00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:42,730
we were always told us for

00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:46,429
helpp even get into the photographer

00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:47,600
he's been holdin one release love

00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:49,190
stirring

00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,980
and so

00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:54,760
I sort of took that is don't bother us

00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:54,760
the Webster

00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:59,930
wait till it comes down story so that

00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:03,760
our way to it we know it's these going

00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:06,130
that's dirty then talk to them

00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,470
that was a long time ago he's going so

00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:11,020
okay yeah that's a good point and I

00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:14,730
think that's true that's what we want to

00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:16,600
happen but at the same time it can be

00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:19,120
the current community can be

00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:22,480
intimidating to work with so what I'd

00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:23,740
like to basically is that if there are

00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,770
problems if there are ways that we can

00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:28,120
make it easier for you to contribute

00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:29,500
upstream then we'd love to help with

00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:32,290
that and if that means occasionally

00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:33,730
looking at a patch then we can can see

00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:36,310
if that so basically we want to try and

00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:39,910
be the the resource to let you be able

00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:41,920
to get stuff on upstream um so it's

00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:46,000
basically we want to be the guiding hand

00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:49,520
and so it's the kinder gentler and then

00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:52,050
you said they wanted to be more

00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:54,000
what is the proper ways that up as a

00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:56,640
fork our mailing list it has really hit

00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,010
much discussion we convince the IRC

00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:03,180
Channel it's very little

00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:05,370
Richard occasional yeah so I mean either

00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:06,960
of those there's no reason why there

00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:09,210
can't be more discussion on those men

00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,040
honest I think or IRC I think it's safe

00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:12,720
and quiet because people haven't been

00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,820
participating there's no reason to say

00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:18,510
is that we can't have discussions there

00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:19,590
I think we might I think part of what

00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:21,480
I'd like to see happen is have some

00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:24,000
discussions there and then perhaps is

00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:25,770
that if it's to a point we could say

00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,200
okay this has been a good discussion now

00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:31,560
can be perhaps proposed this upstream so

00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:33,630
the idea is is that we can we can we can

00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:35,220
being incubator for ideas maybe for

00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:41,400
upstream and then but eventually be able

00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:43,830
to get them to from communities so past

00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:47,250
like I had done

00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:50,040
report monthly basis and that's fine

00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:52,830
took like dat applauded do together and

00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:54,840
exit out but there be no feedback right

00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:57,870
so like am I talking to myself on this

00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:59,670
mailing list so the mailing list itself

00:36:57,870 --> 00:37:02,400
is really hard to know whether people

00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:04,320
reading it that's true and I'm not

00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,910
asking playing people are fighting this

00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,470
is awesome things okay at the time but

00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:08,850
it's just good to know that it people

00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:10,770
thought I valuable and that's always

00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:13,350
something I mean everybody level to

00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:14,940
Colonel a little problem so that Janelle

00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:16,740
to know gates that change lot of

00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:18,750
adrenaline until something has gone

00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:21,240
wrong I tried saying it was the side of

00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:22,830
the paper I need to write those messages

00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:25,470
but I did not notice when I stopped

00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:27,970
exactly

00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:29,580
it also add as is that we say we want

00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:31,780
people to contribute i don't think we

00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:33,160
we're still working on figuring out ways

00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:35,230
to do this so if you have suggestions

00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:37,150
again we'd like to hear this but the

00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:39,580
point is is that we want to try and be

00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:41,050
we want to try to be interacting are not

00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:43,060
just be in our own little credit world

00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:45,330
shuttle up in a blanket having a lot

00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,330
pops

00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:52,820
laughter coming

00:37:59,589 --> 00:38:02,670
right that that

00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:10,920
bless your way than an engineer Mike it

00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:15,200
also it also means that

00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:15,200
he's invited playing

00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,880
that's a that's a really good point and

00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:22,309
this is I think one of the valuable

00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:25,160
things I've gotten that mentoring every

00:38:22,309 --> 00:38:26,750
cheese is that I figured out I have a

00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:29,930
better idea about how exactly helping

00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:31,460
you people get started and everything

00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:33,140
there and I think part of this is also

00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:35,930
figuring out what our tasks that are

00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:37,520
good for two peoples as well so but

00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:39,349
that's a good submission all I think

00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:44,650
I'll think if I can find some can be

00:38:39,349 --> 00:38:44,650
traumatic yes

00:38:45,739 --> 00:38:48,739
image

00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:54,299
Topsy

00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:58,010
some of the team

00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:01,030
No

00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:15,260
yeah so for a rawhide we do a snapshot

00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:17,510
which is where we take whatever is of

00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:20,270
the master at that time and then pull it

00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:22,220
in at as a patch and then rebase

00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:24,050
whatever else we're carrying on top of

00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:26,120
that you're stable updates again we're

00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:28,940
pulling in what comes in as a patch and

00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:31,030
bring that and is that and then it is

00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:34,880
that each Fedora commit is going to be

00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:37,310
correspond to a patch or get I'm sorry

00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:40,220
does that answer your question or like

00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:43,310
every ride every day prabhas little

00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:45,410
micro cleanings and then for like the

00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:47,579
stable releases you wait much longer

00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:50,090
write something in order

00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:54,800
horses by right now

00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:54,800
all these it's important

00:39:56,150 --> 00:40:02,580
the whole 47

00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:02,580
but why is like

00:40:02,789 --> 00:40:07,589
so these were what we have at least in

00:40:04,949 --> 00:40:10,709
our sources their family on the last

00:40:07,589 --> 00:40:12,979
stable update then Narcy patch and then

00:40:10,709 --> 00:40:17,609
a get packed on on top of that for

00:40:12,979 --> 00:40:20,519
rawhide and then for stable releases we

00:40:17,609 --> 00:40:23,009
have the release base for dot whatever

00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:25,769
Colonel and then the patch the Exile

00:40:23,009 --> 00:40:29,569
help that so you have your having a

00:40:25,769 --> 00:40:31,460
patch is coming into different parts so

00:40:29,569 --> 00:40:35,510
yep

00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:38,230
it certainly not based on how guys you

00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:41,030
work with the colonel fix my issue

00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:44,720
saying one of them i don't really do

00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:49,760
well I stay through the patch inspect

00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:52,700
build it and coaching wait our no

00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:55,580
machine is fast did install package

00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:58,550
which I know is dumb because there's a

00:40:55,580 --> 00:41:01,570
far easier way to do it but I don't want

00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:01,570
to get to the point where I

00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:07,540
boot I know there must be a simpler way

00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:09,130
to

00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:11,460
soft as otherwise you guys put in

00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:11,460
complaint

00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:17,380
but yet I don't want to go down to the

00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:20,460
raw girl service you know like dealing

00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:23,250
with the package desperation spec file

00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:26,040
so as far as what you're saying um yeah

00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:27,900
we do actually wait for at least on my

00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:29,670
machine why I'm doing local balance um I

00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:32,160
will be very patient and wait for it to

00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:33,720
build there's also there's no a fast

00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,650
build script which makes things a little

00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:39,599
bit better if you want to test things

00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:40,740
locally but but I think here that's a

00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,020
pretty specific emotion the more general

00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:46,140
question about what we do we've tried to

00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:48,810
keep the wiki wiki up to date with steps

00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:51,390
and things like that so if you take

00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:55,290
around a drawer project down Colonel

00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:59,940
there's the main page if you realize he

00:41:55,290 --> 00:42:02,099
sometimes learned it's sort of like okay

00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:04,339
there's wiki page but because we're

00:42:02,099 --> 00:42:04,339
certain

00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:11,850
helping

00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:18,640
ok Sokka motor joined us over a year ago

00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:20,380
her first tasks was it was mostly

00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:22,900
because I was the first really new

00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:25,720
person in a long time so therefore who

00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:29,190
were discovering exactly what actually

00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:33,250
was not documented so I tried to do that

00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:35,080
to keep the up to date I think most the

00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:36,460
steps right now or recently up to date

00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:38,800
if you find things that aren't there

00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:43,560
welcome to paid some discussion of the

00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:43,560
man unless you know write plugins

00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:48,410
ages

00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:52,750
how

00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:59,160
she's actually let's say it is awesome

00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,570
to this purpose that's like bad

00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:02,340
motivation there because what if you

00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:04,020
think like the other stuff looks cooler

00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:09,360
like you've got spider web that's

00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:12,570
awesome thank God so back to your point

00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:15,390
is there is no magical if you like the

00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:18,270
package management aspects of it that

00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:19,869
you have to leave their people like what

00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:21,999
I was doing wrong

00:43:19,869 --> 00:43:25,859
local marvel

00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:25,859
and it's a roughly 45

00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,140
there are faster ways

00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,240
then you're down

00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:41,530
it's all

00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:44,200
if you don't actually if you do make

00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:46,300
install a little i will do that for you

00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:48,690
if you have acted a bit offish there

00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:51,369
something you want Nora but then it

00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:53,320
spread is that the problem isn't going

00:43:51,369 --> 00:43:56,530
to manually clean them up right so

00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:58,750
because I'm doing a bystander's bisect

00:43:56,530 --> 00:44:00,640
you have to be with anybody and if it

00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:05,010
always for Laura scripts making

00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:05,010
something you don't but he saw the week

00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:16,450
yes certainly when people could be with

00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:18,370
by section I generally try and encourage

00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:20,350
them to figure out what are the last two

00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:21,670
built-in cookie that actually worked and

00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:23,440
then say okay once you have those two

00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:25,180
tags then you can start going down to

00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,510
the nitty-gritty and trying to figure

00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:27,510
things out

00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:37,069
tpain pearls

00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:37,069
the problem

00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:43,590
is there going

00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:43,590
it doesn't work

00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:56,700
any us

00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:03,610
sure mention file systems

00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:05,720
our business

00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:07,880
still nada yeah

00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:08,700
there are other paulo systems does

00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:10,609
anybody

00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:12,450
to see you there

00:45:10,609 --> 00:45:16,270
interesting

00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:19,620
inferred or not obviously somebody

00:45:16,270 --> 00:45:19,620
like to be cached god

00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:25,240
he keeps coming up with this thing and

00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:27,280
his benchmark numbers are neat but

00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:30,730
oh you know I don't even know how to

00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:33,220
test that yeah it's part of it as well

00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:36,070
this is that I don't think any of us

00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:38,080
really have done a lot of work what file

00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:39,880
system so therefore I think all this is

00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:42,340
on our radar but we don't know exactly

00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:43,810
we ever really thought to try and push

00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:46,060
for it or bring to our attention so

00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:47,650
again this may be a place where to start

00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:51,300
discussion on the mailing lists about

00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:56,010
exactly what you have to find I mean

00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:57,990
yeah qatar investment facebook

00:45:56,010 --> 00:46:00,960
wonderfest for data they always a word

00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:02,730
file system Sonia thanks so if you

00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:05,910
actually talk to some of the Red Hat

00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:09,300
files guys actually do that hot

00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:10,680
error yes if you talk to them they will

00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:12,840
tell you that in order to become

00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:14,470
production reading glasses it takes 10

00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:16,930
years ago

00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:22,210
so butter festival

00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:22,210
what happened yes but

00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:28,780
purpose intent was

00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:32,220
employees all of our members there's

00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:32,220
some guys masseuse and actually

00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:45,910
it is smart

00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:47,710
they turned off the TV okay so you can

00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:50,230
you can run you can do things like

00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:53,730
snapshots but it can't do like off like

00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:53,730
compression and you can't do

00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:59,130
could you otherwise you can do it in the

00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:03,780
door up but you're running businesses in

00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:06,450
pain so it's a little bit different

00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:08,849
world the interesting thing in my

00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:11,819
opinion is that whenever someone asks

00:47:08,849 --> 00:47:13,859
you why we are you Larry fest I always

00:47:11,819 --> 00:47:15,569
ask me why you want and they never

00:47:13,859 --> 00:47:18,210
actually talked about like the file

00:47:15,569 --> 00:47:19,890
systems itself they talked about wanting

00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:22,170

00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:29,580

00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:37,800
