hi guys welcome back in Ho Chi sell my

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,059
name is mike and who's not giving this

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,980
pack is because i want you to back on

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:18,630
Kojo young people to to do fun things

00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,270
with that I want people to make it do

00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,699
things that I haven't thought of so I'm

00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:27,689
going to talk about a couple different

00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:32,309
things that you might do that might be

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:34,829
considered hacking Koji there's a number

00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:43,440
of different places and ways you might

00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:47,000
do that a little about me I looking at

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:51,320
red hat since 2001 I started out doing

00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,680
QA for anaconda and the behavior release

00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:59,540
engineer foolishly and then rewrote the

00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:04,760
build system foolishly I guess and that

00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:08,770
eventually Koji on FS on my cam redhead

00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,770
on my chem so there I am

00:01:10,869 --> 00:01:17,380
koji raise your hand if you use Koji

00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:21,380
which is everybody in the room I figured

00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:23,030
so you know what koji is you may or may

00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:26,240
not know that other people sighs fedora

00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:29,619
use Koji let hat uses Koji let's have

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,119
used Koji before it was Koji and

00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:36,619
Santoshi's with Koji now not to build

00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:39,500
the course and fast yet but today to

00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:42,200
build the community build build the

00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:44,090
government opposite cost when it chooses

00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,399
that amazon used except there's actually

00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:50,929
a long list but i didn't want to get to

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:53,060
this with a slide so and that's and i

00:01:50,929 --> 00:01:56,329
don't even really know how people might

00:01:53,060 --> 00:02:01,280
be using it not telling telling me so

00:01:56,329 --> 00:02:02,569
why would you want to hack kochi i can

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,720
think of a lot of reasons and you can

00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:08,299
probably pick up more generally it boils

00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,450
down to you want poachy to do something

00:02:08,299 --> 00:02:11,239
that

00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:15,599
do or at least doesn't already do easily

00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:18,000
so that might mean you write some custom

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,099
scripts to run on your client I do this

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,310
all the time I have an entire directory

00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:25,680
full of one-off strips that i wrote to

00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:31,319
make how to do this one weird thing this

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:33,209
one time and that's that so maybe we're

00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,640
about to do that too on occasion so

00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:37,380
we'll talk about make money that

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,760
sometimes you want to do exactly that

00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,319
not so much you make coach you do

00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,480
something but to get code you to tell

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,690
you something to figure out what's in

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,420
the data there's a lot of data and Kochi

00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:52,470
it's been running built for almost 10

00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:56,519
years now Rock Nine and change into dora

00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:58,290
and so I mean you could get into the AP

00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:00,480
I am really pull some interesting data

00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,580
there that the web interfaces not going

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,710
to speak before you

00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:06,140
in order to do that it probably have to

00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:10,780
dive into the API or at least learn some

00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:10,780
of the more esoteric CLI commands

00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,910
interfacing with other tools and other

00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:18,920
infrastructure Fedora has done a lot of

00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:21,800
this you guys we have a talking to the

00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,690
on fed message we have it talking to

00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:26,810
other two door accruals very important

00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:29,330
stuff so some of you may well need to

00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:35,720
hack on code you to make it work with

00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:37,400
the next bit of fedora construction or

00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,630
you may just want to make code you do

00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,620
something with it believe it already

00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:46,690
does make it look differently there at

00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:50,480
wet cleaning and or out in the future so

00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:53,500
it's a lot of of ways you can approach

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,960
this so

00:03:53,500 --> 00:04:00,510
before we get into what you would do

00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:05,440
let's try to look at that big picture of

00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:07,780
what house ho Chi is structured I made

00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,390
this diagram a long time ago and then I

00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:12,820
realized that I don't think it ever I

00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:17,680
couldn't find it I think I've seen this

00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:19,019
Tiger anvil but I cannot I don't

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,660
understand how

00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:23,129
with the docks but at some point it was

00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,659
in a document and I think I just fell

00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:32,580
out and I thought we made it last night

00:04:26,659 --> 00:04:35,639
man I wasted an hour and eat save but

00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:38,400
you know the kid making ten come here

00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:42,150
where Koji is pretty much everything

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,430
happens about all right the habit is the

00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:46,319
thing in the middle that for the most

00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:48,419
part of dollars of access all the data

00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,680
if you don't talk to their database you

00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:51,060
don't talk to the file system for the

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,180
most part you talk to the hub and it

00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:56,789
does a story now it all the pieces of

00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:59,009
code you do that web UI is Jeff

00:04:56,789 --> 00:05:01,710
application uses the weapon uses the hub

00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:03,990
to do things command-line interface it

00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:06,870
just stop stop the builders they just

00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:09,960
talk about your acceptance of blue

00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:12,259
you're a little cheating we're gonna

00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,259
cheat

00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:18,470
Kira no leaders I have to talk to the

00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:21,390
file system in order to run great retail

00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:25,240
I hadn't counted

00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:30,250
to have that work without having it

00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:31,780
mounted read-only and kajira I can

00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:35,590
probably fix that at some point but

00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:39,490
right now kajira actually does the does

00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:40,990
the repo deletions itself but that's

00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:47,799
about it that's little blue arrow is

00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:50,779
cheating so

00:05:47,799 --> 00:05:53,529
most of the places you would hack

00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:53,529
coaching would be

00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:00,830
writing your own thing and talk to how

00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:03,530
to make you do things maybe writing some

00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:05,780
plugins to the hub or the builders or

00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:08,110
maybe writing a new tool which fits in

00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,110
this diagram

00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,830
I will not about fewer odd things about

00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:18,040
command line a couple of these are

00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:19,630
definitely an OG territory and one of

00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,660
them is maybe not but it's a really cool

00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:25,030
command line with coach minute I don't

00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,290
think people know about and it's nice

00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:34,420
you're going to hack on Koji to know

00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:36,400
about it so so first of all if you don't

00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:38,490
know how to commit all the commands that

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,670
cody has and there are a lot of them

00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:45,880
coach enough will list them all I'm just

00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:47,110
gonna talk about a couple and this is

00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:51,580
the room it's not really hacking

00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:54,670
coaching but it's a real Swiss Army

00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:59,860
knife for me I use it all the time and I

00:06:54,670 --> 00:07:02,229
don't know about it koji list history so

00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:05,379
most every bit of data in kochi not all

00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:07,030
of it is this version they all have the

00:07:05,379 --> 00:07:10,539
vent I to use and every time you make a

00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:12,639
change like you tag a bill you don't you

00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:14,169
don't lose the knowledge of that build

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,849
one sad that tag it's still there you

00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:21,039
know so cookie you can tell you it's

00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:23,860
particular with things like hang tag tag

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:28,569
data or information about tags and

00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:31,719
everyone and battle its history this is

00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:36,250
just one example just look just I did a

00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:39,580
list history of the package Koji after

00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:43,199
the past couple weeks and you can see

00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:48,400
our activity or that coaching packaged

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:52,500
in a few days if without that that back

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:57,340
after an argument you get a very long

00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:58,629
stream I don't have time to go into a

00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:03,180
pair were different options that this

00:07:58,629 --> 00:08:03,180
has think

00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,890
there's a lot

00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:27,570
and for the most part it will each of

00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:30,330
these options sort of automatically

00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:32,610
limits the query to the appropriate sort

00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:34,410
of data so if you put dash dash user

00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:39,000
it's only been a flurry tables that have

00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:41,760
a user field etc to them anyway like I

00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,830
said not really happy on Koji red it's a

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,830
really useful tool and if ya

00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:59,470
at-bat

00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:02,310
hello haha which I'm a fan

00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,310
I'm not sure if I

00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:13,360
action in Tampa

00:09:08,769 --> 00:09:15,649
I don't have it I was just take a look

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:19,339
yeah

00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:22,100
I don't know why I was like it like it

00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:24,920
very quick on my laptop

00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:27,069
why because I've never used it so it's

00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,069
not

00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:36,279
yeah yeah

00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,279
dirty and have you in there

00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,820
I should not make sure that's up today

00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:53,480
let's see so I the another interesting

00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:55,340
little thing that people don't know

00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:58,480
about man line is that you can do direct

00:09:55,340 --> 00:10:03,760
RPC calls straight from the command line

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:07,130
so this is a simple one if you wanted to

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:10,730
see the wall on data or the package oh

00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:15,440
gee Patrick Cote Union season doesn't

00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:17,960
show much take an ID but picture now

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:21,170
that we have the IED number instead of

00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:24,389
just name for that a pitcher do more

00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:33,870
complicated query

00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:37,230
Carla's Lewis and Fisher it's making a

00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:37,230
cocktail olive

00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:42,130
shut up syntax doesn't really lend

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:45,310
itself to data structures so I I just

00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:45,310
fall into

00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:53,310
on which you have to be clever about

00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:55,470
putting that you can do it so listing

00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:57,870
all builds package ID 1181 will just go

00:10:55,470 --> 00:11:02,130
gee I put a limit of one just to get

00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:05,519
this problem otherwise it'd be it's very

00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:08,279
proposed but if you don't like to

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,920
explore the API which is that playing

00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:13,920
with the API your viruses it you may

00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:16,050
sometimes want to just run a realm or

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,680
rummage real quick just to see what they

00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:22,920
do just to see the raw data because the

00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:24,899
corresponding command line doesn't who I

00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:28,490
do what you want to order sepehr always

00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:33,300
hiding some little more detail from you

00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:35,550
and also the command line

00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:39,720
I actually missed the API for you on an

00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:42,510
abbreviated I just read one entry in

00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,760
there but if you run code juleps API

00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:49,220
over the whole the whole very long list

00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:53,450
of RPC calls and that's just one it's a

00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:53,450
dynamically generated introspectively

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,209
just a few notes about command line

00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:59,209
approach attackers

00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:04,449
let's get moving hi vomit because the

00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:08,079
most part is gonna happen koji you're

00:12:04,449 --> 00:12:11,230
probably going to do it in Python I hope

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:16,269
that's not that I respect very very

00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:18,310
simple example coaching provides of the

00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:23,680
PO Chi library and it makes it pretty

00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:28,690
easy just kochi you better put you need

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:30,430
to create a client session object give

00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:34,149
it the oil serve you talking to i'm

00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:37,620
using fedora one here but you need to be

00:12:34,149 --> 00:12:41,790
a different URLs for different servers

00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:41,790
I'm not do enough indication here

00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:48,570
another talk about wrapping is talk but

00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:55,290
you can see how authentication is done

00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:58,970
by by diving into the Koji client so

00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:58,970
just a super a little

00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:05,810
get the package so we get the ID and

00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:10,520
then get all the villains basically what

00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:12,740
we did in the last and last example

00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:16,310
let's go get violent it's a lot of us

00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:18,430
are doing Python in the shell and print

00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,430
that

00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:26,990
the PRI with other languages so true

00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:31,720
answer us 6x Marcus E so if you can do x

00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:31,720
mark recede and you can just do that

00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:38,680
more examples for more examples he

00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:42,070
allergic point there

00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:46,570
examples that miserable but there's no

00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:48,610
magic any much Lakota tools they pretty

00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:50,380
much just talked to the husband's that

00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:53,279
will do this so if you want to know how

00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:55,390
the coaching client does something just

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:58,360
go have a look that's probably just a

00:13:55,390 --> 00:14:00,430
couple couple hours he calls a water

00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,200
look a lot of defying commands are

00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:05,230
relatively thin wrappers around it

00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:07,529
around on all the c-collar too so he

00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:07,529
obviously

00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:13,649
that's pretty stable yeah until please

00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:16,370
Beckett which will have to do at some

00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:18,820
point because it

00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:24,740
we have not seriously repping the API

00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:27,459
yet added a lot to it but

00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,459
hold on our way

00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:38,370
so other languages it is j excellency we

00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:42,030
do use a note extension which is the

00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:44,730
most standard extension to X Marcus E

00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:47,820
and that just is a new data type of nil

00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:51,060
or no or whatever which is really

00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:52,860
missing especially if you're going to

00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:57,240
use a language like Python when nuns

00:14:52,860 --> 00:15:00,120
abound everywhere you really it's a lot

00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:02,360
easier to have no objection so we use

00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,360
that

00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:07,320
if you're doing it if you're doing this

00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:09,000
with other languages the no extension

00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,950
may give you trouble there's a number of

00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,930
excellent c libraries that don't

00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:17,250
understand it so make sure you have an

00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:19,260
excellent c library that does or if not

00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:25,650
be very careful that you don't make any

00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:29,960
calls that returning knowles one really

00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:32,240
nice thing you can do we're from

00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:35,170
landline is using the bug excellency

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:39,530
option which will cause it to output the

00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:42,230
law debug data for every artists e

00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:44,000
connection that it makes which is really

00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:45,260
handy if you're really trying to see the

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,040
guts of how could she is doing something

00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:48,040
so um Emily

00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:58,699
as a relatively high polish example this

00:15:55,069 --> 00:16:01,419
is making this is using the artsy API

00:15:58,699 --> 00:16:01,419
with curl

00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:08,470
just put a bunch of put the XML request

00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:10,660
in the file and passive coaching with

00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:14,940
curl and I would have the output there

00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:14,940
but it's wow it's really verbose

00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:21,610
however figure out how to do that

00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:40,379
so

00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:53,189
that will be the three output by add DMX

00:16:48,579 --> 00:16:53,189
want to see xml-rpc

00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:06,910
so you can see it posting the same thing

00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:11,850
that we passed into curl and getting

00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:15,150
this ugly xml it's not a concise

00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:15,150
serialization language

00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:31,390
that thing's is another way that you

00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:33,370
might

00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:36,130
head around scheduling ideas and stuff

00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:39,880
if you you guys have used the doors Koji

00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:44,910
that is themed it is the Fedora kochi

00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:49,330
does not look like the default thing so

00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:58,200
wake utilities are override all sad

00:17:49,330 --> 00:18:00,910
images and the CSS and can add extra

00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,530
extra inserts into the navigate

00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:04,360
navigational are at the top and footer

00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:06,850
at the bottom and with that you can

00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:12,520
actually do a lot especially if you put

00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:15,790
some javascript in that matter so and

00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:18,130
all you have to do is once you put that

00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:19,930
content under the themes directory

00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:21,490
you just set cogic being equals whatever

00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:23,610
you call it and boom it's going to use

00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:26,260
that you don't have to copy everything

00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:28,630
koji looks into the fall static

00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:30,490
directory first for everything that's

00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:32,620
looking for if it doesn't find it only

00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:35,230
then does it looking it looks in the

00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:36,520
theme first if one is set and if it

00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:38,820
doesn't find it falls back to the

00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:41,230
original static so if you just want to

00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:43,420
override the CSS you can make a

00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:46,330
directory with only kochi dot CSS in it

00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:49,150
and that will work just fine or if you

00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:52,090
just want to change the icon at top

00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:54,790
right corner just making sure it's the

00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:57,100
same size unless you also changed see it

00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:59,770
unless you also change the CSS that you

00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:02,170
can do stuff like that so this is pretty

00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:04,510
easy Jim doesn't require any coding

00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:10,200
really unless you do javascript in your

00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:10,200
Twitter and and

00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:14,520
you guys seen

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:30,029
I mean this is an unseen Koji instance

00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:32,749
on my laptop not nearly as pretty as the

00:19:30,029 --> 00:19:32,749
one you're used to sit

00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:48,519
but policy

00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:53,409
those are you familiar with a policy yes

00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:55,659
all right so policy is a way that you

00:19:53,409 --> 00:19:58,210
can configure the hard to control and

00:19:55,659 --> 00:20:04,230
coaches behavior in a number of

00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:10,360
different ways it's a very simplistic

00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:11,919
configuration language not vaguely it

00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:15,279
looks vaguely shallots but it's really

00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,360
much dumber than that but you took with

00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:19,899
that you can do a number of things by

00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:22,779
controlling you can tag we're set some

00:20:19,899 --> 00:20:25,659
fairly complex rules for that so if you

00:20:22,779 --> 00:20:27,130
if you want only this small group of

00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:28,450
people to be able to track this

00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:31,750
particular package and these particular

00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:36,820
tags with matching rules you can set up

00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:39,279
accident it does that you can control we

00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:41,620
can manipulate package lists normally

00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:43,659
that if most of these policies have the

00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:47,630
false the default actual policy is only

00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:49,700
admins can do it but you can change that

00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:52,250
there's camel policy that determines

00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:55,430
what channel tasks go into which is very

00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:58,640
useful if you want to make sure that

00:20:55,430 --> 00:21:06,290
only the surpassed only land on to the

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:08,590
others and it might be helpful to see an

00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:08,590
example

00:21:11,879 --> 00:21:18,569
so there's actually i think the

00:21:14,129 --> 00:21:21,610
documentation there's actually naturally

00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:25,679
back on this that goes over the

00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:25,679
the different policies and

00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:40,020
that that that legible yet

00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:54,530
so here there is a simple various takagi

00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:59,080
policy kind of it's a little bit strict

00:21:54,530 --> 00:22:01,850
but the default ragging policy is

00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:04,430
there's no restrictions apart from the

00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:07,640
tag permission settings that are really

00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:10,390
separate from this but the here is a

00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:14,600
policy that says that admins can

00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:16,250
advocate tag and how people can tag in a

00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:20,240
candidate and other than that no you

00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:23,120
can't which is very strict but maybe

00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:26,630
somebody wants that somewhere maybe you

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:30,500
have maybe you have a system where your

00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:32,930
regular users can only tap put bills

00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:34,610
into Canada tags and you have another

00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:37,100
process that will move them out of

00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:38,810
Canada tags after some verification so

00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:41,440
you could enforce that very strictly if

00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:41,440
you want to work

00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:52,340
it is finding more complicated ones so

00:22:50,629 --> 00:22:56,200
you

00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:56,200
this one rocks

00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:04,769
prevents tagging I thought things were

00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:07,199
built in the epic tag anywhere else so

00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:10,109
if you want to say people that builds

00:23:07,199 --> 00:23:13,349
isolated from the rest of your approach

00:23:10,109 --> 00:23:15,470
instance and lock them into their own

00:23:13,349 --> 00:23:19,549
tax

00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:24,020
musta like this now is this hacking well

00:23:19,549 --> 00:23:26,929
maybe because you can really really

00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:35,320
control it find rain what cookies doing

00:23:26,929 --> 00:23:39,080
here baby ah so you can add new tests

00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:41,270
with plenty with huh plugins so and when

00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:43,549
you start doing that then you can really

00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:44,929
start control what happened so if you

00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:48,460
could if you don't like the built-in

00:23:44,929 --> 00:23:48,460
tests you can add your own

00:23:51,549 --> 00:23:57,629
and just as an example of black waters

00:23:55,149 --> 00:23:57,629
running with

00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:04,310
the door just has

00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:09,490
relatively short policy

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:19,059
it's going to see the format each each

00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:23,950
the thorns of match lines each match

00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:26,830
ruler has as an a

00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:30,919
arguments and the double ampersand

00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:35,710
separation full of means and an but

00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:39,889
and Colin Colin it gets you to the

00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:43,190
result of some policy and it just first

00:24:39,889 --> 00:24:45,609
match wins again very simplistic but you

00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,609
can do a lot with

00:24:54,520 --> 00:25:04,720
on to harper games since I mentioned in

00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:06,250
the last slide across programs the easy

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,070
the easiest things to do with how

00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:12,610
problems are it will use the things that

00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:17,730
we really desire put clips in to the

00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:22,270
code for you to do our a div icons or

00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:25,750
adding policy tests or look into the

00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:28,170
combat system in protein and there are a

00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:28,170
number of examples

00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,420
ha plugins in the coach code

00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:50,700
it was a

00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:50,700
more about hello world version

00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:06,570
so this is

00:26:00,909 --> 00:26:10,269
really just a plug-in that puts into I

00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:12,070
hope I box there's some decorators for

00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:17,080
doing that that are finding the plug-in

00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:20,460
module and all it does is log every

00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,460
callback that it would cease

00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:24,710
which is this is pretty much how their

00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,030
message bus program works too except

00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:31,400
instead of logging in its that Saddam

00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:34,600
phonetic bus with a little bit more than

00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,600
that but basically it

00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:50,120
message their forces I'm same way except

00:26:47,929 --> 00:26:53,559
grizzle it's more cut you gotta manage

00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,559
connection in your timeouts

00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:58,440
down to the

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,460
that so this says it hooks into the car

00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,850
mats the same way except it limited only

00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:20,399
to the ones that saw a post and pretty

00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:23,240
much just takes my data call back and

00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,240
puts it on a message bus

00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:40,440
so writing plugins can be tricky because

00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:43,059
it delves into the internals of Koji but

00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:46,090
the code is not that bad to read

00:27:43,059 --> 00:27:48,940
I think it's once you figure out where

00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:50,379
to get started and again there are

00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,970
examples so if you feel the need to

00:27:50,379 --> 00:27:56,019
write a plug-in and there's lots of the

00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:58,929
reasons do you know some examples maybe

00:27:56,019 --> 00:28:02,200
ping us on cogida vettel it's totally

00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:09,490
doable you can do a lot better plugins

00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:14,980
are maybe the less there are less things

00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:17,919
that we have specific hopes for plugins

00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:19,539
to use the easiest thing to do with

00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:24,119
builder plugin is adding task handlers

00:28:19,539 --> 00:28:26,919
which is granted terribly useful so the

00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:30,789
example that we have in Dakota code

00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:34,480
itself is the grunt plugin that was

00:28:30,789 --> 00:28:39,210
added recently for the compostable to

00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:39,210
use for the five and

00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:49,110
that's actually

00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:02,830
I chose set up but

00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:12,090
carini the 30 human dress looks for

00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:14,700
subclass of base task handler when it

00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:17,160
loads the plugin so if you saw class it

00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:19,530
then you just create a task handler

00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:21,830
that's you don't have to decorate or

00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:21,830
anything

00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:28,740
see examples of TAS gamblers just put

00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,740
edginess its hold on

00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:39,660
and

00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:41,910
aye sir I think I've been mostly

00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:45,170
progressing in levels of complexity

00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:50,070
through heroes things you might do the

00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:51,540
that you get to the end and you can't

00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:52,830
make code you do what you want you

00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:54,450
really know that those we're talking

00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:58,280
about at that point you've just got to

00:29:54,450 --> 00:30:02,180
change the code which you can hardly do

00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:02,180
it lives in the girl

00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:11,400
check it out make changes I took to use

00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:14,309
the make targets I've got here you will

00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:19,470
have to commit locally first because it

00:30:14,309 --> 00:30:23,250
uses get archived in the makefile to do

00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:25,590
the bill there's a test sr p.m. for real

00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:28,169
quick ease that we used to directory but

00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:33,210
i managed to get mom's latest commit

00:30:28,169 --> 00:30:35,450
right so just make dress RPM and be what

00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:35,450
you will

00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:43,970
this you may change this cookie and you

00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:48,020
feel like you would like to share them

00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:52,430
with the world we're out there as I said

00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:55,280
we're on figure we take the requests if

00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:56,930
you're working on a really big feature

00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,520
you might want to talk to us on oh gee

00:30:56,930 --> 00:31:08,890
today before you spend a lot of time on

00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:08,890
it and okay so

00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:17,010
a little quicker than I accept so let me

00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:20,480
see if there are questions if not I can

00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:20,480
i yeah

00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,940
on one yeah

00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:35,710
doctor

00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:35,710
a puppet show

00:31:36,169 --> 00:31:40,720
oh so very

00:31:45,850 --> 00:32:03,470
ok so this 42 thing with the family

00:31:55,149 --> 00:32:07,900
controller which John A cero okay well

00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:16,000
as a day other than six

00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:18,130
I so I I never I never use country

00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,160
doctor I just I just installed on my

00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:20,160
laptop

00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:31,130
I think our use case but I think Lynne's

00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:33,340
nada is a bit much to block at face

00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:36,360
value it

00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:36,360
edge and hopefully

00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:46,050
the other the only hard part about

00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:48,750
installing for me really is getting the

00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:52,640
got a damn circus setup if you want to

00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:52,640
use turn off what you do

00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:12,560
yeah zero

00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:19,400
oh [ __ ] nothing

00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:35,530
right well it depends on eros background

00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:37,570
too right if you're if you're familiar

00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:39,820
with getting perspex up and running if

00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:41,230
you're familiar with using with setting

00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:44,110
up surfs you're going to have a big

00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:46,300
advantage as a lot of folks and my

00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:49,070
question is is like if those are things

00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:53,440
you're not doing

00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:53,440
add some too

00:33:53,730 --> 00:34:07,540
or as being you're right is there a

00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:13,200
quick waiting for death so the equipment

00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:15,820
from you is is just just run it yeah I

00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:18,910
thought people a successful country dojo

00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:19,580
so tired it's not working I would get a

00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:28,040
guardian

00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:29,780
just a weird yeah I think yeah I think I

00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:33,820
think what needs to happen is one we gon

00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:38,470
fix that dog does that doc is

00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:41,380
technically complete but maybe not

00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:43,610
Elliot quick subsection look like or

00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:45,560
proprietary dad don't need a

00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:48,299
subscription like you know what these

00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:51,549
small sets that

00:34:48,299 --> 00:34:53,800
yeah because only husband were you I

00:34:51,549 --> 00:34:56,260
mean

00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:58,920
I don't care all sides I actually

00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,920
together

00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:02,829
nothing if you don't

00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:10,270
yeah so if you want the committee don't

00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:13,000
you certs use counsel at all I me I

00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:15,730
would never recommend you use password

00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,560
off anything remotely close production

00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:19,840
priority because the password off and

00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:22,240
Koji is not good it was really just a

00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:27,850
debug step on the way on the way

00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:31,720
development but but it's there and and

00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:34,510
and normally what what I do when I'm

00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:37,810
setting that first time is I set up I

00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:40,090
set up the password off first or a

00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:42,820
little bit and I don't worry about off

00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:45,610
at first right so get it running make

00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:47,500
sure that I can hit the horrible with

00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:48,880
Merrill just run a bunch of Koji bash

00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:50,770
chestno off commands or run code you

00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:53,560
commands that that don't need off like

00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:56,020
most of the read-only commands just

00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:58,900
don't even try to authenticate if you

00:35:56,020 --> 00:36:00,970
can get that working then you know where

00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:02,740
you know you're mostly there it's just

00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:08,680
adding off on the end which can be a

00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:10,370
pain I know so sorry that's not

00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:13,240
another

00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:13,240
did ya

00:36:15,489 --> 00:36:20,680
you are saying is

00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:20,680
there is no

00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,430
and you already

00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:30,000
of this and then your eyes

00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:32,810
let us be merry

00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,810
because our

00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,290
is tangled in

00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:40,290
yo

00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:46,910
and so

00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:52,609
yeah but it's just like you

00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:54,770
just like a few days to 7 8 9 95 plus

00:36:52,609 --> 00:36:56,660
percent of potential developers of the

00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:59,730
web it hard love now Matthew of that

00:36:56,660 --> 00:37:02,910
because many ex-wives do

00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:05,070
on I be just like dr. pol or bigger up a

00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:06,650
valve environment they're not saying is

00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:09,690
like those

00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:11,880
production deployment they can what I

00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:15,630
work before doing that but do something

00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:18,180
that's low very very happy and does

00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:22,510
eluded my question look at me and also i

00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:24,850
think is very able through the very tail

00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:27,710
she was the way you would

00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:31,300
would what come again

00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:31,300
what may another way

00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:45,150
play a Vanessa what up and where

00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:49,130
r

00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,010
by the

00:37:55,369 --> 00:37:59,650
um

00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:59,650
uh

00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:04,690
few more minutes actually so other

00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:08,320
questions or is there anything you'd

00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:10,000
like me to demo be happy to that a lot

00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,100
crazy isn't sitting right here we can do

00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:17,980
whatever we want to it he can abuse my

00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:24,250
laptop why the name select molarity why

00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:30,040
not diesel jo sang wasn't the rover

00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:33,119
started in 2005 where there have been

00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:37,240
thoughts yes they have them thoughts I

00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:39,100
was last year III was proposing a number

00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:42,520
of things I wanted to do for for Koji

00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:43,810
that are very big and invasive and and I

00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:48,940
definitely want to go through a JSON

00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:54,280
based on bc i'm not sure how fast we

00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:59,260
could reasonably draw ex Markie see Miss

00:38:54,280 --> 00:39:01,540
Rowley for you know 04 04 entrenched

00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:04,380
Cody deployments set prominent North

00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,380
America Linux vendors

00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:13,240
firm-level just

00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:13,240
I certain businesses

00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:30,430
now this is how to have on mochi so so

00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:39,420
be out with the idea of so as far as to

00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:42,090
point out goes I think I had a good of a

00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:44,290
different view on it now which is the

00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:47,440
purging to boil obviously has not

00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:50,920
happened and the reason it didn't happen

00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:58,020
partially besides me being too busy with

00:39:50,920 --> 00:40:02,530
other stuff is that it was a lot the

00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:08,650
very big very English is very risky set

00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:12,370
of changes and so I think the better

00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:13,990
plan is to really focus on instead of

00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:16,490
trying to put them all in one ball on

00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:17,960
site let's make

00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:21,110
we have to do all these things before

00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:24,760
the in color to point out let's focus on

00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:27,619
the things we can do individually

00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:29,720
confident generators are in we're

00:40:27,619 --> 00:40:31,490
working on adding more testing and it

00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:34,850
makes it easy to development we're

00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:40,369
looking on the iphone free pour work is

00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:45,619
underway working on reworking the ssl

00:40:40,369 --> 00:40:50,000
code so various bits and pieces that

00:40:45,619 --> 00:40:54,050
were in two point O have landed are

00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:58,930
under development but when we call a two

00:40:54,050 --> 00:41:01,880
point O is we may call a to point out

00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:03,710
sooner rather than later for all the

00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:05,869
things along to point out lists are done

00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:07,970
and then make people go three point out

00:41:05,869 --> 00:41:14,119
over for long four point out because I

00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:16,100
think this is too much emotional impact

00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:18,140
of that two point O number i think we

00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:21,350
just need to get over it and move the

00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:23,680
API on if I did yeah laughs I you had a

00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:23,680
question for

00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:28,740
No

00:41:32,349 --> 00:41:36,810
the other half a step no right now but

00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:39,810
brothers or both

00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:39,810
ok

00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:46,030
you know something that

00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:49,920
past summer

00:41:55,559 --> 00:41:58,849
some sort of the right path but

00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:08,650
great awesome foursome

00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,650
with us

00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:20,300
I at

00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:20,300
right [ __ ] or

00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,800
we had something today

00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:33,700
well I sure I had to I think we talked

00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:40,630
about his food and wins yeah except

00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:42,760
nothing he goes to you yeah it's a this

00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:47,040
sounds like what i was talking about it

00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:51,100
when when i was adding the yet another

00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:53,980
image tool support in it to it into Koji

00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:56,710
and it was basically the same code as

00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:59,860
the other image tools except really all

00:42:56,710 --> 00:43:02,680
that was changing was what command was

00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:04,000
running in the church and and what's

00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:06,010
where things were pulling out so it

00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,610
occurred to me that maybe there was some

00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:13,270
way to make that generic and and have it

00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:16,210
be almost like a set and image spec fit

00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:18,760
yeah when you run up yet we do our game

00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:20,260
bills there's a spectrum heat building

00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:22,120
rpms in all sorts of different ways and

00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:23,950
telling the spec says this is how you

00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:25,300
build it this is what comes out you

00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:26,170
could do the same thing for images and

00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,720
then allow them to just use different

00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:30,420
tools and have different

00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:33,060
silence back and then we don't have to

00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:34,410
write new plugins and new features in

00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:36,869
the Koji every time when it comes up a

00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:40,910
new image tool if we just they just let

00:43:36,869 --> 00:43:40,910
them change a stack I don't know

00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:54,750
ok

00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,540
ok

00:44:03,109 --> 00:44:10,569
um let's see Russians

00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:15,880
yes

00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:18,700
now

00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:23,420
we reserve

00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:25,720
we got it

00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:25,720
sir

00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:28,830
we had

00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:45,799
get a fresh clone and my checkouts

00:44:41,549 --> 00:44:45,799
gotten weird extra style

00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:58,230
dinner table

00:45:15,089 --> 00:45:20,989
fifty percent think twice when he said

00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:25,080
and

00:45:29,029 --> 00:45:32,140
hey money yeah

00:45:44,510 --> 00:46:08,970
the icing yeah i mean i'm interested in

00:45:53,880 --> 00:46:12,150
it it's so the grapes are deeply held

00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:14,430
assumption which is the NBR is a unique

00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:18,000
and we assume that MBL is a unique and I

00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:21,869
wanted my ways right so you going to get

00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:23,880
through and you give it an NBR you call

00:46:21,869 --> 00:46:30,380
the bill with NBR you expect to get one

00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:34,910
answer back not 10 but now you get

00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:38,450
with that bauhaus the tricky I mean I've

00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:44,870
got as the work today on a few years ago

00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:47,510
it's never landed did some gymnastics to

00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:51,320
get a ripped it to look around the file

00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:54,650
system many space thing but but to do it

00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:59,540
right really want to get away from using

00:46:54,650 --> 00:47:04,160
the ndr in in indigo path at all but

00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:07,030
again you change that and people are

00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:10,030
gonna get ya

00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:10,030
because

00:47:10,089 --> 00:47:13,089
sharp

00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:27,029
go to kind of everything

00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:27,029
place where but for

00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:36,720
well today because

00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:48,579
whatever

00:47:46,099 --> 00:47:48,579
what

00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:57,090
that's the implication that I have those

00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:58,590
have a default lane specially kind of

00:47:57,090 --> 00:48:03,870
you kind of have to do it that way yeah

00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:06,500
and I think people there's

00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:11,340
implementation that it's not ready to go

00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:14,850
go in there no there's there's a it you

00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:18,530
know again we create a test week would

00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:18,530
help but also just

00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,950
so many calls change the beach Ainge

00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:29,200
behavior with it with just one simple

00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:29,200
change so it's tricky

00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:38,140
but we can you talk about that i think i

00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:41,500
have in the amount of time yep clement

00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:46,390
all right Sarah so no time for demo in

00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:47,770
last minute questions all right well

00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:50,190
thank you guys for coming thanks for

00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:50,190
listening

00:48:55,540 --> 00:49:01,850
I'm now that i know this i have my mind

00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:03,950
is clearer and i'm happy to talk about

00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:06,170
any sort of random koji things you guys

00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:09,710
when talk about so just hit me up in the

00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:11,960
whole areas we you know i'm probably

00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:17,320
doing some packing on koji wrong here so

00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:17,320
yeah just come talk to me thanks

00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:22,270
