Playlist: Flock 2016
Description: 
	In this talk we aim to provide an overview of what the Fedora Infrastructure has been up to this year. On the sysadmin side as well as the application side. We'll give some clues as to what we want to work on / achieve this year and leave rooms for questions.

	00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:14,099
yes okay let's go ahead and get started

00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:16,230
I think it's time hi hi yes yep I talk

00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:19,050
today about the scene of the destruction

00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:25,080
can you guys hear me in the back yes and

00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:29,160
can you see this tiny print mostly all

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:31,590
right my name is Kevin Kinsey and here

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,930
we're trying to talk about the state of

00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,309
fedora and this structure and we're

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,350
going to go over a bunch of things that

00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:39,870
we've done in the previous year since

00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:42,840
the last block at least those highlights

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,489
of things that we remember that thought

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,700
were important that people may not have

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:49,260
realized we're bound to leave things out

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,750
there are just so many things that

00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:57,030
happen we are bound to have forgotten

00:00:51,750 --> 00:01:00,480
something or come up with some some

00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:02,430
items that or not come up with some

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,589
items that you you will definitely know

00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,240
of so if you want to chime in with

00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:08,189
something if we're talking about a

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,520
particular application or whatnot and

00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:13,020
you remember something to happen please

00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,299
chive right in if you have questions

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:20,369
what we're going feel free to chime

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:21,720
right in let's say anything else there

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:24,890
might be seems that you have finally

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:27,240
heard about is money yes there might be

00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:29,600
other times we're going to we're going

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,070
to point to a number of other talks

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,780
specific things that that we worked on

00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,850
this last year and people are presenting

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,130
on at this very conference that you may

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:41,610
want to go to those talks if you're more

00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:45,229
interested in that particular subject so

00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,229
let's see let's go and get right

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:55,750
the work this ok so here is an item how

00:01:53,170 --> 00:02:01,630
many of you knew that we had a openstack

00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:03,670
cloud fair number of people good so

00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:06,610
we've done about your work on the cloud

00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:10,330
this last year just recently we've added

00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:11,970
some RPC 64 compute nodes and copra is

00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:16,209
going to start using those very soon

00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:19,150
nice they'll prevent any issues with

00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:23,050
those powerpc 64 builds and they should

00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:24,850
be a given go faster I hope we've got it

00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:28,330
storage there was a lot of storage added

00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:30,280
last year and there's a lot of things

00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:32,650
going on at Cooper you can find the

00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:37,810
Cobra guys wearing shirts that say ask

00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:40,060
about Cooper so that uses our our

00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:42,910
private cloud to get all of its builds

00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:46,090
and so forth so one thing's gone there

00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:47,970
we have a Jenkins instance that is

00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:51,340
getting more and more projects in it

00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:53,980
that does its buildings also in the

00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:56,680
OpenStack glad and also kind of us as a

00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:58,870
note we have been transitioning our

00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:02,380
cloud stuff to fedora and for cloud

00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:04,450
about org as a separate domain we

00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:06,730
initially have things set up as cloud up

00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:09,720
in our project org but that presented

00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:13,000
certain problems like you couldn't do

00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,770
hsps headers on all pedure project

00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,330
if you had some cloud instance is

00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:17,980
running without certificates and that

00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:21,070
sort of thing so we kind of moved it up

00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:25,210
to its under me too glad to get around

00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:28,920
that problem so let's think there's

00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:28,920
probably some of their stuff there but

00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:35,200
the ansible move since the last fall

00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:38,410
we're talking about moving our stuff to

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,000
ansible and we completed that so now

00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:42,850
we're running all ansible for our

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,560
configuration management stuff we've

00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:46,570
been helping test upstream halves for

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,060
releases which has been really good the

00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:50,950
last couple releases I've been testing

00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,870
all the release candidates and finding

00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:55,060
issues and then they fix the issues

00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:57,160
before the actual release which is great

00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:59,320
the ansible folks have been really

00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:04,780
responsive to you to bug reports of one

00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:07,830
on good stuff we've also been working on

00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:09,880
cleaning up our interval playbooks and

00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:12,430
trying to make sure that their item

00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:15,250
potent so you put on 20 Heinz and get

00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:17,919
the exact same no changes after the

00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:21,130
initial one set up we will have a

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:23,620
workshop on friday i think it is i'm not

00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:26,410
exactly sure the scheduled arrival or a

00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:27,640
thursday only days yeah we have a an

00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:30,729
ansible workshop where we're going to

00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:32,950
work on we kind of set up our edible

00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:35,770
infrastructure maintenance was first

00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:38,020
created many years ago so we've been

00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,490
trying to keep up with things but there

00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:41,860
are some kind of standards that we

00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:44,169
haven't done and we have a kind of mood

00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:46,330
to the same structure that people expect

00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:47,080
these days so we're going to workshop on

00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:50,169
Thursday

00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,669
try and work on that because of our we

00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:55,300
have a lot of advanced amol playbooks

00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:57,460
we're a good example project rather

00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:00,159
people look at all our stuff is open and

00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:04,840
we like that to be very standard client

00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:08,620
and you know sort of setup correctly for

00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:13,719
people to work at since friday morning

00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:15,430
that i don't know if that's correct this

00:05:13,719 --> 00:05:19,120
is over this last year we moved most of

00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:23,379
our sort of standard in the structure

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:27,460
type stuff to rel 7 we have a breakdown

00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:28,870
here of what our OS releases are astute

00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:31,210
among you will notice that we have the

00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:34,569
door pune to listed here which recently

00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:35,979
went into life so there are some

00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:41,229
instances there that we still need to

00:05:35,979 --> 00:05:43,659
clean out not too many but just a few

00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:46,409
there's a jinx and jenkins instances

00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:48,789
there's some build instances in our

00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:50,770
private cloud that various people been

00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:53,319
using that we need to have them

00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:55,120
transition to do over beans etc is they

00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:58,389
do the ink compatibility or just I'm

00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,810
just talking about yeah so like for

00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:04,659
example we provide in our cloud build

00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:07,539
systems for the twisted Python folks so

00:06:04,659 --> 00:06:11,589
they can run twisted tests on the Fedora

00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:14,199
22 23 25 etc so I've set them up with

00:06:11,589 --> 00:06:16,719
that are 24 instances and they turn

00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:17,440
those on but they have it turned off the

00:06:16,719 --> 00:06:20,600
builds on

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,220
so we can disable them so so on the

00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:25,250
federal notes there are only time

00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:27,920
constraints on the real six we are both

00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:30,290
times and compatibility yes and that's

00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,210
why we still have twenty six no six and

00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:34,330
six right and that's a good deal less

00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:36,620
urgent because obviously rellis

00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:39,890
supported for l6 is going to be

00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:42,020
supported for abundant water so but we'd

00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:44,530
like to move those good luck and they'll

00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:46,970
be more about that some later slides

00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:50,330
when I put these together and look there

00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:52,160
was 525 instance we had a danceable it's

00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:53,690
we'll manage that isn't all the

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,730
instances though because it's a lot of

00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:59,480
the cloud ones are just done ad hoc by

00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:03,680
people and things like that so we have

00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:05,720
quite a few instances out there some of

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,550
them are spread out quite a bit like our

00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:12,620
proxy servers are spread out over the

00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:14,360
world and so some parts of our answer

00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:16,280
once your starch are pretty quick like

00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,170
you know you can configure something

00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:20,780
over 10 hosts and if they're all in the

00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:22,700
same data center that's great but if

00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:25,550
you're going across our proxy servers

00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:27,410
which are in a data centers all over the

00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:29,090
world that takes a long time some of

00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:37,220
them are slower from the management

00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:39,320
hosts etc etc also we lived the move to

00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,780
bodie to and hyper kid email and three

00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:44,480
allowed us to get rid of something yet

00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:48,460
rel six instances moved into seven or

00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,460
fedora in the past year

00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:57,749
another thing we've done since last four

00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:04,479
so we brought the secondary

00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:09,969
architectures into our main

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:12,789
infrastructure in the past the arm RPC

00:08:09,969 --> 00:08:15,159
and s390 Koji's and their build systems

00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:17,080
the secondary architectures we're all

00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:19,809
just sort of done by those people who

00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:22,599
worked on those and as you might imagine

00:08:19,809 --> 00:08:25,899
they didn't have a lot of time to apply

00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:27,279
updates regularly or configure things in

00:08:25,899 --> 00:08:31,449
the same way that the primary was

00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:33,729
configured or moved to rel 7 quickly etc

00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:37,029
etc so we moved all those into our

00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:38,680
ansible management infrastructure so now

00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:40,810
they are managed exactly the same way

00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,849
the program code G is managed they use

00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:44,229
the same ansible templates so we know

00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:47,079
that they're actually set up the same

00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:49,240
play the same Miles's they follow the

00:08:47,079 --> 00:08:52,209
same update patterns we dated all that

00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,829
stuff so that has been really nice we've

00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:57,490
run into problems in the past for that

00:08:53,829 --> 00:08:59,860
where we have a update on a primary Koji

00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:01,540
and it doesn't filter out to them and

00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:04,949
then they have problems building because

00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:08,970
they need an ecology package etc Turner

00:09:04,949 --> 00:09:08,970
so that's been a really good

00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:19,530
so looking forward from the system

00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:21,060
inside things this is a slide for

00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:24,210
Patrick Harris in supports on our

00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:28,560
private cloud but we have a lot of cloud

00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:31,320
plans over the next year or so or two we

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,570
want to move update to the latest raid

00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,460
on OpenStack platform right now we're

00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:38,010
running thought which is pretty old and

00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:42,510
we'd like to move to eight or nine

00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:45,690
whichever is a now but nine design is

00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:47,850
that's a huge my work right it is but it

00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:50,190
is not compatible those releases they

00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:53,040
aren't very so basically what it will

00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:55,440
entail is spinning up a new cloud on the

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,180
new version with a few compute nodes and

00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,400
then migrating everything over to it and

00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:01,530
adding the compute nodes as you as you

00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,870
migrate so it's a lot of work but you

00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:06,450
can it'll be worth it and once we're at

00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:08,370
that level that later OpenStack does

00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:10,890
support upgrades and things like that so

00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:13,020
bubbling to somebody document what

00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:14,200
happens when that besides in and get

00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,140
long

00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,910
that actually get written down anywhere

00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:20,860
as far as what well because this is a

00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:22,210
useful bit of documentation for anybody

00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:24,820
else who ever has to be the same thing

00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:26,170
later sure and so I don't know because I

00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,820
looked at this stuff I looked the

00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:31,810
ansible play books and stuff just to see

00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:35,430
how I might do stuff in my own setups so

00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:38,560
right yeah so the question was about the

00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:42,670
private clouds and upgrading and setting

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:46,120
up right now our current hafta open step

00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:49,090
5 is it as an ansible play black it was

00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:52,000
installed that but that was three years

00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:53,470
ago something like that and things have

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,200
changed a lot there's a lot of different

00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:58,030
the installers different configuration

00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,920
is different so basically once we move

00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:01,360
to the new setup it's going to be a

00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,630
different way look it's going to be a

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:07,240
whole new setup but it should be in

00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:10,450
there definitely so that's what we want

00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:17,460
to do want to add some air 64 and RB

00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:21,900
seven instances either via vert on arm

00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:26,110
area or 64 or via ironic which is the

00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:30,700
install treat a real machine as a cloud

00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:34,750
instance type of thing we want to get

00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:38,620
it's a lot of authentication and we want

00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:40,420
to open up we want to set up things so

00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:42,190
that more people can use our OpenStack

00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:44,590
essentially for things that are useful

00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:46,230
for fedora and that's one of the things

00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:49,630
we're going to talk about at the

00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:51,400
infrastructure or workshop tomorrow is

00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:54,100
laying out how we want to set that up

00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:56,959
but basically it should be fairly easy

00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:59,130
for us to provide authentication

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,750
some amount of resources to any

00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:03,060
contributors so that they can log into

00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:04,649
the OpenStack and spit up an instance

00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:07,040
and test something and do you know

00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:08,819
whatever it is they need to do easily

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,529
now we're going to have to figure out

00:12:08,819 --> 00:12:12,779
what resources we can provide to

00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:14,100
everybody and what makes sense for

00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:17,279
people around there if you want people

00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:19,699
to run long long term things how we want

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:22,350
to secure that all these questions

00:12:19,699 --> 00:12:23,970
remain to be solved but I think that

00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:27,569
could be something that's very useful

00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:29,220
for folks in the coming years and then

00:12:27,569 --> 00:12:31,500
there's work on setting up your

00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,660
ownership instance on top of our private

00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:37,050
cloud again for contributors to be able

00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:39,209
to spin up applications and testings the

00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:41,360
cloud working group folks are working on

00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:41,360
that

00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:48,100
another thing we want to try and do over

00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,620
the next year is move the stuff that is

00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:56,620
on for hosted government which is kind

00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:58,300
of our old source project repository and

00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:01,780
we want to try and move those things to

00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:03,640
the gear it's going to be a lot of work

00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:05,340
and there's going to be things that we

00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,420
have to change and there's going to be

00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:08,380
things that don't want to move and

00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,600
there's going to be things that want to

00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:12,700
move somewhere else and all sorts of

00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,620
stuff like that we want to give a long

00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,030
ramp here we don't want to just say oh

00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:18,790
we're turning off phone or hosting

00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:20,140
tomorrow get your stuff foods now we

00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:23,910
want to want to give everyone the

00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:26,980
opportunity to move my great stuff and

00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:28,240
we're hoping that we can get in the last

00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:30,250
couple months I've been trying to talk

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,370
to the larger projects on fedora posted

00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:35,340
and get them to file issues in here for

00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:38,610
things they need or workflow they need

00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:43,500
and with mixed success you know they

00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:46,660
provided something we do have an inmate

00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:50,770
importer now or exporter going around

00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:53,110
yes and do Tarzan you know hopefully

00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:55,300
attachments are working they are not

00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:57,670
very good on that so we now have an

00:13:55,300 --> 00:14:01,510
important that will take a track project

00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:04,150
all the issues from it and move them

00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:05,890
over to the care issues so you don't

00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:08,830
lose any history that way and of course

00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:10,780
get repos are easy to move but some

00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:15,100
people have particular workflows and

00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:18,579
they're drunk projects or a one month so

00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:22,689
if you have a forested project and

00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:25,179
you have a tissue moving to the gear or

00:14:22,689 --> 00:14:27,759
there's some problem or more flow please

00:14:25,179 --> 00:14:29,889
do follow it a issue of the gear and

00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:31,689
we'll see what we can do there's the

00:14:29,889 --> 00:14:33,850
question about in project the few cuts

00:14:31,689 --> 00:14:36,329
out that I'm not teasing gates there are

00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:41,559
a few projects Fodor hosted supported

00:14:36,329 --> 00:14:46,230
mercurial as an svn as our emphasis all

00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:48,939
those are invertible begin yes problems

00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:50,829
and there's a couple of folks I talked

00:14:48,939 --> 00:14:53,439
to you that are we're looking to move to

00:14:50,829 --> 00:14:55,569
get up or somewhere else just because

00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:57,160
they're the rest of their projects are

00:14:55,569 --> 00:14:59,079
there or you know their contributor

00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:02,730
bases there that work with that whatever

00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:02,730
I mean are LED certainly valid

00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:11,779
poker has been released for six seven

00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:14,440
months long yeah yeah so it's reasonable

00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:14,440
to anyone

00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:21,800
conservation and

00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:29,560
on technical

00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:41,560
I think there's some of that but I think

00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:45,370
it's also improved a lot in the last few

00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:47,200
months there's a documentation your

00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:49,660
Peguero project can have documentation

00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:52,240
now it's another docs repo which will

00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:54,130
render so you can actually describe you

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,930
know what you want users to view had one

00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:59,529
thin foil issues there's templates for

00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:03,730
issues have so I think there's a lot of

00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:06,010
a lot of that is there now but you know

00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:10,450
again is there in your faces it's

00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:12,640
difficult so I mean we're always looking

00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:15,130
to improve it track some people like

00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:18,490
tracking and think it's great but other

00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:23,140
people despise it so I mean it's just

00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:24,550
supposed yeah there's a what you do the

00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:26,110
best you can like a kid supported

00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:28,870
forever and I think we're behind on

00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:31,899
track these pretty fine well it's on a

00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:33,760
supportive branch but it is and again

00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:37,480
track as a project they were supposed to

00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:39,760
have their 1.2 release out 3-4 months

00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:43,209
ago something like that it just isn't

00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:47,089
released so

00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:49,339
yeah if you commence our ideas on how to

00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:51,170
improve tracks then they stick the

00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:53,300
beggarman there is a freaking room for

00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:55,670
improvement and move for allergies are

00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:58,279
complain so it feels like how much work

00:16:55,670 --> 00:17:00,410
is there available to do things in

00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:03,189
figure that makes no sense how many

00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:06,199
developers of burger are there right now

00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:07,640
well interestingly burger is actually

00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:08,660
one of the most successful project that

00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,280
we are running high in the

00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:12,470
infrastructure fund an epic estrangement

00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:15,919
docucenter from contributor point of

00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:18,530
view it's well far beyond on the number

00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,669
of commits competitive with other people

00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,890
but it's one of the project that is

00:17:19,669 --> 00:17:24,230
attracting the most new Commerce data

00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:26,959
project and the person behind you is a

00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:29,150
perfect example is new trees new to the

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,160
community is new to federal for a few

00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:32,929
months and yes we turn the park your

00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:35,570
water and yes or two patches in maker

00:17:32,929 --> 00:17:38,330
itself the next up I wanted you to I'm

00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:41,419
just like my question is with your file

00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:44,419
issues that you have with a girl that

00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:46,580
prevent you from moving from dry what

00:17:44,419 --> 00:17:48,860
chance do you have having the fix really

00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:51,890
I mean we try to get a ticket least

00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:56,210
already hundreds it's people going to

00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:59,470
ask ossl right I mean we can only do the

00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:02,450
best we can do yes it's it's hard to say

00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:05,120
it would be good the things that we need

00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:07,820
to do the hosted move I think we're

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,650
going to set up a label and so we can at

00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,720
least know what those issues are and

00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:15,250
maybe probably prioritize them as best

00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,250
we can with the developers

00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:24,289
is katina so we've been talking about

00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:27,230
moving into the container world now that

00:18:24,289 --> 00:18:29,840
things are sort of a little more stable

00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:33,559
in a little more useful now that we have

00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:36,289
a container build system which Adam was

00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:38,179
talking about earlier this morning I'm

00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:40,640
looking it may be setting up a mirror

00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:43,190
list container I think that might be a

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,929
good win for us but we're going to have

00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:48,350
to figure out exactly how to do that and

00:18:44,929 --> 00:18:49,789
how you know what part of it is going to

00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:51,559
be in the container what part of its

00:18:49,789 --> 00:18:55,610
going to be outside the container mirror

00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:58,370
lists is our application that returns a

00:18:55,610 --> 00:19:00,890
list of mirrors to users so if you do

00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:02,780
dnf update blah blah blah your query

00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:06,110
error list server and it's giving you

00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:08,720
back this metal link of servers and

00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:10,880
check sounds and so forth and so it's a

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,650
very critical and something that we want

00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,020
to have running all the time we don't

00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:16,700
want to disrupt it etc it's one of the

00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:19,070
few application that basically don't

00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:21,080
need net Jess yeah those people are

00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:22,760
reporting issues before not just if

00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:25,220
there's ever a problem in it we hear

00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,750
from users before or our monitor even

00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:29,000
goes off you know something happens and

00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:31,970
some user shows up hey that kid again

00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,409
dude dnf update so it's obviously very

00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:35,870
critical but it's also something that's

00:19:33,409 --> 00:19:38,240
very isolated it takes a mirror list

00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:41,240
which is this blob of data and it just

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,909
serves that data that's all it does so

00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:45,530
it's a good candidate for a container so

00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:47,659
we're looking at maybe setting that up

00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:50,990
leveraging the container build system

00:19:47,659 --> 00:19:53,600
and also if we do this I mean it's going

00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:55,820
to have other advantages like if you for

00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:59,960
whatever reason we're operating an

00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:01,429
isolated environment and you or you have

00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,380
a particular environment and you needed

00:20:01,429 --> 00:20:04,970
to do your own errorless server it would

00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:07,360
be very easy to just take this container

00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:09,760
give it your own data and then

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:12,130
your own metal links or whatever back

00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:15,190
soon we're going to talk about this in

00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:20,410
the infrastructure workshopping so how

00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:21,910
we're going to do it we've been talking

00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:25,120
for a number of years about getting on

00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:27,580
the database replication training we

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,160
just need to buckle down and do it I've

00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:32,080
been working on some this year right now

00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:35,020
our database we have a number of

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:37,690
database servers and you know we back

00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:39,640
them up and whatnot but they're not

00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:41,559
highly available so that's why you see

00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,330
us do averages periodically where we

00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:45,520
have to update things if the database

00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:47,350
server gets rebooted there's that outage

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,750
Schwartz now we want to move that to

00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:51,340
high availability touch setup where we

00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:55,770
don't have to have those averages we can

00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:55,770
just fill a room reason etc

00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:05,529
there's a proposal out there it's not

00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:07,929
had wide discussion yet it's brought up

00:21:05,529 --> 00:21:09,490
to fesco they're moving the secondary

00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:12,190
architectures right now the secretary

00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:17,110
architectures of their own Koji's s390

00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:18,970
is its own koji are 64 power bc there's

00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:20,889
a proposal to just move all those built

00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:23,500
into the primary koji so that they just

00:21:20,889 --> 00:21:25,750
all happen at the same time and that

00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:29,260
would simplify a lot of stuff for

00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:30,669
research airings and it really wouldn't

00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:33,760
have that what you packed on people

00:21:30,669 --> 00:21:36,220
because right now if you do a build on

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:38,350
the primary and it fails on powerpc or

00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:40,000
something like that then there's a bug

00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:41,409
somebody has to look into its pants to

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,230
fix it somebody has to submit it

00:21:41,409 --> 00:21:46,470
available so that would just make this

00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:48,880
process quicker and easier for everybody

00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:51,429
it's going to be discussed more probably

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,080
the next few weeks and if we do that

00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:56,649
they are 64 would probably be the first

00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:58,860
one to move in somewhat important you

00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:58,860
mean

00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:05,940
wow it would mean that the bill would

00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:08,519
fail so that you would say okay my bill

00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:09,960
failed and they're either it would be

00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:12,210
something obvious that you could just

00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:15,419
fix or you would go what why is that

00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:17,850
bailing on s390 and he would talk to the

00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:19,919
sector air folks and say why is this

00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:25,740
failing on a 319 they say oh here's a

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:27,450
patch we'd be like Oh or guess well it

00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:30,059
depends their son talked about that

00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:31,409
weather right now the land that work is

00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:33,539
the whole bill would fail but there's

00:22:31,409 --> 00:22:36,210
some talk about changing kojis so that

00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:37,440
it doesn't do that so that it it would

00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:40,529
still fail the bill that it would

00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,929
continue doing all right now if any

00:22:40,529 --> 00:22:44,960
architecture fails koji goes up it's

00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:47,460
failed it cancels the other relative

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,950
there's talk about making it fail to

00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:51,990
build snow but continue all builds to

00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:53,639
their completion so that you would know

00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:57,499
exactly which one continues that

00:22:53,639 --> 00:23:01,999
actually fail on instead of just one but

00:22:57,499 --> 00:23:01,999
you had a question today

00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:11,580
even now sometimes I'm going packages

00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:13,620
and eight hours now I raise our days so

00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:15,570
all the secondary architectures are

00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:18,060
faster than our primary arm v7

00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:19,680
architecture so they shouldn't be a

00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:22,080
grown-up well it should it should

00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:25,710
increasing in speed however also on that

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:29,510
vein we should be making rv7 builds a

00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:33,080
lot faster soon where we have an AR 64

00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:36,090
the set of hardware that can run arm v7

00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:39,240
BMS on them so we're going to move those

00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:41,850
Milner's to ems on ER 64 and they should

00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:44,750
be I think it's three to four to five

00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:47,400
times faster so that should speed yeah

00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:48,990
everyone's looking for that it so that

00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:53,520
should happen by relatively soon but

00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:58,350
that's the slowest powerpc s390 and a or

00:23:53,520 --> 00:24:00,330
64 are all faster than rb7 so it should

00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:05,360
once we land that it should speed up

00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:08,740
everything every inner power and speed I

00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,450
have some critical issue

00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:12,970
and then some architecture I don't know

00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:15,610
nothing about red is blocking me from

00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:19,240
pushing training to update fedora and

00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:22,210
nobody from the architecture scheme is

00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:25,090
available for help should I exclude are

00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:27,220
just to like make it and that's a

00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:29,800
perfectly valid question that's what we

00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:31,510
have to discuss and this is supposed to

00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:34,570
be run upon the developers for

00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:36,160
discussion so yeah maybe there's should

00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:38,170
be a procedure like that so like if it's

00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,900
a security update and you have to get it

00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:43,450
out quickly and you know s390 doesn't go

00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:45,400
or whatever maybe that is a knowledge

00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:47,500
thing to do exclude argent do that bill

00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:50,050
doesn't revert it so that they can fix

00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:51,790
it and push up another bill but all the

00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:57,550
regular other architectures connection

00:24:51,790 --> 00:25:03,870
the updated samsung pieces there's about

00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:03,870
a shitty bar from toxic of their artists

00:25:04,109 --> 00:25:10,059
primarily tennis or negatives well it's

00:25:07,209 --> 00:25:16,949
not actually shifting that eat something

00:25:10,059 --> 00:25:21,159
fails the attorneys are there beautiful

00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:24,429
so there's some statistic on this and

00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:26,379
again well I don't have all the data

00:25:24,429 --> 00:25:28,929
here but there's a statistic on this is

00:25:26,379 --> 00:25:31,149
like ninety-nine percent of packages in

00:25:28,929 --> 00:25:34,119
primary build fine on secondary just

00:25:31,149 --> 00:25:37,569
there's no issue and when it is an issue

00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:39,699
it's either something that the secondary

00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:42,999
person has to come up with a patch for

00:25:39,699 --> 00:25:47,019
or you know do something invasive you

00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:48,669
know something some work so if the vast

00:25:47,019 --> 00:25:52,449
majority of cases it doesn't happen it

00:25:48,669 --> 00:25:56,999
just really my question Finney wouldn't

00:25:52,449 --> 00:26:00,690
we xstrata sources for Avengers fight

00:25:56,999 --> 00:26:00,690
like the arm

00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:11,009
definitely you're ready and then we have

00:26:04,019 --> 00:26:12,899
that book yep so we have four right and

00:26:11,009 --> 00:26:15,419
we yeah that's a good perfectly valid

00:26:12,899 --> 00:26:17,580
question I agree that having those

00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:19,860
resources would be good we could do PVC

00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:22,619
now in the cloud is we have a compute

00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:25,619
node there but we still need s390 and

00:26:22,619 --> 00:26:28,619
air 64 but i think i think the largest

00:26:25,619 --> 00:26:30,600
problem that you get in this situation

00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:33,330
is you're trying to build a no arch

00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:36,570
package it picks a random architecture

00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:39,330
that simply does not support old hamble

00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:42,840
or some java or something great i'm

00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:45,779
dying or not right you're not really no

00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:48,419
large but you are because now you add a

00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:50,669
new package you have to know right oui

00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:53,369
charges to exclude and of course then we

00:26:50,669 --> 00:26:55,679
break no art it's not something it's

00:26:53,369 --> 00:26:57,179
been a long long at our problem I don't

00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,190
know what the good answer is for that

00:26:57,179 --> 00:27:00,929
awesome well anyway there's going to be

00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:04,259
a lot more discussion on this on the

00:27:00,929 --> 00:27:08,759
list and peter has a big proposal so

00:27:04,259 --> 00:27:10,889
forth now good all right so we got no

00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:12,629
muttering automation we're working out

00:27:10,889 --> 00:27:15,720
this year spooge just going to work on

00:27:12,629 --> 00:27:19,379
right now we used a key is just because

00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:22,529
it sucks the least there's certainly

00:27:19,379 --> 00:27:24,570
lots of other options out there now but

00:27:22,529 --> 00:27:26,399
right now are our nagios system is very

00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:28,950
manual so like when we create a new

00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:31,389
application or instance or whatever it

00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:33,039
depends on rivers adding that to me

00:27:31,389 --> 00:27:35,200
they monitor all the right things and I

00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:37,299
have the hosts and so forth since we

00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,279
know I've ansible there there's no

00:27:37,299 --> 00:27:40,839
reason to do this manual anymore this

00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,369
should be completely automated when you

00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:45,059
add a new host and ansible to do

00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:49,619
something it should get monitored so

00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:52,359
hopefully this year we'll have that good

00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:55,269
and neither of the application stuff

00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:57,099
yeah so on the application side let's

00:27:55,269 --> 00:28:01,029
give inside that we have had a quite a

00:27:57,099 --> 00:28:03,129
number of changes this year and we

00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:05,320
basically cannot really list them all

00:28:03,129 --> 00:28:06,940
here because there are just too many too

00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:09,639
many application too many changes so

00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:12,489
what we try to do here is a to highlight

00:28:09,639 --> 00:28:14,349
some of these that are big enough some

00:28:12,489 --> 00:28:16,389
of these that are that we consider to be

00:28:14,349 --> 00:28:18,369
important enough and some that you might

00:28:16,389 --> 00:28:20,049
not have heard about so this our

00:28:18,369 --> 00:28:23,589
application that we have developed or

00:28:20,049 --> 00:28:26,409
changed we worked that are important

00:28:23,589 --> 00:28:30,190
changes we've missed a famine once we

00:28:26,409 --> 00:28:31,989
use the fmn 90 right there yep important

00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:36,669
changes but that you might not have

00:28:31,989 --> 00:28:38,709
heard about so one that one is probably

00:28:36,669 --> 00:28:40,059
something that a good contour example to

00:28:38,709 --> 00:28:41,950
what did you say because that's probably

00:28:40,059 --> 00:28:45,039
something that you already know and I've

00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:47,499
heard about so many months three men man

00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:50,200
has released a new major release that

00:28:47,499 --> 00:28:54,099
was long overdue which is made man 3 and

00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:57,459
we are moving away from the old Piper

00:28:54,099 --> 00:29:00,190
male archive interface where emails were

00:28:57,459 --> 00:29:02,379
listed by amounts and if you are the

00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:03,969
straight going over two months then you

00:29:02,379 --> 00:29:05,049
have to go from one page to do so to

00:29:03,969 --> 00:29:06,999
actually be able to read the entire

00:29:05,049 --> 00:29:10,839
thread to something a little bit more

00:29:06,999 --> 00:29:13,149
i'm going to say wed to that oh well you

00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:16,539
actually gets one straight entirely you

00:29:13,149 --> 00:29:18,759
can reply online directly so and that's

00:29:16,539 --> 00:29:20,799
basically I broke it is so I quickly is

00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:23,559
developed by our Vanya who's here in the

00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:25,989
room and and the idea one of the idea of

00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:28,089
it is to be able to breach forums with

00:29:25,989 --> 00:29:28,860
meaning lists so you can interact with

00:29:28,089 --> 00:29:32,340
minimum is as

00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:34,740
you're just looking at the forum and you

00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:36,450
can one of the key feature which I see

00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:38,280
in there is that you can actually go to

00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:40,740
our kitty send an email to milling means

00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:42,510
that you are not subscribed to you won't

00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:44,520
get any emails and you're still able to

00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:46,140
actually send your emails get the reply

00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:48,390
reply to this thread and you don't have

00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:49,770
to follow it is any of the other message

00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:50,760
communication that's going on the list

00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:52,440
and you're not going to receive in your

00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,940
vm else that's going on a list but you

00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,920
still get your message through and you

00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:58,049
still can access the replies I think

00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:00,059
that was one of the one of the key

00:29:58,049 --> 00:30:02,820
feature of it the advantage is that

00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:04,350
nowadays we are complete the migration

00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:06,660
has been completed so there is no more

00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:09,030
main man tube running what there is one

00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:11,250
on Finn real estate look they moved it

00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:13,980
okay so now even throw it is now a man

00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:15,630
mystery and I perkily based there is a

00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:20,429
talk about that so if you want to run

00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:28,280
over to hyper kitty well first TD

00:30:20,429 --> 00:30:28,280
setting in we've all around yep

00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:31,550
fine

00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:37,760
it was

00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:46,740
my name is

00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:46,740
I

00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:57,330
so so the question is

00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:59,160
the question is out can you subscribe to

00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:01,140
a Milanese that is private since you

00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:17,010
cannot see the mini mix into this

00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:19,620
private maintain and there is a baby

00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:21,990
Spencer archives and then you have the

00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:28,170
way you have a way to subscribe to this

00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:31,290
way so this so the answer for the for a

00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:33,300
movie here you can subscribe so they are

00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:34,620
chill with your face two men men 31 is

00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:36,600
the archive and that's how poor kitty

00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:39,510
and one is yet mean and as for serious

00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:41,040
you cannot do that if I are poor kitty

00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:42,720
because that's the archive and your

00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:48,240
capital private but you can do that by

00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:50,100
upper service so another small

00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,460
application that we wrote is called MV

00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:57,180
API and MV API is very simple

00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:58,770
application the idea is we have you we

00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:01,200
have the yum repositories and the humor

00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:03,990
histories are consisted either of XML

00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:07,050
file or small sqlite database and that's

00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:08,490
when you dnf update you see download at

00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:12,030
the beginning and basically it's fished

00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:14,190
it's fetching these files and but if you

00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:16,260
want to actually you know get the

00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:19,320
information from these files you either

00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:21,000
need to use the dnf API and then

00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,920
download and carry information locally

00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,270
and then when there's a new role of

00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:27,630
update you need to retreat this

00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:30,300
information or you can use MV API and

00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:33,930
the idea of it is it's basically it's a

00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:36,840
very small API that just expose what is

00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:39,390
present on the SQLite database from the

00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:42,000
human repositories so it goes you can

00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:43,440
ask for what of the dependencies of a

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,970
package you can ask what is the change

00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,770
log of a package you can ask what other

00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:49,680
files present in a package you can ask

00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:52,320
version release you can ask the set

00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:55,010
packages you can you can use the sub

00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:57,799
package to go back to the source package

00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:59,779
this kind of thing so all this kind of

00:32:57,799 --> 00:33:02,539
information that represents on the yum

00:32:59,779 --> 00:33:06,259
repository which may want to have access

00:33:02,539 --> 00:33:09,309
to and public with infrastructural this

00:33:06,259 --> 00:33:12,860
is this is public and this is using the

00:33:09,309 --> 00:33:15,499
federal the rawhide throat on before we

00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:17,539
might need to configure territory city

00:33:15,499 --> 00:33:19,220
throat when to its using the testing

00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:21,409
repository is using the stableboy great

00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:23,239
stories and the release with visitors so

00:33:21,409 --> 00:33:25,190
if you ask for information about the

00:33:23,239 --> 00:33:26,570
colonel it's going to look for a big

00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:28,340
tasting if it doesn't find it in

00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:29,989
updating is going to look at updates if

00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:32,239
it doesn't find it in update spring clip

00:33:29,989 --> 00:33:34,759
release so eventually you should get an

00:33:32,239 --> 00:33:37,639
answer it might take a little bit longer

00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:39,379
but it's actually very very fast so it's

00:33:37,639 --> 00:33:40,700
a you don't notice that it's actually

00:33:39,379 --> 00:33:42,350
going through three data base to give

00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:45,950
you the answer but you get every single

00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:47,779
and it's returns to nice JSON blob so

00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:50,980
you can integrate that with which our

00:33:47,779 --> 00:33:50,980
position and play around with it

00:33:54,430 --> 00:34:00,280
sir are there any past like this Rico so

00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:03,920
the could you repo is in there as well

00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:06,230
so you can so when you go on the side

00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:08,090
it's didn't put the oil here it's some

00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:09,919
apps that forever project the tops life

00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:12,110
in the API if you go in there you have a

00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:14,060
nice ice cube edge with a few links and

00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:15,350
one of them is the branches link and the

00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:19,010
branches basically list the different

00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:20,690
reports that are available or crunchy so

00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:22,490
it will sell poggi will say rawhide

00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:25,159
would say throws only for trains between

00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:26,840
2 30 p l7 II killed six appeal five what

00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:29,800
one other thing to note here is that it

00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:33,110
also emits bed passengers so it'll say

00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:35,570
md API noticed koji build-out giga

00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:38,600
database updated and then you can see

00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:47,210
that it updated or 20 or 25 updates

00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:49,250
updated preference so the question is is

00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:51,320
there a recovery equivalent that uses

00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:53,270
that did something which I have in line

00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:54,740
mine's probably the needs of time it's i

00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:56,629
still haven't played with it because i

00:34:54,740 --> 00:35:00,140
really would like to yeah get the

00:34:56,629 --> 00:35:01,520
iterative aspects of repo query building

00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:04,550
the dependency trees and kind of scene

00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:07,100
using MVP is probably hunter right so

00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:08,450
the answer is no stila still open media

00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:10,370
openly someone wants to pick it up but

00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:14,600
otherwise I might just get around to it

00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:16,520
at one point so and the good part about

00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:19,790
it is that we actually started Doug

00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:21,710
fitting it so the federal packages is

00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:24,110
what's running at up the fair project

00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:26,600
that org slash packages and it's this

00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:28,130
application that we have which is not

00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,630
really meant for contributors although

00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:31,460
it is us become two videos but it's also

00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:33,200
used for people outside of our community

00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:36,050
to see which packages are in fedora

00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,910
which version are they what are the

00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:40,760
contact people what are the bug reports

00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:42,800
what are the patch is because it says at

00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:45,890
least the content of the git repo the

00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:48,350
change love this kind of sense and it

00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:51,140
was getting very slow the architecture

00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:52,730
was a little bit weak one of the problem

00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:56,030
that it had was he was actually using

00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:58,130
the SQLite database from you and it had

00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:59,240
a large so that it would update the

00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:01,010
database and

00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,450
the log could not be released and then

00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:05,390
the front time would be blood by this

00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:06,980
love and or the front and good luck the

00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:08,930
database and then the backend would not

00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:11,020
be able to update the old stuff so was a

00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:13,700
little bit of a mess playing with that

00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:16,070
so we get rid of all the young

00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:19,400
integration parts and we just using API

00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:21,380
nowadays and it uses it cash the

00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:26,060
information from any API so it's very

00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:28,250
snappy and it will refresh its cash or

00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:30,410
its invalidate his cash when in the API

00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:33,200
sense of a message message saying that I

00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:37,040
Elite Eights there was a new paji repo

00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:38,540
build that says so in the API is not an

00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,940
able to say well there is a new coach

00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:42,980
Chirico built it also says what changed

00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:45,110
in that triple bill so which are the

00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:48,320
package that's that were impacting by

00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:49,400
this update and so it I'm a federal

00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,350
package please just look at these

00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,910
messages and see what there was a new

00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:54,890
kernel so I'm just invalidate the cash

00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:56,300
flow gianna and when someone goes to the

00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:58,250
badge and ask for the colonel is going

00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:59,780
to grow in the API retreat info cash

00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:02,020
them so that's when the next person is

00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:04,850
coming they will eat the cat directly

00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:08,170
it's much more stable and in used to we

00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:12,230
have had much less ticket talkin about

00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:15,880
about projecting outdated there is still

00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:18,710
a little bit of some time small issues

00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:21,290
one of them is coming from the Ruby

00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:23,420
world where we have one package that's

00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:26,900
present from two different sources and

00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:28,520
basically according to who is looking at

00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:30,230
which page first the information is

00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:33,380
going to be displayed in one way or the

00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:37,520
other way but it's a it's a little bit

00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:40,550
of a corners case and there is no real

00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:42,040
good answer for that one because it's a

00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:45,370
it's a tricky one

00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:47,910
and so yeah it says message please yeah

00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:50,920
is that every day it's it's pretty any

00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:53,080
we do get bugs on it actually

00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:54,700
particularly but most of them because

00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:57,160
people saying that this is our bugzilla

00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:58,810
so they just report package initials on

00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:00,760
that so we actually have at some plates

00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:02,200
in there saying like thank you for your

00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,640
ticket but this is not the right place

00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:08,770
please fill it to bugzilla that for

00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:11,620
another time okay I'm going to go with

00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:14,230
faster now yeah but notice something

00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:15,970
which I wanted to bring forward mostly

00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:18,100
because it's pretty cool I mean this is

00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:20,440
the the new interface for the meeting

00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:22,090
looks so when you do a meetings on IRC

00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:24,670
you use that word and you start meeting

00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:27,760
and n meetings the logs there is HTML

00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:30,010
and text logs that are published much

00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,560
retrieves them stores them presents them

00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:34,000
in a nice way it's using Java scripts so

00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:37,000
that's one of our few application that's

00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,130
mostly only JavaScript I think and one

00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,840
of the cool thing about it is it has

00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:44,200
absolutely nothing to do with the

00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:46,630
federal engineering team it was made by

00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:48,010
someone from the community that came up

00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:49,330
rivers and was like here making this

00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:52,630
cool app for this and we were like okay

00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:54,370
go for it and we just ran it and II

00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:56,860
wrote it is maintaining it and with just

00:38:54,370 --> 00:39:02,140
running it and reporting him for the

00:38:56,860 --> 00:39:04,450
dogs so it's pretty cool Mira manager

00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:06,430
too so that's something which you don't

00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:09,280
which you're all using that you don't

00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:11,440
see pretty much it was in old

00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:15,190
application that's back in the days from

00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:18,310
when our core meltdown one of the router

00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:19,750
on a release day in the river debts that

00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:23,710
doesn't clear and read up not being

00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:26,200
sloppy about every failure so we started

00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:28,330
to when mirrors and there was how do we

00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:30,280
do direct people to these mirrors so

00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:33,460
that's my manager so it's something from

00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:35,200
throughout 0 for 3 it was really an old

00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:40,000
application so it needed to be refreshed

00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:41,620
that's marinated to its in its love you

00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,680
haven't seen it it's working so that's

00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:46,090
good the good thing about it is we

00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:48,280
brought back a couple of features that

00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:49,720
had been removed over time one

00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:51,430
them is the distribution of the mirrors

00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,870
over the world so you have a map of the

00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:55,960
world and you can see where the mirrors

00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:58,480
are we have a sort of few stats which

00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:00,760
are integrated in it one of them is this

00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:03,340
one so this is all the work of a driven

00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:04,360
river with realtor that's not has

00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:06,580
nothing to do with the flow

00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:08,530
infrastructure it's just runs me he also

00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:11,770
likes my manager who runs a mirror so

00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:14,890
it's just working on it and so this is

00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:19,960
an idea of how many mirrors are so this

00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:23,020
is for rawhide x86 64 and every single

00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:25,150
book this is the number of in green you

00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:28,390
have the number of mirrors that is up to

00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:30,520
date when the cron job run so what you

00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:33,700
can see is when we probably here at the

00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:35,230
roland update so we have 20 more that up

00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:38,740
to date and then at the next one we had

00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:42,490
57 378 85 and then we have any real date

00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:44,470
every until four hours yes something

00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:46,570
like that Jenna and what we see at the

00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:49,150
top is we have some errors that are

00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:50,350
never that are always out dated so the

00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:52,330
question becomes of course is that

00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:54,160
always the same years so do we are

00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:56,530
always about ten years at the top that

00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,350
are just always outdated and since I

00:40:56,530 --> 00:41:00,700
always have dated people don't use them

00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:03,610
because mirrorless is not going to give

00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:05,020
you a mirror consolidated so the next

00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:06,700
thing that we should do is look at these

00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:08,620
ten mirrors and see there are constants

00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:11,110
at the time but you get it does give us

00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:13,600
an idea of how long it takes for when we

00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:15,880
push an update to ride along the text to

00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:19,390
reach all of our mirrors and you can see

00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:20,890
that it does take about two hours that's

00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:24,160
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:27,850
in that system as far as say eight hours

00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:31,510
we have most of our mirror sedated we

00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:35,130
are working on yeah tips here is 10

00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:35,130
minutes for sure

00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:42,290
so my manager is the application that

00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,580
people running mirrors are going to

00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:46,250
interact with that's the place where

00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:48,890
they declare them yours and mirror lists

00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:51,170
is what is using the data from your

00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:52,550
manager so there is there are three

00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:54,440
components there is a front end mirror

00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:55,880
manager with people research there is

00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:58,160
the background that texted the

00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:00,710
information from their manager call them

00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:02,240
see if they're updated generates a data

00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:05,300
files that is then given to the

00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:07,190
muralists to be served to the users so

00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:11,960
that's so the triangle looks being built

00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:14,330
here then we have Bassett's so what it

00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:15,770
is you not you haven't heard about the

00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:18,860
name but you have heard about the issue

00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:21,220
and that's by me and so release the hand

00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:25,610
and we have Bassett's to fight spam

00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:27,830
that's Patricks baby the idea is when

00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:30,170
you register too fast it goes through a

00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:32,060
machine learning process that tries to

00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:34,220
figure out if your spammer or not based

00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:35,600
on information that we have and then you

00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:36,770
sign the CLA and then it has more

00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,660
information letting you start doing

00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:42,680
something and then it blocks you because

00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:44,120
you BF badly there is going to be a talk

00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:45,050
about that so if you want to know a

00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:51,560
little bit more of the gory details

00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:55,250
please attend then they respect well

00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:57,680
that's my baby so it's already been

00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:59,990
mentioned it's our new Forge only

00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:04,010
packets python-based yeah it got a very

00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:05,780
very big lift face yeah firstly by Ryan

00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:07,460
here so all the crates go see if you

00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:10,390
like the new UI if you don't have to do

00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:10,390
it or want me

00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:14,780
that has been it that is going to

00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:17,450
tremendous help to get the project

00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:19,430
subsidizing or so because it's it makes

00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:22,640
the project much more attractive and

00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:25,100
such a huge contributors there was one

00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:28,340
project that we had put a slide off and

00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:31,580
that's some of it is removed is we also

00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:33,950
started reworking our fmm system so

00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:36,410
ikemen is the federal miss the federal

00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:37,970
message notification service so it's the

00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:39,260
place where you can go with some apps

00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:41,090
that are our project at all /

00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:44,540
densification and it's the place where

00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:46,130
you can go and exactly point out which

00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:48,740
kind of notification you want to get

00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:50,300
from our procedure see and you can not

00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:52,490
only say which notification but you can

00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:55,790
say you where and so the idea is like

00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:57,830
you can get I want to have a nanny see

00:43:55,790 --> 00:44:00,530
an hour see notification when I do built

00:43:57,830 --> 00:44:02,750
on Koji that is successful and I want to

00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:04,820
get Sid by email when the build is

00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:06,140
filled and then because then I can knock

00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:08,390
out the emails i can go back to the

00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:10,190
links and see what went wrong so these

00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:12,260
are the kind of the delivered the

00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:16,310
granularity that the FEMEN is alone yes

00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:18,770
and we did an entire an entire rewrite

00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:20,360
of the backends we just changed you the

00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:23,510
way the architecture of the backend

00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:25,610
worked and we're about three times about

00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:29,570
three times faster we can proceed about

00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:32,900
proceed about 100 message per minutes we

00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:36,260
were about 13 message for minutes before

00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:38,960
something like that and we deployed that

00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:41,870
last week Monday and on Tuesday we had

00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:43,610
the mass branching and I think we

00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:46,610
recovered from the mass branching in

00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:48,839
about half a day while it took us about

00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:52,200
two days before was about

00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:53,999
the bottleneck here is competing for its

00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:56,219
message that goes on the bus we need to

00:44:53,999 --> 00:44:58,019
compute all the filters of all the roots

00:44:56,219 --> 00:45:00,329
of every user and the debate debates to

00:44:58,019 --> 00:45:02,369
figure out if they want to use if they

00:45:00,329 --> 00:45:04,710
want to be notified of this message and

00:45:02,369 --> 00:45:09,329
where that could be done in parallel so

00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:13,079
it's paralyzed to some extent so yeah we

00:45:09,329 --> 00:45:14,339
now have using a queuing system and then

00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:16,109
different workers that are doing the

00:45:14,339 --> 00:45:18,779
computation and then one worker at the

00:45:16,109 --> 00:45:22,799
at the bank that's justin vio sending to

00:45:18,779 --> 00:45:26,369
our see any games used to be our by a

00:45:22,799 --> 00:45:30,930
man i asked me performance reasons so

00:45:26,369 --> 00:45:32,849
impossible and i hope that something if

00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:35,130
there are is the reason it for it

00:45:32,849 --> 00:45:37,890
definitely so there are cute cookers

00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:39,630
Rico that are blacklisted right now it's

00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:41,519
at the ruby gem and the pipe i will book

00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:43,469
but are entirely rebuilding the entire

00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:46,979
ruby gem ecosystem in the entire pie pie

00:45:43,469 --> 00:45:51,269
ecosystem this is from before the the

00:45:46,979 --> 00:45:52,799
rewrite we kept the change in there I'm

00:45:51,269 --> 00:45:56,369
actually curious to remove that and see

00:45:52,799 --> 00:45:59,089
how swamped I hemant gets or not the

00:45:56,369 --> 00:45:59,089
first Utley

00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:05,780
about us inside okay that was another

00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:08,870
one so that's maybe something we can

00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:11,510
open to the the only thing why we when

00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:14,960
we depart the new SMN we did not clear

00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:17,270
out the blacklisted copper repo was

00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,830
about I'm not sure if there is actually

00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:20,690
anyone that's really interesting to get

00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:22,940
notification about every single built-in

00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:24,920
in copper of pi PI of fergie chip if

00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:27,410
there is a market to turn them back on

00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:29,420
but if there is no one on the receiving

00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:30,350
end I don't see why we should just put

00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:33,740
clothes on the system for the

00:46:30,350 --> 00:46:35,390
fundamentals it's not running on my

00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:40,670
mission i don't i don't need eater at

00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:59,860
all and it's for your holiday bonus for

00:46:40,670 --> 00:47:04,120
our community working progress so far

00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:07,850
it's a sort of the source code is there

00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:09,980
yeah one of the one of the changes

00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:11,390
that's coming is we're actually adding a

00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:13,760
new back end and that's going to be a

00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:15,920
simple sever sent events back ends sewn

00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:19,070
evansville server that is going to be

00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:21,260
able to send notifications so you the

00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:22,970
idea is to integrate that in herbs in

00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:25,670
empty you're going to add the feet so

00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:27,020
it's a live refresh of notification and

00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:29,030
you're going to be able to sell you on

00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:32,870
your webs well I want to be notified on

00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:36,410
email on RC on my herbs page about these

00:47:32,870 --> 00:47:38,060
and these subjects and the SS the events

00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:40,070
or server could be used for other kind

00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:43,130
of modifications including the Dignam

00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:44,810
desktop notification the booking that

00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:47,850
worked or use the work

00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:49,500
so one of the idea is that we really

00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:51,420
keep the older computation of who wants

00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:54,030
to know about what in one place and

00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:56,910
instead of trying to spreading that over

00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:58,290
different applications I'm completely

00:47:56,910 --> 00:48:01,170
running out of time because I still at

00:47:58,290 --> 00:48:03,360
the commencement parts so I'm going to

00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:05,550
go very quickly in there epsilon is

00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:07,650
getting a new pretty awesome feature

00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:10,260
which is the open IDs connect supports

00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:13,640
and that's again Patrick's work is part

00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:16,500
of the open ID committee with cinema get

00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:18,480
the opening the foundation is the reddit

00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:21,330
representative of the open ID foundation

00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:26,700
so you signed autograph at the end of

00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:29,060
data one of the things so open ID

00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:31,920
connect is basically os/2 on steroids

00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:34,170
fixing one of those such problems of

00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:36,660
those two it will allow us to do cross

00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:38,310
up authentication so since like when you

00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:39,600
when you're on earth you will be able to

00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:41,970
interact with federal calor without

00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:44,880
actually going to physical or when

00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:46,260
you're on body or some new interface you

00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:49,740
would be able to interact with package

00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:52,020
eb or body in one place and that should

00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:54,510
also work makes our life much easier for

00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:58,410
every CLI programs that we want to work

00:48:54,510 --> 00:49:00,720
with first three is going to be released

00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:02,460
the NI see two people here just that I

00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:05,640
just really really hard working on it

00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:07,320
right now we basically should have it

00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:09,450
running on staging by the end of the

00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:11,160
week based pretty much after that we are

00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:12,570
going to break staging and then we're

00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:14,190
going to fix touching and then we are

00:49:12,570 --> 00:49:16,400
going to break proud and a fully fixed

00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:16,400
part

00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:23,740
I'm let you go through the support the

00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:25,600
changes here one of the thing is it's

00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:27,610
also going to help us with everything

00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:29,530
that's been based authentication so

00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:33,190
every CLI tool should benefit from that

00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:34,840
as well nice package DB that's something

00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:36,820
that as we mentioned we have added

00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:41,340
namespacing to package DB so that it

00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:45,850
supports other components and rpms

00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:48,010
dockers as been mentioned with max at

00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:50,080
maximilian atyminius talked earlier

00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:52,750
there is a some trace in the modularity

00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:54,070
group to interact with faculty be but

00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:57,250
there might be a package to be through

00:49:54,070 --> 00:50:00,040
around the corner for that Sarah herbs

00:49:57,250 --> 00:50:02,140
so the idea is to make it easier for new

00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:03,700
contributors to find what's going on in

00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:06,640
our community and our to reach us

00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:09,370
apparently our old timers do like our

00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:11,830
small dark corners so we want to put

00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:14,440
some way for newcomers to join us in the

00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:17,640
dark side there is going to be accessed

00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:20,830
on Friday on it so feel free to join

00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:23,650
bugger as I saw new things coming up

00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:26,290
private repos so I'm not quite sure yet

00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:28,090
if we want to allow it on Peggy detail

00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:29,890
but if you want to run your own bugger

00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:31,570
instance or if your company wants to win

00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:34,960
it then you should be able to activate

00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:38,410
private repo there it will be quicker we

00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:40,060
are working to be able to mirror coat so

00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:42,610
when you push the part when you push the

00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:47,770
bugger it will be able to mirror to get

00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:50,710
out for example of the fidelity we have

00:50:47,770 --> 00:50:53,320
bug reporter which allows us to bring

00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:56,920
your project from say github or federal

00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:58,900
st to pack your itself and something

00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:01,660
that has been asking that we need to

00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:03,880
figure out is to get meaningless for

00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:05,320
projects so that's a we've made mentor

00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:06,970
it should be much easier to do and

00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:08,700
that's just something which we need to

00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:12,180
get around

00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:15,480
I can she is that federal project org so

00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:17,280
far it's a nice sigit interface and you

00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:20,700
can bro the repository you can access

00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:23,910
the the leukocyte cash and nowadays in

00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:25,440
staging you can do / bugger and you can

00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:27,210
fork and you can see which project

00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,650
you're managing you can see the content

00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:33,150
of the key triple you can fork you can

00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:39,420
pull request and eventually you will be

00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:41,250
able to match the thing with it is you

00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:44,760
can fall in progress you cannot educate

00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:47,010
this does not replace bugzilla this does

00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:48,720
not replace package to be so every acl's

00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:50,339
or the group management all the user

00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:53,849
management remain civic FD bien is

00:51:50,339 --> 00:51:56,280
synced to figure when we sync the gates

00:51:53,849 --> 00:51:58,500
and everything and it does provide looks

00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:01,470
so seem like web boots are to be

00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:02,849
provided by a gear and we well it's not

00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:04,740
a product yet i'm setting but that's

00:52:02,849 --> 00:52:06,480
something which we will want to deploy a

00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:08,130
point point it has get hook so you

00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,650
should be able to get commit by email

00:52:08,130 --> 00:52:14,670
strangle you right now the church just

00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:18,900
not sure oh so you like bridge again

00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:21,000
good conclusion by project coming I

00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:26,890
sorry

00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:29,380
we could like so you we're working on a

00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:31,569
on a G we're working on CI integration

00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:33,579
and right now the only see I that we

00:52:31,569 --> 00:52:35,680
have is Jenkins but we could see

00:52:33,579 --> 00:52:37,450
something with bugger doing the

00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:40,510
integration with something like open

00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:42,309
cute ass khatron and then and then when

00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:45,279
you're going to pull request you get so

00:52:42,309 --> 00:52:47,529
what we can be flags and you can get a

00:52:45,279 --> 00:52:49,569
flight a flag from aki anything you have

00:52:47,529 --> 00:52:52,000
three warnings or four hours what is

00:52:49,569 --> 00:52:53,319
also not sure or whatever power yet or

00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,990
you can liquor then you could integrate

00:52:53,319 --> 00:52:57,700
crochet it is a problem see I is you

00:52:55,990 --> 00:52:59,500
need to rebuild everything that depends

00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:03,119
upon you to see if they wrote well it's

00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:07,630
perfect where it gets very interesting

00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:10,390
hard work it takes pay attention it yeah

00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:11,740
that's your baby so really I'm here

00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:13,329
trying to a lightning talk about you

00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:16,720
figure how to sign up for which is I'm

00:53:13,329 --> 00:53:18,819
just trying to speed up so we're doing a

00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:21,579
bit we talked about Mara manager to we

00:53:18,819 --> 00:53:23,319
talked about me released but there is so

00:53:21,579 --> 00:53:25,359
the server side of it and that's how

00:53:23,319 --> 00:53:28,180
mirrors reports that they are all today

00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:30,069
to us or if they want to and that's

00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:32,710
quick fellow reviewers and that's tips

00:53:30,069 --> 00:53:34,539
baby and it's basically would make

00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:37,660
running a Federal Bureau much quicker

00:53:34,539 --> 00:53:39,430
yeah both of them have been running the

00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:41,380
script for like every 10 minutes oh yeah

00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:43,329
that's how much that's how a little note

00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:45,220
exactly if there's no changes that

00:53:43,329 --> 00:53:46,750
that's our little load it brings to both

00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:49,270
the server side of the hose running

00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:52,420
explain anyone

00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:53,740
one cause I chose revenge so I already

00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:56,590
talked about document so that's one less

00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:59,350
I don't our neighbor wiki is getting

00:53:56,590 --> 00:54:01,330
upgraded but Ricky's getting aggregate

00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:03,250
us moving to it's going to move to open

00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:06,520
ID so you're going to have the same

00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:08,650
loading pages for every other odd is

00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:12,300
moving from mask for mysql to possess

00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:14,920
clear it's moving from rio 630 7 and

00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:16,900
that's there is a question of really we

00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:19,600
get better mobile support with the new

00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:27,250
version that's a something we ? you need

00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:38,320
to taste turkey yeah okay okay and we

00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:40,000
have lost five units that's so ND api is

00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:43,330
part on three only one of the latest

00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:45,880
service written by albania to do to be

00:54:43,330 --> 00:54:48,580
able to do plus plus outside zach-bots

00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:50,980
altai Darcy to give a cookie badges is

00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:53,890
part answer only so we are towards

00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:56,980
slowly but we are moving towards few of

00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:58,480
their our application data / 10 3 one of

00:54:56,980 --> 00:55:01,000
the problem is getting the patterns we

00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:02,890
stuck in atl server to get decent report

00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:06,520
the curry session might actually i'll

00:55:02,890 --> 00:55:08,820
commit so something to see the other

00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:08,820
question

00:55:15,579 --> 00:55:22,329
it's there I don't know what the status

00:55:18,729 --> 00:55:25,059
is can I have my aunt is in the same

00:55:22,329 --> 00:55:27,940
place it has been where the stuff is all

00:55:25,059 --> 00:55:30,579
there it's just very dependent on my

00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:32,890
three not four time pics advanced

00:55:30,579 --> 00:55:35,999
there's not a lot of that so that's the

00:55:32,890 --> 00:55:35,999
only thing that's really stop

00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:46,400
that happens

00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:46,400
probably won't happen unless

00:55:47,079 --> 00:55:53,849
regular is it so it's dependent on

00:55:55,330 --> 00:56:02,680
it's been in progress for a long time

00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:05,430
yes it's just for progress it's what you

00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:05,430
think that I used

any other questions

00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:19,420
