	00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:11,340
alright guys welcome to my talk on

00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:13,440
Zonama translation platforms first

00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:18,060
apparently my cough that a bad show this

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:20,600
week so i'm coughing to spare Amelia so

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:23,630
do a brief introduction of myself

00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:26,189
working with the Red Hat at the moment

00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:28,050
from the google ization choking thing

00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:31,800
and the sauce senior software engineer

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,899
I've been joining Red Hat for five years

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:38,879
this year and been working on this

00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:44,489
project ever since and our team consists

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:47,579
of four full-time software engineer so

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:48,750
let us begin so these are the topics

00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:50,899
i'll be going through today what is

00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,520
another the workflow obviously

00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:57,719
translating cynara and what's coming up

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,820
in 4.0 release so we've got any

00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:04,489
questions in the during representation

00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,489
just let me know or interrupt me anytime

00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:11,880
so what is another sozin allah is a

00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:15,479
translation platform that used by

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:18,930
various community projects it will start

00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:20,640
as a tooling to help internal Red Hat

00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:23,880
translators look how with our clothes

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,670
and translation processes but then

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:29,840
evolve and get into the community of

00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:33,240
open source we are currently used by

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:36,450
internal Red Hat translators OpenStack

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,680
community and also fedora and as far as

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,090
I know there's a couple of our private

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,060
company that's actually using or

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:45,000
deployed your own snot instance using

00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:49,079
them by themselves so the data starts

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,579
off in 2008 and the main focus is how we

00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:52,829
can help the maintainer Zanda

00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:57,119
translators with their workflows in

00:01:52,829 --> 00:02:02,570
order to get your projects translate to

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,570
other main components that is I think

00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:09,290
important which is the server side and

00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:11,560
the coin design it is written in Java

00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:16,580
and JavaScript for the front end and

00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:19,190
running on MySQL databases and for

00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:22,880
fedora we're actually migrating my great

00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:25,190
honor for our packages in 2014 it is

00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:31,730
fully migrated now in further Agha it's

00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:32,990
not other boy so the server side so

00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:35,470
basically that's the back end of the

00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:39,610
hose another is the brain of the zenana

00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:43,490
it hosted in jboss the AP in internet

00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:47,020
handles user interactions with the rest

00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:52,490
api's and truly interface interactions

00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:55,250
persist data in the database and the

00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:58,070
line there process of migrating react

00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:00,320
jas from front end that's basically if

00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:02,540
you have noticed our front-end sexually

00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,520
using jsf at the moment it's been

00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:06,260
obsolete the technologies so we are

00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:09,440
currently migrating to react Jas to

00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:10,880
handle the the front end itself so

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,420
there's a couple of instances thats

00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:16,640
another has 40 open source community

00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:18,350
fedora does another the world is the one

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,840
dedicated for order for our packages

00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:23,150
we've got translators inaudible which is

00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,590
for the open source project so anyone

00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:26,930
can host there if they register

00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:29,390
themselves we also got jboss stop

00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:32,840
translate jboss was none other oh which

00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:36,290
is for jboss project itself and we've

00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:39,290
got one more instances in Sana'a

00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:41,530
internal and also OpenStack has their

00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:46,280
own instances which is OpenStack

00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:48,590
translate OpenStack the whole so all the

00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,989
four instances fedora translators

00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:54,560
another hole jboss and internal redhead

00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:56,300
is managed by the zenana team where else

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,080
the open set one there are ops team

00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,080
sexually handle it

00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:06,269
for a client site is a command line

00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:09,510
tools that I think mainly used by the

00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:11,370
maintainer it handles the command line

00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:14,220
interactions within our server so you do

00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:16,049
a push-pull getting some interactions of

00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:19,019
getting some data from the server itself

00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:24,600
and push shampoo source and translation

00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:26,790
files obviously so previously a thing in

00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,210
two years ago we have a Python client

00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:33,690
for Sanada itself the problem with that

00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:34,860
was having problems maintaining it in

00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:37,860
terms of keeping up with the

00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:40,229
technologies and there's no expertise of

00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,990
in terms of Python programmers in the

00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:45,389
team so currently it's maintained by

00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:46,970
community so it's not that up to date

00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:49,770
compared to the other coin that we have

00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:52,950
we have Java client which is currently

00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:54,810
maintained by the zenana team it has

00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:57,500
gone through a couple of migration

00:04:54,810 --> 00:05:01,050
before currently we are using a

00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:04,500
framework called zero install so what it

00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:07,229
does it helps the client to the package

00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:11,250
to multiple platforms so it supports in

00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:12,630
Mac OS Linux and windows that's the main

00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:16,200
problem that we have previously with the

00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:17,639
Python client where the users need to

00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,919
install different packages and different

00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,510
platform itself with zero install are

00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,520
basically it supports multiple platforms

00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:25,500
so all you need to do is just install 0

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,810
in store for either of the platforms

00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,789
operating systems then 0 install would

00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:31,830
handle the as another client through

00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:37,880
downloading some feet from the sinasu

00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:42,500
itself so we're talking about what floor

00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:45,270
so workflow ensenada as in general

00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:48,360
pushing operations mainly on pushing

00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:50,820
source files so to me the operations

00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,260
mainly done by maintain itself it's

00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:54,780
about pushing the resources that's been

00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:58,530
ready to Sanada and make it available to

00:05:54,780 --> 00:06:00,629
all the translators in red in ensenada

00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:03,249
to be able to start resonating

00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:07,749
that's two way off pushing source files

00:06:03,249 --> 00:06:11,169
using browser and using client for using

00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:13,659
browser obviously it's not recommended

00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:16,479
the reason I put it there because it's

00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:20,949
kind of like a one of operations where

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:23,259
do if you got emergence to push a single

00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:25,319
files without going to configure the

00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:27,759
configurations for that project itself

00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:29,589
then using browser is the is the best

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,899
way to go so all you need to do is to

00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:34,509
log in and you know go to the links and

00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:36,969
you can push it up straight away or

00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:38,499
upload it if you call it and the

00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:39,789
benefits of that is there's no extra

00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:41,769
installation which is does another

00:06:39,789 --> 00:06:45,369
client need it so you can basically a

00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:47,939
browser log in and done but a client

00:06:45,369 --> 00:06:50,769
self it's more recommended because

00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:52,479
basically with the project hosted

00:06:50,769 --> 00:06:54,189
ensenada there's a configuration files

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:57,569
attached to it which is causing out of

00:06:54,189 --> 00:06:59,619
XML and in that file there's a lot of

00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:02,559
configurations of the directories named

00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:04,119
the download the download of files the

00:07:02,559 --> 00:07:06,579
naming convention and everything is

00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:08,949
being set up by the maintainer so it's

00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:10,539
more recommended to use the client to

00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:13,360
actually push the source file because

00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:14,979
it's actually reading the exhibition XML

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,050
configurations and push it to the

00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:20,619
correct directories or the founding

00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:22,089
itself so using client is more

00:07:20,619 --> 00:07:24,490
appropriate and it can be automated

00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:28,499
because you can set up a con job

00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:28,499
basically to run the command line itself

00:07:31,769 --> 00:07:39,300
for pulling translations so it can be

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:42,369
done by maintain errs or the translators

00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,990
for the maintainer obviously they do it

00:07:42,369 --> 00:07:47,069
when the translation is finished or

00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:50,649
completed and ready to be packaged and

00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:52,779
sing it to the repository for the

00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:55,089
translators I would imagine it's mainly

00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:58,629
for previewing your work after the

00:07:55,089 --> 00:08:03,099
translation has been done and thing

00:07:58,629 --> 00:08:05,409
mainly be done by the QA as well to

00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:07,390
build up the test instances or the

00:08:05,409 --> 00:08:10,720
documents and have a

00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:13,300
view or QA on that again it can be done

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,310
by browser and client browser is easier

00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:18,340
just click on and download the file

00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:21,190
straight away it's the same benefits and

00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:23,680
same pros and cons as the pushing of

00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:25,330
source files so using browser obviously

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:29,830
it's a quick preview of translated

00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:32,980
documents a quick way to QE or get the

00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:35,340
resources that's been done ensenada but

00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:38,770
it's not recommended for the reputable

00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:41,290
operations using client again it's the

00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:42,790
same it can be automated it's more

00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:45,130
controlled because the configuration is

00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:50,110
there and everything and it's more

00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:52,930
recommended it's more stable in a way so

00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:57,910
this is diagram for overall diagram for

00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:59,350
the workflow in de nada so you got the g

00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:01,360
itself is actually clear across three I

00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:04,420
can't find a better icon for that so I'm

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:07,270
sorry so you've got a maintainer or the

00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:10,810
writer that actually push and pull

00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:12,520
translations from sonata and you've got

00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:14,500
a translator that actually only handles

00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:17,500
translations ensenada so you're going to

00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:21,100
only translate in strings and the

00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:22,720
maintainer actually sinking the after

00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,190
pulling the translation sinking it to

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,460
the repository and built the

00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:30,720
documentation or the package itself so

00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:33,370
overall this is the well this is the

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,960
simplified versions of the operations

00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:36,820
obviously there's a lot of back end

00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,960
stuff happening when building on

00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:42,640
documents there's a different process

00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:44,410
and also when building package as well

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:52,860
there's a lot of happening in the back

00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:55,270
end so translate ensenada so in general

00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:59,290
obviously when I put up the slides I

00:09:55,270 --> 00:10:03,450
didn't obviously I forgot about the

00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:03,450
processes in fedora where you need to

00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:11,250
forget the processes in fedora where you

00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:14,970
need to register in the mailing list and

00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:17,400
introduce yourself goof and the

00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:20,070
processes of a translator to be able to

00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,630
contribute into fedora translations so

00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:25,620
what I put it there is actually the

00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:28,530
process for for Sanada itself so from

00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:31,260
the data point of view user just need to

00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:33,720
have an account ensenada and you are a

00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:36,420
member of a language team so the process

00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,820
would be you register yourself you get

00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:41,130
an activation email for your account

00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:43,650
then after that you request to join a

00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:46,860
language team so obviously for fedoras

00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:48,800
process is a bit different as far as I

00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:51,540
know you need to join mailing list and

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,150
you need to request for joining a

00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:55,830
membership in the language team and up

00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:58,590
to the team coordinator to approved it

00:10:55,830 --> 00:11:03,210
and then you can start to contribute

00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:05,940
into the Fedora translations so that's

00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:09,420
the general platform mostly all projects

00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:13,160
in Zanna we also recently introduced a

00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:16,350
project security so it's more like a

00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:19,530
more tighter control projects for

00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:21,450
translations so for the in the project

00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:23,910
setting itself you can actually set

00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:26,730
invite only in the security in the

00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:29,940
Security tab so what that means is if

00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:31,410
it's set it's only a set of users or

00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:34,350
translators can actually translate

00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:37,170
ensenada rather than all the people that

00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:39,390
are actually registered ensenada so it's

00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:43,080
more controlled environment it's

00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:44,700
actually focused more for like a

00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,710
corporate projects where you don't want

00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:49,310
anyone to be able to translate in the

00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:51,810
project itself you just want to tightly

00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:54,570
secure it and you only trust the set of

00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:57,410
people that's the whole idea for that

00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:57,410
feature

00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:07,280
now for translate obviously if you guys

00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:10,640
have been using it that's an editor that

00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:14,180
you guys go into it's an interface that

00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:15,980
is actually written in Java but it's we

00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:19,870
have a framework called GWT that

00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:22,070
actually converts it into JavaScript and

00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:26,450
it's an interface for translated

00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:28,700
translate it supports concurrent editing

00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:30,410
for multiple users so if multiple users

00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:32,270
actually in the same entry when editing

00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:36,190
you can actually see their name in there

00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:40,250
and try to avoid the conflict

00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:41,980
translations in an entry now the last

00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:44,600
point new improved editor is in progress

00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:46,070
if you guys have been seeing it there's

00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:50,270
a small hi column to talk to the editor

00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:52,400
saying help I editor so that's the new

00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:55,880
migration that we move to react jas

00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:58,310
which I mentioned earlier so in that new

00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:00,470
editor we ask you working on it at the

00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:02,240
moment is in alpha state so we are track

00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:04,580
we are slowly migrating all the features

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:08,590
deaths in the current editor into the

00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:11,180
new editor itself so keep an eye on that

00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:15,140
it also supports with the new editor

00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:17,510
supports responsive design so that means

00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:19,670
if you try to view it in a smaller

00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:25,400
screen or in a mobile it was support

00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:26,600
that so in the editor itself I call it

00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,060
help her with some people called

00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,830
different names there's couple of

00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:34,130
features in the editor that helps with

00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:35,750
the translations so it's a translation

00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:38,360
memory and glossary at the bottom with

00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:41,090
you if you in the existent view existing

00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,820
view in the editor itself it acts as a

00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:46,040
reference for translators during

00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:48,560
translations you get to see what has

00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:52,720
been translated ensenada in the past and

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:56,930
has been approved or safe as translated

00:13:52,720 --> 00:14:00,170
for glossary at the moment it's upload

00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:03,190
by admin so it acts as kind of a

00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:06,380
dictionary for the translator itself so

00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:07,230
glossary is not as updated as

00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,150
translation member

00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:11,640
because it's it's by problem so it

00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:14,160
depends on the admin that actually

00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:17,160
uploading it for translation memory it

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,930
can be from any projects ensenada so any

00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,300
translation that has been approved or

00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:23,970
save it will instantly show up in your

00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:26,250
next translation when you actually

00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:27,870
translating a string it was searched

00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:29,490
photo matching ones and it will display

00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:37,380
at the bottom there to help you guys to

00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:48,720
translate I'm going pretty fast here any

00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:51,090
questions no good so at the moment in

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,130
fedora doctrine in fedora does another

00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:59,610
hole the version is three point nine

00:14:53,130 --> 00:15:01,710
point three there's a it was 392 as of

00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:04,110
last week but this week is string a tree

00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:07,290
the reason was there's a there's a bug

00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:12,120
fix urgent bug fix on the login info

00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:14,310
derive so yep it was that the main

00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,920
problem was the Unicode itself where if

00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:19,590
you've got a Unicode in in fedora on

00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:22,140
your full name or in your name it will

00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:27,480
create problems so it's a it's a problem

00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:30,480
in in tonight sir but so the next one we

00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:32,820
expect to come out is 4.0 that would be

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,470
in three months time so we just released

00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:36,330
Rayna tree so three months on we try to

00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:39,240
release it every three months and every

00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:41,190
six months there's a major release so in

00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:45,990
next three months hopefully we can see

00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:47,940
4.0 so the features that we have in 4.0

00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:50,130
there's couple of changes in the UI

00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:54,360
itself and some extra features in the

00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:57,360
front end dr. image for developers and

00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,970
quick starts or from what the feedback

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,850
that we got from some of the

00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:05,910
contributors to Zinara it's very hard to

00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:08,130
set up cynara india in the machines so

00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:09,840
we have provided a docker image where

00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:12,900
you can start up a spin up a container

00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:15,420
and start up straight away easily and I

00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:19,380
can pretty much start coding itself

00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:24,240
you want to the first release of the

00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:27,180
Nara sing so the not a thing is a site

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:30,570
projects that we do around the nada the

00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:34,830
focus was the idea was to help up with

00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:38,490
the workflow that we have our own so if

00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:39,770
you look at the workflow just now so if

00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:42,840
you look at the push and pull

00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:44,340
translations and sync repository at the

00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:46,790
moment it's done by the maintainer

00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:50,400
manually or he can set up a cron jumped

00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:52,800
so that's another thing projects is to

00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:57,480
automate that tree processes so

00:16:52,800 --> 00:17:01,080
basically it's a scheduling system where

00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:03,680
a maintainer goes in there set up some

00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:08,040
are put in some settings point it to the

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:11,340
project's URL or project settings then

00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:13,410
in the in the time or in the schedule

00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:16,380
that he set up it would actually push

00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:19,650
sources from the repository to Sanada

00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:22,140
and pull translations sing it back to

00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:24,660
the repository so it depends on the

00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:27,690
configurations so he can set up every

00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:29,010
hourly or daily stuff ladder that were

00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:32,190
done so it will automate the whole

00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:34,680
process so it would eliminate the need

00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:36,960
for installing is another coin on your

00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,570
local machines worrying about all the

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,920
source is not updated ensenada

00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:43,410
translator translator is not getting the

00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:45,480
the latest source string ensenada the

00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:48,060
translating is a the effort for

00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,740
translate all the ostrich is wasted so

00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:57,060
that's another thing project would

00:17:49,740 --> 00:18:00,810
automate all that process and and it

00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:02,220
supports only that the same login as an

00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:04,140
Anna so you don't need to register a new

00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:07,470
account so use the existing account

00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:09,300
although is a separate service but it

00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:11,780
uses the same login as what you had no

00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,780
means an hour

00:18:12,169 --> 00:18:21,820
what is going on in and resourceful

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:28,170
and they've been asking to been making

00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:28,170
some cosmetics yes yes once I folks are

00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:37,630
at the moment yeah so at the moment we

00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,370
don't have that yet but that's because

00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:40,750
it's a new project so we try to take a

00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:43,510
step by step so we're trying to do the

00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:45,430
first release then we will provide I

00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:47,230
know I don't know if you guys use

00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:48,640
Jenkins before but there's a lot of good

00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:50,980
features in there where you can see the

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,520
logs the history and all the job status

00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:55,600
so we try to have that then as well

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,460
obviously it's going to take time but

00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,860
the main focus right now is to have it

00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:02,170
working with the basic sinking so to

00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:03,760
automate that three processes first then

00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:08,050
we can add in more features in the

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:10,540
future the idea was allowed maintainer

00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:12,760
to have an easy life they don't need to

00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,900
worry about oh I need to push I forgot

00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,510
to push the source string when it's

00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:18,100
updated tues another or pulling the

00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:19,300
latest translation from tonight that's

00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,580
that the worry that you don't need to

00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:23,170
worry about it it's a setup then he

00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:29,800
would done it automatically in the back

00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:32,680
end now the next one is project-based

00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:36,130
glossary at the moment the glossary

00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:39,340
itself its global meaning that it's it

00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:42,040
applies to all projects ensenada one of

00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:43,330
the feedback that we got was some of the

00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,520
projects prefer to have their own

00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:47,080
context and that's a lot of problem for

00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,050
the translators because different

00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:52,390
projects same word has different context

00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:55,990
and translating it would be a lot

00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:59,320
difficult so what the request was we

00:19:55,990 --> 00:20:01,930
need a project glossary again this was

00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:04,300
based the idea was coming from the

00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:06,210
external parties where they want to have

00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:08,050
a more controlled environment and

00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:10,270
therefore they want to have their own

00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:12,790
glossary to reduce or reference by the

00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:14,800
translators so meaning that that word

00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:16,930
should be translated in that way or it

00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:20,290
shouldn't be translated so that's why

00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:24,030
the project glossary is introduced so it

00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:24,030
will be in 4.0 and

00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:31,480
and also the existing glossary the

00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:35,200
feature will be improved after to you

00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:37,570
guys later on some previews for 4.0 but

00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,060
we have improved the existing glossary

00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:42,070
where if you assign to a row you can

00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:45,640
actually add it glossary itself ensenada

00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:48,070
now so unlike previously you need to do

00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:50,530
it outside another push it to the nada

00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:53,500
by admin but now you can actually edit

00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:58,600
in Ensenada but it doesn't keep the

00:20:53,500 --> 00:21:01,560
history as it doesn't before so just be

00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,560
careful when you're editing glossary

00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:12,880
sorry is their plan the history there

00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:15,400
are talks on that we were still

00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,350
evaluating on on whether it's worth the

00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,060
effort of doing that or not because at

00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:20,560
the end of the day it's a glossary it's

00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:22,420
a dictionary right it's not like a

00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,850
translation memory where we need to keep

00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:27,430
track of the contributors that the

00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:30,040
contributions or for individuals or or

00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:31,660
the history of the translation where it

00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,670
goes bad and stuff like that it's just a

00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:35,890
glossary is just a dictionary so we're

00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:37,450
still evaluating on whether we we want

00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:40,360
to put in the effort of of having that

00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:43,140
or not because that would hugely they

00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:46,650
would increase hugely on the database

00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:46,650
sizes obviously

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,470
yes so that there are a couple we are

00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:58,690
actually we are having a sack projects

00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:02,760
of how we improve the storage we have

00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:02,760
been looking on document based database

00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:17,230
yeah yeah so we have explored some of

00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:20,110
the options so that there are a couple

00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:21,490
of ways so when when doing that

00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:23,260
obviously that the main thing that we

00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:25,420
want to migrate is the current

00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:27,220
translation memory it's a huge data in

00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:31,180
database at the moment running on MySQL

00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:34,570
so so if we were to migrate to different

00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:35,860
database then translation memory is the

00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:37,660
first one that we go to my questions

00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:39,910
because it would improve usually on the

00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:41,860
performance then we were looking at the

00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:45,880
glossary move there as well so it's

00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:51,610
going to be step-by-step the last point

00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:52,780
is integration with fedora so for the

00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:56,680
recent few months we've been

00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:59,920
concentrating on integrating with the

00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:01,330
systems so a couple of systems so from

00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,840
Fedora point of view we are trying to

00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:09,520
integrate with the Fedora batch and

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:13,060
further our house as mentioned earlier

00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:15,160
this morning Fedora hubs is the upcoming

00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:19,210
projects for fedora where it tracks all

00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:22,480
the activities of the in the federal

00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:23,830
community so 11 other requests 11 of the

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,480
early experiment they want to do or

00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:27,550
prototypes these two halves and at our

00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:30,490
feet information about the translation

00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:32,640
activities into their systems so

00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:35,410
previously we already done some of the

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:38,560
implementation on that this one is just

00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:42,330
an improve on the previous versions so

00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:47,710
there will be extra information feed on

00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:50,920
the 10 messages and obviously the badges

00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:52,690
itself voice is the same web hook that

00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:54,350
what we call it back cool because it

00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:56,480
actually fires a message to

00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:58,039
system so it's the same message that's

00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,200
going to be used by the badge and this

00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:05,510
fedora helps to to actually have those

00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:08,650
help them consume the message in

00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:11,030
progress again it's the editor itself

00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:14,030
it's a big thing because we have been

00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:18,080
trying to push it for over a year but

00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:19,669
almost a year now since it comes up the

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,280
reason being was there's a lot of

00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:24,710
changes in the back end where we have

00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:26,419
used the old technologies where it's

00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:29,120
already obsolete so we try to migrate to

00:24:26,419 --> 00:24:30,590
new technologies so it's taken us take

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,900
taken us a lot of time to actually

00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:34,760
migrate that but we have got to the

00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:36,409
point where we will start migrating some

00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:38,120
of the features from the o editor into

00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:43,640
the new ones so hopefully you'll be

00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:46,970
ready to be used soon and new plugins in

00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:49,460
general sing so as I mentioned just now

00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:51,890
the last thing is a project to automate

00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:54,380
the process it's actually designed in a

00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:57,590
plug-in based systems so you can write

00:24:54,380 --> 00:25:01,010
as as many plugins as you want so the

00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:03,169
idea was not only you can sing to a git

00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:05,990
repository but you can write plugins to

00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:09,110
svn repository or CVS repository someone

00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:11,809
is using it still or even to other

00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:15,500
systems so it's its main purpose is to

00:25:11,809 --> 00:25:17,659
sink a push-pull source files into into

00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:19,789
sanada and get transition file into

00:25:17,659 --> 00:25:22,730
somewhere else so that somewhere else

00:25:19,789 --> 00:25:25,159
can be a boss tree or any repository or

00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:26,840
any system so as long as the plug-in is

00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:28,760
there it would be able to do that

00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:31,429
automate it would be able to automate

00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:34,700
that whole process itself so the idea is

00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:36,020
to obviously we first start off as get

00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,990
because that's the most commonly used

00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:41,150
repository but in the future we're

00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:48,350
probably looking at some of the systems

00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:49,640
probably some of the subversion is one

00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:54,140
of them because someone is still using

00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:58,250
that and one of systems drupal's which

00:25:54,140 --> 00:26:01,250
is having their own translation

00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:03,440
management but we were hoping sanada can

00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:04,460
do some sort of syncing with them to

00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,630
actually have

00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:09,800
the resources available in Drupal's but

00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:11,630
that's that's the whole idea is that

00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,100
that's the whole idea for the plug-in

00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:15,890
based system you can write as many as

00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:18,800
you want and as long as it can be it has

00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:22,330
a REST API is that that supports it we

00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:22,330
will be able to sync it with another

00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:32,480
actually that's the last slide it's

00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:36,050
pretty fast so again any contribution is

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:40,520
welcome ensenada I know there's a lot of

00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:42,170
Python programmers in fedora but if you

00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:45,980
know a bit of Java or you got any

00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:50,570
feature requests that you want to try

00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:52,700
out with Java please do it's easy with

00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:59,290
the doctors right now you can spin it up

00:26:52,700 --> 00:27:02,290
straight away but yeah that's about it

00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:02,290
questions

00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:09,880
so the requirement of me was not on the

00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:19,690
projector homework and stuff I quite a

00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:22,509
little beauty quiet so okay so that's

00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:24,490
that the questions it involve a couple

00:27:22,509 --> 00:27:26,980
process so if you understand the whole

00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:29,649
process it the project's needs to start

00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:32,289
off with internationalisation where you

00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:34,600
externalize the string so the most

00:27:32,289 --> 00:27:37,059
common one is going pop files right but

00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:40,539
the recent one you can see in JSON files

00:27:37,059 --> 00:27:43,090
or XML files or ex Leif projects or

00:27:40,539 --> 00:27:45,370
property files for java so there's a

00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:47,440
couple of formats so the nada supports

00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:50,830
all of them well not all of them but are

00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:53,019
the majority of them so if you look at

00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:54,789
these another XML or when you create a

00:27:53,019 --> 00:27:57,490
project ensenada it would ask you what

00:27:54,789 --> 00:27:59,110
project have you are then if when you

00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:01,539
push it it would actually scan for a

00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:04,629
certain extension of the files so if you

00:28:01,539 --> 00:28:06,850
set it like you are a java project it

00:28:04,629 --> 00:28:10,059
was getting for doc property part if you

00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:13,960
scanning for if you sell it for actually

00:28:10,059 --> 00:28:22,929
it would look for xml files so there are

00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:25,299
a couple of them for your yes pop art as

00:28:22,929 --> 00:28:30,629
the source files then pull boss is a

00:28:25,299 --> 00:28:30,629
transitional server if feels like I know

00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:40,740
at the moment an artisan supported but

00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:44,190
if you look if you set up your projects

00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:48,299
as in i believe is a python projects you

00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:50,159
can set up easily to explore eyes the

00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:54,509
string or internationalize it as you say

00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:56,309
so I believe while I'm not entirely sure

00:28:54,509 --> 00:28:58,470
but most of the programmers if you

00:28:56,309 --> 00:28:59,970
actually develop a package you would

00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:02,809
have a fair bit of idea what you should

00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:05,970
do to have your package prepare to be

00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:09,960
translated so don't have that files

00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:13,889
ready so that's why there's a lot of

00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:16,049
confusion where where a program will

00:29:13,889 --> 00:29:18,389
write a program is not internationalized

00:29:16,049 --> 00:29:23,100
and please translate my package is not

00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:25,559
work it doesn't work that way but having

00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:28,470
said that in 4.0 we are trying to

00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:30,749
centralize everything so you no longer

00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:34,230
endure the idea was you no longer have

00:29:30,749 --> 00:29:36,480
to select the project time you just

00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:39,389
create a project then sanada itself

00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,399
would be smart enough to figure out what

00:29:39,389 --> 00:29:45,299
type of project is there so that's

00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:48,539
that's the whole idea we are still

00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:52,350
working on that so hopefully you'll see

00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:54,779
that very soon now with with the new

00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:57,809
endpoint it actually supports ODT

00:29:54,779 --> 00:30:00,950
flowers as well so audio open office or

00:29:57,809 --> 00:30:05,279
Libre Office file formats so the slides

00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:13,139
the LibreOffice writers format so ODT

00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:15,299
ldp HTML even dot srt wittich which is a

00:30:13,139 --> 00:30:17,759
subtitle files if i'm not mistaken for

00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:21,179
for videos so it's also supported by

00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:25,019
advising on the upcoming one is JSON

00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:28,289
files so it is largely used now by a lot

00:30:25,019 --> 00:30:31,350
of the projects JavaScript projects so

00:30:28,289 --> 00:30:33,740
we try to support it as well so that's

00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:43,940
the whole idea of

00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:49,640
4444 the file projects types of files I

00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:49,640
have a project with my own hands yeah

00:30:49,770 --> 00:31:00,340
yep so at the moment if you are doing it

00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:02,260
through browser yes you can but if

00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:05,140
you're using it if you try to upload it

00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:08,350
using client then it doesn't support it

00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:10,960
because in client we we have some rules

00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:13,930
where it only scans for one specific

00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:16,870
part time but if you're using browser

00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:19,720
you can actually upload multiple file

00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:27,790
types ODT or TP multiple file type skin

00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:29,320
a single project so it should be a

00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:32,800
different type projects because

00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:34,000
obviously yeah yeah so the the idea was

00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:37,810
about to give you a bit of background

00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:41,470
that the client was created on pop oh

00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:43,960
yeah text format as the first for me so

00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:46,030
the intelligence of the rules that we

00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:48,850
put in there is to have only one single

00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:50,290
time but as the project grows and more

00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:51,970
and more different types of projects

00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:53,350
there's a lot of departments to coming

00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:55,000
up saying that or we want to support

00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:57,550
multiple files hiding in the single

00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,140
project for instance there's a month

00:31:57,550 --> 00:32:03,190
down with dot properties actually

00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:05,590
request from internal Red Hat so so at

00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:06,880
the moment yes we are using browser to

00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:09,910
actually have look all those files and

00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,410
ensenada but hopefully we can improve

00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:15,940
the client of the supports that in the

00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:20,190
future with the file project type that I

00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:24,120
mentioned earlier that the new improved

00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:26,860
project type the client does support it

00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:29,980
we were still working on it but if you

00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:31,420
use file project type which is a so you

00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,980
don't need to specify any projects that

00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:35,950
you want you just need to put what

00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:37,780
extension you want to include during the

00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:45,460
scanning process it would actually

00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:47,690
supports it so it's a leaf is in 4.0 so

00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:52,120
hopefully we can see that

00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:52,120
yeah it's there to support monica volvo

00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:57,279
ocean

00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:14,740
liked it yep listen bad and needs to be

00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:17,470
invited but how how how it works that's

00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:22,020
happening in invited as in the projects

00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:24,880
security checked yeah yeah so again that

00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:27,430
sorry the security the extra security

00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:29,260
check is it's up for it's a decision

00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:32,320
from the maintainer is from the package

00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:33,940
maintainer right so if there is a

00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,130
package maintainers say okay I only

00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:37,210
trust at this set of people I only want

00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:40,870
this set of people to transmit my

00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:42,580
projects so be so obviously he's

00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:44,410
obviously that the project would be

00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:46,210
limited to that set of people for folded

00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:52,210
all the translated translation effort

00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:54,820
right but if you set it that way that

00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:57,160
means the all the translator that has

00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:58,930
been approved by fedora that goes in and

00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:01,000
translate will not be able to translate

00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:03,420
your project so what the project

00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,400
maintainer does is actually limiting the

00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:08,710
the possible translation that he can

00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,720
have from all the contributors in a

00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:12,780
project itself but it's up to him

00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,980
because it's his decision to actually

00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:19,150
say that I only trust of this set of

00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:23,260
people yeah we were very devil keen no

00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:24,599
but my question was like they say I want

00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:27,940
to compute

00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:31,929
prostate and I want to contribute in

00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:38,169
dogs here what are the steps I have to

00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:40,529
follow away like okay to be honest I I

00:34:38,169 --> 00:34:44,829
don't have the exact answer I believe

00:34:40,529 --> 00:34:47,230
Noriko has which is that so I believe

00:34:44,829 --> 00:34:53,379
that that's a whip wiki page that has

00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:59,380
all the steps yes but in the case of

00:34:53,379 --> 00:35:04,420
dogs it ends in Selma in a linear

00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:10,720
medallist amy i actually live and I'm

00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:13,029
not there I mean routine okay so it's

00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:16,119
actually the coordinators that's that's

00:35:13,029 --> 00:35:17,799
not approving that then so you should

00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:20,170
you should contact the coordinators or i

00:35:17,799 --> 00:35:23,859
can i can look it up for you i can

00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:25,900
approve it if you want so as i mentioned

00:35:23,859 --> 00:35:28,240
earlier the four instances that i

00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:30,910
mentioned the fedoras nada or translates

00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:33,069
another jboss and the internalized

00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:36,490
or handle is all managed by design on

00:35:33,069 --> 00:35:38,920
our team right so thus analogy is an

00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:40,809
admin in order for instances but having

00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:42,910
said that for the fedora instance is a

00:35:40,809 --> 00:35:45,190
bit different we don't interfere with

00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:48,849
the the request for the further or

00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:55,930
instance is all done by noriko and one

00:35:48,849 --> 00:35:58,539
of the guys yes so Noriko and peter is

00:35:55,930 --> 00:36:01,900
actually handling the administration of

00:35:58,539 --> 00:36:03,789
the Dorados a none at all we only we

00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:05,349
want designer if you wanna interfere if

00:36:03,789 --> 00:36:07,270
they're sent if there's a bug that we

00:36:05,349 --> 00:36:10,720
need to go in or we need to debug the

00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:12,839
systems so for fedora instance a bit

00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:16,059
different so if you've got any problems

00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:17,770
with approving your your language team

00:36:16,059 --> 00:36:20,140
approved by a language team or you have

00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:22,270
problems with logging in or stuff like

00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:24,069
that you should contact Noriko you

00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:28,200
should be able to help you to actually

00:36:24,069 --> 00:36:28,200
push the coordinator to approve it

00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:42,970
yes yeah yeah demos on the stock in here

00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:42,970
right

00:36:55,190 --> 00:37:02,270
alright just need to see it that way so

00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:08,960
this is the this is just a quick preview

00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:12,490
of what 4.0 will look like so this is

00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:15,940
running on my local instance so and to

00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:15,940
find my link

00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:37,260
actually I should show you let me show

00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:41,310
the personal statistics first in the in

00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:46,620
the current versions so soon as you log

00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:48,420
in sorry if you are not login you'll be

00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:55,380
able to see the profile but not the

00:37:48,420 --> 00:38:05,220
statistics yeah so if you do a search

00:37:55,380 --> 00:38:07,590
here let's say Noriko so you can see the

00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:11,580
statistic here and you can select the

00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:20,460
timeframe and we actually got an API to

00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:26,310
to have that sorry that was in 3.8 if

00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:34,590
i'm not mistaken sorry come on oh it's a

00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:42,800
bit sensitive now so probably the last

00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:42,800
one is ever had it's actually being busy

00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:48,609
yeah so for Mariko it's a bit different

00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:50,440
right she's not a full-time translator

00:38:48,609 --> 00:38:53,920
anymore she is managing the team so

00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:56,530
she's not doing any translations so I'd

00:38:53,920 --> 00:39:02,619
love to make her look so bad so let's

00:38:56,530 --> 00:39:04,210
not continue but but yeah that that's

00:39:02,619 --> 00:39:26,380
basically the page to see the statistics

00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:29,830
yes easily accessible like you and you

00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:33,750
know who was the last edit oh and is the

00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:36,849
night that there's no need to that yes

00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:39,670
wouldn't be some improvement yes if i

00:39:36,849 --> 00:39:42,790
click on japanese because she's she's

00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:45,099
not whatever she's Germans and that the

00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:47,470
japanese media that she's part of the

00:39:45,099 --> 00:39:50,080
japanese team denim and if i click on

00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:53,050
japanese teen will it be possible to

00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:55,210
have this to have an idea of your

00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:58,599
activity of the japanese team the whole

00:39:55,210 --> 00:40:01,690
team yes work and because it is possible

00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:04,510
to be honest is another have a lot of

00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:07,900
information updates we keep every every

00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:09,670
data on every translation that all the

00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:12,339
individuals has been meeting have it has

00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:14,380
has made right so that's that's a lot of

00:40:12,339 --> 00:40:16,780
valuable data in there it's just how we

00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:18,070
actually present them ensenada what sort

00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:21,520
of information that we need to show

00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:25,480
ensenada so we are currently working to

00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:28,089
improve our project page project /

00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:29,800
version page at the moment it is

00:40:28,089 --> 00:40:31,599
separated to page right so you got a

00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:33,580
project page with a list of versions

00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:35,560
then in a version page you've got the

00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:37,839
document list or the language list and

00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:39,550
the documents so we try to change we try

00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:42,160
to combine all this into one single page

00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:44,589
where you can actually only see well

00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,630
it's only highlight the language that

00:40:44,589 --> 00:40:48,400
you actually join in so you don't need

00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:50,050
to go through all the languages click on

00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,420
that and select documents to translate

00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:53,829
so it's going to straight up with your

00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:57,450
languages that you have

00:40:53,829 --> 00:41:00,160
you have joined then it will have some

00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:02,319
useful information by useful information

00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:04,619
I was in the recent activities for these

00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:06,729
projects or for these versions and

00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:10,150
that's something that would interest

00:41:06,729 --> 00:41:13,029
most of the translators to have at easy

00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:14,849
access well to make them easy access to

00:41:13,029 --> 00:41:18,069
the to the recent updated project

00:41:14,849 --> 00:41:19,329
documents in the project itself so we

00:41:18,069 --> 00:41:23,229
are currently working on the prototype

00:41:19,329 --> 00:41:26,380
for that page so hopefully it would save

00:41:23,229 --> 00:41:27,339
a lot of problems where the so one more

00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,630
complaints that we come from the

00:41:27,339 --> 00:41:31,719
translator was they need to go through

00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:33,640
the list of the languages and summer if

00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:35,499
it's if it's tie with Z then obviously

00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:37,420
the scroller at the bottom and slack on

00:41:35,499 --> 00:41:39,969
that and stuff for that so yeah that

00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:49,390
that would actually solve all those

00:41:39,969 --> 00:41:52,079
problems for for the individuals not not

00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:52,079
at the moment but

00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:07,210
yeah I say to him look at the Vietnam

00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:12,720
this year I own nine percent him and

00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:12,720
they release difference late under which

00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:23,230
yes well jet generally I would say well

00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:25,180
it's my personal opinion I would say we

00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:28,060
tried not to create a competitive

00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:30,190
environments in the package itself but

00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:31,800
it's a different opinion right some some

00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:36,690
people loves it because you can improve

00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:39,510
the performance in different teams so

00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:42,280
it's it's a good idea i would say

00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:44,200
perhaps not so much of comparing between

00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:47,080
two people but you can select a set of

00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:49,590
people to show it in the screen yes i

00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:49,590
agree

00:42:54,560 --> 00:43:01,730
yes every time you not confront people

00:42:57,150 --> 00:43:01,730
as a reward yes yes

00:43:07,009 --> 00:43:13,410
yeah so it comes down to the whole idea

00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:16,410
of integrating with the Fedora badges

00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:19,170
system so that feat itself would

00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:21,269
actually send a message to fedora

00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:24,079
messages that the fat message and they

00:43:21,269 --> 00:43:26,549
would consume it and there will be

00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:43,109
implemented implementation on that side

00:43:26,549 --> 00:43:45,690
22 to actually situation 24 seconds

00:43:43,109 --> 00:43:48,450
searay but no other group temperature

00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:52,400
right now it means for everybody who can

00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:52,400
hit videos Patrick

00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:16,750
fast fast books price of an ID there is

00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:21,010
the risk of the same when its power goes

00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:23,490
into Jerusalem track you may get two

00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:23,490
important

00:44:34,039 --> 00:44:50,700
which is reviewed yes so it goes back to

00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:54,059
the initial process where how to join in

00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:55,589
in the Fedora translators process right

00:44:54,059 --> 00:44:56,970
so if you look at the wiki page you

00:44:55,589 --> 00:44:59,099
should actually start with the door

00:44:56,970 --> 00:45:01,430
offers before you join us another so you

00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:03,750
have everything set up in in fedora

00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:06,690
except the CL in and everything then

00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:09,210
only you sign up in ensenada that's

00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:11,160
that's the whole idea because from from

00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:15,440
another point of view we try not to

00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:15,440
interfere with the login system yeah

00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:28,579
yeah I am so much

00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:28,579
I had more than serious crew mm-hmm

00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:41,890
well I can move a monster but that's it

00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:44,230
you know what is nice because yeah but I

00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:45,970
i would say it's it's not something that

00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:56,440
Sanada can handle because it's an

00:45:45,970 --> 00:46:09,609
entirely fedora system so yeah it is

00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:17,290
infrastructure yes what and we know the

00:46:09,609 --> 00:46:19,920
classrooms my name is we have to we have

00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:19,920
to find

00:46:26,009 --> 00:46:34,119
the US 10 now and that's impossible

00:46:31,329 --> 00:46:46,589
which is no data i gived winners and we

00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:54,489
need to delay to create a new one but

00:46:46,589 --> 00:47:01,390
just one yes the first page senator yep

00:46:54,489 --> 00:47:03,819
will be possible to write it so we would

00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:07,809
make sure the end users the translator

00:47:03,819 --> 00:47:11,079
if they write with by in Seneca they say

00:47:07,809 --> 00:47:16,330
okay you are there you are under federal

00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:20,940
translation what this is when I'm fine

00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:23,980
information and yes weighs less yes

00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:27,970
definitely the right the connection web

00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:37,770
page it doesn't have access and so if I

00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:37,770
survive this link yes we can release

00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:46,120
communication yes the front page is it

00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:49,030
can be easily added by by the admin it

00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:50,230
is customizable in every instances so if

00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:52,150
you look at it OpenStack one they have

00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:54,550
different in front end because I mean

00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:57,730
putting the informations so at the

00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:59,680
moment I believe ya again is the non

00:47:57,730 --> 00:48:02,020
noriko the hands of that so if you need

00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:07,350
some information that's in the front

00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:07,350
page please do contact Noriko or myself

00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:21,990
yes so I'm trying to yes

00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:37,690
yes you need to have an account ensenada

00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:42,250
that's it well I don't have it ready

00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:45,130
right here but i'll show it to you or

00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:48,070
pointed to you later on the link so the

00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:49,930
api's actually allows you to extract the

00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:52,630
list of contributors over a period of

00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:54,370
time so you can get the username then

00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:56,440
you can fire up a second request to get

00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:58,650
your contributions over a period of one

00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:01,990
year so whichever one year that you are

00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:03,820
365 days so from there you can get all

00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:05,350
the informations about how much that

00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:12,400
person actually come to be that during

00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:14,100
that time yes yes so I have am having

00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:22,120
problem connecting to internet right now

00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:25,290
