Title: Flock 2016 - What's Fedora's alternative to vi httpd.conf?, Owen Taylor
Publication date: 2016-08-21
Playlist: Flock 2016
Description: 
	The most traditional way to do server development on a Linux workstation is to treat your workstation like a server: install the dependencies, put your code in a system directory, and edit the web server config. The idea of an ostree-based workstation with a fixed system image would make this impossible: a workstation doesn't have the web server or development dependencies installed systemwide, but it's not the best way to do things for many other reasons: the project may need versions of dependencies that are newer or older than what your workstation has, different projects may have conflicting dependencies, its hard to go from development to deployment, and so forth. There are no shortage of options for alternate ways to develop: Docker, Vagrant, Python's virtualenv, and many more, each with lots of subvariants. But with all these options out there, how do we guide users to ways that work well, and that let them leverage the Fedora ecosystem? And how do we provide integration with standard Workstation components like the terminal, GNOME Boxes, and with IDEs to make the experience truly slick and compelling?

so um I'm Owen Taylor for those of you

00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:12,110
don't know me I am work at Red Hat I

00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:14,309
have a role as the architect for our

00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:17,760
workstation efforts that means that I

00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:20,130
mostly do a lot of both planning tasks

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,039
and coordination between workstation and

00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:26,939
red hats server products and do some

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,830
more things on the Fedora side so my

00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:33,750
title by talk may be competing for the

00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:36,270
most obscure title of the conference but

00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:40,710
a so it's talk talk is what's fedoras

00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:41,879
alternative to vi httpd com so why

00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,890
everybody we talked to me about is how

00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:45,840
we move from the old-fashioned way of

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:49,170
doing development the way of doing

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,640
development that was a good idea when it

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,620
was amazing that you had this this

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,190
length computer that was just like a

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:58,320
server but you was on your desk and to a

00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,149
more modern web development they would

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,640
make sense in the new world of

00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:04,949
containers and virtual machines when you

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,510
don't really have to have your

00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:07,830
workstation and your server via exactly

00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:14,180
the same thing and how can we take

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:18,960
advantage of that so once off off I

00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:21,439
would like okay that's one second here

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,439
while i squish

00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,250
let's see

00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:54,060
okay um so so I want to talk a little

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,410
bit first it's about how Fedora is for

00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,450
developers because this is all about

00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:58,890
making * better for developers and I

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:03,570
think you could say that Fedora is great

00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:04,980
for developers to look at develop the

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:09,200
floor developer portal is a new effort

00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:09,200
has a lot of great information about

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,650
about what's available for Doran okay

00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,900
that you see we have all these different

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,490
languages available and not only do we

00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,950
have this packaging available but it's

00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,750
very quickly updated after six months in

00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,980
your version of fedora out with new

00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,260
versions of all these different

00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:27,420
languages and all this imply burgers

00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:32,640
that go along with it and it's not just

00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:35,550
it's not just languages it's tools we

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,740
have you know darker and bigger intend

00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,660
or killed during all these things you

00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:42,920
can use a separate development

00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,920
environments and different things

00:02:53,590 --> 00:03:00,489
other hand or is awful for developers

00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:01,900
we've all these different software

00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:04,300
available one get started you say well

00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,680
what do I start with we were going to

00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:09,790
say it on the same level we show you

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:12,250
python and we show you go and show you

00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:15,660
elixir and look what do I start off with

00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:19,180
we've all these different tools we have

00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:21,010
do we use docker do we use vagrant to

00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:25,090
use Burkholder we're not giving any

00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:26,860
recommendations there we every six

00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,989
months we do an update with new versions

00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,940
of all the software so if i want the

00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:33,760
next version of python well i need to

00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:37,630
upgrade my my desktop to the new version

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,099
and what if what if some version project

00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:41,920
were working on one silver in a Python

00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:43,750
then I have to choose upgrade or not to

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,790
choose to upgrade that's not a very good

00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:49,120
situation really don't want our version

00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:51,340
of our tools we bound to our the desktop

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,560
or running and have to if I need a new

00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:55,959
new version Python I shouldn't happen to

00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,209
you a system upgrade and even though we

00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:00,519
update every six months that's still not

00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:02,950
fast enough the new version of node.js

00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:04,959
comes out it might be six months until

00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:11,109
you get to use at new version of fedora

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:12,849
so that's not so good um and you know

00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:14,290
one of the managers we say of pretoria

00:04:12,849 --> 00:04:17,289
that didn't mention is that we don't

00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:19,780
really bind you to any web service we're

00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:22,270
not trying to sell you any online you

00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:23,860
know Brock saying we're not AWS for non

00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:25,450
google app engine if you go for fedora

00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:28,450
you're developing using all these open

00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:30,729
tools but on the other hand you get the

00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:33,490
end of the day and you write the coolest

00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:35,200
new outpatient at fedora how do they you

00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:37,120
get out to your users we don't provide

00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:42,330
any help there you have to then figure

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:44,740
that all out for yourself um so um just

00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:46,300
typical development don't look at me a

00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,400
lot of different things so I just wanted

00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,860
to quickly say what I'm talking about

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:54,250
here and what I'm really talking about

00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:57,160
is web development server development

00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:59,530
back-end development this is a large

00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,210
chunk of the developing market it's also

00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:03,639
really we're open source is strongest

00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:06,340
this is a world and where

00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:09,310
source tools have a great deal of

00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:10,689
mindshare you know there are other

00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:12,310
important types of development I think

00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:15,009
when other thing we see important in a

00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:18,639
fedora is such as computing and big data

00:05:15,009 --> 00:05:20,680
that's definitely something we'll do

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,969
it's not necessarily write an

00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,379
application for all people is often

00:05:21,969 --> 00:05:26,319
writing that patient writing code for

00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:28,240
yourself play around with data need up

00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:30,340
native application development is also

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,779
very important it's not like there are a

00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:34,180
lot of people sitting out there writing

00:05:31,779 --> 00:05:36,069
native apps for linux or especially you

00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,750
know maps for linux but those are the

00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:39,819
apps that make our desktop work really

00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:42,099
well then it compelling we need to

00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:43,750
support that and i'm not going to talk

00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:45,969
about that but we're doing a lot of work

00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:49,000
in the workstation to support that with

00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:50,159
where we're going to don't builder flat

00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,659
packs really make this a whole lot

00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:55,539
better and some of the same principles

00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:57,849
that I'm going talk about here are found

00:05:55,539 --> 00:06:00,849
in that work but it's a little bit

00:05:57,849 --> 00:06:03,039
separate Fedora has a lot of people

00:06:00,849 --> 00:06:04,599
doing loaded level development to doing

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,550
the colonel they're doing the system

00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:08,080
development that already works pretty

00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:11,169
well I'm not going to say we should

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,080
change how we do that you know then

00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:15,400
there are a touch of development that

00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,349
maybe there are look we have less

00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,729
influence over it's always doing a

00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:20,770
mobile app development they're probably

00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:23,409
using you know the tool provided by

00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:25,509
Apple or by Google and we can't really

00:06:23,409 --> 00:06:28,080
make that better or worse it's just what

00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:31,689
it is and you know game development is a

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:34,659
thing of its own so at this is not

00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:36,849
comprehensive there's IOT and so forth

00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:38,409
but a the main takeaway here is I'm

00:06:36,849 --> 00:06:41,949
really talking about the server-side

00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:43,180
development because that's where we

00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:45,279
should have our biggest presence and

00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:49,560
where we need to we can make things

00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:53,680
better for people so the old school

00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:56,319
development was the VI httpd.conf where

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,979
I just start start off my editor I've

00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,599
started editing config files my system

00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:04,180
you know I see what see what happens

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:06,849
with that but what is what does modern

00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:09,580
development mean to me motor development

00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:11,469
means that your development environment

00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,750
is not your workstation of arm

00:07:11,469 --> 00:07:14,979
necessarily you're you're the container

00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,090
or virtual machine so you have a

00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:18,430
development of our movies

00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:22,780
slated from your workstation and I can

00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:24,580
if I want to develop for sent us on door

00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:27,550
I can do that I one develop four foot

00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:31,780
over 25 and fedora 24 I can do that and

00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:33,400
I have this you know I can cleanly

00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,600
separate that out flat pack is a

00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,150
different way of separating that out

00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,470
that really applies to more desktop

00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:40,389
applications where we say that one time

00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:46,630
for flat pack is different from your

00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:49,090
desktop runtime your built environment

00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:52,210
should be reproducible you shouldn't

00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:54,729
have to spend days setting up your

00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:57,030
workstation or vm and the right way to

00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:59,740
come get something good pile and then

00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:01,900
absolute if you need to reset the again

00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:03,340
start over from scratch you should

00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,600
actually have recorded exactly what you

00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,460
needed to do to set up your development

00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:10,150
environment hopefully that's very simple

00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:12,510
and get going and the fact hopefully

00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:15,160
that development environment is actually

00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:18,490
recorded in your git repository it's

00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,990
part of your project configuration so

00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:21,700
that everybody can using the same

00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:24,070
development environment I think anybody

00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:27,100
who has worked on a Zipkin open source

00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:28,600
project has found that one of the

00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:32,080
hardest problems of getting new comers

00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:33,909
suit in is giving them getting them

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,370
going on developing Department how do

00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:37,360
they get your software to build why is

00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:41,770
it working differently on their machine

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,719
than your machine you know we with

00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:46,839
genome we spent many years creating

00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:50,170
gauge build the system to try to make

00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:51,820
everybody's open department enough alike

00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:55,120
by installing system packages but

00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:58,120
rebuilding things and generally you know

00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:02,020
if I'm actually working on a server

00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:03,550
application everybody regardless of what

00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:05,380
operating system they're using on their

00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:08,500
desktop to be able to use the same

00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:09,700
development environment and often that's

00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,440
him develop environments can be why we

00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,180
used for testing and even what you're

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,190
going to use for a new deployment this

00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:18,790
versions can be the same across all of

00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:22,600
those that's what we can really have in

00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:24,630
a that's what we can have these days so

00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,150
um

00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:29,580
now let's are changing gears just a bit

00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:33,570
I want to go back to this idea of we've

00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:36,000
all how we're displaying so much choice

00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:38,700
to developers on fedora we're displaying

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,500
all these different options and why

00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,150
should we narrow that down a bit why

00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,810
should we figure out what's the Golden

00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:47,610
Path for developers well you know one

00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:49,620
thing is that having diversity is here

00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:53,640
is good but that's really putting a lot

00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:54,750
of responsibility on the newcomer the

00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,640
person who is coming into fedora and

00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:59,130
says I want to create a web app we're

00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,870
saying well those pros and cons to all

00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:02,700
of these go research this on the

00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:06,420
internet and figure out what you want to

00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:08,010
do that's you know if we have opinions

00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,660
we think things and some things work

00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:12,330
better we think some things are more

00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:14,420
free software then we really have the

00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:17,580
responsibility to make a recommendation

00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:22,320
we shouldn't just say it's all good you

00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:25,110
figure it out we also have the case that

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,120
we don't really know how our users are

00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:31,590
developing with fedora so we can't

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:33,900
actually have good test for it we when

00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:36,090
somebody comes in and says I've hit this

00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,860
problem someone will probably tell them

00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:40,760
to use something different say you're

00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:43,080
use fedora you try to use vagrant on it

00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,640
you hit a problem somebody says oh

00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,580
you're using the loop verte back into

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:50,180
vagrant yeah I virtualbox one works

00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:53,820
better by introducing that instead and

00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:57,240
we don't say which one is really our

00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:58,530
standard we're like yeah okay there's

00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,270
some problems there people can work

00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:02,820
around them well instead we should know

00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:04,860
what what do we are working people use

00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,450
vagrant are we recommend people to use

00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:10,260
bigger with levert them a better picture

00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:11,460
that works out of the box so if we know

00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:13,410
what our paths are we can really make

00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,760
sure they work well and not only work

00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:17,760
well we can make sure that they work

00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:20,700
slickly we can make our tools add

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,560
occupation center around certain paths

00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,570
that we think work well and provide a

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,910
very nice experience instead of saying

00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:31,250
here's a terminal here's a list of

00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:31,250
packages you can install it DMF have fun

00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:36,880
tell just came about decisions not only

00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:38,680
do I have to know like why should we

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,980
make them we have to know how we should

00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:44,710
make them and I guess there's two points

00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:46,540
i'll say there one is that we definitely

00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:48,010
not saying we should have no choices I

00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,750
think it's very reasonable to somebody

00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:51,730
coming in to say I want a program in

00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:53,440
python I want to program in Java Script

00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:57,370
give me different recommendations about

00:11:53,440 --> 00:12:00,280
how to do that but you can't have too

00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:02,830
many choices you can't have to choose

00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:04,120
your if you're saying first chose your

00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:06,190
language men choose you develop an

00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,660
environment then choose which database

00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:09,010
going to use with it choose this and

00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:12,460
then choose that we're going to

00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:14,260
basically we lost any sense that we're

00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:17,440
actually able to provide a curated

00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:20,530
experience so we want to pride a small

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:25,140
finite set of choices and then within

00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:25,140
that we need to engage the communities

00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:30,640
to tell us what the best of three

00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:32,890
practices are we really should be going

00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:36,880
to peel state evolving with python on

00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:38,920
fedora and say well how people do Python

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,600
development how do we go then to our

00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,820
tools what's the best way of Sipan

00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:45,070
environment for python and the same way

00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:47,920
with nodejs or roast or whatever other

00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:50,050
project working on because we can't

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:53,530
invent entirely new different ways of

00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:55,750
doing things on fedora in the end Fedora

00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:59,500
is not the right place somebody to ask

00:12:55,750 --> 00:13:00,910
you know a question about the pilot

00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,800
genera they're running with into with

00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:04,390
rust we can't have our fedora or

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,740
specifically bit of rust we need to make

00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:08,380
sure people invoked upstream community

00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:10,300
and say I'm having this problem and then

00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:12,910
have that makes sense so we need to

00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:15,130
basically figure out what the best of

00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:20,230
three practices are and Bill are sore

00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:22,510
golden paths around that and then you

00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:23,950
know if you are saying okay there are

00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:27,000
certain drop with developing that we're

00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:30,640
promoting well what about everybody who

00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,350
built some different way well you know

00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,770
one thing I'd say that we need to make

00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:40,300
what we're doing extensible and

00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:42,089
generally flexible so that you can work

00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:45,569
as you used to but you

00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:46,920
our tools when they make sense but we

00:13:45,569 --> 00:13:49,620
shouldn't be the point of saying

00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:51,660
accessibility means that anybody can add

00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:54,209
to our set of options we shouldn't feel

00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:56,930
that just because somebody has to grow

00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:59,009
up how to use the tools with elixir and

00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:01,439
it's blog about that then we have to

00:13:59,009 --> 00:14:04,199
offer elixir as a top level language of

00:14:01,439 --> 00:14:06,959
choice I'm picking an elixir because it

00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:09,180
was on the mill product or project at

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:11,639
Oregon I had not heard of it before but

00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:15,649
maybe that's new hot thing and it's good

00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:15,649
if you are an electrical / I apologize

00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:24,180
so um and then I mean as I said if we

00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:25,410
pick our paths we can clear road roblox

00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:27,139
I think we know some of the roblox

00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:29,730
people typically hit on fedora

00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:34,259
networking with virtual machines can be

00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:36,360
a real pain you can there's different

00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:41,459
constraints of the rangas Libertas

00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:43,860
system or as a user and often that can

00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:46,050
be a real pain point on we know that

00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:48,449
permissions in SEO image can be it hard

00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:52,220
for new users and some of this is just a

00:14:48,449 --> 00:14:55,319
question of documentation like if you

00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:57,240
there's doctor now if you want to model

00:14:55,319 --> 00:14:58,920
the volume under fedora there's a

00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,809
special option you can add to the mount

00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:03,740
to say picks up the SE learning

00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:06,360
permissions this is great this is a

00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:07,470
really nice thing that was added but if

00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,720
you don't know about it you're going to

00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:12,829
have a world of pain until you find it

00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,829
somewhere deep in the man page

00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:20,010
and then but most of the way I'm gonna

00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:22,290
talk about here is how to create a slick

00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:24,720
experience around I'm do it when I

00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:28,410
fedora and so if you were at the last

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,270
talked you saw Richard Hughes talk about

00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:32,160
things he's been working on for five

00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:34,170
years that he's worked through with

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,270
develop with the designers and gone

00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:38,340
through many iterations i'm gonna be

00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:42,110
showing some demos of stuff that i spent

00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:45,360
about three days on so this is not

00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:48,090
necessarily anything that's going to

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:52,530
move forward but it's basically just

00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:54,990
showing off my some ideas in code so the

00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:57,510
first thing i want to say is that we

00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:58,770
need to have tools that have just enough

00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:01,440
smarts and just enough knowledge of our

00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:05,280
conventions to be able to work

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:07,050
effectively with people's projects so

00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,580
the first one will show off is something

00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,620
that I've called for working purposes

00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:13,830
fed em it's basically a tool that

00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:24,270
understands common project conventions

00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:29,520
so here so say I have little big Reuben

00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:31,710
ok so here we have a little um I think

00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:33,300
I'm actually going to move recording

00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:36,030
screams look at the screen and said and

00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:38,210
see if it till I don't think it'll make

00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:43,260
much sense with it just be talking but

00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:44,880
we have hello python program and if you

00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:47,100
don't python and you see a directory

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,890
called VN inside of Python project grew

00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,480
saying ok that's probably a Python

00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:52,980
virtual environment it's one of multiple

00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,080
dimensions people use for setting up

00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:58,910
virtual environments under Python but

00:16:55,080 --> 00:17:01,080
it's a somewhat recognized one so and

00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:03,690
well how would you activate that vibe

00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:08,810
and if you were you know if you know

00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:08,810
that you'd source ben VN bin

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,480
source did the IMP didn't activate

00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,069
that's something that somebody who's

00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:20,050
worked with Python probably understands

00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:23,709
but since no we can our tooling can

00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:32,770
understand connection to so so you fed

00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:34,420
em shell that brings up a shell this is

00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:35,770
a few thing to change to the prompt to

00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:45,730
say I'm working on the whole Python

00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:47,770
project it if added the VN bin to the

00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:49,720
path there so now if I like Python I get

00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:52,510
the localized Python which use the local

00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,890
versions of the libraries and you know I

00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:57,700
think the only other thing it does here

00:17:53,890 --> 00:18:00,880
is if it changes it sets millions for CD

00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:02,650
so if I Stevie somewhere else now it's

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,840
Ed goes back to the project home instead

00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:07,179
of my home but it's really very simple

00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:10,059
tool and by itself is probably not all

00:18:07,179 --> 00:18:11,380
that interesting that is if you're

00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:14,620
working in Python you probably figure

00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:16,480
out how to you which one I've are

00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:21,670
Vincent there are Python specific

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:23,710
tooling like auto em to do similar

00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:26,650
things in a way that I'll do we

00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:29,020
recognize but the nice thing about this

00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:31,500
is if we start building up to mention

00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:37,720
saying that our projects live in under

00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:40,059
capital P projects and that they're set

00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,620
up in a way that said I'd recognizes

00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:46,059
them build higher level tools that work

00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:48,100
on that so I wrote a little graphical

00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:49,900
program called again from working

00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:52,510
purposes new term the basically

00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:54,250
understands this project structure so if

00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:58,510
I go to the activities overview now and

00:18:54,250 --> 00:19:01,570
I search for hello python I guess which

00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:03,540
result coming from new term second

00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:08,140
search results just from my terminal but

00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:10,030
and if I turned their it opens up that

00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:16,179
my other monitor so let me drag this

00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:19,440
across then I will a terminal here you

00:19:16,179 --> 00:19:21,600
know this is we see here it new

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,909
starting up into a product rectory so

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:29,190
internal runs fedrick head ends and now

00:19:23,909 --> 00:19:30,840
it has you know okay I don't has a pass

00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:33,360
that up I probably a little bit hard to

00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:36,240
read here but it has the path setup as

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:39,149
before um if I create you know if I

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,639
create a new tab here it's also going to

00:19:39,149 --> 00:19:44,549
have the same path set up one thing I

00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:45,809
did is while the sum of the prompt

00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:47,309
information didn't have to be stuffed

00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:49,440
into pumped now that had nowhere

00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:51,200
terminal there so the project name is up

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:55,110
in the left-hand corner instead of being

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,850
stopping to my path and then you know

00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:59,250
demo a few more things that this does

00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:01,909
later on this talk here but the basic

00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:07,440
idea is that now we've we made it

00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:08,639
navigation part of the desktop something

00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,409
that's a way or because we have an app

00:20:08,639 --> 00:20:11,789
that actually knows what projects and a

00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:15,120
condensed show up an active research

00:20:11,789 --> 00:20:16,139
well if I just had terminals and young

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,509
field doesn't understand anything about

00:20:16,139 --> 00:20:21,110
a terminal and definite understand what

00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:23,669
you're wanting inside the terminal and

00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:26,600
if I have a different project here I go

00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:26,600
push

00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:34,500
here's this is another project here that

00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:37,490
I have the same i ate my capital T

00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:40,560
projects directory and this is an oj s

00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:42,330
project and just to demonstrate that

00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:47,400
it's that we can be a little more

00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:49,230
general by echo half and here we see

00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:52,410
that it knew that in a Pronovias

00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:53,880
directory that under node module / Ben

00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:55,350
that's what you need to have in your

00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,170
path so knew how to set up something

00:20:55,350 --> 00:21:05,180
different for a note I yet jasmel gation

00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:05,180
um so okay um

00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:10,559
so that's part of the solution here i'm

00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:12,120
talking about that we understand

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,710
projects we understand how to set things

00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:16,350
up with we understand how to bring that

00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:17,730
into the desktop but i haven't really

00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:20,160
gone to the other product what i'm

00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:26,820
talking about which is the idea that

00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:27,870
you're that you're the global

00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:30,270
environment is not the workstation

00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:32,070
environment I mean Python virtual and

00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:35,299
sort of salted a bit this means a

00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:38,090
different side of packages there but it

00:21:35,299 --> 00:21:40,290
doesn't really address the question of

00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:42,510
saying what a wonderful version of

00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:48,660
Python what if I dip different version

00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:50,280
nodejs so um the other thing that I look

00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:53,429
for that fed imes know this is how to

00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:55,770
set up Tanner quickly with a different

00:21:53,429 --> 00:21:59,549
set of packages and I get you into that

00:21:55,770 --> 00:22:00,990
container so let's get out of those so

00:21:59,549 --> 00:22:03,360
that's I'm going to do this in the

00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:05,750
normal term oh so it's clear what I'm

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,750
doing

00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:16,470
so let's see

00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,200
so

00:22:28,349 --> 00:22:39,820
ok I'll start with fedora 24 and

00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:41,320
packages will want nodejs I'll have been

00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:43,599
put in there it's very simple file which

00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:46,029
says that I want you to start with up

00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:49,450
for over 24 docker image and also

00:22:46,029 --> 00:22:53,409
include the nodejs package then yeah

00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:56,979
what's that now but now if i do 110 mm

00:22:53,409 --> 00:22:58,929
shell but the forwards would have just

00:22:56,979 --> 00:23:01,359
said Oh cakes in OJ's project let's it

00:22:58,929 --> 00:23:03,759
up using system packages but now that

00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:06,549
she's left adoro Gemmell there it

00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:10,690
created a little docker file that the

00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:12,399
appropriate content Senate said ok can

00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:17,589
actually scroll up a little bit on there

00:23:12,399 --> 00:23:20,079
to see what it did it solid some some

00:23:17,589 --> 00:23:22,299
basic tools like get him less and there

00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:25,959
then it installed the package I listed

00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:28,359
there and then it added myself inside

00:23:25,959 --> 00:23:30,639
the package there beside the container

00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:34,450
and then gave me a shell inside the

00:23:30,639 --> 00:23:36,519
container so this was very very fast

00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:39,549
because it was cash that was done it

00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:41,109
previously ok it would take sorry from

00:23:39,549 --> 00:23:43,349
scratch probably about a couple of

00:23:41,109 --> 00:23:47,829
minutes if you had to download images

00:23:43,349 --> 00:23:50,529
may be more from a conference network so

00:23:47,829 --> 00:23:51,700
see so we're going now x I'm not in my

00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:54,009
home directory I'm actually in /

00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:57,129
projects angular phone cat has been down

00:23:54,009 --> 00:24:04,179
in there inside the container if I do

00:23:57,129 --> 00:24:05,859
RPM do no I don't have 213 packages

00:24:04,179 --> 00:24:07,869
installed so clearly I have a much

00:24:05,859 --> 00:24:12,749
smaller and cleaner package set than my

00:24:07,869 --> 00:24:12,749
workstation would show um and

00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:19,970
and you know basically just have a fully

00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,550
working the environment there and I

00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:24,890
could have used a different version of

00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:27,230
fedora I could use sent to us instead of

00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:27,830
fedora and it would have given me a

00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:30,620
different type of development

00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:33,020
environment and I think as we go forward

00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:35,390
with fedora and modularity will see that

00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:37,580
there's more ability to say that I want

00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:41,690
you know when the next version of those

00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:45,860
GS is a is released I'll immediately be

00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:48,080
able to get that from fedora and we'll

00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:50,960
probably breaking up the fedora or a

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,430
tempo a little bit so that we don't have

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,690
the problem that you and mrs. Eric have

00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:55,880
to wait for the next version method or

00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:57,140
to get the next version of software so I

00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:59,600
think even more you'll be able to pick

00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:01,580
the version of the software you want but

00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,940
already by just saying that i can get

00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:06,470
environment without having to change

00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:08,180
things on my workstation that have made

00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:09,710
a big step forward and this actually

00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:11,020
becomes a lot more important with atomic

00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:14,210
workstation where we're saying that our

00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:17,030
image for the system is actually fixed

00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:19,850
image RPM layering gives you some of the

00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:21,890
loyalty to get around that so i'm going

00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:24,530
to install something on top of the

00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:28,280
standard atomic rotation image but it

00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:30,350
has the basic limitation of losing some

00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:32,390
of the bands of tonic workstation as

00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:34,070
soon as you start installing new

00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:36,410
packages a top of your works at Tomic

00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:39,200
workstation image then it you no longer

00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:41,240
know that's going to upgrade cleanly you

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,000
have some think it's a lot more

00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:46,190
complicated so this is meant to be a way

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,130
that will work both existing fedora and

00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:51,080
with future versions of it door where we

00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:53,360
have a fixed base image in a player the

00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:56,860
top this is a way of liberating a fedora

00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,860
development environment on top

00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:19,010
ok

00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:21,350
so so that's sort of high or consisting

00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:22,820
project we also want to talk about you

00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:26,210
know also want to provide ways of

00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:28,520
starting a new project and you know I

00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:30,290
think this is the idea of a new project

00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:32,240
wizard is pretty well established we had

00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:36,140
it with developer assistant assistant

00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:38,060
and I want to show off of what looks

00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:41,390
like an get on builders to sort of fill

00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:46,760
with the medellín state of the art is

00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:50,030
around that so if you wanted own builder

00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:52,940
you see a offers you to want to either

00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:56,120
use one of your current projects or you

00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:57,830
can create a new project and set it off

00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:00,260
aristede you create a project directory

00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:03,920
on your computer or from git repository

00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:06,250
or from a template and then you have

00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:14,750
your choice of you know you pick your

00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:17,300
name and project and then but you pick

00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:18,770
your what languages in right now build

00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:20,840
their offers it's very small set of

00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:24,380
templates which are very much oriented

00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:25,730
around own development so I don't know

00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:27,920
yet whether if we're doing something

00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:29,510
that's not our benevolent whether we

00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:33,850
actually want to use the Builder code

00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:38,780
base or to replicate the same sort of

00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:40,460
interface for for command line projects

00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:43,310
but this is hardly type of interface

00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:45,710
that I eventually having right now I'm

00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:49,990
just going to demo this big a new

00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:49,990
project from the command line very much

00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:53,380
those

00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:58,680
not here so

00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:06,990
very much simple oh I'm just going to

00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:09,990
stay fit down for Craig Django my django

00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:09,990
project

00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:21,250
hold it right it would that shows that

00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:27,220
there's no actual template system that's

00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:30,070
just one hard coded 10-foot there so go

00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:34,690
ahead and does a bunch of stuff it sets

00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:36,340
up the the inner eyes environment ok now

00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:38,350
it's actually except so virtual

00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:42,640
environment and then it's going to run

00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:47,590
the sort of Django set of tool and

00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:52,299
played my django right bring it up in

00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:54,880
the terminal here and then you know it

00:28:52,299 --> 00:28:57,820
has throat skeleton jangle set up there

00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:01,690
it has the virtual environment and it's

00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:03,250
all set up for me but the thing here is

00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:05,890
this is the same set of to get if you

00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:07,750
follow Django tutorial from the website

00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:09,730
we're not creating in a new way of doing

00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:11,110
general projects at this point you could

00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:13,240
just go ahead and follow the Django

00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:17,130
tutorial straight through and it would

00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:17,130
all work and if I do

00:29:25,059 --> 00:29:27,120
Oh

00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:30,500
don't have something

00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:47,380
the

00:29:48,429 --> 00:29:57,929
this is demo a factor yeah it's don't

00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:57,929
know the offhand of the option to retain

00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,440
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:13,799
ok it's going to back going again

00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:32,130
port forwards it will leave it's going

00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:38,160
to demo here I coleg take control see

00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:41,600
here and so one thing I points out here

00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:43,680
is that it's not a it's actually the

00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:46,410
visits for development and because we

00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:48,600
want which was often the dango tutorials

00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:52,530
it just work the container is actually

00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:54,240
sharing the same the host networking

00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:57,570
does not is not using a separate

00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:59,580
networking thing because generally that

00:30:57,570 --> 00:31:00,930
Mason crazy divergence between what

00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:02,520
people expect upstream and what you'd

00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:06,360
actually have and you'd have to know

00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:10,230
what the IP of the container was um and

00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:11,430
that you know that's um pretty

00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:14,460
straightforward and you could do that

00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:15,870
whether or not you have on the all the

00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:17,820
packages installed on your host system

00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:20,370
or not and you can do it with any

00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:23,700
version of Django that's available in

00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:27,060
fedora so that's essentially the answer

00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:30,000
you know in very rough sketch of what my

00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:31,920
question in my talk title presents is

00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,080
that we want to be doing things in

00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:36,870
containers what could we do things like

00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,820
up screen and we want to have tools that

00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:43,980
make it slick and straightforward to do

00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:46,500
that now this is guess you sort of

00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:49,440
started but we actually need to provide

00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:51,030
user support from n to n we can't just

00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,380
say that we're gonna get you started

00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:54,810
with a project and then leave you off

00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:57,510
and this is where I think that we've why

00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:59,430
deficits in never really caught on

00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:01,650
because dev assistant was something that

00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:03,600
was very useful to create a template to

00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:05,370
create an initial project there but it

00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,410
didn't offer anything to an experienced

00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:09,690
user so there was no reason to actually

00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:13,110
engage with dev assistant unless you

00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:15,510
didn't know anything about about getting

00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:17,460
started once you actually knew the the

00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:18,900
tools that were behind dev assistant it

00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:21,960
became a little bit unnecessary overhead

00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:23,250
and the idea here is to incite great

00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,840
tools that actually are useful for

00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:27,630
experienced developers for people who

00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:30,180
already know what they're doing and you

00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:32,550
know that's often going to be by

00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:36,230
actually providing the necessary bits of

00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:39,290
user interface within the application

00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:41,929
the term allocation to let you move

00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:45,500
forward in the in useful ways and this

00:32:41,929 --> 00:32:50,210
is a sort of it quickly locket to

00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:58,030
example of that so so if i do i get the

00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:58,030
knit here get add mo man

00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:13,010
okay now I see / hear it nope the

00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:15,560
terminal program noted that this is a

00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:22,640
get project figured out on the master

00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:25,550
branch if I get check out this be some

00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:27,440
fix create a new branch that will notice

00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:29,630
the change for the branch there so

00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,280
that's running it's a little bit

00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:34,310
interface again this is something that

00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:36,830
most people have set up what if they

00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:38,330
know how in their prompt but that's

00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:40,250
another you know you have to find

00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:42,200
somebody to tell you how do you set up

00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:44,660
your prompt forget okay did you do that

00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:46,040
correctly then you get prompt and then

00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:47,750
there's only so much you can stuff into

00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,070
the prompt I mean at some point your

00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:53,120
prom screaming becomes like a half mile

00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:55,090
long and I you know similarly we could

00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,830
do things that for instance if you have

00:33:55,090 --> 00:34:00,590
you actually have a more production dr.

00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:02,660
image that you're using to test your

00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:04,940
application set up there we could

00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:08,540
provide the status of that in the user

00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:10,010
interface or basically anything at sort

00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:11,060
of useful connections textual

00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:12,919
information with a project we can

00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:15,560
provide within the terminal user

00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:17,630
interface and not just require it

00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:20,330
everybody do it by stuffing things into

00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:22,190
the prompt but I again it's not a

00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:25,460
question of did you have to go out and

00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:27,740
use get external get tool to get this

00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:29,480
we're trying to work within how people

00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:30,970
are working within a terminal we're

00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:33,710
basically in creating better ways of

00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:35,149
working within a terminal but we should

00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:37,909
also integrate well with the external

00:34:35,149 --> 00:34:40,700
tools when they exist so maybe next to

00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:43,550
this is a button to launch skit get G on

00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:47,179
the same directory there and if you want

00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:48,800
the graphical view so um you know then

00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:52,240
we're seeing on from here we have to

00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,240
continue um

00:34:56,140 --> 00:35:02,660
kien you on sort of the introducing the

00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,680
best practices there so how do you

00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:07,430
packed up your application for

00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:09,230
deployment are we using a docker file do

00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:10,580
we want to is open ship something

00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:12,320
interesting from fedora we have to

00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:14,360
figure that out we have to provide the

00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,670
ways to make it easy for people to take

00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:19,250
those steps there and then you know I

00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:21,410
guess it leaves open question but as a

00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:22,640
final question we're not done until the

00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:25,670
user the app is actually deployed

00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:29,090
someplace so just having a development

00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:31,040
solution isn't enough we actually have

00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:32,510
to know what are we're recommending for

00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,010
deployment are we hugging pulled that

00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:37,220
you need to install fedora server

00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:38,270
someplace are we telling people that you

00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:40,700
know you should write Oakland shift

00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:43,610
application and find some provider who

00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:46,790
is offering hosting for that or some

00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:48,470
other format i think it's a it's a very

00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:51,680
hard question because if it or doesn't

00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:54,850
sell anything we don't provide any web

00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:56,900
services but you know i think it is

00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:58,280
something going up in mind and

00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,780
recommending how you create your

00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,980
application is how we were eventually

00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:03,500
going to deploy it and there might be

00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:05,630
multiple answers depending on you know

00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:08,600
what you're interested in but there has

00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:09,980
to be some answer there so that's

00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:13,250
basically what I wanted to talk about

00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:14,750
today um so you can find me on to our

00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:18,410
workstation if these kind of things

00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:20,570
interest you or email me um and I guess

00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:23,440
this point out asked for any questions

00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:23,440
or comments people have

00:36:28,069 --> 00:36:35,430
yeah okay yeah how much of this i mean

00:36:32,869 --> 00:36:38,339
most of it doesn't look gnome dependent

00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:41,009
but some of it looks you have the

00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:44,130
terminal starting the SMS that's not

00:36:41,009 --> 00:36:45,599
really a no independent thing well okay

00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:46,979
so what's good on the pendant here I

00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:49,910
mean clearly the underlying command line

00:36:46,979 --> 00:36:52,920
tool is nothing to do with Kimber oh no

00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:55,789
but the application that I'm writing

00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:58,289
their this new term as i call it is

00:36:55,789 --> 00:37:00,329
design is intended to be designed

00:36:58,289 --> 00:37:02,459
according to kodama be that guidelines a

00:37:00,329 --> 00:37:04,949
tip well into the genome desktop it

00:37:02,459 --> 00:37:08,160
should be totally runnable and or KDE or

00:37:04,949 --> 00:37:10,140
xfce as well it might not be quite as

00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:12,029
slick I mean it provides a gum shall

00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:13,709
search provider if you're going to

00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:17,400
economic so you can search for things in

00:37:13,709 --> 00:37:18,630
the show but I mean I think probably you

00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,609
get a lot of the benefits under any

00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:25,229
desktop you just might get a little bit

00:37:20,609 --> 00:37:27,119
of mist net mismatching you I yeah well

00:37:25,229 --> 00:37:30,989
I mean it it would come up the title bar

00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:33,539
if if you're branded under would xfce

00:37:30,989 --> 00:37:37,259
would come up with a minimal title bar I

00:37:33,539 --> 00:37:39,359
think it depends a bit on it it depends

00:37:37,259 --> 00:37:40,440
upon whether JK things that you got

00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:43,019
patient will be able to run something

00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:46,170
without a separate title bar and whether

00:37:43,019 --> 00:37:47,369
a patient is using the it's the

00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:49,049
application using the app menu to

00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:50,999
display important things and that would

00:37:49,049 --> 00:37:53,849
open a menu bar view so I mean you know

00:37:50,999 --> 00:37:55,529
we do pay attention in within the GK

00:37:53,849 --> 00:37:58,979
project to be able to make appt said

00:37:55,529 --> 00:38:03,569
that adapts between different desktops

00:37:58,979 --> 00:38:05,459
and you know that if that could be

00:38:03,569 --> 00:38:07,170
tiresome app support but I definitely

00:38:05,459 --> 00:38:08,729
would expect that it would work like

00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:10,199
like the gnome software work on any

00:38:08,729 --> 00:38:13,079
desktop this will work on any desktop

00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:14,880
you may but it's using the genome design

00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:17,849
language work would eventually use a gum

00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:20,900
sign language now instead of whatever I

00:38:17,849 --> 00:38:20,900
hacked up in two days

00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:28,140
yeah so how would you market this to

00:38:25,589 --> 00:38:30,050
developers get their mind

00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:35,300
that assistant was a great

00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:37,400
yeah somehow I know so I mean I think so

00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:42,470
deficit end you know I mean I think

00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:44,000
there was a couple of things that had

00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:46,400
their definition one is I think just

00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:50,150
basically that it didn't really offer

00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:52,220
much to somebody who already knew what

00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:54,770
they were doing you know it basically

00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:56,060
was you know I don't know how to check

00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:59,830
out the type of package from github I

00:38:56,060 --> 00:39:03,320
can use desert d eight-week github

00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:04,310
whatever and so so basically said if you

00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,830
don't want to do you could figure out

00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:08,420
the deficit command line already can

00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:10,820
figure out sort of native command line

00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:12,490
that wasn't necessarily a win so I had a

00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:16,130
lot of knowledge but projects but it was

00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:19,400
all pushed it on to the park so the

00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:21,020
starting area that's one sort of thing

00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:24,710
anything hindered I've assistant and I

00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:27,050
think also the the you I never got as

00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:29,780
much attention and love as the command

00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:32,120
line and I think that means he we didn't

00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:34,580
have a lot of cool you know videos down

00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:36,890
with the most rating that assistant you

00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:39,830
know I think you know basically my game

00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:42,980
for rodents would basically to you know

00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:44,570
make it slick you know make it work make

00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:46,730
it be actually useful for people make

00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:48,470
sure that we get up contesting among

00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:50,090
ourselves to make sure that's actually

00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:52,370
something that we should be promoting

00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:54,590
you know and then then you go out and

00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:56,840
get help tell people about how it makes

00:39:54,590 --> 00:40:00,650
your life Isabel for better you know and

00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:02,570
how it's and I think that nothing I can

00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:05,570
get a powerful message and just to show

00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:09,680
people I think there's often the sort of

00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:12,710
dichotomy between terminal and design

00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:14,090
that is your design if they're entirely

00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:16,190
within the terminal based upon command

00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:19,400
line options or you design the user

00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:20,829
interface and I think that that's not a

00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:24,369
dichotomy that we really

00:40:20,829 --> 00:40:26,259
to have that especially on fedora where

00:40:24,369 --> 00:40:29,079
the terminal in sepa development is very

00:40:26,259 --> 00:40:31,359
much what we're focusing around we can

00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:32,650
have both we can have things that are

00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:40,950
people who want to work on a terminal

00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:44,230
that are more than just a terminal yeah

00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:48,790
this is something private

00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:51,790
um not really I mean I can put it up I

00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:53,230
mean I i'll call it like i can

00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:56,440
definitely put up put out the code off

00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:58,300
somewhere and it's real code there's

00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:00,609
nobody behind the curtain there but I

00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:02,890
think basically I mean before I really

00:41:00,609 --> 00:41:04,750
say it's ready to rue 21 thing I've like

00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:07,119
I need to do is have some buy-in from

00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:10,260
the genome designers that this is sort

00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:14,350
of interesting way to go on that and

00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:15,790
because without that it's it's basically

00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:18,550
just my project is that were going to be

00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:19,750
good and then the second thing is that i

00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:21,609
would have to sort of figure out a bit

00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:26,710
more about naming I don't think new

00:41:21,609 --> 00:41:29,590
curve is a final made for this so so

00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:32,590
that those are sort of the but I mean I

00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:34,690
it's all try to talk to poor people like

00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:35,920
wat egg on the ground side so I figure

00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:39,369
out how this work with a gun yeah

00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,890
overall good design and you know if it

00:41:39,369 --> 00:41:44,500
then if that looks good then I'll

00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:47,050
probably put up somewhere and offer for

00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:50,580
hacking I don't want to jump the gun too

00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:50,580
much on that so right now

00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:57,500
