Title: Flock 2016 - What's Fedora's alternative to vi httpd.conf?, Owen Taylor

Description: 
	The most traditional way to do server development on a Linux workstation is to treat your workstation like a server: install the dependencies, put your code in a system directory, and edit the web server config. The idea of an ostree-based workstation with a fixed system image would make this impossible: a workstation doesn't have the web server or development dependencies installed systemwide, but it's not the best way to do things for many other reasons: the project may need versions of dependencies that are newer or older than what your workstation has, different projects may have conflicting dependencies, its hard to go from development to deployment, and so forth. There are no shortage of options for alternate ways to develop: Docker, Vagrant, Python's virtualenv, and many more, each with lots of subvariants. But with all these options out there, how do we guide users to ways that work well, and that let them leverage the Fedora ecosystem? And how do we provide integration with standard Workstation components like the terminal, GNOME Boxes, and with IDEs to make the experience truly slick and compelling?
