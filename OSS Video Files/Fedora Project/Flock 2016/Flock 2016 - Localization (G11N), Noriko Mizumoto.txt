	00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:06,049
thank you for coming my talk my name is

00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:09,690
Noriko mizumoto today I'd like to

00:00:06,049 --> 00:00:19,320
introduce how the local is maintained is

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:21,390
doing a fantastic job yeah you start

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,710
talking about the localization I'd like

00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:30,119
to introduce a little bit about out of

00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:33,450
technology of japan maybe some of the

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:38,309
people knows about the totals company in

00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:42,390
japan in this a little bit embarrassing

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:47,670
experience experience from 5-6 years ago

00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:51,059
by myself it is not the first time but

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:56,910
the total technology is so other person

00:00:51,059 --> 00:01:01,129
every year is changing that time the

00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,129
first time to see this one

00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:11,510
and so this device and then I got into

00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:13,940
running and then do the things where I

00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:17,180
need to do it and try to exit from the

00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:19,700
room but before the exit the room I have

00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,250
to press buttons or have to use the

00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:24,980
lever and try to find that the buttons

00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:28,130
livers everywhere a book but i can't

00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:30,920
find out i will show you the entire

00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:36,610
device the state of the technology from

00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:40,130
now a bit embarrassing you this is I go

00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:42,500
so I did everything down I need to fresh

00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:45,440
it but can't find it the liver or

00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:49,580
buttons to fresh it so that i can get

00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:54,259
out from this room right and then at

00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:56,810
that times the system it says they are

00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:59,869
already english but when I got in there

00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:03,410
there is a no English only the Japanese

00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:06,070
so if I am via English speakers totally

00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:11,600
i have no idea which buttons to press

00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:17,230
and then finally I got found this device

00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:20,440
it says hover my hand it will flash it

00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:23,660
the first experience for myself because

00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:28,130
flashing meals plus the buttons or

00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:31,600
deliver but not follow my hand it just

00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:35,450
have in my hand it's fresh it's

00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:40,180
surprising embarrassing apparently i

00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:44,030
encounter now these days total the total

00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:47,750
develop this one now know that a no

00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:52,160
cover the hands it's your enter in the

00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:54,530
room the lid is automatically open you

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:58,670
did everything you have to do and they

00:02:54,530 --> 00:03:02,690
walk away everything down flush let's

00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:06,450
play the back no hope no go ahead just

00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:08,400
walk away it looks after everything

00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:09,959
so this is still a different from the

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:16,790
localization what I wanted to tell you

00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:21,030
is this is the one this is the one and

00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:24,870
that one if you guys only speak English

00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:27,540
and there is a lot in there it is

00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:29,130
useless for the people who doesn't

00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:32,099
understand the Japanese for digital

00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:35,310
technology I wanted to tell you how the

00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:38,940
localization is important for the fedora

00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:47,340
itself English Fedora is sometimes used

00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:52,819
as for non-english speakers this is

00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:57,450
exact English written fedora page and

00:03:52,819 --> 00:04:01,140
this is how we translate it it is

00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:03,930
translated in a polish translated check

00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:06,810
transit it in Albanian translated in

00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:11,160
German President in Japanese more and

00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:16,850
more and in French other luggage so that

00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:16,850
every non-english speakers hockley and

00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:24,000
understand what is going on what is the

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:30,270
technology the picadura is for providing

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:32,490
to the users to do the localization we

00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:35,070
the every application need

00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:37,229
internationalisation first otherwise

00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:40,020
vocalization cannot be dark it's kind of

00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:42,330
the preparation to down the proper

00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,910
localization but i am from the

00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:46,770
internationalisation king so i just give

00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,900
you a small tips about what is the

00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:51,570
internationalization what is important

00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:56,900
things to remember it's a both side of

00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:56,900
the localizer also the year developers

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:10,240
the face when people have had make their

00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:14,140
own application I like emphasize that

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:17,550
please think about to make your

00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:20,350
application the international

00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:24,070
internationalization to keep compatible

00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:29,860
it's like a get text or logging tools it

00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:32,980
depending on what languages you are

00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:36,150
using it is probably easier for you guys

00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:38,320
too soft internet which one is for you

00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:40,360
but make sure that the international

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:44,740
relation totally compatible so that

00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:46,600
makes much easier later on to the

00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:49,600
application international artists and

00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:53,830
then localize the second second one is

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:58,030
write in English so for Japanese people

00:05:53,830 --> 00:06:01,780
tends to write in Japanese are partially

00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:05,200
or entirely then in open source more

00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:08,290
other developers can join contribute

00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:11,020
improve or send a patch to improve the

00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:13,650
year coding itself it is good to help

00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:16,470
everything in English so that other

00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:21,040
developers can understand your

00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:24,160
application itself and from the side is

00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:28,840
more problematic for the yellow Kaiser

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:31,420
translators at plural forms with that

00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:33,550
the plural forms sometimes it's really

00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:36,820
hard for the translators to translate

00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:41,920
for Asian language we do not have a

00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:44,380
plural form so singular or poles we do

00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:46,840
exactly the same translation for the

00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:49,960
French where the German the other email

00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:54,070
team has a plural form so they have to

00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:57,610
have super strength to translate single

00:06:54,070 --> 00:07:00,840
format and their poor former even with

00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:04,410
the sentencing exactly the same

00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:08,790
and the numbering substitutions also the

00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:12,960
ability for the translation team if you

00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:18,210
use exactly the same substitutions then

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:21,780
we cannot change the orders but many

00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:24,720
luggage has their own grammar typical

00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:27,570
different from the English so sometimes

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,790
we need to flip their substitution but

00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:33,450
if substitution doesn't have any number

00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:37,050
and we can do that because it it being

00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:39,990
fed in the order which which comes from

00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:44,970
the first in English format so the

00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:49,139
numbering does help a lot which give you

00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:52,710
the another example like 1 2 3 4 5 sauce

00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:55,590
it's in the English order but if it

00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:57,900
translated in the Japanese we have to

00:07:55,590 --> 00:08:02,190
change the order number two comes first

00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:04,400
three two one and five otherwise it

00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:09,479
doesn't make sense what does it means

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:16,200
output is second August Tuesday ten

00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:18,690
o'clock in English should say second of

00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:22,110
Tuesday second of august and o'clock but

00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:25,020
inject in Japan it is a different order

00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:31,800
that's why that we really love like to

00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:36,950
have a number for the substitutions and

00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:41,969
the last one is do not cut it off the

00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:46,529
words in the sentence but it says that

00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:49,110
this rule is applicable to block the

00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:51,480
substitutions the one sentence we are

00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:54,300
easy to translate but if cut it up in

00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:58,740
the each terms then it's really hard to

00:08:54,300 --> 00:09:00,870
give a correct translation and then we

00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:03,300
try to give the correct translation but

00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:07,740
it going to be the literal so that once

00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:08,690
that is consists in the one sentence in

00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:13,160
the program

00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:16,550
as output it looks like sometimes funny

00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:21,290
translation so it impact the Equality of

00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:25,700
the economy also and then that means the

00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:29,510
user face quality is sacrificed because

00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:35,230
of this so make sure that how it looks

00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:35,230
like before having the sentence

00:09:41,749 --> 00:09:47,040
there are more probably the questions

00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:48,269
about the internationalization but as I

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,119
said I'm not coming from the

00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:52,319
internationalization and then it's lucky

00:09:51,119 --> 00:09:54,989
that we have a cup of

00:09:52,319 --> 00:09:58,559
internationalization team on board on

00:09:54,989 --> 00:10:01,259
this floor in one person coda Praveen is

00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:03,480
going to give a session about the

00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:08,239
globalization audit of the federal

00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:11,459
atomic please join his talk and then any

00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:14,279
instant naturalization problems all the

00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:21,089
questions I believe that he can answer

00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:23,899
are more in details ok let's talk about

00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:29,850
the localization what we are localizing

00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:31,980
we localize websites we localize of

00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:34,259
course the door right so this is

00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:38,970
installer and the package name is

00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:42,889
anaconda again this is an anaconda we do

00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:47,009
a lot of the packages in fedora as well

00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:50,189
this is a login screen this is actually

00:10:47,009 --> 00:10:54,119
the GDN of combination of the GDN and

00:10:50,189 --> 00:11:00,379
the gnome shell packages once lo green

00:10:54,119 --> 00:11:03,839
will receive this spring setup screen

00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:08,879
this coming from genome initial setup

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:11,309
packages that means many of the fedora

00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:16,100
translator also contribute to the genome

00:11:11,309 --> 00:11:19,559
project itself and then some of us even

00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:24,209
contribute to the legal fees as well or

00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:28,289
the Mozilla project we work a multiple

00:11:24,209 --> 00:11:34,049
project to phone the nice complete home

00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:37,829
of fedora we work on the wiki page it's

00:11:34,049 --> 00:11:43,369
more play format that each team may have

00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:45,670
their own language team pages that we do

00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:49,550
translate the wicked pages

00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:52,100
and then last one is a documentation the

00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:54,500
installation guide system administration

00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:57,230
guide many of the guy the public from

00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:59,720
the documentation team who will localize

00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:03,560
where skyed as well but at this moment

00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:06,980
there is some publishing to issues on

00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:09,860
that documentation theme side so we do

00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:12,980
translate but unfortunately we cannot

00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:15,800
publish our localize the documentation

00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:22,730
at this moment and hopefully the problem

00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:26,290
will be solved soon yes we can translate

00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:26,290
that can't publish at all

00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:41,950
he talked about the transactions

00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:46,090
colleges now only we don't translate

00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:50,710
grants so the Norfolk station has to be

00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:50,710
efficient in every damages

00:12:56,329 --> 00:13:05,949
yeah yeah many of my wish years Fedora

00:13:00,769 --> 00:13:05,949
is for though we don't translate others

00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:15,619
Merry Christmas why he named the droids

00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:18,619
translated RI I do not translate your

00:13:15,619 --> 00:13:22,059
name the name is real name it's

00:13:18,619 --> 00:13:24,470
impressive wheels fixes proportion to

00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:28,069
the catering in our lately because

00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:33,709
otherwise it is like using instead of

00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:38,269
using thoroughly as a BF intro the man

00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:40,459
rock may ask why you have computers

00:13:38,269 --> 00:13:43,249
that's that's why you have been too good

00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:48,339
to rebuild the house entrance so that

00:13:43,249 --> 00:13:52,660
you don't have to go has no floor at all

00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:58,540
the board is record I shall want to go

00:13:52,660 --> 00:14:00,860
because less which levels are stronger

00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:05,139
ain't even gonna leave a dirty no work

00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:05,139
of some structure on shut up

00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:24,130
we use fanciful everywhere there is an

00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:31,210
exception I don't live in it so long

00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:33,430
federal station maybe we can discuss

00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:42,510
about the lighting in the workshop them

00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:46,800
to have so let me give next slice please

00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:49,270
I'd like to introduce the way the

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:54,130
translation activity sits in the

00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:56,290
development cycle this is the yeah

00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:59,770
schedule fit over schedule the only

00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:03,220
shows up the key milestones and there is

00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:06,760
a software string first date this day is

00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:10,420
exactly the developer has to stop Eddie

00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:13,360
or add or delete the strings but they

00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:15,760
have to finalize the strength part of

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,190
the the application so that the transit

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:22,180
a clean start translation and make it

00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:25,750
hundred-person translated if the

00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:28,030
developer break this day then we give

00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:30,520
the hundred hundred percent translation

00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:32,950
but still application will not be

00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:35,530
localized hundred percent so this is the

00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:38,950
data is very in order the possible from

00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:40,960
the developer to the translators and the

00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:44,920
nest comes to the deadline of the

00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:47,680
software that we stop the translation

00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:50,290
and give the ball back to the developers

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:53,740
of the developer we're stuck who the

00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:56,950
latest translation build make sure the

00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:59,250
build is saying and put it back to the

00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:06,810
cause you so that will come up

00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:09,240
release next release a little bit scroll

00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:13,020
down then we will see a detailed

00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:16,740
schedule in here for the translation

00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:19,470
schedule we do explain more about we do

00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:22,170
have a QA test period as well some more

00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:25,490
detailed schedule we can find in terms

00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:27,750
of the translation team also as I

00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:29,700
explained the document that we do the

00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:32,420
different we do translate the

00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:37,260
documentation we do translate the

00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:39,810
website it is those are depending on the

00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:43,530
website team or the documentation team

00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:45,960
so usually we go in the documentation

00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:48,450
team schedule when is the string free

00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:50,460
site for the release notes or render

00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:58,860
your string free state for the website

00:16:50,460 --> 00:17:03,690
itself and the last one is upstream

00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:06,240
project schedule as i explained that do

00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:08,310
not some of the kinome part will come in

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:12,720
a fedora some of the live loaf is part

00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:16,110
coming Nick adoro some Mozilla part come

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:19,199
in a fedora but which part will come out

00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:21,540
it says that exactly which version of

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,910
the goon or mu come in the Fedora 25

00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:26,670
which version of the limit office will

00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:28,920
come in a failure 25 so according those

00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:33,240
information that the translator will

00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:36,320
work or focus on those Beijing to get in

00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,320
the door 25

00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:49,570
language seems we do have an 81 language

00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:52,870
change at this moment in 875 translators

00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:55,899
registered I think we are one of the

00:17:52,870 --> 00:18:00,059
biggest sub-project under the fedora

00:17:55,899 --> 00:18:02,740
project I don't say that all of the 875

00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:05,200
translators are active at the moment but

00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:07,929
at least they are registered and then

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:12,850
they potentially come up in being active

00:18:07,929 --> 00:18:16,990
in and out in and out we have our own

00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:20,730
homepage it's a federal projects / wiki

00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:23,740
/ Alton and all the information in there

00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:30,179
we do have a bi-weekly meeting on the

00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:30,179
RSC as well his

00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:40,799
translators is people in the teens and

00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:44,190
fedora 12 this is all new company it 808

00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:48,000
hun semi-hard counted from the trance at

00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:50,970
least making this registration purchase

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,750
down fast yes that's right on so their

00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:57,690
money more do not registered in this

00:18:54,750 --> 00:19:00,990
smelling in this mailing list but owning

00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:03,240
a local mailing list but basically we

00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:07,110
asked the translators to join

00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:09,780
this main mailing list as well the local

00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:12,260
mailing this supposed differently or

00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,260
branding

00:19:21,149 --> 00:19:27,450
how to join your language them if near

00:19:24,269 --> 00:19:31,109
and interested the localization this is

00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:36,269
how that how to join language thing we

00:19:31,109 --> 00:19:38,279
will have more kind user friendly guide

00:19:36,269 --> 00:19:42,119
written in a wiki page which can be

00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:45,839
found in the home page basically what

00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:49,849
the new person has to do is create FAS

00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:52,859
that's every contributor doing and

00:19:49,849 --> 00:19:56,249
subscribe mailing list that we just

00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:58,559
talked about once transplant list of

00:19:56,249 --> 00:20:00,839
federal project all that this is mailing

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:04,109
list every translator required to join

00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:06,559
the second one is language specific

00:20:04,109 --> 00:20:12,359
mailing list for a Japanese trans

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:14,729
dossier mailing list and French has

00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:17,789
their own mailing list in this mailing

00:20:14,729 --> 00:20:22,859
list can be discussed about the language

00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:25,950
specific the goals or worried about our

00:20:22,859 --> 00:20:29,909
problems and they can speak in their own

00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:32,700
languages as well ensign to the sonata

00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:34,799
because the most of the packages to

00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:37,259
register dings another and then we are

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:40,710
using this another as our translation

00:20:37,259 --> 00:20:43,070
platform and then we can start

00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:43,070
translating

00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:53,790
in the previous wiki page guide consists

00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:55,920
of six sections but to start with the

00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:59,310
translation we only need one two three

00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:01,050
sections four five six is more like

00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:03,690
additional information how to

00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:06,060
proofreading how to make sure no error

00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:07,980
for the packages but basically we need

00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:12,240
only one two three sections that's all

00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:14,700
and in section 2 point 2 point 3 there

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:18,840
is the section code introduce yourself

00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:24,360
this is most important part if the join

00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:27,360
team it's not the technical technical

00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:30,300
part but this is a communication part

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:36,060
communicating with the other team with

00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:40,290
the other translators say what to say

00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:43,050
say hello to others to start the team

00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:45,600
working is very important if you are

00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:47,750
here and then other thing work over

00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:51,810
there and then there is no communication

00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:55,200
then it's funny isn't it it's like

00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:58,290
working on the same language team then

00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,900
it is nice to help each other if say

00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:03,690
hello where I am the new can you help me

00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:06,000
blah then the other person can help you

00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:09,000
that say nothing and then the other

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,360
person can't help you are all so the

00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,930
communication is important and this is

00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:20,090
the very first / very first part to

00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:20,090
introduce yourself into the team

00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:30,690
I just brought up some neighbors

00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:34,620
language teams there is a polish team

00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:36,360
led by Kyoto there's a check team

00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:38,760
there's a Hungarian team there's a

00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:45,630
Sawbuck team where are the German team

00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:49,170
as well if anything any problem any

00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:52,230
questions any translation and lab

00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:54,780
probably the coordinate talk to the

00:22:52,230 --> 00:23:01,620
coordinate accorded are happy to fix it

00:22:54,780 --> 00:23:05,100
or discuss it it's our help in the

00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:08,550
initial keynote we love it about the

00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:11,010
fedora half and then translation team

00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:15,800
and the design team are looking at to

00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:19,310
connect the old localization team sonata

00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:21,750
workflow translation work Rocco says

00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:25,080
connecting to the photographer for the

00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:29,430
hub so do we are more easily to access

00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:32,150
about easily no easily to learn more

00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:34,920
information from the having a one place

00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:38,540
but I can't have anything to show you

00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:42,600
today but there is an infra

00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:47,910
infrastructure workshop on force over

00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:51,210
thursday starting 130 to 330 we are free

00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:54,180
to talk about further questions give you

to talk about how to include the Fedora

00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,930
hub in terms of the localization

00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:21,140
let me just a little bit about the de

00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:24,020
nada how we work with Sonata put in the

00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:27,680
your web browser fedora dot org then

00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:30,680
this login screen comes up it's a very

00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:36,560
simple app click on the right hand top

00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:39,860
log in then the second login screen

00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:44,540
comes up this is actually comes from the

00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:47,990
edge salon open ID / patrick i can see

00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:51,850
him in this work this is his application

00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:56,180
through this application collect the

00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:58,910
janitor to the FAS system so that we

00:24:56,180 --> 00:25:01,940
make sure that only the translator who

00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:05,980
has a phase account can access and

00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:09,470
access to the insalata before

00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:13,580
applications the username the password

00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:17,000
from the faa's account and there we can

00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:20,660
go in the dashboard of the own dashboard

00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:25,190
from there say if I wanted to continue

00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:27,860
the translation previously work then go

00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:29,960
to the history activities and click the

00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:32,060
link say I used to work there on the

00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:35,060
corner the yesterday click this link and

00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:37,630
then I can move to the Anaconda project

00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:40,700
page to start the translation or I

00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:46,400
started to nearly new project than in

00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:49,640
the saatchi field we talked in the

00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:52,490
project playing to such and then enter

00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:55,700
then it goes to that project page it

00:25:52,490 --> 00:26:00,490
looks like this this is a Alec on the

00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:04,310
project page some project page has

00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:07,160
multiple versions the other project has

00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:10,580
only one version most likely master

00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:14,000
version if there is only one version

00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:16,130
then the translator simply work on the

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,390
subversion and then that translation

00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:24,170
will go into the latest release but if

00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:27,920
the project has a multiple versions then

00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:30,650
what we have to do is currently we are

00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:34,400
in the fedora Tony family development

00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:37,640
cycle find out the f 25 branch in here

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:41,900
if there is f 25 branch then we'll work

00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:46,730
on it that we go into f 25 trans 25

00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:51,500
release if we pick master while there is

00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:53,750
f 25 master is for the future so it's

00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:56,750
not wasting but it's goes to the future

00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:59,570
not the current release so as long as

00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:02,390
there is f 25 or the current release

00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:04,970
Blanche working on that branch so that

00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:07,340
it can go up the current release at this

00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:09,470
pace there isn't no f 25 branch that

00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:13,670
means an accord a team doesn't create

00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:17,240
f25 branch yet so we still be able to

00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:19,700
walk on the master branch and then

00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:23,560
anaconda team will copy the master

00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:27,710
branch create a new f25 branch and

00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:31,010
upload from that point translator can

00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:37,220
start f25 branch for specifically the f

00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:39,500
25 release click the yard because there

00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:44,380
is a no f 25 branch click the master

00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:44,380
branch this time it shows up like this

00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:52,070
click on language say this x click the

00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:57,200
polish and then right hand side number

00:27:52,070 --> 00:28:00,140
three it shows our document most likely

00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:03,800
the project has only one document but

00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:06,890
sometimes one project has to document in

00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:10,340
that means we have to work on the third

00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:13,970
document to complete that application

00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:15,950
specially that application this time

00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:18,390
only one documentation so click the

00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:22,299
button manager

00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:24,159
this called the editor screen where we

00:28:22,299 --> 00:28:26,669
can add the translation editor

00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:30,940
translation delete the wrong translation

00:28:26,669 --> 00:28:34,299
the left-hand side is a source English

00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:37,090
so we can see it but we can't touch it

00:28:34,299 --> 00:28:39,429
so even click it we can touch it you can

00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:46,960
edit it with an edited we can delete it

00:28:39,429 --> 00:28:50,470
so it is safe sometimes we say we when

00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:54,039
we localize in the editors then easily

00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:56,950
to accidentally touch the sauce sauce

00:28:54,039 --> 00:29:00,039
English and we change it that can lead

00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:03,760
to the era when they when you developers

00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:06,610
package that translation so that they

00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:11,049
give up to incur the translation but

00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:14,100
using the sauna that we don't kind of

00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:17,919
touch the English sauce so it is safe

00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:20,559
safeway not accidentally touch the

00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:23,350
English Court but we can translate in

00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:29,500
the right hand side there the idea

00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:32,289
translation the language sauce is a left

00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:36,659
hand side in English well I mean so for

00:29:32,289 --> 00:29:36,659
example 12 is working on outside and say

00:29:49,149 --> 00:29:52,539
very little

00:29:54,590 --> 00:30:01,240
yep

00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:05,320
technically it can be done but if the

00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:09,700
source is Russia and then the developer

00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:12,520
requires the spanish translation imagine

00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:18,130
how many translator i can transfer from

00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:20,170
Russia to Spanish that means salmon the

00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:22,870
salmon do understand Russian an

00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:27,550
expansion in the same time it's a very

00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:30,430
small amount of resource so that in the

00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:33,970
beginning I explained that right in

00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:37,180
English so that the many of the

00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:39,310
translator do understand English so so

00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:41,980
that can be translated in many other

00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:47,290
languages so if even the developers

00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:49,810
speak Russian then I encourage that

00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:52,930
group of people to grab some

00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:55,750
english-speaking well in with English

00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:59,110
speakers to translate that his Russian

00:30:55,750 --> 00:31:01,810
into the english first and put put the

00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:04,480
app we can put the translation english

00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:07,510
sauce as English sauce so that the many

00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:10,150
other language can translate but put as

00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:11,860
a Russian as a source it really have

00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:14,650
wires to traffic because I don't

00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:17,320
understand Russian so i can transfer

00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:20,340
from english to japanese a contrast with

00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,340
russian to each other

00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:29,450
I just explained a very brief essential

00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:32,600
information about the sonata and lucky

00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:35,809
again we have as a lotta different team

00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:38,360
on board on the flock and he is going to

00:31:35,809 --> 00:31:41,990
present more detailed than at a session

00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:45,440
which happens today 232 320th of please

00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:52,940
join his session with bunch of questions

00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:55,309
and shoot him until he died okay that's

00:31:52,940 --> 00:32:02,570
all from me my name is Michael any

00:31:55,309 --> 00:32:05,450
questions or any suggestions just come

00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:08,960
to me after the sessions or use them in

00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:12,230
email noriko at redhat.com or i'll be on

00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:15,950
IRC usually I'm alone the ephedra dusty

00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:19,190
11 n channels in the Austrian time nine

00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:24,740
to five so just give me my nickname is

00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:29,409
and why I care so any questions I'm not

00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:29,409
sure I can also everything about yes

00:32:30,289 --> 00:32:39,280
history of of

00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:46,850
organizations during comedy history

00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:54,050
localization right localization history

00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:57,170
in the testing group localization team

00:32:54,050 --> 00:33:02,590
actually starting almost the same time

00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:05,570
in that way the fedoras started in 2003

00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:08,360
before the Fedora started the Red Hat

00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:13,040
has red hat linux not they were heading

00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:16,190
to class lynard red had selling the Red

00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:19,130
Hat Linux or the open-source contributed

00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:22,370
we'd had decided to have separate the

00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:27,260
Red Hat Enterprise Linux and fedora so

00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:30,080
that the Red Hat were for the epidural

00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:33,320
as a red hat enterprise linux as the

00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:35,210
other doing the same thing since then

00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:38,210
that the most of the arena had

00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:40,970
developers contribute to the fedora so

00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:44,030
as the Red Hat translator contribute to

00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:48,520
the fedora localization itself as a

00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:51,440
beginning and then we started to more

00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:55,250
encourage the community people to join

00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:58,370
and take the lead many of the language

00:33:55,250 --> 00:34:01,160
are now led by the emotional but the

00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:04,550
period community translators even the

00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:08,780
Japanese team has their own lead let me

00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:13,000
but they're only so we are getting grow

00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:16,720
bigger and bigger in terms of the

00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:20,960
testing group this is a little bit

00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:26,180
problematic area that we need more

00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:30,220
resource preparation for testing is this

00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:32,810
thing is a very important part to keep

00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:35,690
good quality for the localization

00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:37,940
because we work in the janata but we

00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:41,600
don't know how the string comes up in

00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:43,050
which situations through the testing we

00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:45,810
actually see

00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:48,270
the application as the operating system

00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:51,300
so we can see how the strength comes up

00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:53,910
and check it and then the quality is

00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:56,490
good or bad and the weekend changing

00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:59,190
with amata but the testing is we need

00:34:56,490 --> 00:35:01,830
some resource to communicate with the

00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:04,500
release engineering team also the QE

00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:08,640
came to set up the test test days and

00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:14,220
prepare the testing itself and at this

00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:17,880
stage there is only one or two people

00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:21,120
from red heart but differently we are

00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:24,090
short of the resource and we like to

00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:27,110
have more people joy Joyner on both for

00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:27,110
the testing

00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,210
kissing you have

00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:43,920
so guests as well as the transitive

00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:43,920
intransitive would be very simple

00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:53,090
and said many you also look on different

00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:57,690
projects yeah is there any way to share

00:35:53,090 --> 00:36:04,080
previously done translation yep yep we

00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:06,270
do I I haven't tried to come how many

00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:10,500
packages away across again it's so many

00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:14,040
more than hunger and then in xela that

00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:17,760
there is a code translation memory so

00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:20,670
all the translations are kind of stored

00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:25,140
as a data and then we can refer to it

00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:28,050
and then there is a copy buttons so we

00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:29,520
found the similar translation or the

00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:32,160
good quality translation in the

00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:35,190
translation Emily we can we can simply

00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:40,770
click the copy copy buttons it comes up

00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:44,040
in translation field in the editor and

00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:46,980
probably a little bit tweaked needed so

00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:52,100
that basically we can share the data

00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:52,100
base quiz hood in ayia language teen

00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:00,890
imagine quality yeah transmission

00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:09,720
there is another function called the

00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:13,710
review once translated it says as a

00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:16,110
status is translated in Xalapa and then

00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:19,260
another person it's called the reviewer

00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:22,740
has a review of permission ensenada that

00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:26,610
person reviewed that strings and market

00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:30,030
review approved or rejected a probe

00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:33,000
means this is good quality and then the

00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:35,700
status change to the reboot approve or

00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,700
reject it so that somebody has to redo

00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:42,180
the translation but if marked as a

00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:46,080
reviewed approved that means the quality

00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:48,600
is good so everything that another is a

00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:51,600
pretty much smart user-friendly

00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:54,480
translator friendly platform which is

00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:58,800
also used by the OpenStack project as

00:37:54,480 --> 00:38:00,660
well so we like to spread to do normal

00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:05,480
self below me is using at the moment

00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:05,480
down line pretty much a manuals

00:38:08,109 --> 00:38:13,690
translation and help to the project the

00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:13,690
notes

00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:23,859
here's a small translation team say only

00:38:20,229 --> 00:38:25,229
a few active translator is at the moment

00:38:23,859 --> 00:38:28,589
focusing and one hundred percent

00:38:25,229 --> 00:38:31,269
translation rather than the review so

00:38:28,589 --> 00:38:36,160
those theme having worked the review

00:38:31,269 --> 00:38:39,519
that all probably yeah from now on we

00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:42,880
should encourage stuff that teams to

00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:45,309
review more essential like anaconda or

00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:54,609
the essential packages to make sure that

00:38:45,309 --> 00:38:58,359
the party is good is a work able to say

00:38:54,609 --> 00:39:00,849
this project is under the Green who

00:38:58,359 --> 00:39:08,370
process if the content has not been

00:39:00,849 --> 00:39:13,000
reviewed or approved I come in

00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:16,450
God is there a way to do project manager

00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,610
this is a way to walk you mr.

00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:21,430
translation so we can manage quality

00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:24,730
doesn't exist but is there is such a

00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:27,280
feature but that features only how to

00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:32,640
buy the big developers so developers can

00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:35,920
decide the translation can only use as

00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:38,830
review the translation but if click if

00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:48,550
you use that features that can affect

00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:51,700
all languages not only a frame yeah yeah

00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:53,620
yeahs cannot say to my mine my agreeing

00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:55,660
sizing acknowledge this will work that

00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:58,210
way depends of the way the Polish

00:39:55,660 --> 00:40:01,090
community is using organized yeah

00:39:58,210 --> 00:40:04,210
probably we can discuss about that point

00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:08,620
I agree on that on the election prepay

00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:11,320
prepared so that I don't know I i

00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:15,760
believe that another team will join that

00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:17,800
workshop so yeah that the part i

00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:21,570
accounted anything at all but then that

00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,570
the team can do something else for us

00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,240
great

00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:38,440
I'm a developer and I often in contact

00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:44,360
with translators might have some msgs

00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:49,880

00:40:57,339 --> 00:41:02,069

through our group problems those steps

00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:22,690
yes it is something the promise of

00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:26,050

00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:29,610
another oscillate my son yeah we better

00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:29,610
to cook torture

00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:52,730
they are officially the most when they

00:43:49,530 --> 00:44:02,000
have some rights because you can occur

00:43:52,730 --> 00:44:05,000
or you cannot go fresco yet no permits

00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
recently

00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:16,840
stock remember the wheel every is for

00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:16,840
organization

00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:26,370

00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:26,370
compliment

so this revealed that's the first one

00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:44,250
that's actively used anymore so there is

00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:47,400
a question actually should we have

00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:50,790
everyone's later that kind of person

00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:58,160

00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:58,160
or process is

00:45:51,820 --> 00:46:07,370
yeah although well there is a no mock-up

00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:10,040
or the automatical status that it is

00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:14,020
this person is active this person is in

00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:17,570
after more likely in terms they

00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:21,230
regularly comes up in nailing this and

00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:24,680
then help the people or submitting a

00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:27,620
translation itself it's really depending

00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:31,810
on the teams but for the Japanese if the

00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:36,260
people when translated translate wants

00:46:31,810 --> 00:46:38,440
