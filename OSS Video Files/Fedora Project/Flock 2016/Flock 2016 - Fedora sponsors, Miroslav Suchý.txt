Playlist: Flock 2016
Description: 
	For long time I am closely watching Fedora Sponsorship process. I made an survey amongst both Sponsors and Sponsoree. I got some data and I want to present it to you. I want to discuss with Fedora Sponsors in person and identify the parts of the process, which can be improved.
