Title: Flock 2016 - Fedora sponsors, Miroslav Suchý
Publication date: 2016-08-21
Playlist: Flock 2016
Description: 
	For long time I am closely watching Fedora Sponsorship process. I made an survey amongst both Sponsors and Sponsoree. I got some data and I want to present it to you. I want to discuss with Fedora Sponsors in person and identify the parts of the process, which can be improved.

okay so you may know me my name is

00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:17,490
miroslav Sookie and I would like to talk

00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:32,250
here about sponsorship process and how

00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:37,020
to improve that and it is possible I am

00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:40,770
Imperial sponsor I've been monitoring

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:43,129
how the sponsorship works and I'm

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,930
personally not satisfied with that so I

00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:54,899
watched it closely for for more than a

00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:59,760
year I have some data and I can show you

00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:03,530
them probably even some ideas but the

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:06,720
main point would should be dead v later

00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:10,400
should discuss how to improve and I

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:15,689
would really love to hear your ideas

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:18,299
which I may later are present or

00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:22,380
meaningless or something like that come

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:26,790
here sorry so what is what is the

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:30,240
situation today if someone want to join

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:33,030
fedora and contribute to fedora and

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,950
sorry I'm not all right now I'm speaking

00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:38,009
about contributing like like packaging

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:43,280
Peck geeze they are dozens of other I

00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:46,979
areas editing with it wiki art usability

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:50,100
outreach and others bad I'm focusing

00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:51,930
here only on the packaging part so

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:57,869
what's the situation today you have to

00:01:51,930 --> 00:02:04,040
submit packet review and blog federer FP

00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:04,040
lead sponsor and and where

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:19,530
and wait and wait sometimes it's fast ba

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:24,239
sometime it is not our right now we have

00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:28,709
in the queue 100 package reviews which

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:33,900
are waiting for sponsored or

00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:37,230
co-sponsored that's not larger we had

00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:40,920
times when it was closed around

00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:47,310
thousands yeah it is not much but it's

00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:52,170
still more than zero ah fortunately it's

00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:59,640
not growing too much recently but it's

00:02:52,170 --> 00:03:02,599
not declining kider and i will mention

00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:04,709
it on other side there are some some

00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:09,209
reviews which are waiting there for

00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:12,060
years which is not ideal either yeah

00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:15,209
sometimes it's on purpose i would say i

00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:18,540
guess he just anybody has anybody been

00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:21,269
probably higher effects review yeah I I

00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:24,060
probably the longest standing here I I

00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:27,420
was that I was the one who finished that

00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:32,639
ok I also wanted to try pick that person

00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:36,829
yeah first to me I mean it's been like

00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:41,549
eight years so I think and yeah and it

00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:44,220
came under and the review last it was

00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:47,850
closed after nine years but it was two

00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:51,160
ice creams fighting each other

00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:54,580
baba this was even yeah in fedora fight

00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:58,270
yeah I said I send the data guy gap and

00:03:54,580 --> 00:04:02,340
the federer Frederica gap and dead cop

00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:07,780
with either a swap for for his patient

00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:10,150
and put patients but what so but yeah we

00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:15,850
have summaries which are quite a stopped

00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:18,820
and there is a fight whether the guys

00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:21,400
should wait because there are still some

00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:24,820
review which was not even touched my

00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:29,560
sponsor or whether they should contact

00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:33,040
one yeah some try to contact problem who

00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:36,120
to convert because we have 135 sponsor

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,680
which is not so much about nice number

00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,830
but I will speak about that later and

00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:44,950
the cube is just saying right now the

00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:52,150
only Streb you is 44 years old you used

00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:54,700
to be nine years old we have 190 rebels

00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:59,080
which need sponsors and at the same time

00:04:54,700 --> 00:05:02,020
we have ten times more regular package

00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:07,780
review which are waiting for being

00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:09,460
crabby which file with motivation and I

00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:17,310
will speak about it later just remember

00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:21,730
that data ok we have 135 sponsors wow

00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:25,660
that's only just recording DD because

00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:31,480
some of them are enacted some of them

00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:34,330
are even depth so if you try to reach

00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:39,010
some of those sponsors you may or get be

00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:44,380
lucky to even get some response some of

00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:48,790
them are specialized on some on in their

00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:51,009
field I will probably not say java

00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:57,099
package for the review

00:05:51,009 --> 00:06:00,369
or if I can avoid that and I guess

00:05:57,099 --> 00:06:06,669
others have similar so find the correct

00:06:00,369 --> 00:06:10,300
sponsor for your package can be hard but

00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:14,159
look closely what on the sponsors I

00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:17,469
gather some statistics and eighty

00:06:14,159 --> 00:06:22,839
sponsors have no visible activity in

00:06:17,469 --> 00:06:29,669
past year it is mean Snyder not comment

00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:43,860
in those reviews or neither sponsored

00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:47,770
somebody directly in what no interesting

00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:52,029
because someone doesn't take achieve the

00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:55,059
same two years yeah but some of their

00:06:52,029 --> 00:06:57,279
active I I seen in that list some people

00:06:55,059 --> 00:06:59,289
which are active and do a lot of work

00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,689
for federal resort they are active in

00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:04,990
figure they just didn't then I need any

00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:07,599
sponsorship in past year and yes I know

00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:09,789
bout some guys which done some

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:12,879
sponsorship really did work like talking

00:07:09,789 --> 00:07:15,039
about packaging at I sorry I don't want

00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,839
to name them because it's not fair

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,839
because they they probably done some

00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:25,300
some some work but it doesn't help with

00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:30,320
lowering those picture of yours well I

00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:34,190
think you're you're you say no visible

00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:39,950
that's the right term my one of the 80

00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:44,560
with no visible activity I have like

00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:48,080
something 22 23 people that I sponsor I

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,760
still over every commit they do I take

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,090
care of them on email with them and

00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:55,520
probably of course that's not visible

00:07:52,090 --> 00:08:00,170
I'm not ready to accept new sponsors

00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:03,590
where lady I yeah because yeah I'm a

00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:05,510
verte that it's it's not fair metrics I

00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:10,150
am trying to get at least something

00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:16,010
close so we know how how many sponsors

00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:18,770
me as you a guy who want to join federer

00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:21,080
is able to reach yes but the thing is

00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:23,210
like you already came up with this I

00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,040
here on the meeting this very year and I

00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:26,990
was one of the people who replied and

00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:30,200
said hey I'm still a trip just your

00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:32,720
visitor and then you responded like a

00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:36,200
I'm going to shut down my right ear and

00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:39,919
I think the truth is somewhere in the

00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,840
middle we need to find your way then and

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:45,350
we can identify people who are no longer

00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:47,830
active or willing to accept your

00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:52,270
sponsors and I think you're suggesting

00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:55,600
that if somebody is really no longer

00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:57,820
active on the whole system he doesn't

00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,000
authenticate against chess or something

00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:03,280
from then he's really gone none of these

00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,810
need to be white without a more general

00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:12,760
problem yeah that was gentle maybe you

00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:14,800
can refine the data in identified very

00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:18,100
few people because I don't spit but we

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:21,700
have a tea person people are totally

00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:23,800
legit but if we have a list like five or

00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:26,350
ten people that's something that should

00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:28,780
be brought to a specialist where we have

00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:36,310
this alias and we say okay we're

00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:39,700
particularly ok I will postpone it for

00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:42,760
for later diskussioner i would first try

00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:45,870
to present those data they are not

00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:50,110
perfect but let's assume for a while too

00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:52,900
well on the statistic level it show us

00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:56,440
at least the world where the percentage

00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:58,480
we are yeah so right now we have

00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,300
probably fifty five percent which are

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:09,150
willing to sponsor somebody or take

00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:14,460
somebody new she's not big number so uh

00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:18,580
how disposers work in past year from my

00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:23,410
for from my script it seems that only

00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:26,020
twelve sponsors work on boxes ok it

00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:28,150
seems like really low number for me I

00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:30,640
don't even trust it but I didn't have

00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:37,810
time to validate that but still low

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:40,510
number I am lucky to

00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:45,450
but that means that the local sponsor of

00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:51,430
concern grab are working on Mozilla so

00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:54,010
that's something yeah we despite the

00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:58,240
fact that only 12 people 12 people works

00:10:54,010 --> 00:11:02,950
on bugzilla he had 49 sponsors which

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:06,460
sponsored for 142 sponsored so it was

00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:09,670
I'd retired sponsorship or comment gains

00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:12,839
or something like that so yeah we had a

00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:19,980
lot of fresh fresh a lot we have some

00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:24,810
flat fresh blue blood but obviously no

00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:30,640
not all of them come through the normal

00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:39,730
sponsorship process as we plan to work

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:43,390
it formula was from why dispensary pull

00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:46,120
out from my experience and I don't have

00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:49,000
the data for dead because I may contact

00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:53,320
some some sponsor which pull out but

00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:56,170
they will wait for days months or years

00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:58,450
and then was the interesting interested

00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:03,760
in in fedora because they have no

00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:07,570
reaction and then somebody after a few

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:09,790
years sometimes even me common deuce are

00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:12,310
you still interesting and when they

00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:15,220
didn't react for two months or something

00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:18,130
like that the picture abhi was close so

00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:20,650
what we basically lost that people they

00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:23,500
were in some time interesting in fedora

00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:26,890
and contributing it was that and if you

00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:30,430
were on the presentation of P today

00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:33,850
morning they have a some data from data

00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:36,779
Grapher under she had a huge number of

00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:40,930
about people which created first account

00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:43,840
done some work for federal less than 10

00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:47,260
da action

00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:52,090
Ripper and then they were gone no no

00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:54,700
more interesting in fedora so oh those

00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:58,750
are people which we may work with them

00:12:54,700 --> 00:13:05,470
and convince them to join federer do

00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:12,310
something and very often the reason is

00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:14,350
that why via sponsors are closing it's

00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:16,690
not about the review is because the

00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:21,790
sponsor he doesn't drive yeah that's

00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:24,460
true very very often I take a limited

00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:27,910
sample of some those all these reviews

00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:30,850
and average waiting time for the

00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:35,710
sponsoring reactions stuff Mons video

00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:37,360
and the longest 28 months so yeah we

00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:40,270
sometimes have to wait for the spawn

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:44,170
Jory and sometimes even for a long time

00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:47,200
but at the same time and this number are

00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:49,270
fifty to fifty fifty percent we are

00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,700
waiting for this pondering and fifty

00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:54,430
percent for the sponsors is that we are

00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:58,180
much longer waiting for the spawns over

00:13:54,430 --> 00:14:01,170
on the same sample there we waited

00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:06,370
twenty six months for four spoons or

00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:07,870
when the longest time was 64 the thing

00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:09,250
is this author doesn't have to do it

00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:11,550
does have to be a sponsor does the

00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,550
review

00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:18,230
actually this process is that we ask

00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:21,410
sponsor e to you before reviews and they

00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:25,880
often don't and I can reach in somewhere

00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:30,860
in the end yeah I don't I don't mention

00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:34,460
it yet in a barrel I even a setup

00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:37,610
thought about women rver redhead only

00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:40,760
focus because I notice that quite often

00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:45,170
those people which get our sponsor are

00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:50,360
at reddit com so I say are we ready sng

00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:53,930
corner actually it was some other sample

00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:59,590
for past water it was I think there was

00:14:53,930 --> 00:15:06,620
40 people sponsored 21 was from redhead

00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:09,020
19 from some other domains and 3ds from

00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:13,430
these others were likely redhead because

00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:18,590
they named match to our local employees

00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:21,860
database so we have a lot of people from

00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:25,130
red hat which are being sponsored but at

00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:30,260
the same time approximately same number

00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:32,920
from the others and there and it seemed

00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:36,200
we are not making exception because a

00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:43,070
former vice president are still waiting

00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:47,960
for four years to be spawns or so yeah

00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:51,620
yeah yeah yeah correct but very

00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:55,550
interesting was that dope from these 90

00:15:51,620 --> 00:16:01,900
others were for from Intel they have an

00:15:55,550 --> 00:16:06,910
angel com which brings me the idea that

00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:12,080
very likely those seem sponsor a

00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:15,560
successful on Zuri comes from the group

00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:19,400
or from the community where somebody

00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:22,490
from Ferrara federer already exists if

00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:24,230
you join a red hat somebody built

00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:28,339
elementary because you need it for work

00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:30,649
and he will say do that do that and you

00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:35,390
will really like a busy sponsored within

00:16:30,649 --> 00:16:37,970
days or week if you come from the Intel

00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:41,779
or some other company versus already

00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:44,240
have federal account inspector he will

00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:46,880
guide you and say right now you have to

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:50,270
read these guidelines but only these

00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:53,839
parts these are important these are 15

00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:55,730
pages long is not so important and watch

00:16:53,839 --> 00:17:00,680
this process you need to know that and

00:16:55,730 --> 00:17:02,720
you are a sponsored again very quick you

00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:05,059
come from the University where is

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,839
already somebody from federal it goes

00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:13,790
quick but if you are really nooby noob I

00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:15,980
and you are alone and you just heard and

00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:17,870
read about Federer and I want to join

00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:21,199
and you don't know anything about

00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:32,780
Phaedra nobody it's very likely for you

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:39,050
to be hard it's your you're supposed to

00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:40,670
say read the guidelines it's long and I

00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:42,860
don't even know all those guidelines

00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:48,080
because they are changing quite quite

00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:51,440
fast and I don't know that yeah ah and

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:53,510
you have any food should if you have to

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:57,590
do some informal review you have to know

00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:59,950
the guidelines first so it's chicken egg

00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,950
problem

00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:07,049
that don't have to see live with your

00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:09,960
sponsors because when you do not for

00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:13,200
engaging apartment you know parking

00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:16,200
garage pretty well and not likely to you

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:26,760
each Garland's which are very different

00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:29,730
in different rings yeah well I asked the

00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:34,320
sponsors to feel sorry I get 33

00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:37,919
responses here are the results so one

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:40,410
you can the link is on my on my slide

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:44,820
saw when you will check it it's on the

00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:50,640
Internet ah you can go through that but

00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:52,380
there is nothing too surprising just

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,590
that how often do you check for the new

00:18:52,380 --> 00:19:03,270
bugzilla looking F and unique F in each

00:18:55,590 --> 00:19:09,270
sponsors rarely Europe per year or once

00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:13,350
some period but despite that this answer

00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:16,860
are very likely honest I think they are

00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:23,280
very often lie because I asked several

00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:27,630
guys how many people use sponsored in

00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:31,580
past half a year they told me some

00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:36,840
numbers and when I can compare that

00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:40,440
against my script it's often like okay i

00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:43,830
sponsored like six people I said no it

00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:48,780
was just too you spose are six people in

00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:50,850
past 80 knots this the time they are

00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:54,330
replying good purpose but the time flies

00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:58,020
is it sounds like being yesterday but

00:19:54,330 --> 00:20:01,110
it's been years ago probably so so so

00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:04,140
right I very often say yeah I'm doing

00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:05,049
sponsorship work quite often but if I

00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:09,620
look into the

00:20:05,049 --> 00:20:13,010
seems that ok I guess last review six

00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:18,650
months ago so because I had a lot of

00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:28,580
work and I forget about the time also

00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:31,309
that this survey is by no means yes just

00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:35,780
you got some responses injected Raza I

00:20:31,309 --> 00:20:38,090
again I'm guilty as charged I didn't get

00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:49,960
survey so I don't even remember if I did

00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:53,179
or not yeah but more interesting was

00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:57,070
similar sponsor survey which I send

00:20:53,179 --> 00:20:59,960
response re is what we were recently

00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:04,600
successfully sponsored I didn't send

00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:09,890
those which were unsuccessfully my fault

00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:13,820
and a lot of them say that they were

00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:18,380
pretty fast sponsored but some of them

00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:24,559
ma waited even even I think there was a

00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:27,440
year yeah some of them to care ah some

00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:30,440
of them find hard to find spawns or some

00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:33,650
of them say okay my redhead teammates

00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:36,260
sponsored be yeah so so let's jive I'm

00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:40,370
talking about if you have some teammate

00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:44,919
who already is Federer you are very

00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:50,900
likely to find a sponsor you are not oh

00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:56,470
it's difficult for you interesting is

00:21:50,900 --> 00:22:01,309
this part by the biggest obstacle and

00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:05,240
you can find your cool print some say

00:22:01,309 --> 00:22:08,539
there are a lot of documentation some

00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:13,370
say they're there is too much

00:22:08,539 --> 00:22:17,140
documentation so someone someone won't

00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:17,140
less someone want more

00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:23,929
so our record but I don't think so

00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:26,360
definitely there is something fishy

00:22:23,929 --> 00:22:29,240
without documentation and that's what I

00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:35,110
said we have long guidelines you are

00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:35,110
unable to comprehend that on your day 0

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:44,330
so you when i meet probably something

00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:50,289
well smaller while if you are more

00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:50,289
advanced unique some pointers later

00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:06,110
telnet literally because yes it has more

00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:08,570
emotional person smaller set of

00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:10,940
guidelines and most of these guys they

00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:13,490
don't even heard of them so i have to

00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:15,409
focus on the most important investor

00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:17,330
yeah i mean there are so many different

00:23:15,409 --> 00:23:20,059
aspects is one of this is to review

00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:23,659
process sucks and we know it because it

00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:27,260
was we came up with it in 2006 something

00:23:23,659 --> 00:23:29,590
in and auxiliary doesn't work that's

00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:34,250
somebody's been working on an app and

00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:36,620
some kind of without that's done if it

00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:38,900
ever it's done kind of like a whole lot

00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:41,780
of things nicer I mean we have been

00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:46,210
trying to split the system to make it

00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:48,640
easier that's why that anybody can do

00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:51,790
you now it's just if somebody in the

00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:55,420
question is I have it later in slice for

00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:58,600
a suggestion for QA fedora QA can be

00:23:55,420 --> 00:24:00,910
around federal review automatically yeah

00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:04,770
with the two would of course do that

00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:08,050
seems I look at the source and last one

00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:10,660
yeah so because a lot of sponsor just

00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:12,730
fill it and there are some issues so

00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:15,400
dislike first response around the

00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:18,550
federal review your son shoot and fix

00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:22,540
this first right and then we will

00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:25,690
talk about about other spars that can be

00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:28,330
done out of thing because we know the

00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:31,080
door review itself can take about zero

00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:34,300
number pull out the last bit of info

00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:38,380
there's nothing that stops somebody from

00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:41,680
taking a list of those those bugs asking

00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:43,150
for or with you to run and then pasting

00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,250
the input into the bottom I mean

00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:49,770
that'sthat's which sprint yeah and that

00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:49,770
is you're wanting it's just as anyone

00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:58,330
when I do that I want to come first yes

00:24:54,850 --> 00:25:01,630
to either to be yeah so some lobbying

00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:05,410
look we know we all see a lot of reviews

00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:07,580
with partisan bill okay I mean it

00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:10,640
doesn't build you know

00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:12,440
they should be look doing this

00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,930
themselves to some of them no and in

00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:18,500
fact that thing is the ones that go or

00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:23,270
oftener one sponsored or in the review

00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:25,400
is why we have 1200 review you know it's

00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:27,200
it's not because all these packages are

00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:32,870
impossible sometimes yeah we get

00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:37,820
hammered so I I made it a step aside

00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:42,080
look right now how Debbie undo that is

00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:46,670
there something which our competition do

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:49,790
better which we can learn pro I am sure

00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:55,490
someone knows Debbie on how it works but

00:25:49,790 --> 00:26:00,230
they have two kinds of developers they

00:25:55,490 --> 00:26:04,100
have Debbie on developer which can do

00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:07,910
anything I think they don't even need to

00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:09,920
send picture of you like we do they can

00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:12,860
upload anything so they do something can

00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:15,260
immediately Apple I'm not sure if we

00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:18,890
won't do that but it will definitely

00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:27,680
help to lower that picture view of those

00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:31,010
one a thousand package so everybody but

00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:33,680
it's quite hard to become debian

00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:37,940
developer III don't know I don't even

00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:43,760
know what it actually takes but I here I

00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:46,730
try it it I try I try to become dead one

00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:49,490
and if I managed to succeed and probably

00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:51,920
won't sit here today like their

00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:52,809
requirements are so ridiculous behind ya

00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:58,269
require

00:26:52,809 --> 00:27:00,909
is a meeting free no no no no no no no

00:26:58,269 --> 00:27:04,600
that that's one lever below because

00:27:00,909 --> 00:27:07,629
that's for Debian maintainer which is

00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:11,259
one level below Debbie on my dinner is

00:27:07,629 --> 00:27:14,139
somebody because right anyone can submit

00:27:11,259 --> 00:27:16,360
package today beyond but Debian

00:27:14,139 --> 00:27:18,340
developers must sponsoring so if you

00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:22,330
must send it to debian developer and he

00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:26,110
can say send it to review it and upload

00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:28,419
it on your behalf debian maintainer can

00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:31,769
upload it without sponsor but it still

00:27:28,419 --> 00:27:36,009
debian developer and i don't know what

00:27:31,769 --> 00:27:38,950
the differences actually is by this one

00:27:36,009 --> 00:27:42,249
level below and for the debian

00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:45,129
maintainer you have to have gpg key sign

00:27:42,249 --> 00:27:47,499
it by at least one the beyond developer

00:27:45,129 --> 00:27:51,279
living one and more and passed it was

00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:53,799
free Debian developers yeah so you must

00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:58,690
met them in person and when I tried it

00:27:53,799 --> 00:28:03,820
so for me it was man i traveled to to

00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:07,299
prague to veen and to salzburg to have

00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:10,869
that g PG silent so you have to agree to

00:28:07,299 --> 00:28:12,820
social contract and policies and then is

00:28:10,869 --> 00:28:17,200
your hard part you have to find your

00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:20,499
allocate like sponsor which then must

00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:24,669
agree that you are good enough and it's

00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:30,309
fuzzy defined not define what that means

00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:34,899
so I sit for Holly with debian developer

00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:38,289
in one room we change email us over over

00:28:34,899 --> 00:28:40,570
on that for four weeks and I still was

00:28:38,289 --> 00:28:47,710
not good enough to become the be amazing

00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:51,340
so the bar is pretty high so i'm not

00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:53,619
sure we want to have it so high so we

00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:55,779
are probably not doing anything so wrong

00:28:53,619 --> 00:28:58,499
and i'm not sure if we can learn from

00:28:55,779 --> 00:28:58,499
debbie answer

00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:05,580
kevin caron suggesting that proven fact

00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:09,990
here should be able to choose new pages

00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:16,530
i would raise for this high side of

00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:20,490
without review yeah a kid his high for

00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:24,630
visitor that's why would not say that

00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:27,510
because if I despite being proven

00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:29,940
packager and sponsored I still have no

00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:33,450
problem sending a semitic package review

00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:36,210
because I'm unfamiliar with you guys and

00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:38,370
I quite easy find somebody who do the

00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:41,370
package review for me because the guys

00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:45,270
knows that there will be very clean no

00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:47,850
problem with my code so so it can be

00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:50,700
coming in any hours in here that if

00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:54,540
you're already community you should just

00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:58,820
be able to train with you know but we

00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:58,820
are talking about getting new people in

00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:09,600
virgin get worse than we getting new

00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:12,629
people most of the given the opera fans

00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:15,269
come from the seagull research facility

00:30:12,629 --> 00:30:20,309
in rear most typical they have a lot of

00:30:15,269 --> 00:30:22,950
didn't water inside yeah turn to me 30

00:30:20,309 --> 00:30:24,779
days if there are things that they've

00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:26,820
gone down better you mentioned

00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:33,059
devil-may-care them and they're going to

00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:35,789
go over but also romantic maintain some

00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:38,789
sort of the developer is like proven

00:30:35,789 --> 00:30:41,279
packager they can upload any packages in

00:30:38,789 --> 00:30:44,250
equal depending tenure can just upload

00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:47,009
two packages they have AC around so it's

00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:49,860
like normal editor but there is also a

00:30:47,009 --> 00:30:53,429
possibility to maintain a package not in

00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:55,860
either maintainer Nordic over just each

00:30:53,429 --> 00:30:59,220
time you want to add a knockoff you just

00:30:55,860 --> 00:31:00,960
need to contact your sponsor yeah yeah

00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:03,649
yeah and I mentioned that it became

00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:06,690
important in federal dr. such

00:31:03,649 --> 00:31:09,750
possibility really well theoretically

00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:12,899
yes you can provide patches in bacteria

00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:16,590
and taranta but its moral obscenity

00:31:12,899 --> 00:31:19,320
requires more even more time of the

00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:22,289
sponsor so I would rather spend that

00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:26,070
time on on sponsoring the guys and in

00:31:22,289 --> 00:31:29,690
what was wrong with his code and become

00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:33,179
that expanded time on him to become

00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:35,830
packager if I spent like three times

00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:37,870
reviewing

00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:41,080
that somebody submits I would rather

00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:43,299
focus on these three reviews and after

00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:47,950
the third time be smart enough to become

00:31:43,299 --> 00:31:52,630
a really mature yeah so here comes few

00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:56,380
suggestion or question I I have and then

00:31:52,630 --> 00:32:01,720
let's discuss so how to fix that I have

00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:04,809
more sponsors right now the bar is even

00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:07,330
quite low previously it was like fuzzy

00:32:04,809 --> 00:32:10,090
define it was good you should be good

00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:11,889
enough right now it's just only you

00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:15,460
should maintain three non-trivial

00:32:11,889 --> 00:32:18,309
packages i have five high quality

00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:21,460
non-trivial package reviews and have me

00:32:18,309 --> 00:32:23,440
Dean members through the branching so

00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:27,850
far at least for one or early cycle so

00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:32,980
it's quite low and despite the dead

00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:37,389
we still have quite a few sponsors I try

00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:40,059
to ask few people a few long time

00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:43,149
figures if they want to become sponsors

00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:47,620
and to my surprise they were not

00:32:43,149 --> 00:32:50,350
interesting in mostly the response was

00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:54,700
something like why waste the time on you

00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:57,940
be so when we have the pic review which

00:32:54,700 --> 00:33:00,370
is quite long and if I want to get that

00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:02,679
package she's probably in that picture

00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:06,549
of you from somebody already in Federer

00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:08,830
and I will spend less time on the review

00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:14,679
because it will be like being more one

00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:17,919
more better so I'm not sure if we are

00:33:14,679 --> 00:33:22,000
able to find more spoons over but we can

00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:25,690
definitely make some marketing so please

00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:28,539
become spawns or spending your time on

00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:31,800
the newbies something like that I mean

00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:33,540
the sponsors group is an invite you know

00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:36,480
why it becomes sponsor but you get

00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:38,790
nominated but no but you can submit

00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:43,110
ticket you can ask you can ask submit

00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:46,800
okay right okay yeah and then we are

00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:48,930
working we could just okay yeah but we

00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:53,850
could just say you could approach the

00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:57,120
existing sponsors until each of them how

00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:59,790
many 135 yeah one up now Lainey

00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:02,520
suggestion for somebody else becoming a

00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:04,410
sponsor Sen Yuen if we all did we were

00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:08,429
just double the number yeah I think

00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:10,560
anybody didn't wants it she requested it

00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:12,720
already really maybe there's a few that

00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,310
don't know the process but the cajuns

00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,770
they are you know I might like to do

00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:20,730
that but i think i mean the barrier is

00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:22,860
really low I mean those criteria which I

00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:25,710
mean I lowered them about as much as I

00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:29,700
thought was reasonable yeah and then all

00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:32,220
you do saal attractive there's only been

00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:34,860
ready speaking for all the people being

00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:37,290
rejected from becoming a small so we

00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:40,770
rejected them from the reason yes I

00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:45,120
think there's no way we can further know

00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:48,780
what about yeah I agree yeah oh but it's

00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:51,630
just yeah it's more about marketing and

00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:55,560
the tools for example I said because

00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:59,760
when you submit the package you wait I

00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:02,070
remember when I done that and I had

00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:05,610
somebody inherited who done the river

00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:09,720
with so it was quite fast in the end but

00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:12,630
still I waited like days and I was do

00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:15,510
you buy and I I have nothing to do eyes

00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:17,550
what do what should I do I was waiting

00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:20,820
days and I was feeling like I'm wasting

00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:24,300
my time I was young and I wanted to do

00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:26,940
something and so what about suggesting

00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:30,330
them that point them to copper and say

00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:33,750
okay as part of the review process you

00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:38,400
should maintain your package for some

00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:39,670
time in Cooper first this one of the

00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,799
reason is that

00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:44,410
they the people doesn't have the

00:35:41,799 --> 00:35:47,650
endurance so some some people try to do

00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:51,549
the review and our wheat within an

00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:54,369
amount and some some sponsors were

00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:57,339
feeling or even they get the package

00:35:54,369 --> 00:36:00,069
into a fedora but then after a year they

00:35:57,339 --> 00:36:06,040
left federer so some spoons are answered

00:36:00,069 --> 00:36:08,349
that they were frustrated from this and

00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:12,069
they were feeling like wasting the time

00:36:08,349 --> 00:36:15,760
on somebody who left very soon the

00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:18,819
federer so did it turn your show that

00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:28,869
guys have endurance if they are able to

00:36:18,819 --> 00:36:30,849
maintain comparability first question if

00:36:28,869 --> 00:36:33,430
someone is able to maintain a kitchen

00:36:30,849 --> 00:36:37,839
cover its lucky but would be able to me

00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:39,880
to nature that's your own I supposed to

00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:43,690
keep order to make one year and

00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:48,099
disappear totally will that happen yeah

00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:50,349
yeah but if they'd happen too often I if

00:36:48,099 --> 00:36:53,200
I want to if I were to come into north

00:36:50,349 --> 00:36:56,200
country and I knew that they stay longer

00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:59,380
I'm not saying that we should work ethyl

00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:02,020
ether people don't Danny at all already

00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:03,589
seamanship out there okay idea what I

00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:10,229
not

00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:13,469
hell yeah just try to take a look of

00:37:10,229 --> 00:37:17,249
those wrinkles which are making hole

00:37:13,469 --> 00:37:19,890
sponsor how how big is their purity of

00:37:17,249 --> 00:37:23,430
the sponsoring I mean I have the

00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:26,519
experience like if there is such start

00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:29,430
salt per ticket it's visually like it

00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:32,579
was submitted let's a year ago and since

00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:35,460
that moment there is no and I have a

00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:37,769
front such guy i would expect like yes I

00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:40,710
hear him out the package I rather

00:37:37,769 --> 00:37:43,019
regularly updated package and I expect

00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:45,630
the part where we have a big big update

00:37:43,019 --> 00:37:48,450
of the future and so on but typically

00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:50,579
this is no true and yes it had happened

00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:55,799
that there was guy who also sponsored

00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:58,499
for 4 99 years yes some conspiracy well

00:37:55,799 --> 00:38:01,140
I would say it's good and bad because

00:37:58,499 --> 00:38:03,719
like he's shown his entrance and he

00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:05,729
shown that he's capable to maintain and

00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:07,890
take her out of package for social time

00:38:05,729 --> 00:38:10,229
because he had some reason to do this

00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:12,869
but otherwise I expose her everybody

00:38:10,229 --> 00:38:16,309
just because it's for for them is

00:38:12,869 --> 00:38:19,920
one-time shot and what but the Beasties

00:38:16,309 --> 00:38:23,309
island halifax guy is example of

00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:25,469
somebody who worked for usually for some

00:38:23,309 --> 00:38:28,739
company he maintained some piece of

00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:31,049
software there and he should do that

00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:35,519
anyway and it's just willing cokeville

00:38:31,049 --> 00:38:37,979
put that in debian in fedora but on the

00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:41,430
very first obstacle Davis stopped and

00:38:37,979 --> 00:38:44,460
they said today boss I try but there

00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:48,299
were some obstacle a nice sees snow

00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:50,859
though that's I don't feel sorry if it

00:38:48,299 --> 00:38:53,750
desktop on the first okay

00:38:50,859 --> 00:38:55,970
we have a mechanism for getting rid of

00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:58,609
the sale packages they get all offended

00:38:55,970 --> 00:39:02,380
and they go away and I would like to see

00:38:58,609 --> 00:39:05,869
the actual number of where where the

00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:08,540
requester is still active and where

00:39:05,869 --> 00:39:11,540
installed on our on the sponsor or

00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:14,930
suicide too many but there are some it's

00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:17,060
just I I stopped looking a while back

00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:19,580
because I just there was too much stuff

00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:21,859
than my problems people would just bomb

00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:25,220
the rebuke you with half a million ojs

00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:28,010
packages also worth my time to look at

00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:34,820
it and sort through all of that but I

00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:38,270
mean I found very few that people that

00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:42,410
were still interested and were active

00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:43,730
and could find it really I mean most of

00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:46,070
them they were ain't into an

00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:48,650
reviewer like me and then found some

00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:53,180
problem and then just disappear because

00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:55,820
that I didn't say yes and you know but

00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:57,710
then the review stays open then

00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:59,210
eventually you know I used to go through

00:39:57,710 --> 00:40:02,000
every few months in paying all the

00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:04,550
reviews and close the ones that and I

00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,750
just felt that my time is better spent

00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:11,119
elsewhere but speaking of times going to

00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:13,490
the outlet in review will automatically

00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:16,850
I'm all for it oh yeah we're on the

00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:19,130
other good idea oh so we can perceive it

00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:21,280
as we spoke about it free visit it's

00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:25,130
just like the FDLR talk we had the

00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:27,020
technology is there to help you get it

00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:29,020
serves a purpose but it's not everything

00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:32,860
we could just cook

00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:35,350
the get and I'm a year off if the if the

00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:41,460
guy has understood the guidelines and

00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:41,460
get rid of all the paperwork I'm already

00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:54,670
in case although ridges that this work

00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:57,990
sponsor he wants to show their knowledge

00:40:54,670 --> 00:41:00,850
of commas yes I'm going to focus on

00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:02,980
actual reduce because let's help you

00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:06,340
including this tactic as we're giving

00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:10,330
you their mark points to get sponsored

00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:15,670
and I closer video on their behalf isn't

00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:17,800
there like a guideline that says or

00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:20,380
maybe that was just my personal guide in

00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:23,380
order for you for me to sponsor you I

00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:25,030
want you to take place in to take to

00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:26,890
participate in at least three other

00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:30,040
review that there is not a hard guy

00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:34,240
blonde dancer with a shoot oh shoot it's

00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:38,980
your response rate one for any reason at

00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:42,370
a time okay that's that's what it means

00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:44,680
once you get to that point you can do

00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:49,080
whatever you want it is up to you

00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:52,450
because but the job of the sponsor is to

00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:54,610
assist that person getting through the

00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:57,010
process of getting their reviewed

00:41:54,610 --> 00:42:01,900
already reviewed package into the

00:41:57,010 --> 00:42:03,050
distribution and out and updated when

00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:04,850
they need it which means

00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:07,130
that you're on the hook for at least a

00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:09,470
year to help these people with and

00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:11,270
questions that they have that's what it

00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:14,390
means you are not taking responsibility

00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:16,160
for the quality of their packages you

00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:17,900
don't have to look at the package if

00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:21,170
they don't want to because somebody else

00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:25,130
reviewed it already maybe we just need

00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:27,740
to get more to the snowball system and

00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:31,160
one of the reasons like I got sponsored

00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:34,370
I got sponsored and I became a sponsor

00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:38,120
pretty quickly but the reason why it was

00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:40,700
lame who's sponsored me was no no no

00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:43,700
responsibly that make me a sponsor are

00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:47,870
asked if it was okay nominated be a

00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:51,140
sponsor was as soon as the candidate can

00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:54,170
be covered sponsor himself you're no

00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:57,500
longer responsible for that for you so

00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:59,600
like this the snowball approach now we

00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:01,670
all sponsors should should encourage

00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:03,890
other to become sponsors which then

00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:06,560
again or like you eat your ass should

00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:09,320
encourage fight if you get whatever your

00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:15,070
responses somebody new encourage them to

00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:15,070
five reviews one day then get sponsored

00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:22,420
it is no all program to come there

00:43:19,589 --> 00:43:24,760
visualizes because you there's no easy

00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:26,800
way to see how many people use question

00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:30,400
now that's true it's always that a

00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:34,869
problem I think I'm fast three might

00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:37,000
help I got you a list of it was your or

00:43:34,869 --> 00:43:39,369
something that it's cumbersome yeah I

00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:42,220
mean the only real way to do it by the

00:43:39,369 --> 00:43:44,230
way is database access and it's just too

00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:49,150
high school and everybody should just

00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:54,970
nomination fine you movie star people

00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:58,300
fasten just but okay nice about now I

00:43:54,970 --> 00:44:00,940
would like to focus on because all these

00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:03,490
doesn't help with those style stole to

00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:08,890
review which are waiting for years there

00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:11,770
are so there are two suggestion so we

00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:14,619
may highlight somehow the bugs laws

00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:16,780
which are waiting and where the last

00:44:14,619 --> 00:44:20,280
comment is from the reporter so it's

00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:24,069
very likely waiting for the sponsor I

00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:28,000
even trying to reset some bug zealots

00:44:24,069 --> 00:44:30,609
where it is assigned to sponsor and he's

00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,510
waiting for two years and sponsored us

00:44:30,609 --> 00:44:36,760
interact a velocity back to nobody

00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:38,500
because some people have the filter that

00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:40,869
if it is assigned so it's protein

00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:45,670
progress it doesn't say look in the in

00:44:40,869 --> 00:44:48,579
their searches but I even some some

00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:52,480
sponsors Missouri suggest that say it

00:44:48,579 --> 00:44:55,150
should send more emails because if you

00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:57,220
are in some Baja and which is waiting

00:44:55,150 --> 00:45:00,010
for two years you get last email two

00:44:57,220 --> 00:45:02,920
years ago and very likely sleep of your

00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:05,109
mind so you must intentionally go to

00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:08,049
bugzilla and look what your status on

00:45:05,109 --> 00:45:10,809
the reviews I'm not sure how many people

00:45:08,049 --> 00:45:13,990
do that so we can somehow highlight

00:45:10,809 --> 00:45:16,809
these cuts on I don't know how or there

00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:20,140
was a suggestion from somebody that we

00:45:16,809 --> 00:45:25,770
tried a sec year of I ietf signior

00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:28,480
approach when you can take the review

00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:33,160
assign it to somebody we did

00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:36,100
try random people random sponsor are set

00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:39,460
the deadline as if the deadline is not

00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:41,950
met then removed or sponsor from silk

00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:47,170
circulation temporarily and assign it to

00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:51,490
somebody so if the review no but no one

00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:54,369
take it for six months let's say one

00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:57,300
year I don't know I still no one take it

00:45:54,369 --> 00:46:00,160
so why not assign it to somebody and

00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:02,950
even if that's java and I don't like

00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:05,890
Java I will try my best okay can I just

00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:09,540
say ok I'm going to drive a guy please

00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:12,730
we assign it to somebody else should

00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:14,650
find a job all right oh yeah and you can

00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:16,840
I think that this very important aspect

00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:20,820
adjusted specialization mentioned

00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:23,170
earlier so personally I will note that

00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:28,330
review landing on java package I'm

00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:31,650
Johnny but as far as I know jaha reduce

00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:34,750
its liking it's about it's about setting

00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:39,040
inserting two tools so so it can be

00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:41,950
either some tools dumps Creed which

00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:45,070
assign it to somebody or we can set up

00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:48,790
Vicky page where everyone stay his

00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:51,310
specialization and you will be done

00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:53,859
manually and someone say ok here is just

00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:56,200
possible review which is waiting for six

00:46:53,859 --> 00:46:59,320
months for somebody I will look on the

00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:02,109
wiki for best guy and I will assign it

00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:04,660
to somebody and if you say I don't want

00:47:02,109 --> 00:47:07,800
I will assign it to somebody else it's

00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:09,400
up to us I don't know I'm trying

00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:13,400
bracelet

00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:15,320
trackin party Attila so we have a lead

00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:17,510
sponsor and Lee and the FK needs a

00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:19,610
thorough job or something like that I'm

00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:22,730
not i don't think it's easy but I love

00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:25,280
you leave like it so it says people got

00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:27,830
me as a sponsor I knowing these people

00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:30,560
who understands the wrong packaging so

00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:32,360
it might be you did I go ask you for

00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:35,240
help you need review or i can add

00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:37,790
somebody who is not sponsored a nice to

00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:39,980
em in your abilities and i can ask me

00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:42,800
not so let's make their lives for i

00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:47,930
sponsored the guy and that would work

00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:50,180
for me so I work because if somebody is

00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:53,180
packaging some java package and I don't

00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:54,800
know but somebody else reviews it but

00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:58,960
the guy's got a functional package in

00:47:54,800 --> 00:48:03,770
the package or fewer did his job then

00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:05,660
what I have to do is say yes this is how

00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:07,430
you run fed pack this is how you

00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:10,910
important stuff let me make sure that

00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:12,530
you got oh these are uploaded in the

00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:15,020
problems with that and here's how you do

00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:17,810
your builds and okay now your things in

00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:20,000
Bodie and you know now you see you get

00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:22,310
karma and then okay now it's in the

00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,930
disco and then three months later they

00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:25,520
come back and say what was this branch

00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:28,460
thing and what do I do for the next

00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:30,530
place you know when can i update my high

00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:32,930
club questions like that that's what the

00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:35,600
sponsors around for a problem is the

00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:38,000
terminology is probably not correct we

00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:39,470
have people who are new packages right

00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,620
that means their reviews are going to be

00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:43,040
more difficult

00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:45,210
time probably because they know things

00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:47,820
the people who are going to help new

00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:49,020
packages are not necessarily the people

00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:53,130
are going to Shepherd them through the

00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:54,810
system we used to say the sponsor was

00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:57,810
the person who get all that that's not

00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:59,730
necessarily what it did when you see the

00:48:57,810 --> 00:49:02,070
need sponsor me to review is probably

00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:03,510
going to be more difficult if you're

00:49:02,070 --> 00:49:07,320
dealing with somebody who has done this

00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:09,150
before but that's not something that

00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:11,580
tells the reviewer it's almost as if we

00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:13,140
need to separate designation so i should

00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:14,610
say there are new packager that means

00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:16,320
review is going to be harder but once

00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:18,750
the review it's done then they're going

00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:22,770
to need a shepherd instead of a sponsor

00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:25,500
then I maybe some you know I good one

00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:28,280
Eddie of you during a presentation on an

00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:32,640
article about and put you to do now what

00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:35,610
that we can uphold somebody's shipper

00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:40,830
war from spawns already because a lot of

00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:44,730
them is repeating why okay there is the

00:49:40,830 --> 00:49:48,480
the first branching you are pickier and

00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:50,130
now suddenly first branching no yeah

00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:52,200
yeah what do i do whatever that means

00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:56,280
what all is he saw we get from releasing

00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:59,730
so can be can be prepared some documents

00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:03,960
you do video whatever recommendation

00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:08,250
wiki page and use java gripper and when

00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:10,290
the branching cookers find most recent

00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:12,900
sponsors who doesn't come through the

00:50:10,290 --> 00:50:15,300
branching here and send them email are

00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:18,240
you our new contributors and this is

00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:21,780
your first branching you mean these earn

00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:24,750
about it or you submitted your package

00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:26,940
for the row hard and now it's time to

00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:29,220
learn about body you here is the

00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:32,190
documentation and sugar also make it

00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:36,860
automatically and some those can beach

00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:36,860
are doing anyway let's ultimate

00:50:39,059 --> 00:50:47,280
this once serious illness necessary

00:50:43,329 --> 00:50:51,730
Cyrus the person being simplistic

00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:53,859
documentation just take the most

00:50:51,730 --> 00:50:56,770
important point where i ricky and naked

00:50:53,859 --> 00:50:59,980
zebra it should it should be readable

00:50:56,770 --> 00:51:02,470
and then run 200 pages only seven step

00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:04,930
drawing document the right now right and

00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:10,210
the sliding is serious is about more

00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:13,299
about the workroom making color would

00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:15,700
you tell me why do what do i do and that

00:51:13,299 --> 00:51:19,240
happens and that's whether that's a good

00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:22,780
candidate for a core group and not

00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:26,319
necessarily coloring book well we have

00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:28,869
startup time sometime it went on the

00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:31,420
nature of the roar gasp no by the time

00:51:28,869 --> 00:51:35,559
which the term is now is for something

00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:40,150
else but did our example like we have

00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:42,520
the example package for you picture you

00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:46,270
check check it out from get you create

00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:48,369
patch you build that you go to codys

00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:52,180
questions of the catcher or whatever

00:51:48,369 --> 00:51:58,240
like it step by step tutorial or even

00:51:52,180 --> 00:52:01,630
the branching in could be done and

00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:04,510
because we can make those clock to their

00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:09,670
classrooms and use that for for for

00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:13,930
those who buys again locate them on the

00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:18,130
stopped because and tell them about the

00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:20,079
stuff we had because they is hard to

00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:23,770
find the sponsor but i remember on the

00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:25,900
floor was two years ago it was like some

00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:28,660
talk about okay let's talk about

00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:32,500
packaging and there will be sponsors who

00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:35,319
are willing to sponsor your package but

00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:39,280
there was only the sponsors no one

00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:40,750
willing to be sponsored me okay okay yah

00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:45,580
rattling tapping i got

00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:48,040
one radical proposal that starts just

00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:49,900
ignore everything sponsor and whatever

00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:51,790
when somebody shows up and lost a

00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:53,860
package not that they already made a

00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:56,490
pact engineer figured out how to dump it

00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:59,620
bugzilla and all that mess before that

00:52:56,490 --> 00:53:01,870
give a place where people can come say i

00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:05,620
wish to submit package here's the things

00:53:01,870 --> 00:53:08,680
i want to work you will get a sign three

00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:11,530
mentors from the pool of however we

00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:13,840
decide and this bowl should be big and

00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:17,050
hopefully we can find people who would

00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:19,990
want to do this if not one because one

00:53:17,050 --> 00:53:22,420
person can disappear get three or even

00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:25,150
more whom and those people will be your

00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:26,710
contacts and they will help you get all

00:53:25,150 --> 00:53:28,540
the way through the process and they may

00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:30,610
suggest that you go to copper first if

00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:33,040
that's the kind of package we look at

00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:35,110
what the person individually what they

00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:37,180
want to do and somebody's trying to pack

00:53:35,110 --> 00:53:40,350
a some time units utility or something

00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:42,670
you know find you have an easy way but

00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:44,830
somebody who wants to do something big

00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:47,020
is going to need more shepherding more

00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:48,820
elam probably going to want something

00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:51,460
deploying through a copper so many

00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:53,560
cousins you know they don't get stuck in

00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:57,370
a review cube you can actually use and

00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:58,980
test yourself yeah I may not be another

00:53:57,370 --> 00:54:02,130
fun maybe

00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:05,790
the sponsor that's Pete's missing native

00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:07,770
English that wouldn't hurt then but he's

00:54:05,790 --> 00:54:09,960
just one person that's going to be their

00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:12,660
mentors it's hard and you a mentor

00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:15,930
heaven yes Maggie and the ambassador's

00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:18,150
project we learned that the native

00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:20,730
language or even the country that

00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:23,270
Oakland us french guy when we know that

00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:26,130
because your community project when

00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:27,570
grandpa so what's in that helps so we

00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:30,000
pulled together people who know

00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:32,340
packaging people who are part of the

00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,890
ambassador or regional group that could

00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:38,369
perhaps better assist the person when we

00:54:34,890 --> 00:54:41,880
have language difficulties etc and that

00:54:38,369 --> 00:54:44,220
will be that person's team that they can

00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:46,470
all talk together you see so a person

00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:49,800
gets a team of people not all of whom

00:54:46,470 --> 00:54:53,340
have to do a ton of work right but they

00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:55,200
have to be available and then we can get

00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:56,850
them into the technologies and this gets

00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,560
all the way to the point where okay

00:54:56,850 --> 00:55:01,109
they've gotten their fedora account and

00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:04,050
they sign them at PCA whatever we call

00:55:01,109 --> 00:55:06,390
it out they've gotten to that point now

00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:08,609
they can submit and say look you know I

00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:12,450
want to do package it I want to package

00:55:08,609 --> 00:55:14,130
some stuff at that point they should be

00:55:12,450 --> 00:55:15,570
able to get a group of people and not

00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:18,660
just like well there's a ton of people

00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:21,750
on IRC to love you put actual names and

00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:26,940
faces that are spared they get in their

00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:30,119
way like I mean we could run programs

00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:33,060
with bugs in our queries all the stolen

00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:35,550
heavy you have any boats aren't really

00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:37,170
hard to actually do reasonable bugzilla

00:55:35,550 --> 00:55:39,090
queries i'm janna for example they

00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:41,910
mentioned that horrible page that i put

00:55:39,090 --> 00:55:43,590
up like years ago that I I stopped

00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:43,880
working on it because we were supposed

00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:48,859
to

00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:53,779
senior review system para effect i can

00:55:48,859 --> 00:55:56,660
effectively to your idea of the sign of

00:55:53,779 --> 00:56:01,430
team or something i get our God we

00:55:56,660 --> 00:56:03,289
randomly automatically assign we make

00:56:01,430 --> 00:56:07,819
sure at least three people are always

00:56:03,289 --> 00:56:10,940
set on CC to the quality poetic and

00:56:07,819 --> 00:56:14,240
ideally it would be an intelligent

00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:16,789
selection based on paths based on the

00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:20,869
locale or in the black sea to SFO events

00:56:16,789 --> 00:56:24,950
and such like if it's a German candidate

00:56:20,869 --> 00:56:27,559
always assign him one ideally three any

00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:29,420
German sponsors if that's not available

00:56:27,559 --> 00:56:31,700
at least one terms yeah you should have

00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:36,769
done something or jury with John

00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:39,559
geographically near salt 1 J I'm not

00:56:36,769 --> 00:56:42,049
suggesting all next is the next step if

00:56:39,559 --> 00:56:45,349
somebody you moves himself from the SEC

00:56:42,049 --> 00:56:47,630
group assign somebody used to make sure

00:56:45,349 --> 00:56:50,029
it's always yeah people until somebody

00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:52,670
has picked up the bar and assigned to

00:56:50,029 --> 00:56:57,559
himself okay yes I will have to straw

00:56:52,670 --> 00:56:59,289
subdue recording but of course we are we

00:56:57,559 --> 00:57:03,410
can infer continue with the discussion

00:56:59,289 --> 00:57:08,690
we have down tomorrow later yeah walking

00:57:03,410 --> 00:57:11,930
tour yeah and i will write up notes from

00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:20,839
this session and we'll send them for two

00:57:11,930 --> 00:57:23,420
federal response or maybe moving our

00:57:20,839 --> 00:57:25,309
sponsors ok send our school else I'm not

00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:29,240
evil yeah okay there are more kind of

00:57:25,309 --> 00:57:32,509
the sponsors and now something's just

00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:34,039
for the users who are watching this gene

00:57:32,509 --> 00:57:37,539
i will tell you something secretly

00:57:34,039 --> 00:57:37,539
