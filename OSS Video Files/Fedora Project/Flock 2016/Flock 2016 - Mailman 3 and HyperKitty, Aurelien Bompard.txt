Title: Flock 2016 - Mailman 3 and HyperKitty, Aurelien Bompard
Publication date: 2016-08-21
Playlist: Flock 2016
Description: 
	In December 2015, most Fedora mailing-lists have been migrated to the latest version of Mailman, which is a complete rewrite of Mailman 2.1, and brings a much needed refresh in its architecture and its web interfaces. This talk will have an infrastructure-centric side: we'll come back on this migration, how the Fedora mailing list system is organized today, and where we're going with it. It will also have a user-centric side: what possibilities are open by our new archiver, HyperKitty. How it will fit into Hubs. How it will make communication easier, and how you can use it today to efficiently follow and participate in mailing-lists.
