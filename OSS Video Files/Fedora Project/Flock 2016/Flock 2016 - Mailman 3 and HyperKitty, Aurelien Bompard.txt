Title: Flock 2016 - Mailman 3 and HyperKitty, Aurelien Bompard
Publication date: 2016-08-21
Playlist: Flock 2016
Description: 
	In December 2015, most Fedora mailing-lists have been migrated to the latest version of Mailman, which is a complete rewrite of Mailman 2.1, and brings a much needed refresh in its architecture and its web interfaces. This talk will have an infrastructure-centric side: we'll come back on this migration, how the Fedora mailing list system is organized today, and where we're going with it. It will also have a user-centric side: what possibilities are open by our new archiver, HyperKitty. How it will fit into Hubs. How it will make communication easier, and how you can use it today to efficiently follow and participate in mailing-lists.

This video was recorded at the annual Fedora contributor conference, Flock, in KrakÃ³w, Poland, from August 2-5, 2016. You can learn more about Flock at https://flocktofedora.org.

this are doing having on the federal

00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,670
projects or enzyme as a contributor and

00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:30,680
I've been there for your ingenue team

00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:34,309
since 2012 it be in four years sinful

00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:37,190

surveillance images religious fine where

00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:47,840
is unlikely how many of you are using

00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:51,210
today like on a daily basis maybe nobody

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:55,230
baby babies with sometimes performing

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:56,879
monkey okay so you probably have a lot

00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:01,110
of Christians and I have a lot of room

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:05,519
for that so we have time to talk and

00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:07,590
discuss for everyone to be gay until you

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,289
travel no ladies

but we have today we have you have a lot

00:01:10,289 --> 00:01:14,310
of developers while really liking the

00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:17,729
very nice but set of all the filters

00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:22,150
like they want every woman to be and who

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:25,570
are used to switching between the metal

00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:28,030
wait and the offers of North users is

00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:29,650
quite different so we have people

00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:31,840
thinking of people are talking to each

00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:34,690
other and love best about should be

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,870
fixed that's what we're trying to do is

00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:36,870
happy

00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:54,439
so this is really ready to talk about so

00:01:52,189 --> 00:01:56,650
that that's a status and then we are

00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:58,360
actually you a little grain and

00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:02,740
what you have to do if you want to

00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:05,620
install it then on three as a first

00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:08,560
amendment 2 is a much much more middle

00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:10,930
platform it's a very it's a video

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,430
rewrites there is a risk no problem

00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:15,700
coming between men and two and hannah

00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:18,310
three it's a hundred percent by patty

00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:20,980
three application one of the first the

00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:23,710
words out one of the first big

00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:26,830
application that is a start typing to

00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:28,690
Connecticut just practical it's very

00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:32,500
very design very interesting from an

00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:36,160
engineering point of view or the energy

00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:39,040
directly Asif engineer economy very

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,040
start dollars you can get there's

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:45,400
nothing reminders with your custom in

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:48,910
theo text everyone that yeah that was a

00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:52,060
problem and he's done this is good it

00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:55,180
has rest api that is very expendable and

00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:57,099
easy to use with our

00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:01,840
that connects to the type to just rest

00:02:57,099 --> 00:03:06,939
api to help you doing objects and start

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:08,530
dealing with Justin Punta Mulas it home

00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:11,319
is no joy domains so you can have

00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:14,049
several different domains and a little

00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:15,700
at the same level sales presentation a

00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:18,189
while we have the reproductive block

00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:20,530
lists dr. go further than all and list

00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:22,780
the federal estate that I each other due

00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:26,500
by the same elements hours before we

00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:29,409
have two of two instances and you have

00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:33,129
this concept of user that was not really

00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:35,049
present in mail and to use Erick and

00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:38,109
have several addresses different email

00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:40,810
addresses and so for example if you are

00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:42,280
a subscriber list with one address and

00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,169
subtract the difference with another

00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:47,159
address you can have a good review of

00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:50,930
our subscriptions and do stuff like I

00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:53,810
rent my general

00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:56,810
for this value to be such as such and

00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:58,939
half enter values values from here

00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:00,859
different subscriptions if they did so

00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:05,980
that's a really interesting concepts for

00:04:00,859 --> 00:04:09,799
mailing lists method itself is just the

00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:13,909
the may sell domain handling system if

00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:16,250
energy is an LMG p and smtp it doesn't

00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:19,430
have the web interface as member tool

00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:20,959
used to be member to yourself everything

00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:23,840
in the same package then than three

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,759
dozen varieties will actually the way

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,190
you guys that's called a killing

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:31,400
themselves where you as that i will and

00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:34,980
doing red interface is it requires

00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:39,660
different skill sets so they say well

00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:40,920
200 way to do this smtp even a level i

00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,780
don't know how to make a real interface

00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:46,110
I live that out for their people to do

00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:50,810
and rhythms are faced with an admin UI

00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:55,170
is football stories it's based on table

00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:57,210
so it's fat fun also and it's very its

00:04:55,170 --> 00:05:00,150
measurement enjoying that what we used

00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:03,380
to have with moment to obviously very

00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:05,420
has not manual I

00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:07,580
that we are having you out where the

00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:11,690
student doesn't do they are driving ivan

00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:14,480
is the role of faculty so happily is a

00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:20,180
very small car in that building too mmmm

00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:22,700
and any connects to your email reading

00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:24,980
for Calvin and self goes through a web

00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:28,340
application which is the main hyper

00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:31,940
kitty and conveys its base in Python a

00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:33,500
jungle listen it's a disturbing than SQL

00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:36,200
database so they can be queried

00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:39,620
afterwards he tries some analytics and

00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:41,690
in statistics about them and from the

00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,310
from the design center from the user

00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:46,310
perspective it kind of looks like a

00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:50,270
reform where you have friends and people

00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:52,340
replying to the threats it doesn't look

00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:53,910
at those static HTML thing that was

00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:56,880
produced I aur main

00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:59,430
at the time that's one of the things we

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,950
wanted to a lot you can do with some

00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:04,920
type of food text search are inside the

00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:08,100
other lists and the good thing about

00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:10,050
this is you can do the search of crap

00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:12,690
different mailing lists that wasn't very

00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:14,280
possible with lemon tree before where

00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:16,620
you can always search google very sure

00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,390
this is private than your stack you can

00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,730
see my math instruction colonists you

00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:24,210
shall connectivity which will recognize

00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:27,480
which mr. s structure and to agree to

00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:29,430
social psychology the lists so it's

00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:33,630
really well to be integrated search

00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:35,490
system it has a melon web features that

00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:38,310
you can see on forums you can like those

00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:42,090
you can add tags you can failure in some

00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:44,970
squares and keep them in your home page

00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:49,040
two and for you to get back to them

00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:52,860
later and it is when I finally you can

00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:55,920
do you I resizes depending on the size

00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:59,190
of your of your screen and put the

00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:02,230
different us we just differently if you

00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:07,810
have a small screen it's not on me

00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:12,430
exactly we learn to make it easier so

00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:15,760
this is a architecture metal fries are

00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:22,120
their talks to a scale at the waist

00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:25,120
we're using progress in where it can

00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:31,500
also use a very light weight that it can

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:34,000
also uses a sequel light as a database

00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:37,180
he's going to be able to support my

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,240
shorts the request is being worked on

00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:42,310
right now so I think it will look at my

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:46,480
school that my sequel in your ear short

00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:49,660
life the fastest rest api that every

00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:52,340
interface communicates with of course it

00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:55,970
receives made from

00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:58,310
seller today I think well I think there

00:07:55,970 --> 00:08:00,949
is another nice ever that is supported

00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:13,070
besides 46 and I can't believe what it

00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:15,110
is I think it's so the rest api so

00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:16,729
everything that mysterious died of dust

00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:21,050
on the web interface you can do it and

00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:25,250
open online or you using any kind of web

00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:26,960
client that's for the street that you

00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:29,660
will write that would directly over the

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,419
rest api if you have if you want

00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:35,240
presenting to a new query moment for

00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:37,880
mailing list and our memberships users

00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,740
or create a nice time with you from

00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:42,130
something else you can do it using black

00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,130
secure

00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:49,570
I prefer the database yourself that's

00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:55,840
not entirely true was almost and it's

00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:58,000
true it has just basic secret admirer

00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:01,510
ones that change of us that we have the

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,880
specific models happy nowhere on their

00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:05,950
own on the other hand has a very

00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:08,860
specific database because it stores will

00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:10,990
be there in the battle eyes it also has

00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:13,030
a REST API will instead nothing right

00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:15,430
now is one of the thing that you meant

00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:20,170
to improve on having a better rest api

00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:22,750
barbecue so this is for ISA means people

00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:25,930
repel it can also be used a residual to

00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:28,390
subscribe to the loot to resist this mix

00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:31,240
of the UI is made feliz demonstrators

00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:34,450
want to change the settings of nominees

00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:36,490
and have until you know for users who

00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:41,530
want to browse our pipes lead back from

00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:44,880
the web subscribe 220 see whether

00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:47,650
journal transoral remedies are

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:53,680
interesting method of Allah to have

00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:57,960
otherwise in this event substitue right

00:09:53,680 --> 00:10:02,350
now will for service weapons available

00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:03,939
that's a material that's fine the most

00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:06,939
the only one using

00:10:03,939 --> 00:10:09,009
moment the staging server recent changes

00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:11,829
and post them in there are two

00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:15,399
production servers and Charlie within

00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:17,199
myself that will that would allow higher

00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:19,149
variability between those two service

00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:24,039
whether that's when everything goes to

00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:27,669
plan to work if we're going to do not

00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:29,400
just it's a web seven boxes also i have

00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:33,540
a teams for wrestling

00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:35,670
already easy to stop and there are you

00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:39,680
together with ansible rules and

00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:42,540
templates the thing is since member is

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,370
can function without history so happy

00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:46,770
tree canopy cover by itself it doesn't

00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:48,660
need the web interface and Pistorius can

00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:50,550
be installed without epically epic leak

00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:52,230
invincible processors it's a very

00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:54,420
indefinite so I wanted to reflect that

00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:56,760
in their hands there are terms are very

00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:59,850
indignant that if you want all them all

00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:02,160
together it's better to amer to rival

00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:04,260
the the configuration file as such and

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,970
make sure that they offer the same

00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:09,780
general instance itself instead of

00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:11,420
different painting senses so I civilian

00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:13,580
see will learn that you can look at all

00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,680
this is the rule is

00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:17,950
the third one castor chirurgie travel

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:22,420
you can just check it out and see what

00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:22,420
see what see many things aside

00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:32,069
my red for women to go to the more of

00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:34,950
course on this conscious about into the

00:11:32,069 --> 00:11:37,020
terrains and say before the sterile

00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:40,350
the raw projector all released

00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:42,450
separately Super Bowl and the marriage

00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:44,810
has been very progressive we started

00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,810
laughing

00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:51,500
he's alive the police who commits

00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:55,070
mailing lists and something that are

00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:59,870
that tyrant really user talking to each

00:11:55,070 --> 00:12:02,240
other it was less dangerous and all

00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:07,130
try and test them out very easily

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:10,130
because those overly hyper progressive

00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:12,740
and we have actually said boxing we have

00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:16,130
to realize a few things there are

00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:18,980
features that were not present in my

00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:22,040
country at that time and were the well

00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:24,650
we're very used amendment in our level

00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:28,160
to set up except for my list has abated

00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:29,810
topic system in member and remember to

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,920
because that's nine Damon three you know

00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:36,230
who as a system where you could define

00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:38,120
futures in mail in itself instead of

00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:40,550
having a very simple set of the filters

00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:43,730
on where maintains the example you could

00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:48,020
say or this is a package allows list I

00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:50,540
said I have a pattern matching eps 23 in

00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:54,260
the subject after install the subject of

00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:56,600
25 years of the subject and people could

00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:58,490
subscribe to these filters instead of to

00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:01,220
the whole menu lists so there is only

00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:04,580
received email that were that they run

00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:07,100
jointly interested in this has been this

00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:10,850
has been proven to make em free

00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:13,970
now so we had to learn and actually

00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:16,920
switch the system for

00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:20,160
and do something different it's not

00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:22,170
super it anymore if people intimate

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,819
embrace about the packages for different

00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:26,730
architectures you can just look at the

00:13:23,819 --> 00:13:28,709
RSS feed in body and there are much

00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:32,129
easier to parse of costs and planning

00:13:28,709 --> 00:13:33,720
any medicine to you hello filter is

00:13:32,129 --> 00:13:36,269
something also that was kind of

00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:39,149
naturally ready in magnetically you

00:13:36,269 --> 00:13:41,009
could actually set filters and have

00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:44,579
different actions haven't returned

00:13:41,009 --> 00:13:48,379
something that wheels fell off from spam

00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:51,689
filtering so is the list of instance say

00:13:48,379 --> 00:13:54,480
when that remains and filtering system

00:13:51,689 --> 00:13:58,049
that looks at birth expand header I want

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,850
to consider spam patterns well or

00:13:58,049 --> 00:14:02,999
something with this subjective something

00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:05,879
else and in further articles we have a

00:14:02,999 --> 00:14:08,009
ton of different usage and I think that

00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:09,929
work to do specific things it was kind

00:14:08,009 --> 00:14:13,139
of reduced me to doing a lot of

00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:16,679
different things by projecting email

00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:19,379
that came from an ultimate it's coming

00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:21,660
system if it didn't contain the proper

00:14:19,379 --> 00:14:24,329
haven't received from alpha bill passed

00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:26,990
to the lights errors during the

00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:30,860
processing aveda suppose welcome

00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:32,750
was not the new people well maybe even

00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:36,020
think about this kind of use case so i

00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:37,399
have to like you out to me cook you the

00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:41,270
best to make something that's more

00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:43,660
general so this is this is very worried

00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:46,769
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:49,679
versus little bicep

00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:55,199
last year and my version is also this

00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:58,779
friends with very recent i also have in

00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:02,029
the presentation amendment

00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:05,329
at the moment so it definitely doesn't

00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:09,920
matter till I pass in each direction and

00:15:05,329 --> 00:15:12,170
your first email addresses are retrieved

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,180
and added to my men are the second array

00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:17,180
address before you can have several

00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:19,130
different addresses in my mind this is

00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:22,730
something that has been working at Sur

00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:25,430
ground and and dinner office and user i

00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:27,589
modified it and the people who logged in

00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:29,389
at first then you get this and it's only

00:15:27,589 --> 00:15:32,060
the first time in that gate so if you

00:15:29,389 --> 00:15:34,670
don't have if you have to manually enter

00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:39,040
another email address instead because

00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:46,130
you will never find it which Israel and

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:48,139
into bed at the same time that's also

00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:51,620
that's it well that's where we are right

00:15:48,139 --> 00:15:52,920
now and we're going to want to avoid a

00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:57,149
future there

00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:59,730
but a new version 3.1 is where is the

00:15:57,149 --> 00:16:02,100
UFO it's very out probably than

00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:05,970
September the we're not quite sure the

00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:10,459
birth it's summer and it's messy there

00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:10,459
are a few people who are two fundamental

00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:22,920
analysis and evaluation process that

00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:26,279
have been using fantastic as usual the

00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:28,889
riser is helping every committees will

00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:33,570
not reach with a proving them and

00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:34,279
helping them with their features so I

00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:37,959
think

00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:40,939
thing between the two perilous ll

00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:44,269
probably would have taken lot more time

00:16:40,939 --> 00:16:49,040
if terrorism YouTube to have to decide

00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:52,100
later whether an unsubscribe look cool

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:54,680
so if you just send an email to the

00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:56,749
unsubscribe list you will it prints

00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,999
check that you are actually here where

00:16:56,749 --> 00:17:01,339
this email don't try this at home but

00:16:58,999 --> 00:17:04,039
you can tell yourself anybody from the

00:17:01,339 --> 00:17:06,100
turn of this program constructions

00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:09,010
observing the Rangers by sending

00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:13,199
thus spoofing the wrong address book

00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:13,199
yeah that's that the peaceful release

00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:18,819
you may be able to edit the messages

00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:21,900
that are sent to your users when they

00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:24,720
are then they login and when they

00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:26,160
when the neverland delegate but when the

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,220
subscribe to us there's a lot of

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,110
automated templates like are welcome to

00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:33,810
the lists a trance the trap is currently

00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:36,120
files to the file system that you can

00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:38,220
only add it if you are having access to

00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:42,200
the file system is willing to give her a

00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:45,210
little embarrassing suffice for example

00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,980
and translations it's cursing that

00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:49,080
transferring except it's not a very

00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:51,780
merits in anything has very English at

00:17:49,080 --> 00:18:01,500
the moment because it be movable as

00:17:51,780 --> 00:18:04,830
these discussed many years so it's going

00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:08,340
to take a bit more fun when you are eyes

00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:12,870
will also get info box in the coming

00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:16,800
weeks and met we were relying on put on

00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:19,980
the personification and then we should

00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:22,230
no valid answer it's a service that is

00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:26,820
provided and as you are that we don't

00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:27,660
you infiltrate and check your email and

00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:30,360
you

00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:32,070
two other services comes up in Belgium

00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,710
to personnel with a federal contractor

00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:37,260
or email it will send you to you select

00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:39,320
and fast for authentication it will

00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:42,750
connect to google for Gmail addresses

00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:45,030
your other things except medina beside

00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:50,520
to decided to retire it it's got a

00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:52,860
serviceable but by October so we have to

00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:56,070
find a different career on something

00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:59,310
else all applications to something that

00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:02,460
I wanted to avoid because now it's a

00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:04,590
fairy you have to have a very opulent to

00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:06,210
be reminded of their password the usage

00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:08,490
you have to make sure that it's a

00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:10,410
natural human rule 20 accounts of the

00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:13,130
lower stuff that goes with your

00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:15,290
verification but we wanted to avoid that

00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:19,160
we're going to do it

00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:21,860
so we do it we'll do it again of the

00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:25,160
sense that we want to have some time

00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:27,080
before first light up to each other so

00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:32,120
translation is also the thing that we

00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:34,930
went over to improve all so happy kitty

00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,950
its nose it's not specifically

00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:38,360
attachments currently you can if you

00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:40,340
repair from the web you can attach

00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:43,220
anything it would be nice to be able to

00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:46,700
do some so that's something that that

00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:48,470
should be worked on it's it's not as

00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:51,590
easy as it sounds because it has to be

00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:57,190
done mostly interested and that's needs

00:19:51,590 --> 00:20:00,860
and Morrison love or so instantaneous

00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:02,840
the rest api also do some work we

00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,760
currently don't have many people using

00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,630
the

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:09,670
okay that's why it's not so free

00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:13,120
full-featured that's where the coming of

00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:16,360
helps is going to be used a life where x

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:18,300
is going to to to have a havoc in which

00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:20,280
it's broken

00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:22,320
what see while you're doing on your

00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,970
mailing list and maybe reply to people

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,880
it's not the specifications are

00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:32,820
predefined yes but it will be there and

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:36,660
that's going to talk to the rest api so

00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:39,090
needful system system design favorable

00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:43,140
bands in architecture I think my land

00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:45,180
should be already working with real

00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:47,820
favorite

00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:50,070
using system where it hasn't been tested

00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:53,340
yet so it should be done before we lose

00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:57,020
at the friction obviously this the

00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:57,020
components are you well separated

00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:05,820
otherwise when you have like new

00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:08,250
projects or the big news issues of

00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:09,290
existing collections something that will

00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:12,170
be enhanced

00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:15,140
and many communities across the world to

00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:18,710
be moving to Miami three it's going to

00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:20,900
take a water rather than this is a very

00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:24,110
interested in moving really hmm any

00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:26,690
system to help Athenian magnifique they

00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:29,960
currently have several thousand analysts

00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:32,330
that need to be moved if they have

00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:35,840
memories with less traffic than moving a

00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:38,990
lot since china similar but not exactly

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:41,120
the same doctor merch is recognized to

00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:45,740
some people in fancy like doctor I've

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:47,510
heard that somewhere so you went to she

00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:50,060
went to have hyper key on your system

00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:53,420
there is other thing that you that you

00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:56,300
can do it you can use a personal system

00:21:53,420 --> 00:22:00,890
called a mandala which is just them be

00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:03,620
lights without strict that will bring

00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:06,260
any differences together you do provide

00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:09,310
them with a pinkie pie that ties it all

00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:09,310
together and

00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:18,860
banded together and in darkness fell

00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:22,010
asleep just not like that it's better

00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:25,190
than nothing set up stone because it

00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:27,590
lives in a single directory in

00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:31,600
eventually well it doesn't readily see

00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:34,070
users social security essa is not great

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:37,280
so it's not the wrong the weapons are

00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:40,640
approached you were to try it after i do

00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:42,200
encourage you to try apple and for

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,050
evolution departments which we are

00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:48,800
currently using in federal is optimism

00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:51,680
or central semaphores because of a

00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:54,380
scenic support so that's that's a good

00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:57,110
thing it cavities it is protective just

00:22:54,380 --> 00:23:00,360
like male mentors and it works where I

00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:04,340
witness ending syllable the language

00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:06,690
I will simply find them

00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:09,030
that will help you my good for the

00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:10,500
systems you can have my men to a million

00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:14,940
through at the same time on the same

00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:18,180
machine they don't use the same our diet

00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:20,070
raised online spaces it works anything

00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:21,420
you something will not be using there's

00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:24,960
no reason why you shouldn't be able to

00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:26,910
do that it is indeed specific to the

00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,580
fair and faster too good not as much we

00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:33,590
have a role that is only women and hot

00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:33,590
bikini specific and that mean

00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:42,950
yeah the person that you need to watch

00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:45,679
out further when you do realization you

00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:49,070
have to render users that has been

00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:51,890
changing in the way headers other on my

00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:55,549
own PL send to people there used to be

00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:58,220
this XD layer header that was there that

00:23:55,549 --> 00:23:59,990
has been there for a long time and we

00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:05,330
actually have been different deprecated

00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:08,929
since I 2010 or maybe mine there since

00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:11,900
May men having have a heaven had large

00:24:08,929 --> 00:24:15,020
new areas in that time normal cells and

00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:17,840
so automated system stopped using it and

00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:20,360
then I'm sorry stop using it well a lot

00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:23,900
of keepers are still using a billionaire

00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:26,630
header over for filtering so now the

00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:28,210
service is decided it's not exactly the

00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:31,610
same

00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:37,130
and the least I he has a dot instead of

00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:38,540
the ad symbol but it's really usable it

00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:41,000
has high risk topics as I said before

00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:44,950
this kind of service at filtering is

00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:48,470
wrong so if you reliable as always well

00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:52,070
do something else and magazine better

00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:54,020
have it impacts because the structure of

00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:58,250
the data structures together and then on

00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:59,840
to this one I already defense there are

00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:01,460
different ways to be subscribe to a

00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,610
mailing list there is a concept of mem

00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:08,120
members but that was really at the

00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:11,720
corner case in magnitude so migration of

00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:14,660
Vega is not one alone so some refer to

00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:16,820
migratory distant memory system make

00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:18,890
sure that it's trailer thing as you went

00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:20,840
to afterwards that checked by the

00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:23,690
permissions arrived at millennium on

00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:26,149
ballistics allowed to send email

00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:28,909
to learn before but I don't think there

00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:31,299
are four ways but since you can we've

00:25:28,909 --> 00:25:35,120
just arrived remain the the federal

00:25:31,299 --> 00:25:37,970
lists that the retreat we don't have

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:40,700
that many differences are mainly setups

00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:42,769
you have most intimate lists or very few

00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:44,840
sky pilots and we don't have very

00:25:42,769 --> 00:25:47,929
compact sets in

00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:49,370
that means 11 sites on which had

00:25:47,929 --> 00:25:51,289
something more complex make sure that

00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:55,340
it's over could I take my big problem

00:25:51,289 --> 00:25:58,480
and if it's not a common I really do

00:25:55,340 --> 00:26:00,919
well and we become the little birds

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:03,289
there are the best to be performance

00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:06,110
issues we have pants on in the federal

00:26:03,289 --> 00:26:08,690
way of course and one of the main

00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:11,630
problems is that remember rest server

00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:14,750
that customers areas communicates with

00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:17,029
is single file so you can only well it

00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:19,399
can only answer one request by the time

00:26:17,029 --> 00:26:22,730
with us should be 0 but when you have a

00:26:19,399 --> 00:26:27,010
lot of them can be violent so we are

00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:27,010
taking but putting some kind of trucks

00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:36,320
indicate that there's also some caching

00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:39,740
you down and hyper carry and that is not

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:42,200
as good as it could be because we don't

00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:44,809
the very soil you can you can either

00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:47,539
click and subscribe to mendel signals at

00:26:44,809 --> 00:26:50,380
the moment it's very separated our

00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:53,180
continents so we don't

00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:54,950
notifications I put it in the new dental

00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:57,770
education and someone subscribes to a

00:26:54,950 --> 00:27:00,290
list and it since it's a check that it

00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:03,080
has to do an hour like bangles over time

00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:05,780
when you connect to the web interface it

00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:07,430
is cached the caching condition isn't

00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:09,440
any color because we don't get a signal

00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:14,510
when someone changes that blunder

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:17,150
so your cache invalidation an issue can

00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:20,090
relate to performance issues if you set

00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:23,060
the cash to error and it's something

00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:25,430
make sure you have mm mm kg you are

00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:30,760
several on your machine if you want to

00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:30,760
read it with my 10 list fiber and we are

00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:36,350
aware if any of you guys I'm in straight

00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:38,920
now so there's a tournament or no smiles

00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:38,920
no

00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:49,490
so if you have to otherwise there's a

00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:52,980
little thing that can be done mostly

00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:55,680
trimethoprim to see it I'll check to see

00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:59,930
if anyone has over federal system that

00:27:55,680 --> 00:28:04,590
we have well during 7th is less ability

00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:06,810
to de-risk people with like you there's

00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:09,930
a lot of Gangrel optimization that could

00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:14,280
be done on must be industrious the guy

00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:17,310
who the real person or persons do you

00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:21,210
have much experience and on in general

00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:23,130
crab legs before that so it does things

00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:25,050
that were written at the time of

00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:28,640
developed at four so there are see same

00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:31,070
thing that could be upgraded to you our

00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,570
infrastructure you are and with diamonds

00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:35,670
we can say we hire in general number

00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:37,950
eight because it's a lentil soup ever

00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:39,750
version and there's a lot of thing that

00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:42,810
could be improved that thing again and

00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:47,550
you can now that we have this higher

00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:50,190
requirement that before wherever where

00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:53,510
the piper katie is to give you a quick

00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:57,140
ID and have your mailing list are doing

00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:57,140
where is the traffic

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,400
burying it is better than that and

00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:06,110
that's something that we are always

00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,590
trying to get better metrics the

00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:10,850
particular i will maybe list could be

00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:14,870
analyzed by looking at the number of

00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:16,640
people rivers but it could be also be a

00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:18,920
very number of em con trick when you

00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,480
have like a lot of messages and in the

00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:23,030
few people who are actually sending

00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:26,740
whether they are thinking to do to find

00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:31,400
the relevant metrics so there is that

00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:34,430
guy ready go just thinking about it we

00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:35,870
have this cell this algae at some point

00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:39,620
it has what you need to try to detect

00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:42,020
thread patterns and and do something

00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:43,610
about something when you have and you

00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:45,710
have your farewell to people every time

00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:48,890
to each other in to live in google for

00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:52,520
ages it's it's done in actually very

00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:57,050
easily detectable very happily we do

00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:59,930
first up with us if we were people burn

00:29:57,050 --> 00:30:01,310
the way so we will just have everybody

00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:03,780
else

00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:07,680
there's a lot of fun things can be done

00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:10,320
with a good many software and they're

00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:11,790
like people ask for some have asked for

00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,100
very simple questions that we have

00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:17,250
everybody and service sector kind of the

00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:19,170
same thing at a few minutes emotional

00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:20,900
since I whatever they're interesting

00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:24,480
patterns that could be detected an

00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:26,700
accident Adam so that should be that

00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:30,480
different than you could I possibly at

00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:33,720
times to this discussion there anything

00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:36,630
that you could do it has been it has

00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,730
been whatever engine of the project for

00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:43,550
a long time I am actually better than to

00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:46,110
write something about this so why not

00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:48,750
the comment of course needs to be

00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:51,030
improved on thank you we have options

00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:53,880
where else LM as a second there's a lot

00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:59,130
of thing that could be the mud everybody

00:30:53,880 --> 00:31:03,940
uses an off-center seven so I don't back

00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:09,710
hmmm that still in this novel

00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:12,980
oh jeez on designed to help it

00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:14,600
understand my name is better and people

00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:17,840
aren't used to measure used to be after

00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:19,490
20 years ago and should be my best less

00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:27,110
normal and it should be made more

00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:30,980
accessible production server isn't this

00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:33,710
step / after the hole and we're at such

00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:38,270
events of the first one a moment where

00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:40,700
is the deluxe holding the new tire that

00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:43,190
we started working on together it is

00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:45,440
also very interesting first read if you

00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:48,170
were to the firmament in your class

00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:51,020
structure and there's a new tutorial

00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:53,060
inherently who's this one talks about

00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:54,950
how to be there was nothing about name

00:31:53,060 --> 00:32:00,260
and it's the installation of my bed

00:31:54,950 --> 00:32:03,670
itself in this in this documentation and

00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:08,110
repair business really bad like

00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:09,880
for that two issues if you can stash mad

00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:11,980
men you have all the metal products the

00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:15,280
man is abusive ex so you can be a

00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:22,710
student github during chrises notices

00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:26,250
but it depends fine yes we have moments

00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:28,289
he / dippin incident the other

00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:31,610
dependencies but the library that we

00:32:28,289 --> 00:32:36,950
work you access with are several mobiles

00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:42,450
that's also where you can advance or a

00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:45,059
special name something that's the end s

00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:48,179
it is if you have questions or if you

00:32:45,059 --> 00:32:53,510
like question on many to answer them

00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:53,510
and/or ideas or yes

00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:10,240
so real quick and if there isn't real

00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:15,000
proper pregnant faster train hi peculiar

00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:17,460
at the moment that all email are when

00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,460
l didn't technically it goes through

00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:22,470
this basic function that create web

00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:26,360
ranking everything and those are rather

00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:31,620
signal sense it's a general signal sets

00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:35,420
22 well the jungle system app engine all

00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:40,410
so what could be Rama is average at the

00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:43,200
at the nobles in her bikini and surgery

00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:45,540
is very straightforward but not in our

00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:51,090
class with the content attribute way our

00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:56,550
new content Noah and and yeah if you do

00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:58,470
an arrow okay so it's not it's not very

00:33:56,550 --> 00:34:01,800
hard the only thing that you will

00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:05,580
probably need use understand erm for the

00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:07,050
love connection to the database and the

00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:11,360
structure graduate request in the

00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:15,870
database the very last and definitely

00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:18,860
some some function that we do the

00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:21,650
threads with you

00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:26,510
two headers and it's a very separate

00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:29,720
function that then actually uses another

00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:32,510
key I think he uses network legs so too

00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:36,020
it's a pattern library to redo networks

00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:37,820
and representations this is this is

00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:41,350
could be a which starts in sure to look

00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:45,190
at if you want to know how to handle

00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:45,190
many questions of the terrace

00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:53,220
just

00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:56,010
this other relative doesn't have really

00:34:53,220 --> 00:35:00,110
operating system with an HR well you can

00:34:56,010 --> 00:35:03,960
get a signal and even do welcome on the

00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:07,380
video on the projector to other like

00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:10,200
liquid rest and then you can you can

00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:13,050
find a friend the battery is connected

00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:15,720
to this email and attached to it it's

00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:19,080
like it sells evolution work with us

00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:22,410
apparently or currency for because it

00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:25,460
can lose the same you have a tax

00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:29,540
property that you can add things to

00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:29,540
really study

00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:33,460
what's interesting

00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:53,340
remember

00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:58,960
I think it's quite a nipple from the

00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:02,170
hostages the thing is we have to try to

00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:04,810
have something that only is registering

00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:08,290
reverse hyperkinetic to go to the rest

00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:09,970
api and I tell you will follow you will

00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:12,910
get a notification of elastic element

00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:15,370
comes in you can only reduce liability

00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:19,520
to the signal in our

00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:21,550
sorry it will be different okay cool I

00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:26,050
can start with

00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:29,220
we were just relax that will be is

00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:29,220
gonna be quite different purposes

00:36:38,909 --> 00:36:44,559
Thanks this actually most mysteriously

00:36:42,309 --> 00:36:47,969
forces the designers work that really

00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:54,519
are really good making a website in a

00:36:47,969 --> 00:36:56,619
generally bad part other cases because

00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:59,169
it's actually connected to it appeared

00:36:56,619 --> 00:37:01,659
on stream and metal children well it's

00:36:59,169 --> 00:37:03,480
actually real stock but I think that's

00:37:01,659 --> 00:37:06,119
really very interesting in

00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:09,210
is the desire and the edges behind it

00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:12,740
and not the silly thing that is not

00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:17,310
Affeldt means Naruto can penetrate but

00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:19,380
my most of my work these muscles are

00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:21,200
doing on the rest of the stockade should

00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:25,470
be on my man Omar on in thesaurus

00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:27,780
because that's where it was needed at it

00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:34,280
was more hyper kitty was is being traced

00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:37,530
they were his last night cambria mean so

00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:42,570
yeah well thanks thanks I think it's

00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:45,080
really good that's what I do ok so I'm

00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:45,080
