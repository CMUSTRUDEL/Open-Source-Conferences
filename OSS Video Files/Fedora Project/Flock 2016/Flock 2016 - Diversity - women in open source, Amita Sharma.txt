My paper will highlight different aspect of diversity and how fedora is supporting diversity in all terms.

It's wonderful to be a woman. Women have been participating in social, political, economic, cultural, and technological fields for many decades and it's time to push it further. Even if Fedora has a rising number of women participating actively in our community, we aim to increase this number by creating and encouraging programs where women interested in IT can develop their personal and technical skills and make a path for themselves in the IT field.

Every activity counts, like running workshops for schoolgirls in undeserved areas or reaching out to college women to spread knowledge about open source. We can share information about many great groups and opportunities, such as OpenHatch, Women in Drupal, PyLadies, Outreachy and Google Summer of Code. There are so many great outreach programs for women in open source, and we just need to spread the knowledge and motivate women out there to join the movement. We can point people to the resources created for supporting women in open source by the Ada Initiative during its existence from 2011 to 2015, and more resources available on the Geek Feminism wiki. There are lots of things to do, and it is not just coding in fact, you can do many different and exciting things to contribute to open source, such as writing, documentation, design, translation, testing, and more.

We can have a helping-pyramid where each Fedora woman can be a mentor of two more women, and once they feel comfortable enough, each one can be a mentor for two more women, and thus continue the work to make our numbers grow.

would like to sit thanks to our SQL who

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:26,699
has taken the 7d theaters in fedora

00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:29,160
history two constants such a initiating

00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:31,980

your own but we are going to state of

00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:51,780
the ideas you know betting you're

00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:56,030
helping the people so the velocity

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:59,789
pencils none of them so this day our

00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:02,730
purposes on the ruin of linearity growth

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:06,510
so we had considerable many day or two

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:09,420
things of July and we have you know it

00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:14,189
is small events or a personal growth you

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:17,220
we celebrated into the office also this

00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:21,600
is the number of women who has appeared

00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:24,090
in the federal one day and it was quite

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,890
successful and we got some interesting

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:30,840
theories incursions from them or like

00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:33,900
letting them to be active contributor

00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:37,710
and why do we make moving number is

00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:41,840
service in the community so rather

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,840
interesting versions and again I

00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,460
working

00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:46,750
so I want to mess it with Justin laptop

00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:50,200
okay so then I listen to self in the

00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:53,560
technology that is one of the men women

00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:55,780
cannot bail programming or coding men

00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:59,380
are all those the better programmers or

00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:02,440
talent event women there is no audience

00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:05,440
balance for women to work in the tech

00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:07,930
industry so the tempest can make square

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,640

children evident you go anyhow to

00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:23,440
technical industry s I'll make soup

00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:26,080
random example of events it's special to

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,510
me my mother always wanted me to go in

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:33,370

these are some you know what is in the

00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:50,740
mind of the paper that women should

00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:53,800
stick to certain location and not real

00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:56,350
technical at least so there they can be

00:03:53,800 --> 00:04:00,820
know if you want to add your turn we can

00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:04,720
you get that cilix I will reduce a

00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:07,090
series of X it is time to you know

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,730
discuss some facts about women in the

00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:13,840
industry and the community and the

00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:27,970
technology so only you know any of these

00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:33,060
women in the technology today okay so

00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:33,060
anybody who yeah

00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:41,310
games over anybody give Denver she hands

00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:43,919
them in please select issues in the list

00:04:41,310 --> 00:05:03,510
of top 10 women in the technology I

00:04:43,919 --> 00:05:07,110
would like to attend college so I like

00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:09,240
not all of them I care I is a good

00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:11,880
assume a few of them so that's when he

00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,850
misses in KY chris who is known as best

00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:17,880
evils of the personal computer she will

00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:20,610
be able director so I this is the direct

00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,530
example of a movement creativity she

00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:25,169
doesn't want a community to be an

00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:29,970
emotional machine she wants to be more

00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:33,720
user training so I was here I cash box

00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:34,860
or the command line making know that

00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,650
this is

00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:42,900
this is the end put the pipe right so

00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:47,990
she is the measure of such items and so

00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:53,849
little bit of America creativity here so

00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:56,340
makes it heavy Oh margin yeah who have

00:05:53,849 --> 00:06:00,210
let you have done frequency-hopping bet

00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:04,770
they say yes you were it's still using

00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:07,259
yeah yeah after earning editor maybe

00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:10,139
he'll achieve a naked and yes that's

00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:14,069
true that she was an actress by the same

00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:18,030
time she loves steak spectrum technology

00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:21,480
that is far

00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:23,539
touch it like when you are when you turn

00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:28,110
over a new layer dip in general

00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:31,259
wait so that has you lose a lady in army

00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:34,770
in my class in blue so you can be a

00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:37,979
Halloween can be taken up enough place

00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:40,379
for him she is a burger empire she is

00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:43,530
the inventor of the kuru blue valley

00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:45,210
which was used which was the first human

00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:48,090
readable programming language in the

00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:53,069
history and fifty-three percent of the

00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:57,539
organization user so places Adam Adam

00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:59,610
was first programmer ever before why

00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:02,819
nobody has program anything she

00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:06,840
developed a plastic an algorithm for a

00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:10,669
machine which was not even existing yeah

00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:16,259
that's true that was analytical engine

00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:18,300
laces Mary she was for the best feel the

00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:20,699
space she developed the same kind of

00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:23,610
size of the screen displays and the

00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:25,889
loose industry partners she has moved on

00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:28,620
from the industry profitable industry to

00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:30,690
the non profitable organization and she

00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:37,219
will persist until you take your one

00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:40,650
laptop per child woman so you see that

00:07:37,219 --> 00:07:45,110
all these myths are clearly minutes

00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:50,790
because these are the facts it thanks

00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:54,000
before this I wonder today we are

00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:57,560
no I not been without of a row and

00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:01,110
getting it behind us with some examples

00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:04,080
listen she can be okay because you get a

00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:10,260
close the people whom you get off right

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:14,000
so let's go to the examples put a little

00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:18,690
over Britain Marilla search the earth

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:21,720
hour with specialists in red hair she's

00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:24,770
another so the myth I was talking about

00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:28,260
a woman cannot handle the family and

00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:30,720
children and it doesn't take the job so

00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:34,560
she is the language sample to you know

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:38,190
to that myth so and for your information

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:40,020
her traditions have handsome son is in

00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:42,419
the conference so she's a ring in the

00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:48,200
past November style and attitude to

00:08:42,419 --> 00:09:08,250
build a director who remember no more

00:08:48,200 --> 00:09:10,560
yeah excellent to BP 90 who's hitting

00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:13,380
the middle design take lots of batches

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:16,650
which you get fervor it's like Oscar for

00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:19,050
your sake open yourself right The Oval

00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:25,860
Office which is very is coming from this

00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:27,530
baby whoever no move yeah I presented so

00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:30,390
if you had

00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:36,500
detective are especially popular series

00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:36,500
devoid of content okay and these are the

00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:07,650
director so helping in the older of

00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:10,380
dogmas and write to her faking yes she

00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:12,810
is an intern and being there and also

00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:15,390
that you getting in open source so these

00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:18,330
are some live example not the British or

00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:20,250
national examples are the examples from

00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:24,030
the history they are the present

00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:27,470
examples you can relate them so you can

00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:27,470
look at my face I'm a tester

00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:35,399
so some of the things about domain are

00:10:32,129 --> 00:10:39,199
they are created they are wish the time

00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:42,240
yes powerful they are intelligent and

00:10:39,199 --> 00:10:46,439
there is nothing lacking them to be a

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:49,889
good programmer or other color it's fair

00:10:46,439 --> 00:10:52,709
choice to choose a move on and to

00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:58,199
contributing anything they wanted okay

00:10:52,709 --> 00:11:01,290
so there will be a sub fear or in every

00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:04,139
area has increased success and it is

00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:05,759
good there are the numbers to show but

00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:09,660
there are enough of the numbers we have

00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:11,459
shown the presentations but that is true

00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:13,800
that if we have the people from the

00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:16,439
diverse backgrounds where is the

00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:19,079
diversity in the processes where is the

00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:20,999
diversity in the ideas and if you put

00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:25,379
together those argue as your success

00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:26,999
rate when covers okay so magical numbers

00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:29,699
which are pretenders it is getting

00:11:26,999 --> 00:11:32,279
increasing year by year those smelly but

00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:35,279
it is getting increases last last year

00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:38,519
only six women were present in the flow

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:41,730
of improvement of participants and the

00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:45,449
seer the number is 15 so it is steadily

00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:47,519
increasing we are going there these are

00:11:45,449 --> 00:11:50,430
some of the big initiators which has

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,740
been written there is no master edition

00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:56,220
of women in computing which happens in

00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:58,230
us in India every year you may need open

00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:01,290
source order which is consoled by their

00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:03,540
hat or rigid began to specifically for

00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:04,840
the little stain the google Summer of

00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:08,050
services

00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:10,690
mini cooper Henry shorter which is not

00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:13,210
long there it has been stopped that we

00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:16,090
can use their footprint and their code

00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:20,920
of conduct and the type of unconvincing

00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:23,590
open half so if finish it is that there

00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:33,010
it will make us investor to be part of

00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:37,690
the family what is it about 15 why I

00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:40,450
should feel of this equipment so have

00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:42,970
you ever been a fun these are some

00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:45,850
factors which I can we go lady you

00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:48,370
people okay and going good I think the

00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:50,470
lack of knowledge is here then I'm happy

00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:53,470
together when you stay loose not too

00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:56,200
late to ask you the question where can i

00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:57,760
do per ticket in this area and for this

00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,100
specific timing because i have

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:03,400
considered cool to take care of i had to

00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:05,740
squat a job at the office so if i can

00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:08,710
give it to eyes on the decade will it be

00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:13,180
counted so clearly it's a lack of

00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:16,020
knowledge yes you're very calm community

00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:16,020
like we go

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:26,279
morning you never know who had very

00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:28,949
useful at all right so that that Patti

00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:30,959
has to fill we have to start the lullaby

00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:32,459
it's not just the women you should be

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,649
spreading this knowledge to other women

00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:37,259
there is the responsibility of every

00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:40,380
limb over here another the

00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:43,560
responsibility but you know the healthy

00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:47,130
hand you can extend to other women an

00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:49,440
arrangement don't then they are better

00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:51,600
to your daughters or you know your

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,230
sisters don't go to the technical line

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:59,430
it's not see they'll be like my father

00:13:54,230 --> 00:14:02,550
and use them to be growing lifeline open

00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:04,410
the gates for band and the oceans to

00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,449
them give these your future event that

00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:10,079
you have given me part of this industry

00:14:06,449 --> 00:14:13,380
has been superb that is the part of the

00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:16,769
engagement or only so this separately I

00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:19,920
expect so not only from women but from

00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:22,470
the melton disco ball something so tiny

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,959
the lip thing so time is the major

00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:27,569
sector these are women who have to

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:30,800
handle so many hundreds saying that my

00:14:27,569 --> 00:14:34,170
don't need to handle too many things but

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:36,000
there is the things which maybe we can

00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:38,279
not be consistent with on keep your

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,459
payment the community the trend in the

00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:43,529
gap that that is acceptable in the

00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:49,170
community that even if you do small

00:14:43,529 --> 00:14:52,460
chance of things it is something so this

00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:55,090
is I love to hire more women

00:14:52,460 --> 00:15:00,260
last year at least double in the number

00:14:55,090 --> 00:15:03,890
in element or other men you will go and

00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:06,140
educate at least a single woman the edge

00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:09,260
encouragement show them all how to

00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:11,810
contribute as rebels and rockers how

00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:13,850
take all you can solve in how you can

00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:15,950
mentor them because you are already

00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:17,990
extra contribution you can do that is

00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:20,450
the one who make your next one waste any

00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:23,360
time so think about the number maybe

00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:26,450
next year you have equal movements a

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:30,020
take over here and you know as many as

00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:35,450
many city right so that kind of helping

00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:38,090
pyramid we can you know we can google or

00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:40,610
the initiatives like for women stay or

00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:44,510
the events by which we can educate more

00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:47,120
human to the target the community so

00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:51,010
anyone would like to add something to

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:55,630
the ledge to the pets and questions and

00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:55,630
want to talk about diversity also

00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:01,550
haha

00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:52,190
i explicitly mention it all the

00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:55,519
indication and the males that name are

00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:58,100
most welcome in this event and idea to

00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:01,220
have such kind of events it is still

00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:03,949
have majority of the people from the

00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:06,290
minority group and not the others are

00:17:03,949 --> 00:17:10,010
saying are people coming and remembering

00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:12,439
the people we are targeting like we have

00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:15,020
similar one controls and get-togethers

00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:17,089
and events and release parties where

00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:18,919
everybody is growing you know men are

00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:21,309
going women are going but the

00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:25,189
participation of female is less and

00:17:21,309 --> 00:17:28,010
sometimes we need an environment such

00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:32,690
kind of a minor political that I am

00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:35,320
majority giving so idea was to give such

00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:35,320
kind of platform

00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,750
so

00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:22,230
I

00:18:43,229 --> 00:18:50,139
yeah so maybe I look who is the bigger

00:18:47,469 --> 00:18:51,700
answer I like that idea i appreciate

00:18:50,139 --> 00:18:54,909
your quiet and respect that point of

00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:57,219
view this just a little bigger example

00:18:54,909 --> 00:18:59,830
think about a person who doesn't know

00:18:57,219 --> 00:19:02,320
anything and he is directly going to our

00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:04,629
release party further I can take two

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:07,299
political parties happening and they

00:19:04,629 --> 00:19:10,419
were talking about workstation cloud and

00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:14,169
the wrong person dr. in gilded and

00:19:10,419 --> 00:19:16,929
everything is going bouncer and that

00:19:14,169 --> 00:19:19,119
lady could not collect the courage to

00:19:16,929 --> 00:19:21,599
respect the questions he only to put he

00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:25,659
has the question how to make a fire god

00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:28,509
they think that is the right place today

00:19:25,659 --> 00:19:30,669
set question for her even if it was the

00:19:28,509 --> 00:19:34,450
right klarissa even if the people dancin

00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:36,009
that question and answered it she

00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:38,440
couldn't gather the courage to protect

00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:40,869
ocean because people will ask hippler is

00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:43,359
putting clothes suit or advanced stuff

00:19:40,869 --> 00:19:50,339
over there that it was not a big link

00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:50,339
open so that was the idea like

00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:23,290
this color is a graphical user and white

00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:23,290
sent me to educate hit by the chosen

00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:41,000
I will take care of that but my idea is

00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:43,760
specifically to Quebec example is why we

00:20:41,000 --> 00:21:13,549
have women's specific conferences or

00:20:43,760 --> 00:21:18,460
events the idea is to not worry in this

00:21:13,549 --> 00:21:18,460
in this second thoughts okay

00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:32,350
place

00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:37,140
in peace out

00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:37,140
I

00:21:41,649 --> 00:21:44,649
Wow

00:21:46,419 --> 00:21:48,419
ah

00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:06,950
fine

00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,950
Oh

00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:13,370
free will

00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:25,710
and so how does special

00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:39,510
would find helpful and so

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,400
women

00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:57,450
see along

00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:57,450
I would spend a long time

00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:11,100
power the men

00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:23,450
learn like

00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:33,630
I

00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:33,630
although some

00:23:44,180 --> 00:24:02,240
we are on my on the desktop yes so so I

00:23:54,390 --> 00:24:05,240
want is that young and someone could say

00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,240
conferences

00:24:29,870 --> 00:25:03,900
in our angry with many one and that

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:07,030
Obama's are

00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:11,170
because in the group you can get

00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:16,660
empowered to be stronger in the general

00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:21,340
is excellent yes I do especially to

00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:24,330
death because it sort of face here I go

00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:24,330
that's fine

00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:43,390
because pick up her sister all like

00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:48,029
together and just be

00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:51,379
guess who

00:25:48,029 --> 00:25:51,379
but they can

00:25:55,690 --> 00:26:02,240
so they love the way you said women look

00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:05,559
like Olivier Rochus books and good up

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,559
while it'll come

00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:37,310
okay so from what I understood you say

00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:41,770
that in spirit choice to choose their

00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:41,770
own burning system yes okay

00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,519
No

00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:35,760
