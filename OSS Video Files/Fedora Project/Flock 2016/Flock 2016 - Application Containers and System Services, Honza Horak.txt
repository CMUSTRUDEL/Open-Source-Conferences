Title: Flock 2016 - Application Containers and System Services, Honza Horak
Publication date: 2016-08-21
Playlist: Flock 2016
Description: 
	Software maintainers started to face new challenges after Docker formatted containers arrived to developer boxes. Fedora has always been bleeding edge distro, so it comes natural that even in containers world Fedora should be innovator to follow. Linux containers might soon be viable alternative for system services, after they has been already de facto standard of modern PaaS, like OpenShift. Not every container must support both theses use cases, but there are some, like databases containers, where we definitely want to use them as system services and PaaS applications at the same time. Technical Solution is not that hard, it is enough to understand principles of the both use cases. The harder portion of work is to start thinking differently, than how maintainers usually do. In this talk, Honza will share experiences and some tough topics we learned so far during preparing containers for RHEL and CentOS and will share some best practices that should be followed in Fedora as well. The talk will focus on view of Fedora maintainers, who are about to join the dark side of containers development. Let's meet and talk how to make Fedora-based containers better.
