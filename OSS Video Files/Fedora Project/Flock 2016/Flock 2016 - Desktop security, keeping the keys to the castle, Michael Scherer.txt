Firewall, IDS, SELinux, ssh bastion, and others, the list of server side security measure is long. While servers can be reasonably secure nowadays, we always forget that there is always a way to enter by the desktop side. In this talk, we will explore various security measures to be used and deployed on a Linux desktop, and while it will be primarily focused on Fedora, lessons will be applicable also to others systems.
