	(This recording was on a laptop with a defective microphone. Unfortunately, it does not seem like the audio is able to be restored. Please refer to the slides and transcription for the talk, if available.)

Firewall, IDS, SELinux, ssh bastion, and others, the list of server side security measure is long. While servers can be reasonably secure nowadays, we always forget that there is always a way to enter by the desktop side. In this talk, we will explore various security measures to be used and deployed on a Linux desktop, and while it will be primarily focused on Fedora, lessons will be applicable also to others systems.

This video was recorded at the annual Fedora contributor conference, Flock, in KrakÃ³w, Poland, from August 2-5, 2016. You can learn more about Flock at https://flocktofedora.org.

so we just said that it was college and

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:27,240
associate and we were a liquid a message

00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:29,660
my name is a vacation in paris and 20

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,660
but we can

00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:43,739
I saw a source of potassium which is a

00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:48,239
GV Sonny your strategy to determine our

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:48,239
monogamy communi- Burleson

00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:07,880
you are reading constituted an eevee may

00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:17,490
ee- jaws on be your ultimate solution

00:01:14,399 --> 00:01:20,580
which was an interesting onion actually

00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:25,340
goes one of the door 30 words and oh it

00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:28,920
was my question like that night when I

00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:31,229
7am performance of a local server so

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:35,090
transmission and people can weather and

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:43,190
subscribe to just 10 key programming

00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:43,190
when working for them and our ways

00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:31,100
from the Shakopee particular we always

00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:34,340
met with ginger but you can be wrong in

00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:36,800
French so this are able to marry

00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:40,490
security concept of biophysics are in

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:43,040
service you can use your movie the

00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:46,700
services it sort of all time low key

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,680
principles or ability ensure the system

00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,870
you are able to protect this is a

00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,019
manager

00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:55,720
you know she's working as the food let's

00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:58,120
imagine you are equal access this

00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,799
trailer is a website is Monday you are

00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,019
eating minute and I've nothing to

00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:05,920
explain only women in bed for most

00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:08,079
Anthony which are not started and there

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,049
is no charity if you are power for

00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:14,530
example of her particular email to be

00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:18,310
licked is it in the US or in Turkey haha

00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:20,950
this freedom and the visibility which is

00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:23,349
barricaded in them we were supposed to

00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:25,989
be able to do start but yoga as you go

00:03:23,349 --> 00:03:28,629
through pig eat anything image is a test

00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:31,140
for a change of curation share the data

00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:34,799
so we need to protect your system

00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:37,870
education for another white people and

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:41,739
what is the result of a dependent as a

00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:44,379
mother see it's typical occur the usual

00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:47,489
whether you can see quite easily or kind

00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:55,050
of the ultimate evil

00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:55,050
this is a close personal friend I see

00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:04,959
masaru over summer project and 99 that

00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:08,489
did either we performed first cheaper

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:16,810
remember secret a solid first sequence

00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:22,000
the doctor and it's given which is well

00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:24,490
considered as a conventional goes so

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,220
well advanced in persistence west bank

00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:30,430
rd criminal organizations and wants to

00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:35,740
us when we suppose to give you find one

00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:40,120
out if I we can do is just acting like

00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:43,060
one this in your permission I will

00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,949
travel to many shoes attention Lazar

00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:47,320
winning weapon mostly because I have

00:04:44,949 --> 00:04:49,570
focus on the sidewalk station I winning

00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:52,210
the substance for a long time so some of

00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:53,860
the technical is because could be

00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:56,349
because you only

00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:59,650
take another programmer for your

00:04:56,349 --> 00:05:02,379
rotation in turn when we are keeping in

00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:05,050
0 10 I capable people do think the most

00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:10,000
definitely while others at something

00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:19,389
oh yeah 3 control computer ready for

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:22,210
your ic7 stealing from 70 cigarette is

00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:23,800
to decide with a tracking system so I

00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:26,699
believe that you need to use free

00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:29,560
software mostly because now officially

00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:31,690
transferred issue other comments while

00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:34,509
Christmas we're a better can see the

00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:36,639
religion that the circus know that

00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:39,159
people were worthy but at least mover

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,289
for the interests of the panera are the

00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:43,780
same as you like they are compressed

00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:47,349
into you and the addy from a

00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:51,430
feature high potassium in verbal

00:05:47,349 --> 00:05:52,690
includes all those of X so alpha is not

00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:55,449
sufficient you need to use something

00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:57,250
super kid we don't know that's an online

00:05:55,449 --> 00:05:59,349
weather data distribution because it can

00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:01,900
be for consider analogies can also keep

00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:04,330
the system here for more people the

00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:06,789
restaurant is if you will have because

00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:10,889
different better thermal signature that

00:06:06,789 --> 00:06:10,889
you're in a machine so please

00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:17,910
right trainer first treaty present

00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:21,389
posture to Randy faster when I saw Becky

00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:21,389
much messenger

00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:38,509
you see so undercover and GCC new this

00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:40,940
morning resident but yeah sometimes

00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:51,979
judgmental features a method as well

00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:56,169
because with a feature of security will

00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:59,389
increment and medical attention with

00:06:56,169 --> 00:07:05,230
lots of images readiness if you have

00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:08,380
been slightly less with you and is not

00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:11,560
mr. who she got it and goes back to the

00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:13,660
woman reading interpreter prayer even

00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,400
decide to follow my advice missa

00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:17,770
chickabee sister was in the description

00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:23,740
Brandon and the people sing 11

00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:26,770
tournament but this is when you have a

00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:28,390
mood secretly for my website and there

00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:30,610
is no information at all web it's a

00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:34,030
second I'm going to be German it's not

00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:37,030
secure for me so now we just a little

00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:39,910
party system turn I wish you didn't

00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:41,770
storm is a 930 disk or 12 or it's an

00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:43,480
Alex you cannot so just check out what

00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:47,080
we need to go back and insert a rhythm

00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:49,930
and if someone is working on a pedestal

00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,280
be nice to be able to switch later it

00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:53,630
simple the way somewhere that the

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,930
controller chromatography and ways

00:07:53,630 --> 00:08:00,350
rest of it switches your memories just

00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:02,810
check a bit wait and that's it are we

00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:05,030
going blue for us under disk encryption

00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:08,930
is like that you only answer key to

00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:12,460
protecting your database impact on

00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:16,960
people modified released on everything

00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:16,960
actually went with no repeat and repeat

00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:27,350
immediate or sometimes did you talk

00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:32,570
about 20 or more than one else dinosaur

00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:35,539
busy so everything supremacist president

00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:37,880
equal sign but yeah I still try to get

00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:39,770
an education which is you consider where

00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:43,880
my uncle here because you meet at last

00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:46,130
and so people oppose me one and yes

00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,900
the program and I rather the disk

00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:51,680
encryption is taking my bath really and

00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:54,770
I need 7 30 40 100 brands are uniform to

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:59,390
spend the personality as I live I am

00:08:54,770 --> 00:09:01,250
without a ticket semana that I we just

00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:03,500
are ghosts in Paris and use a lego thing

00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:07,160
telling my laptop but it's quite easy

00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:09,380
but is a little too long yeah I wish I

00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:13,250
responded and was able to keep it in i

00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:16,240
need to buy a handle and yeah someone

00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:20,380
for has a rapper ever quite well for

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:22,730
some signal decision you play run and

00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:25,190
typically people are not able to

00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:28,580
document and do something bad with them

00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:31,610
I cannot do this well give them user

00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:35,600
password the bastard is the border for

00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:39,080
exact purpose cancel attack will be back

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:41,720
with as we digitally or when shut down

00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:44,000
the system why the memory is not quite

00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,890
which is done which means that someone

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,860
can just take it put it on angular

00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:50,370
system started and them surrender it and

00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:53,460
in the memories

00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:55,650
the key to emotional disc and visually

00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:57,839
when loaded all time community still be

00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:59,460
repelled kill the disc which is usually

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,500
attached to the record speed Illinois

00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:03,570
which is also attached to the level of

00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,810
this disc in several ways quite

00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:08,910
complicated but on orders of Ukraine and

00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:11,670
let import access as I else that I cook

00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:16,050
is running three saws your little man

00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:18,300
average or even by the second you leave

00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:20,250
your heart and I can get new moon and

00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:22,260
someone's pretend to be your maid and

00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:27,540
tell us that it's recommended to hang

00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:31,080
with a good this displays and cement

00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:33,240
just to verify selector and you know if

00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:35,760
you get the plank type your password and

00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:38,190
it's another surprise it's not the rigid

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,990
after all have fun it's one of the week

00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:43,500
off imagining all studied by listeners

00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:46,050
or whatever and it's away because surely

00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:48,750
chemical attack and kicks a month ago

00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:49,450
get together with other which is working

00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,190
for fun

00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:54,010
open it and if they take that it's human

00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:57,130
to the legacies are federally thing as a

00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:59,050
changing literally because the race boss

00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:02,170
that you need to add something which is

00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:04,500
a microchip to defeat division as of the

00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:09,340
past which is added by the email other

00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:11,440
so well let's take a look for them so we

00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:15,160
want to collect on that very secure

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:18,880
route and we let the women and save a

00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:21,280
secret but basically verified each step

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,850
of the route that smirking as modified

00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:28,860
of fog that means we can do that is a

00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:31,750
signature to process recipe for

00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:35,520
Microsoft you can conclude your monkey

00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:38,830
then staff become while having a cottage

00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:41,800
cameras and everything and you need to

00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:44,440
start with Lisa curioso going on it's

00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:47,769
quite annoying so people propose another

00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:56,529
approach using what you can

00:11:47,769 --> 00:12:01,029
you should settle royal ancestors and in

00:11:56,529 --> 00:12:05,489
bed which is the new single ppl who is a

00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:08,529
1-1 of animal speeds as much budget

00:12:05,489 --> 00:12:13,509
condition six months ago for the first

00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:16,329
musical guest because gable is guiding

00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:24,189
such a person putting the vegetables are

00:12:16,329 --> 00:12:25,649
rich and unless one hahaha so it was not

00:12:24,189 --> 00:12:29,399
so easy to you because it was not

00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:38,829
individual when I read something to

00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:42,279
article1 lacking removal stuff remember

00:12:38,829 --> 00:12:46,499
and there is some other let something on

00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:49,949
jennifer and I can do German SS which

00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:55,029
particular with there is an interesting

00:12:49,949 --> 00:13:05,249
process so it's supposed to work I do

00:12:55,029 --> 00:13:08,649
have been able to best that I do this

00:13:05,249 --> 00:13:10,600
never has to get a good table to press

00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:12,579
for my laptop to an adapter and

00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:16,059
summarization there is three type of

00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:18,610
table so each your the recognition so

00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:21,939
each other management o'clock it will be

00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:26,970
nice to control is BS so nice 34 and

00:13:21,939 --> 00:13:31,119
kids understand from the whispered man I

00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:33,129
computer is put soup on it so the plan

00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:35,169
is to install the key on the noise you

00:13:33,129 --> 00:13:36,570
can do something called the figure of

00:13:35,169 --> 00:13:41,640
the story

00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:44,440
so either moment because miss africa

00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:48,490
does not possess people you should ask

00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:50,440
you man at this point because to be sure

00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:52,060
the home where the first of the three

00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:55,780
magnets can I use it all ready to

00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:59,460
penetrate any money let the belly dancer

00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:59,460
can have to look for something like this

00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:08,530
asked if you want or anything and as I

00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:10,960
have my optimal solution is to user to

00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:13,810
turn around the stick now you can equal

00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:16,810
to ponder healers we can help well and

00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:19,420
are fantastic and if you get seven PST

00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:22,600
then other addresses speaking of which

00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:26,080
is much easier to put more than one

00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:34,180
after the additional it was too many

00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:37,120
data which is by economic Medina need to

00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:39,480
add a pistol cook everything it's much

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,180
easier with

00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,339
people can just decide the compiler for

00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:47,730
my touch with an ax and a bit where the

00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:50,639
difference does it are you going to

00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:53,519
consider try to match it was a security

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:55,620
device at home I mean you can imagine

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,290
that for so fingers crossed the tender

00:14:55,620 --> 00:15:00,600
tender are where you do not get a 30 be

00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:03,300
times where security for the components

00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:07,620
Morahan steps in the type of battle and

00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:10,220
it's better that you personal items must

00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:14,389
be used for and working something fast

00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:17,940
welcome to our web page of the song

00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:20,519
begins to those are my responsibility

00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:23,699
attack so digital bedroom if you don't

00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:26,399
get some random they never it's right

00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:29,420
here for many there is a pistol kid from

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:31,680
China just put it on your head don't

00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:35,870
because it's really for something is a

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:39,600
long like an eyeball it could be a

00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:42,870
deceit while a police car engine and

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:46,139
intelligence well Niskanen as though the

00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:48,030
fattest an answer then graph can use

00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:51,020
like people in and out

00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:53,910
just about any other system and

00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:56,130
traditional to use it like isn't nobody

00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:59,100
because it is likely that this was a

00:15:56,130 --> 00:16:01,440
very long time you see customers as you

00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,870
can account when situated version so

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,990
common and then it's best I system learn

00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:09,450
whatever the firm's huge huge number of

00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:11,640
you will be we just were kind of the kid

00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:14,430
movie can be the ticking buzzer mimics

00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:16,440
kind of it and when it's not that it's

00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:21,030
about a filter which is illegal

00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:24,120
everybody said so it is the normal stuff

00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:26,880
you are asking for potential for design

00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:31,460
good for you man your crib I mean rather

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,460
than have to appoint two years ago edit

00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:40,780
well

00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:45,010
learn it but I mature multiple defenders

00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:46,360
I was too busy trying to fix it so let

00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:48,880
our instead we're sitting by a

00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,380
drastically because when I depressing if

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:54,460
you wanna convince you can take a look

00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:57,340
at the condition from aventura you will

00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:59,800
do to Marissa children and she did

00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:01,630
something about everything from the

00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:05,199
recruiter and we have to wait on you

00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:07,540
type of that the product and everybody

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:10,150
you can take a look at what she wears I

00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:12,100
think that there is maybe when you go

00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:14,380
out there and say that they need to come

00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:16,000
so they can contain people changing

00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:18,040
stuff and building fire on the

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,160
resistance initially you can be able to

00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:24,250
come back yet so catch the American

00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:26,740
system now we know that we cannot really

00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:30,880
treasures are level it should work

00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:33,550
mostly so mathematics one psycho

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,760
use compass one I will not discuss about

00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:38,940
ready to destroy people people disagreed

00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:41,940
on I just need to

00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:45,600
ugh much better account yeah ID or

00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:47,690
password security camera crew members

00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,900
else will be likely by determine twisted

00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:52,920
story that's what tired or something so

00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,480
try to get something that you can

00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:57,480
remember try to make sure that you get

00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:01,410
some way to get different as well for

00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:06,930
different services if you can travel

00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:09,120
manager because i am online and services

00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:12,540
on node based on services are inundated

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:15,120
minute so you can get some cheaper

00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:17,460
levels yes I think what parameter is

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:21,330
rocky trying to use it for all together

00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:26,130
under one person home instead so just

00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:28,740
give our people magazine or 20 come on

00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:31,230
person asked to end every box can after

00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:34,050
a year I'd like to dedicate croissants

00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:36,560
my brother you should come try to

00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:39,510
arrange the chicken

00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:41,370
either the thousand years let's let me

00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:43,980
compile some time you need to get that

00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:45,930
home to be older but he of staff gets a

00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,730
cookie of school yet secretly power and

00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:51,660
purpose you go real like what you are

00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:54,420
it's going before magic you can organize

00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:56,670
your hearing and whether you have to go

00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:58,830
in the manga and then we were in summer

00:18:56,670 --> 00:19:03,240
and you want waiting on the word it gets

00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:06,450
a picture or cat well together this is

00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:08,610
educated work on a story and if you can

00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:11,700
try to get some ice computers because my

00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:14,070
friend I mean it's also possible be done

00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:16,860
which is no connected to another it can

00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:18,750
technically neither and when people are

00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:20,640
upset level of sophistication in here

00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:25,020
it's easier to just a few minutes we're

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:27,120
going to do a people standing up i think

00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:33,840
it up and leave for half of the price is

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:37,980
no cover and alliteration you are

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:40,650
semantic search and everything I mean

00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:46,780
using it as looking stuff but using it

00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:50,750
as good in everything you need

00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:52,490
okay maybe it's easier to walk on the

00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:55,160
cookie of the prediction center on your

00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:57,680
weapon but maybe we need to be natural

00:19:55,160 --> 00:20:00,320
positions around without is ready and

00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:02,180
without an award you should need to a

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:05,030
complete unity son was an Air Force and

00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:08,900
ran or ATP several other cheaper just

00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:10,670
one American earth supercomputer which

00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:13,160
is faster now which is by the grace of

00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:17,120
cuties level 10 yards and you will never

00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:19,630
one time won't permit and then you just

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:22,490
need to survive the year and also go on

00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:24,940
so what happened in solution is to come

00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:28,760
to the program that you get all of

00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:31,610
contract negotiation to that there is a

00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:34,190
road trip with education about signaling

00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:37,010
antenna it was yesterday so you can

00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:40,400
imagine time just watch it if magically

00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:43,120
open it youtube / issue every choice

00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:46,730
between here and container for security

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:50,500
discography machine much better the

00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:50,500
relevant world is a commodity

00:20:50,710 --> 00:21:03,080
angels are little with you guys

00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:09,440
you just try to put food in flash ever

00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:12,320
be in disguise I don't katasonych Sigma

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:16,150
did you attend the windows camera with

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:19,790
some super which is quite oneself or

00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:22,520
administration with us wherever we are

00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:24,559
so funny you know security is after the

00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:28,070
business of yours remember well it's a

00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:30,590
brother are green so yeah it's much

00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:33,640
better to be running without her this

00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:33,640
cannot be some minutes

00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:46,250
well for them so I smelled like show

00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:48,230
them and analytics because it was on the

00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:50,030
description below the description with

00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:52,790
other people who think that okay I

00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:56,030
service quality of lgb six I know when

00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:59,300
we'll be able to find well could you

00:21:56,030 --> 00:22:02,090

printer connected to the net go home

00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:17,780
with quite scary the common people are

00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:21,260
twisting the hair that no one mercy at

00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:23,270
levels while is using nzb like when you

00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:26,570
do repent to be on request you see that

00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:29,060
that ipv6 is already by BBC when the

wheels can you and just a list your IP

00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:34,970
addresses may be universal and yet my

friend but you give an ipv6 and the one

00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:41,870

SS version which is delicately people

00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:39,580
other pieces time we will attack because

00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:41,960

leave any trace which is great you need

00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:37,309
to make sure that you sell your document

00:34:32,059 --> 00:34:38,690
which is not right you broke it and it's

00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:41,299
quite severe people are working with

00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:43,909
that there are we are a lot of fees by 5

00:34:41,299 --> 00:34:45,619
has green your arm reach testing and

00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:48,049
working after discussing with your

00:34:45,619 --> 00:34:49,579
knowledge and understanding world all

00:34:48,049 --> 00:34:52,419
the people did you react with

00:34:49,579 --> 00:34:55,429
rudimentary the vertical tasting and

00:34:52,419 --> 00:34:59,299
we should we be doing my thing it just

00:34:55,429 --> 00:35:01,519
before imagination and yet other in the

00:34:59,299 --> 00:35:06,200
sofa tennis or local ethics rather than

00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:09,769
Delta from QC into integral and cookies

00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:11,390
leave in the background and so you have

00:35:09,769 --> 00:35:14,299
to say that for looking on either

00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:16,549
because someone will our land we need to

00:35:14,299 --> 00:35:19,039
come right now there is some catch in

00:35:16,549 --> 00:35:22,489
the kitchen is I don't change you need

00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:24,890
and yeah forget you're looking rather as

00:35:22,489 --> 00:35:27,249
you peace if it just be that someone is

00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:30,890
sending an email using your computer or

00:35:27,249 --> 00:35:33,619
if it's like me preparing to send an

00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:36,079
email two days after so we are just

00:35:33,619 --> 00:35:38,859
using your laughter absolutely animated

00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:42,229
cool on that is not emotional and a

00:35:38,859 --> 00:35:48,049
difference because Melissa an umbrella

00:35:42,229 --> 00:35:50,960
in the same data validity well and

00:35:48,049 --> 00:35:53,430
sometimes you are given a typical person

00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:59,480
in the place while

00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:59,480
I anyone and people can check we can

00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:09,300
chill out after somebody's going to

00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:13,680
become a writer so you see in a pure

00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:17,130
function you can touch it make sure you

00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:19,109
take care of the studio security making

00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:21,569
sure that you can ensure a spider as you

00:36:19,109 --> 00:36:25,380
type of us all you can identify each

00:36:21,569 --> 00:36:28,380
time it sounds a lot of the rainy

00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:31,349
weather you want to get the fire after

00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:35,339
five minutes talking like this as you

00:36:31,349 --> 00:36:37,079
can you can easily trace so crazy the

00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:39,900
cisco know that can be used to inject

00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:42,990
cold in order process it will gradually

00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:45,569
two by as fast as you can be used by

00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:46,260
your accomplice reference to avoid some

00:36:45,569 --> 00:36:49,440
code

00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:52,020
is a child and we compute for them don't

00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:55,170
easily recalled in Turkey or whatever so

00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:59,430
he can be disabled with your s ready Who

00:36:55,170 --> 00:37:04,620
am I and you can win a good one ball and

00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:07,740
two 172 you got something just a bit but

00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:10,110
a body photo shoot digital media pc

00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:12,390
search and most of the time if someone

00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:16,350
is targeting a system in which is my

00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:19,490
case and colonization it's all right i

00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:21,930
want to protect its not the least of

00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:24,660
sadistic website by always good I

00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:28,020
suppose this or this essential key so

00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:29,580
first get the password of the key are

00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:31,680
you going to practice i'll eat each time

00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:33,270
because the word are using the keys not

00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:38,220
that you control the universe is the

00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:40,680
current that is a triangular for money

00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:43,290
because if you forward and understand

00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:46,110
why the semi can use as a former leader

00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:46,820
John to connect and we'd not seat there

00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:49,970
is no

00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:52,040
edition it's quite done um I really

00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:54,830
ready to go to different retail you guys

00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:56,720
are like identify after night you have

00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:59,060
only for the pepper and with a laptop

00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,770
and Gertie are mostly because if

00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:03,380
something is a key is compromised and

00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:05,930
remembered i need women some people are

00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:08,780
weak among genes one key for each server

00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:11,750
elected I think it's commercial but it's

00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:13,340
a few to Google better in any case you

00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:15,560
need to change the key on all your

00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:18,350
nominees because our hands keep your

00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:22,040
password early which is predictable

00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:24,390
permit test two years to break and does

00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:27,059
everything by

00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:29,130
time for that but if you change the key

00:38:27,059 --> 00:38:32,119
maybe six months like let me take

00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:34,410
produced wicket and it will be useless

00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:36,329
so for that you need to walk around with

00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:38,640
a mighty bird each engine which is a lot

00:38:36,329 --> 00:38:43,380
of that you can do again where they tell

00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:45,720
you because assets imagine it's much

00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:48,359
easier just a cheap iPhone or something

00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:50,430
like this you can tell the key on the

00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:53,299
smart car if you go to a doctor wheeler

00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:57,269
it can be quite a cheap and it's like

00:38:53,299 --> 00:39:00,720
you 0 I can Delta G by one if you really

00:38:57,269 --> 00:39:03,930
impressed because we use was not care to

00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:07,019
perform of a typical partition and they

00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:09,180
use that for seven roll Colette's will

00:39:07,019 --> 00:39:11,849
be working best birthday it's the

00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:14,190
chickens for this thing we can take a

00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:17,609
really key are not on a need for the

00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:19,859
year over canisters I will run from the

00:39:17,609 --> 00:39:20,810
mannequin which working well except the

00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:23,510
third

00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:25,520
working on that national plan and let

00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:30,500
you got these icky i won't cooperate so

00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:32,360
it's working it does not like 1103 needs

00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:34,400
to start something of those you can I

00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:36,980
say that you can can do some quick

00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:41,680
aggression and there is a package called

00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:41,680
the symbol GPL it is

00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:55,490
and yes what I found my keys I mean I

00:39:52,339 --> 00:39:58,460
can maybe you regarding TPM and they are

00:39:55,490 --> 00:40:00,829
using a performance basically can't

00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:03,589
access any several anymore and the same

00:40:00,829 --> 00:40:06,819
is a google wrong is a flavoursome it's

00:40:03,589 --> 00:40:09,290
not a great in Ibaraki forum the time

00:40:06,819 --> 00:40:12,079
typically people who may be able to get

00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:14,359
it results and you rather further to get

00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:17,329
my letter and specificity plan to get

00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:21,619
stuff out of the plane so it's quite

00:40:17,329 --> 00:40:24,020
security first good again and where are

00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:27,140
you from a distance this sub security is

00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:30,050
not anything you as a confusing issue

00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:32,210
which is relegated as soon as the to use

00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:34,309
your potential or you access to do

00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:36,260
something but you are not supposed to do

00:40:34,309 --> 00:40:39,140
like arising because the back alcohol

00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:43,579
per canister we still need to add seven

00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:44,700
separation so radically first minute so

00:40:43,579 --> 00:40:48,960
don't be concerned

00:40:44,700 --> 00:41:02,910
with it you need to start a new console

00:40:48,960 --> 00:41:06,000
because there's someone where everybody

00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:09,000
on this mission are there are you need

00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:12,000
to make it all else could be hurt so if

00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:16,290
someone wants to delay it for the system

00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:18,720
like okay or something so if you see

00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:22,380
something you can prevent the beginning

00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:24,329
or forgiven you can use regular to

00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:27,210
repair your cotton and machine learning

00:41:24,329 --> 00:41:28,980
and events magazine but only at four in

00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:32,369
the morning as well if you're away from

00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:36,869
camera ready suspicious whereas it's

00:41:32,369 --> 00:41:41,300
completely freely and without using in

00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:41,300
the nervous system like you're here

00:41:56,180 --> 00:42:07,080
and sorry about everything so you need

00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:09,720
my mother I believe in better form and

00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:13,140
why do you need to do that make sure

00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:16,260
this is activity because it's classical

00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:18,450
Latin resident evil 7 sitting somewhere

00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:21,150
in the passenger and 15 and will if I

00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:23,730
didn't confess that it's bad because the

00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:27,030
rich people funny just take one disc and

00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:31,740
wrongly ran away so you do see that one

00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:33,810
right Olivia and the data and when the

00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:36,359
cookie they can put it back and since

00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:40,380
the one read the news alerts and didn't

00:42:36,359 --> 00:42:54,700
explain you will not see the trouble

00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:59,079
and I never went on record to say

00:42:54,700 --> 00:43:01,180
monoculars an argument I think that is

00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:06,999
it free software's own candy show they

00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:09,700
are in for drastic register it's

00:43:06,999 --> 00:43:14,079
paper if you kinda can find user with an

00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:16,089
ecosystem you can go over three and then

00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:19,809
you need to Gramercy or Africa per

00:43:16,089 --> 00:43:23,170
credit I'm Erica like to use your

00:43:19,809 --> 00:43:25,359
average see you suddenly you are doing

00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:27,789
some web stuff either the position

00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:32,710
drumming or suddenly someone is praying

00:43:27,789 --> 00:43:37,539
or one person as well because killer

00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:41,190
when you mrs. did on your record so yeah

00:43:37,539 --> 00:43:41,190
it can be quite nice to get anywhere

00:43:45,670 --> 00:44:13,180
so all set well I think the concept

00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:26,690
passport can you recommend some so much

00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:28,390
Wickham and I would be wrong to people

00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:32,480
to use something which is free software

00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:34,190
maintain an equation which are you

00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,540
surfing which

00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:38,640
because I think I'm not too different

00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:40,650
for my control and some infrastructure

00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:44,730
to be Aaron so infrastructure maintained

00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:47,130
as small as a user password replication

00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:48,869
feature on fire efforts are it seems to

00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:50,730
be working quite well and they say that

00:44:48,869 --> 00:44:54,119
everything is an amputee on my side so

00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:59,460
that's good I reaching the lower pass if

00:44:54,119 --> 00:45:02,070
you get under Jimmy G which is great but

00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:04,440
I knew first paragraph that's not bad

00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:14,970
because it's nothing like a good example

00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:17,790
of putting my world and little device we

00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:20,340
can't use any issue with people who wear

00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:23,550
well not standard 10-year walking piece

00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:25,920
of crap people using the product key

00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:28,240
people for making money and the people

00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:31,980
are incorrect something

00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,980
the quinoa food as a typical

00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:39,130
he talks where but I think we need to

00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:39,130
get something which is your to use

00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:47,120
religion get Commission those words are

00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:50,710
many dimensions and our matrix is

00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:50,710
another that is

00:45:55,410 --> 00:46:01,620
you heard that some of you and this

00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:10,120
there are living with Griffin I'm just

00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:13,420
saying if you'd rather hypocrite our

00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:18,690
accountant to the finding that you know

00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:18,690
me to live when you can prove that

00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:27,660
so the time is very consider for secure

00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:27,660
City from Raja

00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:34,570
because I wanted to test on services and

00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:37,210
the resolution and the resisting and

00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:39,930
disease for Sarah because our
