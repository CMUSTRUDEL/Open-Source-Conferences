Title: Flock 2016 - Ensuring ABI stability in Fedora, Sinny Kumari and Dodji Seketeli
Publication date: 2016-08-21
Playlist: Flock 2016
Description: 
	In this talk we will give an overview of what Libabigail is and what tools it provides to do ABI analysis of your C/C++ applications. The talk aims to explain why performing ABI checks in packages shipped with Fedora is important. A Fedora packager attending the talk will be able to ensure that her package is ABI stable with very less effort. We will talk about how and why ABI checks are enabled for Fedora package updates pushed in bodhi and how a package maintainer should respond to it. Finally, we'll also talk about upcoming features in libabigail which will be useful for Fedora.
