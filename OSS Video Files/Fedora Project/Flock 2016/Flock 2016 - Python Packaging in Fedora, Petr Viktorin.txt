Title: Flock 2016 - Python Packaging in Fedora, Petr Viktorin
Publication date: 2016-08-21
Playlist: Flock 2016
Description: 
	Even though Fedora Workstation 23 shipped without Python 2 installed by default, the full transition to Python 3 is still going on. How are we doing on that? What still needs to be done, both upstream and in Fedora? And how you can help? And more importantly – how are we making life easier for future packagers? Now that Copr can build RPMs directly from the Python Package Index, will getting a Python library into Fedora be less of a chore? And how will system-python – an effort to slim down minimal installs – affect Python packaging?
