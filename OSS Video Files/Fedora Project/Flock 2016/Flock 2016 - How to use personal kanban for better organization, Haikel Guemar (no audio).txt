As a Fedora developer, we have a lot to keep track on, with a limited time if it's not your $DAYJOB. Personal Kanban borrows from Lean principles without enforcing a heavyweight process like erm Scrum. No ceremonial, only two simple rules: visualize your tasks and limit your work in process. Then, you'll get better to track your tasks, expectations and commitments. It also means less context switches and improved life quality. You'll learn how to do more and better with the same time (or even less!)
