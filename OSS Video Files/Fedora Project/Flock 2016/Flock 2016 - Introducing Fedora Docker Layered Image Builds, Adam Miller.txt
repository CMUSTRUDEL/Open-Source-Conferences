Publication date: 2016-08-21
Playlist: Flock 2016
Description: 
	In this session we will discuss what the Docker Layered Image Build Service is and what it provides to Fedora Contributors as well as how it caters to the goals of Fedora.Next and now the Fedora Modularization initiative. We will also show examples of how Fedora Contributors can use the service via Koji in a consistent manner as for RPM builds via the fedpkg utility. We will also do a dive into how the system is created with technologies such as Koji, OpenShift, osbs-client tools, atomic-reactor, fedpkg, and distgit namespacing.
