	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,650
waiting for our fearless leader Matthew

00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:16,170
Dora thank you can everybody hear me

00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:18,840
without a microphone awesome no awesome

00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:21,660
I will try and speak somewhat loudly all

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,240
right this is my state of fedora talk

00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:27,840
how many people here were at Def Con in

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,720
February okay so much of the room so

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,009
some of the numbers may be repeats for

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,760
you I've tried to update a lot of the

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:38,040
data but this is essentially the ongoing

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,059
state of fedora talk that I do and some

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:44,129
of it may seem very familiar to you

00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:49,070
although now we are in Cracow I'm also

00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:49,070
curious for whom is this the first flock

00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:57,539
welcome everybody someone this is

00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:00,059
concerned with getting new contributors

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:03,270
into fedora so I'm glad to see that

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:05,970
you're here so I'd like to start out

00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:08,100
with some press quotes and although we

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,990
had good press for Fedora 24 and none of

00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,390
them had glowing quotes to pull here so

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:15,630
here are my glowing quotes from Fedor 22

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:18,720
in Fedora 23 and both of these are of

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:21,840
note because especially the register

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,119
here is a very snarky trait magazine the

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,729
tens didn't have almost always find

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:28,799
something negative to say but in their

00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:31,530
review here of us that basically is

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,460
glowing so I I'm gonna keep highlighting

00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:38,009
this I think it's it's pretty exciting

00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:39,750
and then the main part of my

00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:42,810
presentation here is basically a bunch

00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:45,780
of numbers and I a lot of these are

00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:48,119
pulled together from our mirror and data

00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,380
we don't do any intrusive monitoring of

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:51,570
Fedora users at all there's no a

00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,680
tracking cookie or anything that follows

00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,799
you around and make sure that you're

00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:58,140
counted which means that we're kind of

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,880
doing like a wildlife sampling and

00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,560
trying to figure out what's going on

00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,930
from looking at binoculars from a

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,600
distance one of the ways we do that is

00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,360
by looking at connections

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,569
a mirror server and so I have promised

00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:13,340
Steve smoochin that when I talk about

00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:16,130
these numbers I prefaced them with a

00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,720
scary dinosaur listen it doesn't look so

00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:21,110
scary but a whole herd of them will just

00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,700
get you the important things to know are

00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:24,739
that again because we're not tracking

00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,660
there's a lot of differences in networks

00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:30,110
that will really influence how these

00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:32,360
results look like so network address

00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:34,280
translation means that a lot of

00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,640
different systems can be counted only as

00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,560
one system and changing IP addresses it

00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,870
happens that a lot of ISPs change your

00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,000
IP address multiple times a day that

00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,230
might be over counted and there's a lot

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,230
of other things that could cause

00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:52,250
confusion but I think the general trends

00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:54,590
can be basically counted on and so this

00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:56,630
is a slightly confusing chart but this

00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:59,780
is basically those connections for the

00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:05,420
last five releases here going from the

00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:08,720
green fedora 20 in this left over to put

00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:10,190
over 20 for rising there and that's the

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,959
important thing to see is we've got a

00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,910
general upward trend with each release

00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:16,160
being more popular than the last and

00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:18,440
we've got a very nice quick start for

00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,799
our 24 with it already being more

00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:23,120
popular than 22 and I think you know by

00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:25,370
the end of the summer it's going to be

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:30,310
the release that most Fedora users are

00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:30,310
running so I think that is very nice

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,880
when we look at the absolute numbers

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,470
which I don't have a slide for it was

00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,880
actually kind of a leveling off which

00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:40,430
I'm a little concerned with but I'm

00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:43,549
hoping it's kind of a summer downturn

00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:46,970
we'll see what happens at this talk next

00:03:43,549 --> 00:03:48,590
year when I have what those numbers look

00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:50,750
like but right now things are very

00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:52,430
positive looking so everybody who worked

00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:56,019
on this release last couple releases you

00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:56,019
should give yourself a hand good job

00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:03,600
so on this is the other metric that

00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,520
people often ask about and that's I so

00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,440
download so this is basically just a raw

00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,600
count over time of every day how many

00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,890
times people are downloading their

00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,500
release and I think the interesting

00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:15,450
thing about this is after a big peak

00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,280
when when we have a first release it's

00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:20,190
basically just a constant amount over

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,720
there so the number of downloads happens

00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:25,500
to basically correspond to how long that

00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:28,830
release lasts so 21 and 22 there's total

00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:31,290
of about 800,000 downloads and it's like

00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:34,620
a million for 23 because it was a longer

00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:36,420
cycle there and if you look back at the

00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,940
previous two releases which were about a

00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:41,520
year cycle each those were like 1.2

00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:43,830
million each so it's kind of a constant

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,680
thing although there's a spike we don't

00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:48,090
necessarily have a big uptick I'm just

00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,260
because we have a new release so I think

00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,910
that's an interesting thing to think

00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:53,190
about as we're doing marketing and

00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:55,290
looking a little bit more marketing

00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:57,320
fedora as a whole rather than marketing

00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:59,760
just what's in the latest release

00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,830
another thing you're probably noticing

00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,600
here is that there's a definite downward

00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:05,760
trend here and that actually also comes

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,910
off to the left that's higher as well

00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:10,980
where it's cut off I believe that this

00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,720
is because we've made upgrades so much

00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:14,280
easier so there's no need to download an

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,950
ISO in order to go to the next release

00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:21,450
on the other hand I would love to see

00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:27,300
this going up despite that so there it

00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:28,980
is and this is a breakdown of the

00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,900
different Kaduri editions and what

00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:32,790
percentage of the downloads are

00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:37,350
presented there so this is downloads

00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:38,880
again not connections and I have also a

00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:40,860
slide with all the different spins

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,800
included here so which gets a little bit

00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:46,110
crazy so what first if this one would

00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,890
just let just the main additions that we

00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:51,600
promote and obviously you can see

00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:53,010
workstation is about you know 70% of the

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,760
downloads there but we've got a pretty

00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:58,710
solid download set for server for blah

00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,790
blah blah reasons this actually ends in

00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,170
January and doesn't

00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:03,210
not been updated for the last half a

00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:06,180
year but it looks to me like the trend

00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:08,190
basically continues like this one of the

00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,780
interesting things is this gray bit

00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:12,480
there we didn't have a network installer

00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:14,280
for a workstation earlier and when we

00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:16,950
introduced that it instantly became very

00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,210
popular and it kind of takes a little

00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:20,280
bit of a chunk out of the server

00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:22,320
installs because people were using the

00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,270
server and that ISO in order to get a

00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,050
workstation install and once it was

00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:37,650
available

00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:40,140
they stopped people were using the

00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:41,790
server yeah it didn't take a bite out

00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:46,050
people didn't stop using the server not

00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:50,340
install very much it's true but yeah

00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:52,440
that's a good point yeah it looks like

00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,880
the net with us I attributed it to

00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,510
people switching from the server net

00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:59,820
install but the point is that actually

00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:01,920
that doesn't decrease it's just the net

00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,600
install increases so I don't know I

00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,040
don't have a good answer to that the

00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,200
other thing that I think is very

00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,150
interesting here as you can see atomic

00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:13,170
is this tiny green band round there and

00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:14,730
those are very small numbers but again

00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:17,100
these are downloads of basically the

00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:20,520
install media and or the or in that case

00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:22,830
of that it's the launch Bowl media and

00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,760
because these are cloud instances it's

00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:26,310
really hard to tell the difference

00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,900
between one first and downloaded ran at

00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:30,120
one time or they downloaded it and

00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:33,600
didn't run it at all or they downloaded

00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:35,010
it and ran it a million times and it

00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,960
happens I had a conversation with a

00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:40,230
large Internet company that you have

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,370
heard of at Red Hat summit and they came

00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:44,310
up and we're asking me some questions

00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:45,780
and about further atomic and then they

00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:47,760
said but they've been actually running

00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:50,310
it in production for about six months

00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:52,710
and I said oh that's interesting at what

00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:54,870
kind of scale and they said Oh at all

00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:57,810
the scale and this is a company where

00:07:54,870 --> 00:08:00,720
all the scale is it may be the most

00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:04,320
popular Fedora running at all right now

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:07,180
so so the look the little line doesn't

00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:09,759
necessarily tell tell the whole story

00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:11,620
ah yeah actually surprised that we have

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,940
that many cloud emblems because it seems

00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,530
like the most people getting the powder

00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:16,509
different would actually get it directly

00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:17,770
from Amazon or Ebay

00:08:16,509 --> 00:08:19,389
so one of the reasons we have a lot of

00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:22,180
cloud amp Della's first of all there's

00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:23,860
people running it in OpenStack and the

00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:25,810
other thing is that this is our only

00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,039
vagrant image we currently produce the

00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:29,320
people who are looking for a vagrant

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:31,810
image are directed to the cloud image so

00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:35,500
that is that is the bulk of the spot

00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:37,029
download images and I would actually I

00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,740
think we should make those for the other

00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:40,510
editions as well but we haven't

00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:43,089
currently so that that's what's going on

00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:44,200
there you probably can't hear me so well

00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:45,550
if I turn this way so I'm going to try

00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,430
and stop doing that and I'll try and

00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:49,720
look at my slides down here but

00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:51,459
something's little lines are very hard

00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,380
to see on a small screen so this is all

00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:56,260
of the different spins there you can see

00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:58,870
although the individual other spins are

00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:01,209
not never hugely popular although with

00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:04,089
KDE being the largest at about five

00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:05,350
percent band across there the aggregate

00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:07,149
you know the net result of all these

00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:09,100
different things does add up to a lot of

00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:11,620
various interests I think that's kind of

00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:15,580
a cool thing that we have I think the

00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:17,589
breakdown here was 4% KDE and then LXDE

00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:22,390
and Xfce are about two and a half

00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:24,130
percent each but I know that those are

00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:30,190
very passionate two and a half percent

00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:31,630
so that's okay so I also have some

00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:34,540
external numbers which I think are very

00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:36,580
interesting as well so one of the the

00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:39,310
main target for fedora workstation is

00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:41,470
software developers and it happens that

00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:43,260
the site Stack Exchange who's familiar

00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:46,180
with Stack Overflow

00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:50,079
awesome everybody great who's not

00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:52,029
familiar with this yes so QA site

00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:53,829
targeted at developers they do an annual

00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:56,230
survey and one of the questions they ask

00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:59,350
what is your preferred desktop operating

00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:01,510
system and so this year their survey

00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:04,450
results came out and it's pretty cool

00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:06,670
it's good for Linux at 21 something

00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:08,170
percent and that's actually a game for

00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:10,870
any up a percent from last year

00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:14,740
Windows is slowly creeping down to no

00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:17,620
longer be the majority just a plurality

00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:20,260
OS X is also growing there so this is

00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:23,800
cool for Linux if we break that down

00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:25,270
this is from a year ago the breakdown by

00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:29,050
which Linux distributions are there

00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:32,260
fedora is in the top four that is to say

00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:35,709
we are the fourth of the top four but we

00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:38,770
gonna name showing at least now and

00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:40,570
there's some reasons that this it's not

00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:43,240
a huge surprise fedora has had a

00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:45,190
reputation of being harder to use fast

00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,170
moving and you can't get your media

00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:50,860
there but we would really like to see

00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:52,660
that growing and so this year survey I

00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:55,570
would love to say wow look we doubled it

00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:58,690
we are up a little bit but it's kind of

00:10:55,570 --> 00:11:00,520
noise so I feel like this is a part

00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:03,490
where we really have some work to do in

00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:04,810
the marketing and outreach to software

00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:06,790
developers if we're going to keep

00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:09,279
pursuing the strategy of trying to grow

00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:10,570
in software developer space and it's not

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,399
necessary that we want to compete with

00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:13,630
the other other Lennox's there this

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,550
isn't percentage of Linux this is

00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:18,100
percentage of everything if abouttwo has

00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:23,950
12% and we have 20% I'll be perfectly

00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:26,680
happy so but I would really like to see

00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:27,300
us see that number going up in the

00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,220
future

00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:31,750
and it's actually there's a lot of

00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:34,690
questions in this survey and they have a

00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:36,250
full data anonymize data dump of it so

00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:37,660
if there's interesting questions we can

00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:40,209
have about what other technologies

00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:42,010
people like what areas we can grow in I

00:11:40,209 --> 00:11:44,500
think analyzing that data might be a fun

00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:46,029
project for somebody I was starting to

00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,160
do it but then I realized that would be

00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:49,720
like a PhD thesis for me and I have

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,880
other other things I should be doing

00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:55,410
instead so but if anybody else wants to

00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:59,529
do a project like that come talk to me

00:11:55,410 --> 00:12:02,200
all right so those were numbers

00:11:59,529 --> 00:12:04,899
basically about the operating system

00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,810
itself but Fedora is obviously you

00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:11,350
people more than it is just the

00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:12,700
Downloads so I tried to answer some

00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:14,079
questions about this and if you saw the

00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,450
dev comp talk you saw some of these

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:19,630
things about this these numbers are not

00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:22,570
updated from there but some of the other

00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:25,070
numbers coming up will be here so as

00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:27,230
people probably know we have a message

00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:29,870
we're basically a lot of the activity

00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:31,880
you do in Fedora causes something to be

00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:34,100
generated that can be responded to by

00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,930
other applications or other people and

00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,850
basically most of our online

00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:40,760
applications are hooked up to this and

00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:42,710
so when I wanted to count like what are

00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,480
the active contributors in Fedora I said

00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:45,830
okay well take a look at that and see

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,320
what we could see and I particularly

00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:50,690
looked at certain areas which are easy

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,720
to count ones where an actual human

00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:55,340
being caused the event and rather than

00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,500
it wasn't a bot that has mentioned that

00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:59,180
person or some sort of event or related

00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,610
to a person that wasn't due their action

00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:03,710
and so the three areas that I kind of

00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:06,590
narrowed down from that being possible

00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:10,250
our first editing the wiki page which is

00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:12,140
straightforward and but it's important

00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:14,360
everybody here knows our wiki is not

00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:16,670
like the arch wiki where it's dedicated

00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:19,100
just to documentation this doesn't mean

00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:21,500
this section here doesn't represent Docs

00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,850
writers there represents people do using

00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,790
it as a workspace in all sorts of

00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:27,440
different areas QA and ambassadors and

00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:29,300
everything else where the wiki is kind

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,190
of our workspace

00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:34,280
the other one is Bodhi which is

00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:36,230
basically somebody gave feedback on a on

00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,810
an update and here I'm only counting

00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:40,100
logged in users with your fast name so

00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:42,620
there's anonymous updates too but those

00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:44,120
aren't getting counted and then finally

00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:47,150
in this littler circle here that's

00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:49,850
packagers who basically were you did at

00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:52,460
least one commit to just get made an

00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:54,920
update to a package there and so I think

00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:57,260
it's interesting that there's a lot of

00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:59,660
non overlap between those things and I

00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:01,340
think this means probably that because

00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,870
these are three random things I could

00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:05,540
sample I know there's a lot of areas

00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:07,580
like translations which aren't counted

00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:09,470
here and a lot of ambassador activity so

00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:12,020
when I say there's 2,000 plus

00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:13,940
contributors here that's 2,000 plus in

00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:16,430
the easily measured area so I think we'd

00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:18,440
probably have I probably twice that in

00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:21,290
terms of active contributors in the air

00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:23,150
to fedora and I happen to do this on a

00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:24,860
year basis so I'll probably update these

00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:27,740
numbers for the next Def Con and we'll

00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:29,120
see how we've got changes here I would

00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:31,250
like to measure more things I know

00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,540
senada the translation think recently

00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:35,850
got hooked up but it does not generate

00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:38,910
with usernames that I can easily measure

00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:40,529
here so that might be some fed message

00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:42,089
hacking to get more things hooked up for

00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:44,100
me to count if you have an area you

00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:51,089
think I should be tempting that's the

00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:53,490
place to start and I also took basically

00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:56,310
the top 10% here is a different

00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:58,769
presentation and it kind of has the same

00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:00,600
overall overall picture of ratio of

00:14:58,769 --> 00:15:02,519
people there and I'll talk more about

00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,560
that top 10% of contributors in a little

00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:06,060
bit but one thing I wanted to mention

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,279
here if you have not seen this slide

00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:10,380
before this is one of my favorite ones

00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:12,750
does it keep getting asked by people

00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:14,490
basically inside and outside Red Hat you

00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:16,410
know how much of the work on Fedora is

00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:17,970
being done just by Red Hat is this a

00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:21,779
really a Red Hat thing worth one or two

00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:24,000
external contributors or is this yeah so

00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:26,550
I analyzed that top 10 percent which

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,220
basically is the people who do about 2/3

00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:31,440
of the work and I did not do this with a

00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,850
script because I could knock some of

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,500
them off easily but some of them I

00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:36,630
basically went through name by name and

00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,940
identified if that person is a red

00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:41,310
Hatter or not because it turns out that

00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:43,139
there's this blue area here which I have

00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:45,420
to explain myself it's not actually

00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:47,130
sneaky if you look there you'll find

00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:50,160
that I am actually Mac p.m. at Mac DM

00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:52,500
gud or not at Fedora project org and

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,569
that's because I had all these filters

00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,760
set up for my email before I started

00:15:54,569 --> 00:15:58,589
working for Red Hat and they filtered

00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:01,050
out my Fedora email very nicely and I

00:15:58,589 --> 00:16:03,149
didn't want to redo that so there's a

00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:05,100
lot of people who are redditors now but

00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:06,300
were visible in the community before it

00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,279
came to Red Hat and that's generally

00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,949
what this nine percent here represents

00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:14,310
not really people trying to not proud of

00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:16,860
being a red hat er so but the basic

00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:19,620
number here is really we've got two

00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:22,050
external contributors in the core of

00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:26,689
people doing most of the work in fedora

00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:26,689
for everyone red Hatter which I think

00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:39,420
okay now I have geeky breakdowns of

00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:42,500
where this came from so this this is

00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:45,420
basically a chart of the messages of

00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:49,380
when is this this is the Bodhi feedback

00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:52,079
here over time for the past three years

00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:55,170
here two and a half years and basically

00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:56,399
this is the yeah then of the number of

00:16:55,170 --> 00:17:01,380
people per week

00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:07,140
and this is the 1% and next 10% and so

00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:08,610
on there basically and I put these on

00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:11,280
the same scale here so you can kind of

00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:14,100
see so there are a lot more people who

00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:16,410
actually make changes per week even even

00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:18,480
though the number the number of actual

00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:21,089
people involved overall in Bodhi it was

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,980
higher there's just a lot of changes to

00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:25,610
packages all the time as we all probably

00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:27,959
know and there's the wiki edits as well

00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:30,030
and here's the part where I got to where

00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:32,190
I got to the 2/3 number and this

00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:35,190
basically holds true for all across all

00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:37,950
the different things here we're

00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:39,690
basically of the people who are in like

00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:43,770
a rolling window of the people who did

00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:47,159
who are responsible for one for the top

00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:49,770
top percentage of the messages you can

00:17:47,159 --> 00:17:51,390
basically can see the top 1% here does

00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:52,770
somewhere around 20 percent of the work

00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:54,960
so there are a lot of people who are

00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:56,370
very very busy and I'm sure you will be

00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,750
able to guess a lot of those names if

00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:59,340
you think of somebody you see all the

00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:02,929
time doing everything it's one of those

00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:05,040
people but this next 10% ends up doing

00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:06,840
basically about 2/3 of the work which I

00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,640
actually think is a pretty good ratio

00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,320
when I started to look at this I was

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:14,820
afraid we'd see something more like 90

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:16,200
10 or even 8020 so it's pretty good I'm

00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,900
it'd be kind of nice to see if we could

00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,340
expand the long tail and have more of

00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:22,679
the work done by thousands of other

00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:25,380
people but it's still in you know the

00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:27,090
300 people doing that there are still

00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:31,380
pretty big numbers that's a good core

00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:35,720
group so there's some interesting spikes

00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:38,350
here these big spikes here our package

00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:40,520
our math the math rebuilds we're

00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:42,290
basically somebody in release

00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,960
engineering rebuilt everything so they

00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:48,640
get credit for that that is good right

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:51,410
that is being done by a rel ang user now

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,420
this data set counts the rel ends user

00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:56,660
as a human even though I didn't count in

00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:59,210
that 300 but I actually put it in as a

00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:00,860
in my black list of bots for the next

00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:04,850
time I run this and I tried to rerun it

00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:07,790
not a broke data grabber so so that's

00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:10,340
not updated to show that but that's

00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:13,790
what's going on there and there's one

00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:16,220
other one that has a funny spike here

00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:18,110
these drop pads here what you're seeing

00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:20,540
here is Christmas vacation Christmas

00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:24,380
vacation Christmas vacation there every

00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:26,530
year where people tend to do a lot less

00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:29,870
work across the whole food court there

00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:32,030
and you can see in the packages here

00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:34,880
particularly the casual contributors

00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:35,960
drop out during Christmas which makes

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,760
sense if you're making you know an

00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,210
update to one packet to a package once a

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,370
year

00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:45,410
odds of you doing it and crispy on your

00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:47,510
vacation smaller right exactly but

00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:51,830
people I was going to know the people

00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:55,100
here down here Peter is working 24/7 and

00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:58,240
Dennis and a lot of other people update

00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,240
things no matter what and it

00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:08,610
so this one is basically broken down in

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,860
percentage by and the colors are

00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:13,830
different here this is basically the

00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:16,260
green are actions by people who are new

00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:18,390
in this week the yellow is people who

00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:20,280
are new in this month but not the week

00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:23,400
and the green of the red is people who

00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:26,160
are renewed this year at least and then

00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:28,320
the blue is people who have been active

00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:31,410
for more than a year so we've got a

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,720
constant you know influx of new people

00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:36,720
here all the time this is in the Bodhi

00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:38,580
feedback here but a pretty large

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,190
majority of this is done by people who

00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:43,320
have been around for at least a year and

00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:44,820
in the packet see this is the release

00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:48,420
engineering user by the way when it was

00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:50,940
created that caused that splain in

00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:53,550
general though the packaging in

00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:55,470
particular like ninety ninety percent of

00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:57,300
the packaging is done by people who have

00:20:55,470 --> 00:21:00,060
been around for more of the year more

00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:01,890
than the year but that's kind of a hard

00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:04,890
technical skill so it's not completely

00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:07,440
surprising and vitamin I should mention

00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:09,720
that been around for means mention in

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,970
this data set so people could have been

00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:14,490
Fedora contributors for five years but

00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:16,500
it's the it's the activity by someone

00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:18,390
who started that year that is counting

00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,190
here so it would be kind of nice to get

00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:22,890
some of them get more of new users into

00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:27,480
the packaging group in particular and

00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:29,400
then wiki as you might expect to see has

00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:32,640
a lower barrier to entry and more newer

00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:36,200
users there and we should have a special

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,200
shout out to Patrick

00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:45,700
I can't pronounce his last name because

00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:51,940
I think that nobody I don't think he can

00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:53,380
pronounce his own last name it's right

00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:55,990
because the closest I can get my now

00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:58,360
it's horribly wrong so we've been under

00:21:55,990 --> 00:22:01,990
attacked by spammers in the wiki and so

00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:04,000
you may know that if you are not in at

00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:05,890
least one additional fedora a group of

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,799
some sort you cannot edit the wiki right

00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:10,630
now which is kind of unfortunate

00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:11,530
although because it is sort of a group

00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:14,500
workspace

00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:15,789
it doesn't really impede continued

00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,770
contributors to fit or as much as it

00:22:15,789 --> 00:22:21,669
might if it were really meant to be easy

00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:23,530
to get to resource but I think it's kind

00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:25,780
of a problem and I don't know a good way

00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:28,720
around it but we've done a good job of

00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:31,870
at least keeping that down to zero for

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:37,299
the past couple weeks early zero that

00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:39,190
were visible to me okay and I'm gonna

00:22:37,299 --> 00:22:40,659
try and not use all my time on numbers

00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:44,110
here but I also wanted to mention or a

00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:46,030
fedora magazine this is also something

00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:47,770
that's been very successful and this

00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:49,390
thing that these are just basically paid

00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:51,370
you for months and the important thing

00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:54,010
is we've got a nice upward trend here

00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:55,809
the red dots are when there was a Fedora

00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:58,480
release that month so you can see those

00:22:55,809 --> 00:23:00,190
are obviously gonna be Peaks but there's

00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,360
a general trend in growth as well and

00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:04,000
there's been if you've been following

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,830
the content a lot of growth and really

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,400
good solid articles that are really

00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:11,620
useful to people there so I'm really

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,850
excited for and proud elleven thankful T

00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:19,030
everybody's been working on for our

00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:23,080
magazine so that's the end of my number

00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:25,240
section I'll have some room for

00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:29,650
questions at the end I think but we'll

00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:31,600
go ahead and see how this goes last time

00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:33,010
at Def at DEFCON five had about three

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,200
minutes to rush through the big goals

00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:37,690
section so I'll try and give myself a

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,390
little more time here the important

00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:41,410
thing is that I do not set the goals for

00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:43,300
fedora I

00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:45,220
have a name leader in my title but

00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:47,290
really what I try to do and what we as

00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:49,690
put our leadership in the fedora Council

00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:51,640
try to do is discern the collective

00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:53,170
goals of basically everyone here in this

00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:55,060
room and everyone who couldn't be here

00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:59,230
today in the Fedora contributor

00:23:55,060 --> 00:24:01,300
community so yeah it's it's you guys who

00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:02,860
set the goals and actually as I was

00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,060
going through the things I say okay you

00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:06,160
know that's important I should mention

00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:08,050
that I realized that most of these

00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:11,320
correspond to talks that are happening

00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:13,060
at this conference which means I think

00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,410
things are going going exactly as they

00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:16,600
should be that's what this conference is

00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:18,280
for and it means that these aren't just

00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,570
ideas that I pulled out of my head but

00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:23,350
they're ideas that we're all working

00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:25,360
together on the first one is basically

00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:27,370
that the release train is going to keep

00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:30,510
going we're going to have four twenty

00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:33,250
five released in you know October ish

00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:35,380
November that kind of thing and we

00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:38,050
really want to stick to this idea of

00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:40,630
having an October release and a may

00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:42,220
release every every year so that you can

00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:45,220
know that that's going to be the cadence

00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:47,110
of what Fedora does and if we happen to

00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:48,790
slip in one release will make the next

00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:50,860
really short to make up for it this is

00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:53,830
kind of a new policy and next in the

00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:55,360
last last couple of releases even though

00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:57,310
it's sort of the nominally been the

00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,070
policy but really trying to stick to it

00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:01,540
as a new experiment we're doing I think

00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:03,880
it's gonna be okay

00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:05,680
this particular release is kind of rush

00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:10,420
because that's the consequences of doing

00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:13,810
that so we'll see how that comes out but

00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:16,120
I and I think probably most people here

00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:19,330
know what the basic features are going

00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:21,070
in this release if this were I talked to

00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:23,620
a general audience I probably dwell in

00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:26,320
those a bit more there are some talks

00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:28,060
about the release process Dennis Gilmore

00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,580
has a talk about getting things into

00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:32,890
fedora and Ralph bean has a talk about a

00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:35,320
thing called factory 2.0 which is

00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:36,910
basically upgrading this to a diesel

00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,780
engine of some sort or maybe like an

00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:40,870
electric

00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:45,050
it's gonna be awesome

00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:46,730
what's that maglev maglev awesome that's

00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:48,050
why we're going away next generation I

00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:53,090
thought it's 2.0 we're gonna wreck the

00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:55,520
10 point Oh or something so one of the

00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:57,800
really big things here I think is this

00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,990
idea called modularity and this is

00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:01,610
something that started at flock four

00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:03,320
years ago or maybe a little before that

00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:07,100
but I had a talk at flock there about

00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:09,890
this idea called fedora rings and I had

00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:12,050
I think this Lego slide was in that talk

00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:17,000
and it's been carried forward ever since

00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:19,670
because everybody loves Lego and at Def

00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,980
Con I basically said this should be the

00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:23,480
year where we can do it stop talking

00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,350
about this so much and actually get to

00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:27,110
show and tell

00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:28,720
and I'm really excited Langdon white is

00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:30,890
going to be active doing a show-and-tell

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,720
presentation so if you're interested in

00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:35,150
this how we're gonna put the

00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,130
distribution together in the future I

00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:38,780
think you should go to that talk it's

00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:41,060
gonna be very exciting and it's actually

00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:44,510
not just abstract concepts but actual

00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:46,430
working demo it's pretty cool and a lot

00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:48,350
of the things the idea that a module is

00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:50,600
something that's not an RPM it's bigger

00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:52,910
than an RPM but you can actually put it

00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:54,890
together in a workflow that looks very

00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:59,300
much like what you do to put together a

00:26:54,890 --> 00:27:00,890
package so there's a disc atlandis a

00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:02,630
mechanisms that we use for packaging

00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:05,420
will be used for making a module and I

00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:07,610
think the goal is to open it up so it's

00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:09,320
not just an elite few who make fedora

00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:11,330
modules but we have a whole contributor

00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:16,820
community to making modules just like we

00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:19,610
have for packages now another big thing

00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:21,410
that I am interested in is a university

00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:23,360
outreach goal and this is again going

00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:26,540
back to new users and maybe attracting

00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:28,370
the next generation of developers this

00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:29,840
is something that has been we've been

00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:31,760
talking about for a while but has not

00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,920
quite picked up steam so I hope that

00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,900
this is the conference where we get that

00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:38,570
steam going and gets back to the train

00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:41,480
metaphors of picking up steam justin

00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:47,429
Florey and Jana it's I hate prints your

00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:51,169
name have it talked about that

00:27:47,429 --> 00:27:55,019
and I forget what day that time but

00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:57,599
Justin Florrie today today awesome there

00:27:55,019 --> 00:27:59,729
you are yes talk today about that so I'm

00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:01,320
excited to see how how that goes as well

00:27:59,729 --> 00:28:02,940
because I think we really need to make

00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:05,369
sure we keep getting young people into

00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:07,200
Fedora or else it's gonna end up being

00:28:05,369 --> 00:28:10,679
an old people's distribution which is

00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,659
not what we want to be another one over

00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:16,739
outreach efforts is this Vidura loves

00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:18,989
Python marathon Tech has a talk about

00:28:16,739 --> 00:28:20,849
this this is kind of a marketing idea

00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:23,609
again we'd said we're going to try and

00:28:20,849 --> 00:28:24,809
address the needs of developers and in

00:28:23,609 --> 00:28:26,700
talking about that in Fedor our

00:28:24,809 --> 00:28:28,769
marketing earlier this year we came to

00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:31,529
the conclusion that developers is a very

00:28:28,769 --> 00:28:33,749
broad target and that may be by biting

00:28:31,529 --> 00:28:35,249
off one smaller bit first and saying

00:28:33,749 --> 00:28:37,169
okay we've got a good relationships in

00:28:35,249 --> 00:28:39,869
the Python community we've got good

00:28:37,169 --> 00:28:42,119
Python tooling in fedora let's try and

00:28:39,869 --> 00:28:44,489
market specifically to Python developers

00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:47,039
so we went to PyCon and hand it out

00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:48,809
awesome Fedora Python t-shirts and

00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,950
talked to a lot of people there so

00:28:48,809 --> 00:28:51,269
there's an ongoing effort to

00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:54,479
specifically attract some of those

00:28:51,269 --> 00:28:56,159
Python developers kinda - oh if we try

00:28:54,479 --> 00:28:57,719
to address these developers here's what

00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,849
area were looking at growth and then we

00:28:57,719 --> 00:29:02,729
can broaden that out bringing in you

00:28:59,849 --> 00:29:05,729
know the Java developers and developers

00:29:02,729 --> 00:29:08,009
as I talked to Microsoft that Red Hat

00:29:05,729 --> 00:29:09,749
summit and they were very interested

00:29:08,009 --> 00:29:12,450
about how they could use the fedora

00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:14,999
packaging guidelines to correctly get

00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:17,940
done that package up for fedora I said

00:29:14,999 --> 00:29:20,399
wow and they were very serious about it

00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:24,899
so let's see how that goes but if we're

00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:28,549
now Python so another big thing I've

00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:28,549
been talking about fro yes Adam

00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:33,010
yeah dotnet is an open-source thing

00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:35,290
we're not going to include some closed

00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:39,100
source dotnet in fedora don't worry

00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:40,900
dotnet Microsoft seems to have a change

00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:42,340
of heart and at least from the

00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:44,440
engineering level they seem really

00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:50,430
sincere about it so that's awesome Langa

00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:52,540
a change of CEO also helps yeah exactly

00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:54,850
hubs just something I've been talking

00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:58,050
about for a long time I didn't have the

00:29:54,850 --> 00:30:01,450
IRC meeting slide on here but as

00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:03,760
everybody here knows the core the fedora

00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:06,430
activity is on IRC and mailing lists

00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,740
which are awesome and useful tools but

00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:11,530
also completely invisible to people

00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:14,530
outside of a very nerdy subset of the

00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:16,690
world they're hard barrier to get into

00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:18,520
an IRC culture let alone we're setting

00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:20,290
up an IRC client registering and Nick

00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:23,410
and figure out what a Nick's is and a

00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:24,040
channel and all these things those are

00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:26,370
difficult

00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:29,200
mailing lists or something that

00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:30,640
basically you know people don't want to

00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,460
subscribe to anymore

00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,260
and even if it even has something other

00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:37,150
than a barrier to getting involved in

00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:39,280
fedora it's something or you look at the

00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:41,530
Fedora website and you can't tell that

00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:44,140
anything was going on when we really

00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:46,570
have thousands literally a layer see

00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:48,700
medic meetings every year and you know

00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:50,620
multiple meetings a day and so much

00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:53,050
lines of chat and so much activity

00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:55,450
happening people can't see it and that

00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:57,160
makes it easy to dismiss fedora as a

00:30:55,450 --> 00:31:01,060
vital ongoing project

00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:03,520
so this hubs idea is basically to bring

00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:05,620
all that onto the web which is what most

00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:07,120
people think of anything of the Internet

00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:11,320
today so we want to make sure we are

00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:13,450
visible on you know the internet so

00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:16,150
there's a talk on hyper kitty and

00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:18,220
there's a talk about bringing IRC to the

00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:20,269
hub's and then more important than that

00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:22,190
there is actually a hackfest actually

00:31:20,269 --> 00:31:26,229
work on this on Friday so if that's

00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:30,049
interesting to you go to that next

00:31:26,229 --> 00:31:31,580
Fedora atomic we've been doing this kind

00:31:30,049 --> 00:31:33,379
of cool thing where instead of waiting

00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:36,049
every six months to have a release we've

00:31:33,379 --> 00:31:38,059
had a every two weeks give or take a

00:31:36,049 --> 00:31:40,879
release of the latest version of the top

00:31:38,059 --> 00:31:44,059
of Fedora atomic Coast with updates as I

00:31:40,879 --> 00:31:47,599
said before large company is relying on

00:31:44,059 --> 00:31:49,909
us for this so that's cool but more than

00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:52,339
that I really think that this idea of

00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:54,919
containerized bits of the operating

00:31:52,339 --> 00:31:57,649
system are probably the future of the OS

00:31:54,919 --> 00:32:00,349
from the server to the desktop and we

00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:03,049
see operating systems like core OS and

00:32:00,349 --> 00:32:06,109
ranch or OS in the bleeding edge there

00:32:03,049 --> 00:32:07,849
and I often talk about Fedora not

00:32:06,109 --> 00:32:09,589
wanting to be the bleeding edge what we

00:32:07,849 --> 00:32:10,940
definitely want to be the leading edge

00:32:09,589 --> 00:32:12,950
we want to make sure that when those

00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:14,719
well we can we it's okay to let other

00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:16,369
people experiment with the crazy ideas

00:32:14,719 --> 00:32:17,869
but when they start looking like hey

00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:20,389
that crazy idea might be onto something

00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:22,549
we should be in the forefront of the

00:32:20,389 --> 00:32:24,950
experimentation as well and so atomic is

00:32:22,549 --> 00:32:27,139
basically our way of getting involved in

00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:29,089
that and I think that as time goes on

00:32:27,139 --> 00:32:31,639
and especially in connection with the

00:32:29,089 --> 00:32:33,909
modularity work this is really going to

00:32:31,639 --> 00:32:37,459
be core to how we put together fedora

00:32:33,909 --> 00:32:40,459
and so I think this is a really big deal

00:32:37,459 --> 00:32:42,859
and one of the parts of this particular

00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:45,079
is looking at openshift which is a kind

00:32:42,859 --> 00:32:47,450
of not just a single host people cluster

00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:51,139
system but a container system but a

00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:53,149
clustered one and so Josh burkas here

00:32:51,139 --> 00:32:56,659
has a hackfest about that is that also

00:32:53,149 --> 00:32:59,329
on Friday Thursday Thursday hackfest

00:32:56,659 --> 00:33:01,190
about that which is important and we've

00:32:59,329 --> 00:33:04,009
got a lot of other talks about atomic in

00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:06,229
general in containers one of them is the

00:33:04,009 --> 00:33:08,719
docker layered image build service that

00:33:06,229 --> 00:33:12,049
Adam Miller put together and with a lot

00:33:08,719 --> 00:33:13,759
of other people's help as well and that

00:33:12,049 --> 00:33:17,570
service basically like I said with the

00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:19,279
modules you'll be able to sign up to be

00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:20,899
the maintainer of a docker file a docker

00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:22,429
container just like you can sign up to

00:33:20,899 --> 00:33:24,889
do maintainer of a package and you can

00:33:22,429 --> 00:33:27,340
maintain the container right now

00:33:24,889 --> 00:33:29,980
composed out of RPMs from the

00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:32,230
I'm set and it uses the same sort of the

00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:34,000
exact same tools build some Koji the

00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:36,910
same way that rpms built so I think

00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:40,390
that's really exciting ten-minute

00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:43,000
warning okay yes so the next thing

00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:45,820
talking about the similar kind of

00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,610
technologies flat-pack is a method for

00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:50,830
distributing and running desktop

00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:52,420
applications with the eventual goal of

00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:54,700
running them in this is pure sandbox

00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:57,190
away so you can download random

00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:58,570
applications from somewhere and trust

00:33:57,190 --> 00:34:01,060
that they won't take over your system

00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:04,360
it's pretty cool technology coming from

00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:06,240
the freedesktop.org people and there's a

00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:09,430
big push on that in fedora workstation

00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:11,410
and I don't know if we have any specific

00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:12,940
talks on that but there is a talk about

00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:16,080
the future of fedora workstation which

00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:18,520
I'm sure will mention flat pack as well

00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:22,120
and we also have an ongoing conversation

00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:24,490
in the fedora Council about allowing

00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:27,130
people outside of fedora to make flat

00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:28,870
packs available to fedora users in our

00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:31,360
fedora in the software Center in fedora

00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:33,940
workstation and how we will handle that

00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:35,620
kind of thing because availability of

00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:38,260
applications is one of the things that

00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:39,880
comes back to people comes back to us a

00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:43,720
lot when we were like why did you choose

00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:46,050
something other than fedora so that's

00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:48,430
one of the interesting technologies and

00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:50,200
that is the end of my highlights there

00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:53,470
all I'm sure that there are lots of

00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:55,090
other exciting highlights in in this

00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:56,920
conference I didn't mention everything

00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:59,800
those just some of the ones that really

00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:01,060
stuck out to me I want to thank the

00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,470
people who helped me put together the

00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:07,240
statistics at the beginning

00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:09,340
Steve smoochin and Ralph bean and also

00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:11,140
just thanks to everybody for being so

00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:15,000
awesome fedora would not be what it is

00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:15,000
without you so thank you very much

00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:15,040
awesome okay

00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:17,270
any questions anybody yes statistical

00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,950
contributors your packaging pretty

00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:20,630
interesting but I think it would be even

00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:23,030
more interesting if copper were in here

00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:25,490
because there's a lot lower barrier to

00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:30,740
entry for copper and it would be curious

00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:32,990
to see that same statistic yes so the

00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:35,330
question there was are not a question at

00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:37,580
all but it comment to me which was that

00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:39,860
copper including copper would be good

00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:42,890
and I think copper actually generates

00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:44,540
this messages with user tied to them so

00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:46,450
I'm not sure why it didn't include it so

00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:53,750
I will definitely do that once I've

00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:56,050
unbroken data crapper yes Josh and

00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:56,050
that's ash

00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:16,330
yeah yeah I do not have those stats

00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:18,760
offhand the question was do we have

00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:21,490
stats on packages that do not ever get

00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:22,840
that feedback in bode and make it

00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:26,440
through without anybody ever looking at

00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:35,890
them does somebody from QA have the

00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:37,720
answer to that offhand yeah yeah I am

00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:40,360
happy to show the slides that don't look

00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:42,760
so good yeah there those are what we

00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:44,980
call things to work on slides so that's

00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:59,830
yeah I don't know but that's a good

00:37:44,980 --> 00:38:02,230
interesting question so the question is

00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:05,560
do we have any statistics on the

00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:11,880
diversity and university initiatives the

00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:13,840
answer is no I think I know no data I

00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,520
hope that we've been having some effect

00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:17,290
the university thing has been kind of

00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,150
slow I think we've been having

00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:21,160
there's the Fedora Women's Day which was

00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:22,990
I think very successful that's how

00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:26,380
hopefully that is having an effect

00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:29,290
and I know that Pataca is our diversity

00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:31,119
advisor is working on a survey and that

00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:32,830
once we start having that survey that

00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:34,359
will give us some sort of measurable

00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:40,080
things to do but we don't actually have

00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:40,080
that yet five minutes yeah

00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:58,300
okay okay so the comment was there are

00:38:56,140 --> 00:39:02,920
about 50 people who are pen translations

00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:04,420
over the last four Fedora 24 is that

00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:08,079
just in the sprint or was that over the

00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:09,400
whole release okay so about 50 people

00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:12,430
working in the translations do you know

00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:14,440
what percent with it did it break down

00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:15,880
into like again ten percent of people

00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:19,089
doing most of the work who probably

00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:20,440
follow the same same pattern as well but

00:39:19,089 --> 00:39:25,950
yeah I've definitely be interested in

00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:25,950
adding that yeah

00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:37,530
yeah do we have statistics about what

00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:39,390
upgrade method they use no I do not but

00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:41,520
I can tell that you know it's again

00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:43,290
because the ISO downloads are going down

00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,960
and the number of people running the new

00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:49,890
releases are going up some good chunk of

00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:51,300
people are choosing to upgrade I think

00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:53,430
there's some ways we can pull that out

00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:55,860
of the mirror data but it's a little bit

00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:59,040
hard because you can't you definitely

00:39:55,860 --> 00:40:00,660
can't tell easily the difference between

00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,340
somebody doing a DNF upgrade that pull

00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:05,550
down a lot of packages and an actual

00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:07,230
update without doing deeper analysis

00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:11,790
that would involve keeping more logs and

00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:13,890
we're keeping okay yeah let's talk about

00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:15,240
that later there are definitely some

00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:17,550
things we can do and I think that when

00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:19,470
people do an upgrade using the graphical

00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:22,320
upgrade I think that we've got a way to

00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:26,660
measure that but that just started so I

00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:26,660
haven't been able to do that Justin

00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:35,680
yeah

00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,660
so the question is activity per region

00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:44,260
of the world do you mean contributor

00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:46,360
activity or user activity we have

00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:49,420
information on where contributors are

00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:51,760
from so that could be analyzed but I

00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:53,590
have not really done that but yeah we

00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,820
actually do any people people put in

00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:56,260
where they're from when they sign up for

00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:57,550
an account so we could go and look at

00:40:56,260 --> 00:41:00,340
that and that would be a good thing to

00:40:57,550 --> 00:41:02,260
do we've tried to do some analysis of

00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:04,000
where people are coming from in the

00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:06,700
mirror manager stats and that's actually

00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:10,060
a thing that is one of those things that

00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:12,760
ends up being a dinosaur the stats are

00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:14,620
heavily skewed to users in connect areas

00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:16,810
where there are reliable always-on

00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:19,510
internet connections so people in Latin

00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:22,240
America people in remote parts of Asia

00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:24,430
are definitely people in Africa are

00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,900
being undercounted they're people who

00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:29,500
have high-speed Internet in Europe and

00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:31,270
North America are over counted so if you

00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:33,250
look at the breakdown there it basically

00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:36,520
tells you that it's the case so it

00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:38,830
doesn't really but but for contributors

00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:41,170
we have more granular data that we could

00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:44,080
look at then you have time for one more

00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:49,530
question you already asked a question is

00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:52,220
there anything else

00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:52,220
yes

00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:04,220
yes so the question is have we thought

00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:08,810
about privacy in the broadcast doodles

00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:11,420
and stuff going on fed message a lot of

00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:14,830
the stuff yeah so a lot of the reasons

00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:19,070
we don't have more invasive data is less

00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:20,960
you being careful about privacy but the

00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:23,300
Fed message stuff where your name is

00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,940
attached to a thing you did we have I

00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:28,640
know you raised that issue recently we

00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:33,200
have really not looked into that very

00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:35,450
much before I really find the data

00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,640
valuable but I also understand you know

00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:40,010
the importance of not tracking

00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:42,230
individuals like particular location and

00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:44,660
time of action so it's possible that we

00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:46,310
could look at you know anonymizing older

00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:49,400
data or something that would make that

00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:51,620
like even just knocking things down to

00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,540
you have actions per day instead of

00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:56,420
actually per minute kind of thing would

00:42:53,540 --> 00:43:01,460
probably make a lot of additional

00:42:56,420 --> 00:43:05,890
privacy okay thank you everybody for

00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:05,890
