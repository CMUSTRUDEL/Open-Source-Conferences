Title: Flock 2016 - Testing containers using Tunir, Kushal Das
Publication date: 2016-08-21
Playlist: Flock 2016
Description: 
	Tunir is testing system which can run on your laptop or in server as a command line tool. We use the same to automatically test our Atomic, and cloud images in Fedora Infrastructure. The newer version of Tunir has feature to use Ansible to setup test VMs or remote machines. Using this as the first step, we can setup Kubernetes, and test the layered image builds in a proper container environment. This talk will demonstrate these features, and discuss about how one can use the same tools to test their containers or any other project.
