I wrote right outside I will give you

00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:10,520
the basic concepts about our service our

00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:15,990
features and innovations and in India

00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:18,800
so let's start one spout out is a

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,800
personal

Blaine Anderson 135 welcome dr. Hart's

00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:29,329
life are the advantages are those the

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:33,610
three origins vital techniques than they

00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:33,610
were and all in fact

00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:41,520
many mr. concerts by one of the

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,520
confusion I

00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:51,520
that's the first American sentence

00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:54,670
because such a flexible design that is

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:57,189
Athena we started without their family

00:01:54,670 --> 00:02:00,819
very angry and it's super fervent

00:01:57,189 --> 00:02:03,630
intelligence and others hot air and year

00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:03,630
only thing

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:40,209
yeah and art is a vital identification

00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:44,269
and by that you don't necessarily

00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:47,599
perceive graphical details except you

00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:54,230
can't rely on a line with the face based

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:58,390
on the earth API so let's see your

00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:58,390
college years and we're in hell

00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:20,530
and the other story of perseverance

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:25,930
response and also come across from your

00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:29,280
view learn about Amazon Web Services so

00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:29,280
if you have ever seen

00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:17,539
so very start you start for

00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:20,639
reconsideration very very good example

00:04:17,539 --> 00:04:27,000
welcome the country even of student side

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:29,430
so fountain that demonstrates very very

00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,419
very very the content good thought

00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:36,900
firstly digital

00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:39,659
nonsense successive slight severe and

00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:42,449
center as safe a mere event for

00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:45,810
welcoming we can do this school when

00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:47,669
we're all Australian and other way

00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:51,360
taught you how you can get the

00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:54,440
consultant in the UK regular visitor and

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:58,470
effective and often

00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:01,879
so what's because inside you can start

00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:01,879
to move it around so

00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:11,210
and beautiful character Dakota sorry

00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:14,300
there is only one records in the

00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:16,990
database and what the bunch of humans

00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:19,990
that point about some of the types of

00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,990
verification

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:47,700
so once it has their visitor already so

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,060
you're ready to make it available to the

00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:59,669
customers and clients but you want to

00:05:51,060 --> 00:06:02,250
publish it in schools you can publish

00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:05,639
their victory and course decision as a

00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:08,790
web base of the deterrent so between the

00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:12,630
certified party for example will publish

00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:16,410
an argument is it because any other

00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:21,150
values a physically Sun Devils can get

00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:27,880
affected you can expertise analyze the

00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:32,290
horoscope and these are thank you

00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:38,050
the gardener's you can polish the

00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:41,320
conference - very well so for the most

00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:43,630
very welcome this is riveting sister

00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:46,740
really wants to make the cousin Tyler

00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:50,680
and the world Earth available in

00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:53,380
theoretical source at the same time it's

00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:58,900
a different from what we call better

00:06:53,380 --> 00:07:02,350
satellites and sunrises your satellite

00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:05,139
sink yeah you can have one satellite

00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:07,419
server have a second one

00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:10,120
this one goes to the CDN this one only

00:07:07,419 --> 00:07:14,439
goes to this one okay is that a hold

00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:15,460
function or is that different this is

00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:18,270
like

00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:18,270
okay

00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:25,520
yeah our first a pebble do you have a

00:07:23,159 --> 00:07:29,070
nursery

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:31,290
you can polish all the content

00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:35,520
associated to the repository our leaf

00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:36,990
altitude the relatively cool the actual

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,950
file transfer

00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:44,000
real estate and arson there is special

00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:47,420
consideration worry you can provide cost

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,110
the arrested participation likely a

00:07:47,420 --> 00:08:01,860
possibility you can also provide the

00:07:51,110 --> 00:08:08,340
directory this feature is available for

00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:10,740
the villages rpms and others so far so

00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:15,030
as I said our business the logical

00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:22,440
content at surveys you still didn't find

00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:27,480
the content which is not yet my project

00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:29,880
oh yeah ever mention do is they sell I

00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:35,370
analyze interface we call it power

00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:40,500
platinum we can take a look so

00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:43,800
mr. secretary Artyom you created your

00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:46,320
you provide the earth crazy the senior

00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,040
also instrument such days the world

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,830
problem

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,890
and on this point

00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:57,050
screaming then we want to socialize it

00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:59,940
to say from trunks

00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:03,600
what is going on during civilization

00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:06,050
itself basically first we French the

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,050
metadata

00:09:11,129 --> 00:09:19,529
okay we attend to the metadata

00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:24,959
we analyzed it and then East are all

00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:27,749
face me figure are welcome synchronized

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:33,829
- we found a fearsome RPL there are

00:09:27,749 --> 00:09:37,470
tears sound

00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:39,779
so then the energy constantly the

00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:42,180
repository and whispering this

00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:45,779
organization astound the content isn't

00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:50,629
about let's look what kind of steps at

00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:57,350
the table during the publish publish the

00:09:50,629 --> 00:10:02,389
metadata and all the content package

00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:09,990
repository and we also created since the

00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:12,499
voltage of perish location so as I

00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,499
mentioned you can

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:22,190
do you sleep in the browser

00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:25,670
we decided to recommend our producer

00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:29,930
Allison rebel you to is a very popular

00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:34,580
tool that generates 30 customer pages

00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:40,430
from the year at the metadata this is

00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:45,850
how looks like the regular web a

00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:48,860
circulatory can see the recipient and

00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:52,460
this is how it works with their appear

00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:55,700
functionality enabled so the consist of

00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:58,430
multiple to be lost and the pages are

00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:02,120
done by the template which are provided

00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:08,440
that the repeated them and they say 10%

00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:08,440
leaves to mice and adjusted by moves

00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:21,010
there are some questions at this time

00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:25,279
okay so long as most to be perpetuated

00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:29,420
in a buscar excessive internal force in

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:34,580
by the load policy you talked about how

00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:38,750
one dependent variable so there's really

00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:43,839
the road which says vertically fertilize

00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:43,839
the quality will appeal to only

00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:57,740
and there is a defendant without

00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,740
extremely

00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:08,780
there are two types of them there is

00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:16,620
alderman policy and the ground policy

00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:22,220
what doesn't demand their own actually

00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:25,640
low pile of the metadata be fast and

00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:25,640
stores all the

00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:48,960
while the content is just the beats a

00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:54,180
little faster suitable to decline that

00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:54,180
you can say a lot of Star Trek the

00:12:54,840 --> 00:13:01,420
ground reality simulator

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,770
yeah so if if you do that the first time

00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:05,800
a system registers to the vault

00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:08,800
depository and asks for an RPM it's that

00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:12,720
young transaction is it going to time

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,720
out I failed if I'm on a slow link

00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:31,480
the remercie is over the sale of the old

00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:34,149
amantha in addition to understand which

00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:38,200
I prefer that alderman chemistry eight

00:13:34,149 --> 00:13:42,640
correct success in the background but I

00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:43,899
think my package there are things beats

00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:47,490
on file system

00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:53,020
Lindau stops running the cognitive still

00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:55,470
available to the client to get back up

00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,470
itself

00:13:55,710 --> 00:14:05,790
now let's work so that life for example

00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:08,779
the only ones request some things he

00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:13,070
talks about the recurrent breast pump

00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:18,230
and the requests kind of iron pots

00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:21,050
market accident also called be soil

00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:23,880
which actually relates to political

00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:26,010
connotation of the package in the

00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:30,750
funeral calls together

00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:38,380
location the coastal plain strain

00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:41,400
the content is served right away yeah if

00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,400
the symbol

00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:55,490
the disparity between screech when a

00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:58,910
squeak squeak - you support so we're

00:14:55,490 --> 00:15:01,700
looking to the fish soup very central to

00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:05,270
present we stir in the regulated voltage

00:15:01,700 --> 00:16:17,900
back to the price if there is nothing in

00:15:05,270 --> 00:16:22,070
the consumer is a streamer is the so the

00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:25,330
bill he can be with Old Lace position is

00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:31,300
the euro fell over the country as you

00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:31,300
questa so if you can turn out so well

00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:41,760
failures and want disparity so encourage

00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:41,760
you can remember this fundamental is so

00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:50,910
precious about the demand stuff yeah

00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,910
yeah I'm sure

00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:02,400
I actually know it's like my question is

00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:04,360
about

00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:07,470
well you

00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,470
birth building

00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:15,439
with and then the good sign it was

00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:15,439
the

00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:18,929
how does ball

00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:24,669
like this

00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:31,890
I think inequalities thank you yeah I

00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:33,760
mean because mine's too so it changed

00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:36,680
the concept but it

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:39,920
out of this we never

00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:41,600
or you just right there though right I

00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:45,260
don't think that it's kind of less

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:47,000
because the coachmen yeah exactly but it

00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:49,370
changes the content without changing the

00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,280
lane so you're

00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:53,990
package keeping already the team condom

00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:57,210
because we didn't know about that

00:17:53,990 --> 00:18:01,340
oh it will serve you the old copy

00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:01,340
well yes well

00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:08,210
where you can set a claim on so

00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:19,650
equation well I

00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:24,050
he's gonna set it to two hours which

00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:24,050
means we basically or

00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:27,600
we are setting with

00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:45,930
we synchronize B and let's say our piano

00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:49,290
services we look at the absolutely right

00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:51,900
I think so you forcibly replace the

00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:53,920
package in society but you think of this

00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:58,620
is all day

00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:58,620
because then you improve

00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:03,180
what we do is

00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:06,700
firstly the opportunity recently

00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:10,800
received the original exchange the near

00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:12,570
the truck insurance only personal access

00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:15,340
provision of man

00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:18,370
it

00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:24,120
oh sorry

00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:24,120
he changed we did sir we do change

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,790
Oh

00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:34,400
so the industry metadata will change

00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:41,260
the guy says push with what you're

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,740
saying is in this case if you

00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:45,960
accidentally promote something before

00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:48,220
but then go back and resign it since the

00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,440
upstream metadata

00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:53,010
number of the metadata change yeah it's

00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,010
going to okay

00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,620
yes

00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,610
yet we

00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:14,600
we were persistent yes because very very

00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:14,600
firmly people who to conserve

00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:17,539
all

00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:29,310
fails

00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:37,340
and the consumer which is accessible

00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:41,230
collection around from the country where

00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:43,580
it seems that the keeps to the speed

00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:44,629
physical a collection of the type of

00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:47,149
database

00:20:44,629 --> 00:20:49,279
so this steamer because in this

00:20:47,149 --> 00:20:52,070
collection and less surrendered

00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:54,379
ourselves okay I'm to change this record

00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:57,529
of this package the depressor melodies

00:20:54,379 --> 00:21:00,049
and to industry so every the political

00:20:57,529 --> 00:21:04,429
task which triggered what task is doing

00:21:00,049 --> 00:21:08,710
pass it goes to the base collection and

00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:08,710
attend due respect and welcome the

00:21:15,429 --> 00:21:20,289
database there is a collection

00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,900
if you have some bacteria

00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:56,470
otherwise maybe some time to talk about

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:59,470
other stuff so these are the green

00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:01,990
filter types would be damaged so at the

00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:05,610
Art Fair Remini the ayahs governing

00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:12,690
which is built upon the face illustrate

00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:12,690
we also do for their various languages

00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:24,430
so we've ever saturation can manage one

00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:28,540
of these use cases for very very rough

00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:33,130
life the regular room dispenses best

00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:34,720
death production production so it will

00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:38,910
say you're in development where we

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:46,200
approach and purgatory develop control

00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:46,200
once a three-year term owned by

00:22:53,850 --> 00:23:05,250
is very useful for best anchor a simple

00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:09,440
search and throughout introduces another

00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:09,440
the expenses that you can narrow your

00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:23,340
marriage being a certain distribution we

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:27,270
recently added support service which is

00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:29,460
pretty cool the first solution for

00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:35,669
languages but other than the first one

00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:38,190
so it's faster you can and your custom

00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:42,659
packages by our members with a repertory

00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:44,940
and what one is one of the also think

00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:50,210
about how it can retain

00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:50,210
old person's let me see

00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:27,860
because of this theorem anyone remember

00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:27,860
to use case is

00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:43,750
and we could also start different

00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:47,380
versions of them into their discipline

00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:47,380
how much time is left

00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:58,269
so another use case is that you can

00:24:53,559 --> 00:25:01,450
cause the seven that we call in 2005 in

00:24:58,269 --> 00:25:04,570
addition to the thirties also that we

00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:08,110
fully support affirmative that there is

00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:11,590
a decal spectrum that we have the

00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:16,779
propellant and propels your all Becker

00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:19,749
repositories let me convert them even

00:25:16,779 --> 00:25:22,269
though by that requires some experiment

00:25:19,749 --> 00:25:25,809
requested another poll in order to

00:25:22,269 --> 00:25:29,200
publish those repositories self-trained

00:25:25,809 --> 00:25:35,890
can use them and serve them to the

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:39,610
Democrats what rarities great is small

00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:43,330
which has this provides allows us

00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:50,620
beverage to like apply to you provide

00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:56,200
multiple profiles how it works so you

00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:59,740
can be notoriously you synchronize the

00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:02,710
quantity to fault at this point about

00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:08,050
what the doctor country during the

00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:11,320
required to serve another point so what

00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:17,140
kind of transcended agriculture through

00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:20,230
the filter directs which are going to

00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:24,240
the location where the actual content is

00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:26,440
third there are certain about right so

00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:30,220
widening it the published will be

00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:31,090
published because crane were worse only

00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:33,850
they

00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:41,170
these trials which are usually made

00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:43,810
created there any problems so I think I

00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:45,990
should everything talk about reducing

00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:51,030
any questions

00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:55,940
no so

00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:55,940
our promise terrible expensable

00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:06,760
and the support for the only digital

00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:08,710
prototype of the blendable future like

00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:14,730
synchronization and publish they're

00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:18,880
implemented generically so the progress

00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:26,250
can be sorted mix and by pebbles which

00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:27,490
are responsible for the development all

00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:31,150
right

00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:37,420
so when the tagging is installed.first

00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:40,690
or 20 canary scholarship is available on

00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:44,320
different continents for defending the

00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:47,890
purpose of the usage right so for

00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:50,740
example received whether on health with

00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:54,500
a range around from the party predators

00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:59,150
that means he has a lot more today

00:27:54,500 --> 00:28:02,570
we serve just imitating the database

00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:02,570
this family

00:28:08,409 --> 00:28:15,289
also down to a few lecture that voyage

00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:34,279
to be served a loser be able to handle

00:28:15,289 --> 00:28:37,909
it so ephemeral it's about 25 you need

00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:41,830
to say what let's again so for example

00:28:37,909 --> 00:28:41,830
what makes an argument

00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:55,999
yeah say okay me but this one we define

00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:59,629
the prototype then very very important

00:28:55,999 --> 00:29:03,100
this guy is a searchable for the

00:28:59,629 --> 00:29:07,759
targeting server server in their funeral

00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:09,590
rifles to grab off Instagram during the

00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:11,940
fall so

00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:16,380
to get the coach

00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:20,280
the distributor the submitter is still

00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:25,980
difficult without the oxygen

00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:28,110
so as I said this for example our

00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:30,300
Timothy 2/3 for this unit affirmative

00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:33,500
I've been the particular Merak cylinder

00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,500
young person

00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:44,870
now mr. Kumar the integration designer

00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,870
game played with in sequence

00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:49,360
easy

00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:51,670
Oh

00:29:53,740 --> 00:30:01,059
Eastern learned response for example to

00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:08,940
sucessful publish you could happen even

00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:12,250
the publish/subscribe change

00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:17,970
and at some point burners resumed it you

00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:17,970
can say I want to keep your

00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:26,360
right we also diplomat D H typical

00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:28,960
that's farewell beliefs that allows an

00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:33,260
successful organization very

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:38,120
certification about this is the Luminess

00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:43,630
very come to respect Nepal to do right

00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:43,630
way equal to rapid elections

00:30:44,889 --> 00:30:50,019
aeration to provide the future

00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:22,130
and we have a local sincere canoas

00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:25,720
functionality very No

00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:57,500
so it had distributed a circular

00:31:25,720 --> 00:32:03,760
architecture published they were able to

00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:06,970
secure and by the year so we use sorry

00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,970
for this

00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:19,510
for sexualities and I'm right to ration

00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:23,020
our kitchen plans for you to know what

00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:24,310
respect for us or when you can provide

00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:27,680
your

00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:31,340
so we're starting the plane

00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:32,620
we all remained external to that very

00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:38,400
morning

00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:38,400
but grass because I think about that

00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:47,510
because yes there are hopefully one of

00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:52,760
the most relational charges of a small

00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:57,580
will keep their relational database so

00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:57,580
we decided to you make some things

00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:05,590
conference they decided to use

00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:08,759
phosphorus as GB models and decided to

00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:12,360
use general and lights lots of all right

00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:12,360
generous my world

00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:16,020
so

00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:27,029
sir my presentation Sabbatarians ieave

00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:30,020
me the basic concepts of what are these

00:33:27,029 --> 00:33:33,210
very confused

00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:36,249
somebody's very

00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:39,340
and other information because they're

00:33:36,249 --> 00:33:42,489
expensive the Commission where you

00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:44,889
compiled where a lot of transfers or

00:33:42,489 --> 00:33:47,349
your questions if you still be in

00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:49,989
traverse we will be very happy to come

00:33:47,349 --> 00:34:05,849
to you or to your children starting out

00:33:49,989 --> 00:34:08,889
there was an air of authority and the

00:34:05,849 --> 00:34:12,549
Situationists package distributed not

00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:17,230
just an RPM packaging batterer to

00:34:12,549 --> 00:34:20,289
distribute the document so to also enjoy

00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:23,250
a couple of seconds ago in very much

00:34:20,289 --> 00:34:23,250
Caesarion

00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:34,990
so get excited with this

00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:38,710
so I have a couple questions yes is

00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:42,880
there let's say that hypothetically you

00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:43,540
accidentally assembling is there a tool

00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:47,940
to make

00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:47,940
we generate leads how do I do that

00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:54,580
thinking about publish right like you

00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:56,560
know because it creates about a million

00:34:54,580 --> 00:35:00,830
simoleons

00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:03,020
you're isolated long one is their way of

00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:08,930
course of your genitals

00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:11,589
yes so every publish with every personal

00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:14,329
publish because

00:35:11,589 --> 00:35:16,700
such concept of operational and

00:35:14,329 --> 00:35:19,880
operation of public service if every

00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:21,540
operational college the visionary

00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:25,080
eliminate

00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:27,590
see what most women grateful

00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,590
accomplished

00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:36,569
there was no particle and there was

00:35:36,859 --> 00:35:40,450
there is no point

00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:46,740
so this would be

00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,740
graceful

00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:55,700
I

00:35:52,040 --> 00:36:01,400
it's over today

I've seen Derek syncopation yes so it

00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:05,170
could involve from

00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:10,960
is simple

00:36:07,759 --> 00:36:13,650
really I mean really people

00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,650
saying

00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:21,630
well and they will

00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:21,630
public conscience

00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:25,619
but also public

00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:33,000
so anytime before they made

00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:38,210

00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:09,370
that way also like this make the same

00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:11,660
with other doctors they should not be

00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:16,520
used to have the same team

00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:18,450
like that which for one reason their

00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:23,980
little party

00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:27,010
Wow what are those both Korea and try to

them all yesterday and I

00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:39,350
one the current three where we use to

00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:39,350
build packages that include them

00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:48,670
we want the Durga situation we want

00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:53,009
always to push that to India for the

00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:53,009

00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:11,800
that contain something called whatever

00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:14,380
it

00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:16,410
if you wanted to

00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,410
Oh

00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:25,080
okay

00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:25,080
Marone maybe we'll set up

00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:34,650
that that we would like to wooden so I

00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:34,650
guess

00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:42,470
about this

00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:54,330
just love some

00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:10,410
oh yes so what first doctor

00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:12,710
the words the manufacturing jobs for

00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:12,710
them

00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:21,980
does not go like

00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:21,980
players

00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:33,630
which was created 12:7 and it has a list

00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:36,630
of

00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:36,630
yes

00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:44,710
the layers

00:39:48,609 --> 00:39:57,220
I also know fishing belly

00:39:53,089 --> 00:39:57,220
that was verification

00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:11,050
this time becomes much more difficult to

00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:15,160
manage a lot of relational data with

00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:19,260
relational database we've been using a

00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:24,270
couple of spirits a couple of MongoDB

00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:24,270
instructions like you know cheating with

00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:27,690
so we have something

00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:38,550
that's two

00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:38,550
we didn't say remember you think

00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:49,840
so that immigration affairs might bring

00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,840
a couple of steps

00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:58,180
they're excellent the question is must

00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:08,720
yes you can play right for some time

00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:14,590
about that members of the moment

00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:14,590
progress people very requested

00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:21,470
doesn't mean that's the main driver is

00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:23,810
affected it's hard to be a mess

00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:25,840
yeah and has I doubt you may be the

00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:28,840
runner on the

00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,840
right

00:41:33,609 --> 00:41:36,180
of

00:41:37,349 --> 00:41:41,860
well and I mean just from a from a

00:41:39,509 --> 00:41:43,960
commercial standpoint

00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:45,790
Postgres instead of mom going

00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:49,210
as we move into satellite now we've got

00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:51,760
one database instead I'll go over here

00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:54,900
and close preserver here waiting up

00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,900
together yeah

00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,730
so I have

00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:09,670
Michael and profit

00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:12,000
and say all the edges is not the same

00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:12,000
for the

00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:19,880
yes there is an option called repeal of

00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:22,340
Marshalls surviving photosynthesis the

00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:25,090
acetate returned the old stone but

00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:25,090
different

00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:28,740
depending on the same

00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:43,640
here

00:42:40,009 --> 00:42:43,640
which tosses

00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:48,059
are you

00:42:48,430 --> 00:43:00,150
okay so let's a little trip to London

00:42:51,550 --> 00:43:05,490
would be just right for example

00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:05,490
mysteriously woman celestial okay

00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:15,560
the negation

00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,200
for example doubt you have the issues

00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:19,810
incorrectly

00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:25,510
later

00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:28,950
has changed somehow somebody tried to

00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:28,950
use an idol and

00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,900
your rules for

00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:57,820
felicitations - yeah

00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,820
various contrary

00:43:57,990 --> 00:44:02,640
each product you know

00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:06,589
in products

00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:18,450
and the old way was with each change

00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:18,450
which is required by some leadership

00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:24,870
it's not necessary can just

00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:28,380
like

00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:52,990
education services how to do that but

00:44:48,449 --> 00:44:58,119
with the unit of language we reduce our

00:44:52,990 --> 00:45:02,410
Changez Celotex we go and beat rework be

00:44:58,119 --> 00:45:03,300
a genetic component but but he has on

00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:06,690
surrender

00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:14,099
if you want to actually work for

00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:16,849
but device people these requirements any

00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:16,849
other person

00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:29,740
you're asking about this

00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:32,080
just not choose reading yeah I think

00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:37,470
there's always using change the system

00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:37,470
that also used to use mobility

00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:42,600
the psychic

00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,800
