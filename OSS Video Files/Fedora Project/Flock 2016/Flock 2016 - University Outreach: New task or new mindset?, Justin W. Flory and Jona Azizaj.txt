Title: Flock 2016 - University Outreach: New task or new mindset?, Justin W. Flory and Jona Azizaj
Publication date: 2016-08-21
Playlist: Flock 2016
Description: 
	In early 2015, the Fedora Council proposed a new objective: the University Involvement Initiative. The purpose? Try to increase exposure of Fedora in university settings to gain new users, but also to hopefully gain new contributors. In order to accomplish this, is it a new task, or does it require a new mindset? In this talk, we begin looking at the current mindset and marketing thoughts around attracting university students to Fedora. What is working? What isn't? We will look at personal experiences among the presenters with getting involved with Fedora as a student for an example. We will focus on how changing the ways we approach reaching out to students might be the best way to begin making an impact on students with Fedora.

if you're our other open source project

00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:13,500
so who are the ambassador's so an

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:16,410
ambassador is we are like the voice of

00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,750
the Torah we represent the Torah we

00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:23,670
promote the Torah in different different

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:27,269
events across the world so ambassadors

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:30,480
are responsible so the public can know

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:34,260
our four foundations and they have to

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,180
know what fedora is working so we are

00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:39,239
putting people behind a name because

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:41,370
when I say what Fedora is doing isn't

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:44,280
fedora who is doing all this but it's

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:49,230
the people that are behind it our

00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:52,620
community outreach so we are bringing

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:56,719
Fedora into new and existing places for

00:00:52,620 --> 00:01:00,120
new and existing people what else

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:02,280
ambassadors are responsible to to grow

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:06,689
the community base so we can have more

00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:10,260
people that can joy can join fedora our

00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:13,350
community and contribute there and also

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:17,790
impacting future generation of users and

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:21,180
contributors of all ages and also and

00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:23,700
focuses so what to do we teach and show

00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:26,220
how fedora improves the community

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:29,280
experience computing computing

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:32,549
experience sir and how makes our life

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:36,780
easier how protects our freedom so we

00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:38,579
are fedora and so if you change the

00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,229
context a little bit there's also the

00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:42,890
program the lesser-known program or

00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:46,200
other campus ambassadors so who are they

00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:47,790
they mostly focus at outreach at an

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,549
educational level looking at

00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:53,310
universities high schools primary school

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:56,579
a variety of different places and campus

00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:59,340
does not necessarily equate to student

00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:01,229
can include professors teachers system

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:04,460
administrators and school districts it's

00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:06,990
not exclusively limited to only students

00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:08,599
so the campus ambassadors also impact

00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,830
all kinds of students obviously

00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:13,040
computing professions are applicable

00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:16,040
it's easy to free to point and see

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,500
student or an IT student and let go

00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,090
here's how Fedora can help you or here's

00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,159
how you might be interested in fedora

00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:24,140
but there's also overlap with non

00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:26,390
technical fields to whether it's

00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:28,700
literature philosophy sciences

00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:30,439
mathematics liberal arts there's tons of

00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,299
different applications for how fedora

00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:34,340
and open source can fit into students

00:02:32,299 --> 00:02:36,349
lives that aren't necessarily technical

00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:38,689
you can look at the science like there's

00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:40,700
a science spin for fedora that has a lot

00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:43,010
of really useful tools and open data

00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:46,730
tools for working on scientific

00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:49,189
experiments or other calculation tools

00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:50,870
there's the design spin there's the jams

00:02:49,189 --> 00:02:53,120
then that all focus on things that

00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:56,000
aren't necessarily technical so you can

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:59,000
use it to produce music to remix your

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,669
own music to create artwork to create

00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,250
design assets there's plenty of other

00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:06,349
ways that open source and Fedora can be

00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:09,650
used outside of only technical fields

00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:11,120
and they also are supposed to work at

00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:13,459
all levels of teaching to bring

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,859
information resources about fedora and

00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:18,229
open source technology into the daily

00:03:15,859 --> 00:03:22,840
discussion of students lives sounds

00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:24,919
great right well not quite like that

00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,440
unfortunately the program originally

00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:30,199
started in 2009 but it never really

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,840
quite took off it's a complicated

00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:34,489
history and we want to try to revisit

00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,560
that now and offer some clarity to the

00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:40,819
situation about how to go forward and

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:45,349
kind of reboot this effort so looking

00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:48,590
looking bad if we see the origin story

00:03:45,349 --> 00:03:50,389
for campus ambassadors it was really

00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:53,659
difficult for us to find some

00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:56,540
information to gather some data of what

00:03:53,659 --> 00:04:00,500
was who were part of it or what he'll be

00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:03,949
done because the program does not have

00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,710
much of a documented pass so also it's

00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:09,600
not active

00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:14,550
maintain today but we have some numbers

00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:18,300
of events that they have done it depends

00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:22,350
on different releases but we can see why

00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:25,140
did this project started so they wanted

00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:27,600
to improve outreach to our students that

00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:31,350
were exposed to open source project and

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:34,350
fedora also to put a fedora in hands of

00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:38,400
students today so we can go the platform

00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:41,010
tomorrow because if they are they are

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,990
part now of the project and they

00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:47,340
continue to contribute their there will

00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:51,000
be a long-term contributor to our to our

00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:53,400
project so also bringing younger

00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,590
contributors to help bring new ideas to

00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:58,590
the federal project so we can share away

00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:02,430
our ideas we can discuss about them and

00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:06,210
after that we can implement them and

00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:10,740
what worked and what didn't work so as I

00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:13,680
said we also contacted the person who

00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:18,510
founded it Justin but we haven't

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:20,880
received any email from him so it was

00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:25,680
really difficult for us to find some

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:28,230
numbers but we can't we know I actually

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,390
would do that like I can say from him

00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:32,610
gas specific point back into the other

00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:35,520
night when campus and visitor was he

00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:38,490
discussed and we suddenly got a blow up

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,260
like a lot of people are students who

00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:42,540
never even heard the word figure out

00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:44,620
before but all of them on YouTube

00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:46,750
ambassador so that they can write Kiki

00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:48,370
there is you you can hit it and it's

00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,110
still going on with the Ambassador

00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:52,090
Program somewhat but I am just giving

00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:54,730
you an idea so and that thing we have to

00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:56,680
be asked FM scope for a special

00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:59,170
permission so if you go to the amber

00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,240
citrus drawing page now you will see for

00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:03,550
the Indians part this is written on the

00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,560
talk that at least in India we do not

00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:08,260
actively encourage students to become

00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:11,380
ambassadors and that line came up

00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:14,050
because it does become difficult for us

00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:16,090
to have anything related to fedora and

00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:18,600
the campus center center program so that

00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:22,030
was once you should be faced in in here

00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,680
just how do you think why did not go

00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:25,630
ahead with it and there are few other

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,130
projects who actually overnight i can

00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:31,210
actually named one of the project

00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:35,320
accompany son and we did not go well for

00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:38,190
them thank you thank you so if we see

00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:42,100
the numbers of events focused on

00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:46,180
students education biogenesis we can see

00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:50,110
Phaedra 20 we have 11 events with red 21

00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:55,600
for the droid 22 2 and Fedora 23 we have

00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:58,600
only five events of course it's more

00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:01,120
likely there were there were more events

00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:04,510
because for six months we can't have

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,970
only two events for example but was

00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:08,920
really difficult to find a record of

00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:12,190
their events that that's why we need to

00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:16,600
show up what you do we need to do block

00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:20,710
balls posted to our mailing list and so

00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:22,870
we can find more information and the

00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:24,820
numbers that we saw were searched from

00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:27,330
the event page on the wiki that we have

00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:30,100
and also past record it depends that

00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:32,350
they've done

00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:37,360
could you give an example of like what

00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:40,180
what events this events held at

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:43,570
different universities showing them how

00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:46,750
they can be part of it what will they do

00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:51,400
how is the process the structure of it

00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:53,260
and one comment on my seats yes one

00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,480
column anything that's specifically

00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:57,220
targeted towards like a student audience

00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,050
so the hackathon is probably the easiest

00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:03,450
am thing goes for what that kind of

00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:06,880
event would be some kind of extreme a

00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:09,070
good thing people coming up there's a

00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:13,660
common are sticking out on that will

00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:15,490
definitely get to that so now before we

00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:18,130
start looking into suggestions and ideas

00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:20,530
let's kind of get like a sit Rep of what

00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:22,600
we're looking at right now so the

00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:23,950
program exists but there's no clear way

00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,590
about how it fits into the greater

00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:29,080
picture of overall ambassadors or really

00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:31,000
house even a student can go from being

00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,800
an ambassador to a campus ambassador

00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,719
because it used until just recently it

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,700
was a requirement that in order to be a

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:40,110
campus ambassador you first had to be a

00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:42,550
sponsored member as a regular ambassador

00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:44,710
until recently that was just changed but

00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:46,240
even now it's still unclear about how to

00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:47,680
make that transition or what that even

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,920
means like what's the difference really

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:53,740
so it needs more direction and focus it

00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,240
needs some more energy behind it so kind

00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,660
of the event strategy that's happening

00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,560
now which really is more applicable to

00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:02,170
ambassadors rather than campus

00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,670
ambassadors conferences work well for

00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:06,100
bringing in a large variety of people

00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:08,830
including students and there's a great

00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:11,200
talk that just happened by be this

00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:13,300
morning about all kinds of crazy awesome

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,340
numbers about looking at these kind of

00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,990
things with the tools that we already

00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:18,670
have in our infrastructure like data

00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:21,790
grepher and other things i'll get to in

00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:23,290
a minute talk show showing and teaching

00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:25,030
students what kind of things they can

00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:27,190
they can build a fedora and how open

00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:28,630
source is a popular draw for them so

00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:30,010
when we go to a hackathon its am I are

00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:32,200
sharing like a lot of time students are

00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:34,210
like I want to build this thing I want

00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,100
to do this I want to make it happen and

00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:37,900
you're like well here's these things

00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,640
that fedora doesn't have to be

00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,650
necessarily fedora but like here's this

00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,980
tech that happens to be available in are

00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,210
just too

00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:45,610
bhushan and here's how you could use

00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:48,370
this to make your idea come to life and

00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:50,230
become a reality it also is exposing

00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:52,360
different places of fedora and open

00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:54,340
source and how it's a drawl it's not all

00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,800
programming seriously like I mentioned

00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:59,380
earlier there's the design lab the jam

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,400
lab there's the science lab there's tons

00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:03,160
of different things that aren't

00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,290
exclusively computing and one last thing

00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,150
is it's also in some places it's really

00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:09,190
a popular idea to have the user freedom

00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:11,200
and empowering the student or the user

00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:12,580
about what they can do with their

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,380
distribution what they can do with their

00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,880
system it's not you know a company being

00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,200
like here's your environment and here's

00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,820
what you're locked into because that's

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,860
what as far as at least in the United

00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:22,720
States that's kind of a little bit of

00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:25,570
the culture behind some of like the

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,820
teaching today so it's like it sometimes

00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:29,590
it's a new idea for like someone to

00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:32,140
think like oh wow you know I can change

00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:33,940
everything I can change the entire

00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:36,280
experience and create an entirely new

00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:39,160
thing whereas before I'd be stuck with

00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:40,960
what I'm given and so there are a

00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,270
variety of really cool tools and

00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:46,060
utilities that we have right now that

00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:48,820
are really great for targeting students

00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:52,540
or local events that we put together

00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:54,790
like hackathons badges are absolutely

00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:56,380
incredible because there are great

00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:58,450
waiting first gauge impact at an event

00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:00,370
so you go somewhere and like oh yeah we

00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:01,780
talked to this many people and we're

00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:03,820
this many students came up to us and

00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:05,260
they took this many DVDs but the end the

00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,520
day you're like I don't know what's

00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,800
happening to them I don't know what's

00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,570
going on but you have a number about if

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,910
they have a fast account they can scan a

00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:14,860
QR code go to a link and they instantly

00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:16,540
claim a bag gets added to their fast

00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:19,780
account and you also have an indicator

00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:21,310
you have what their fast user name is so

00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:23,470
it's easy to gauge I go well here's this

00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:24,910
person and you can take a number to see

00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:26,860
we have we engaged with this many people

00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:29,290
that either took the time to make a fast

00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,790
account and get the badge or they

00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:32,170
already had a fast account and maybe

00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:34,390
they're like oh yeah I signed up for

00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:36,280
what a long time ago and I think I still

00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:37,960
have it I'll get the badge and they're

00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:40,570
still engaging with fedora in that way

00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:42,940
and it's also incredibly useful at using

00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:45,640
st. previous and future involvement with

00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:48,040
the badges like checking in a report

00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:52,240
that was done on Boston 14 and thousand

00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:54,010
fifteen by B also was looking at look it

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,130
was a month before a month after about

00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,660
contributor activity

00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:58,520
they had an account before falls dumb

00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:00,160
you were looking at what their activity

00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:02,480
levels were at and how they were

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,280
engaging with the project and then you

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,140
looked at it a month after the event and

00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,490
in most cases you had an increased

00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:09,650
number or an increased amount of

00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:12,920
participation in interest following

00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:15,200
positive for the event and before until

00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,670
the three years ago and badges really

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,710
took off it would have been very

00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:20,900
difficult to be able to find a way to

00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:23,930
get that information and that's all made

00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:25,490
possible by data crapper so there's

00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:27,890
something behind gate a gripper fed

00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:30,080
message is one of the messages buses

00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:32,270
that anytime we do anything in fedora

00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,040
all the notifications in the boss in the

00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:37,040
IRC channels that fire off there's a

00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:38,780
mailing list post or commit bed messages

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,790
the fire hose that's submitting all of

00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:42,650
that constantly a data gripper is kind

00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:43,760
of like the the nozzle to the hose it

00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:46,190
lets you have a little bit more control

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,830
to tune in on the specific amount of

00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:52,370
data whether it's like IRC meeting

00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:54,320
commits packaging bodhi you name it it's

00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:56,060
more than likely on fed message and more

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,430
things are getting on at to like sonata

00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:00,770
for translations is a recent one I know

00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:03,020
of and I don't know if bugzilla I know

00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:04,610
it's done and if it's not implemented

00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:06,500
yet it's very close to being implemented

00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:08,180
which is something that previously and

00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,790
we never had access to and the bed

00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:12,230
message bus and it's a very useful tool

00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,760
for understanding the way our

00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:19,460
contributors are interacting and

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:22,700
engaging with the project so looking

00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:25,470
ahead what about the future our for me I

00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:28,150
we ask that we are going to look at now

00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:32,830
aborting mentorship not just students

00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:36,430
and visibility so onboarding if we look

00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:39,340
at onboarding we need to have clear

00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:41,470
steps for students and faculty members

00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:45,820
how they can get involved so how can

00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:48,940
they be part of the project we need to

00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:51,340
have like the really clear one so which

00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:53,170
is the first half second one like we

00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:55,150
have a different teams for example you

00:13:53,170 --> 00:14:00,970
have to introduce yourself as

00:13:55,150 --> 00:14:03,300
meaningless or you have to find a mentor

00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:07,330
for the process so they need to be

00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:10,600
really clear and also bringing people in

00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:13,180
a connecting them so if you are a new

00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:16,090
person joining the project if for

00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:19,300
example I find also two other ones and

00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:24,160
also the others find two others it will

00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:29,170
be like a chain and we'll have a more

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:31,390
bigger community so also which should be

00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:35,740
really careful so the newcomers feel

00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:38,230
welcome and they feel confident at our

00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:40,960
community so connecting the dots to make

00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:44,980
people feel involved and part of our

00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:48,370
community also providing them resources

00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:52,240
and interjection they need physical

00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:54,610
meetings are the perfect one so meeting

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,850
space it's powerful because it's better

00:14:54,610 --> 00:15:02,500
when you discuss with someone face to

00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:07,980
face and talk with them it's better than

00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:10,990
talking online on my own IRC also

00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:13,300
addressing mentorships and how to win

00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:16,720
your students towards being fedora

00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:19,110
advocates without creating hurdles so we

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:22,600
should use the word mentors or

00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:26,470
mentorship sometimes for the students

00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:29,140
for example if we say mentor is like you

00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:30,830
say teachers and we know the students

00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:36,030
don't like so much too

00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:41,640
so it's kind of weekend or we can choose

00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:45,480
a also another word it's up to us so the

00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:47,790
process needs to be really simple so we

00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:53,910
need not be a process really hard so you

00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:56,040
need to be to have really lots of

00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:58,440
knowledge Azure really a lot of

00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:02,040
technical staffs but if you know the

00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:04,020
basic things you know how our community

00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:08,430
works something like this you can be

00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:12,150
part of it and so that process would be

00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:15,990
simpler and easy for people to be there

00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:25,680
and so they can be motivated to be part

00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:28,020
of the project so mentorship we have so

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,000
empowering the current ambassadors

00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:32,430
campus ambassadors that we have and

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,089
students so they can mentor each other

00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:39,930
because if you're new and after some

00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:42,960
time you will know how the project works

00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:45,839
how things are there so after that you

00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:48,720
will be able to teach those thing to

00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:52,440
another one that's why that's why it

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:56,670
would be way better than having mentors

00:16:52,440 --> 00:17:00,300
for example from our ambassadors program

00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:03,450
that we have and would be a way better

00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:07,319
to teach each other every time we have

00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:09,390
newcomers so the standard training helps

00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:11,670
it right path for interesting

00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:14,850
participants that want to get involved

00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:17,400
and so after they are trained they can

00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:21,750
train also others if they have the right

00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:25,319
resources and Graydon's are available so

00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:27,569
teaching to teach the others also we

00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:30,110
have so similar to other programs

00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:32,420
lightining qualifications or mental

00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:35,809
policy will be important for you to

00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:38,720
flourish so perhaps we have mentorship

00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:44,210
and not mentor as we said also we can

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:46,880
find another thing it's up to us so also

00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:49,850
removing this title the saddest word

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:53,830
title as the mentor and looking and

00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:57,559
mentorship as the metal and we need to

00:17:53,830 --> 00:18:00,620
have more people to bring at our project

00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:03,049
as I said if you bring to others and the

00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:09,679
others we bring also other people would

00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:11,600
be way better for us and so on the other

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,190
key things that can be addressed to is

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,710
it's not just students for campus

00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:17,929
ambassadors there's plenty of other

00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:21,010
people who are actively involved in the

00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:24,230
education seeing that aren't just

00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:26,090
enrolled in courses or our students

00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:27,860
there's instructors there's professors

00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:30,320
there's teachers system administrators

00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:31,640
other faculty members of numerous

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,740
different educational facilities

00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,450
students aren't the only players here

00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:37,010
and one of my favorite examples is

00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:38,690
actually another ambassador in North

00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:41,860
America and also an author for the

00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:44,240
fedora magazine Charles profit he is a

00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:46,549
system administrator in a local school

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,780
district in western New York and one of

00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:50,419
the things that he's always been pushing

00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:51,950
for as a system admin is to use

00:18:50,419 --> 00:18:55,120
different free and open-source tools

00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:58,010
behind the schools local infrastructure

00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,750
I know there's a few that he was looking

00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:01,429
at for monitoring tools and he's slowly

00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:03,380
kind of breaking it in and spreading it

00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:05,780
out to other system administrators in

00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:07,340
the region and it's a slow chain

00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:09,110
reaction and one of his biggest

00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:12,110
challenges is trying to convince like

00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:14,059
the administrators about free and open

00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:16,010
source software and the example he cited

00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:18,740
to me was there was a time where he was

00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:21,110
talking about trying to use like this

00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:23,390
new open source tool in his minister his

00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:25,100
manager was like we will never use open

00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:30,080
source software in the entire time that

00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:32,299
I am in this position exactly so while

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,309
he was holding back his last despite the

00:19:32,299 --> 00:19:36,710
fact that they're already open source

00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:38,600
software running everywhere that's one

00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:39,380
of the challenges that you have to face

00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,450
in that position

00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:43,700
is lack of understanding or sometimes

00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:46,730
even not willing to understand you have

00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:48,830
resist active resistance so having

00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:50,270
resources and guidelines for the people

00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:52,520
in those situations who are like I'm

00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:53,990
stuck I have these people who are doing

00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:56,030
they don't understand they don't listen

00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:57,830
to any of this like I don't know what to

00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:59,420
do I feel powerless like what control do

00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:01,910
I have and there's other people in those

00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:03,710
situations that have experienced like

00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:05,420
Charles for example who have done this

00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:08,270
and be like oh yeah this is how I broke

00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:09,830
it in slowly and surely I got this thing

00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:11,660
in and it led to another thing and I

00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:12,920
started teaching other people about open

00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:16,310
source software in our infrastructure

00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:18,770
and it started spreading so things like

00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:20,030
one of the probably the easiest examples

00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:22,490
I could think of would be like creating

00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:25,340
a fedora computer lab which could also

00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:27,470
be a faculty oriented guide but it could

00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:29,660
also be a student 12 if a student wanted

00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:32,870
to be proactive and kind of a knighting

00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:34,940
at effort maybe if it's for teacher

00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:37,250
specifically if it's teaching with open

00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:38,750
source and fedora like I said all the

00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:40,370
other different things it's not just

00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:43,520
technical where you have the design you

00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:44,840
have the get out the games the music I

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,060
mean there's tons of different spins

00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,980
that aren't exclusively related to

00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:51,890
technology and the teachers could use

00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:53,900
these to educate their students and get

00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:56,870
them also exposed to open-source tech

00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:58,490
and even fedora the other two examples

00:20:56,870 --> 00:21:00,380
kind of like the ones with Charles or be

00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:02,750
like using open source and fedora in

00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:04,760
your infrastructure or breaking down

00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:06,140
proprietary walls in your school how do

00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,820
you do that like if you think about it

00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:09,500
you're like wow that's a huge thing how

00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:11,110
am I going to do that but when you have

00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,820
something else like you know here's

00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:15,290
advice here's a step-by-step kind of

00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:17,180
walk through about how I get it in my

00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:18,980
region and when you have we have a

00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:20,690
community of support with other people

00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:22,670
who have done it it makes it a lot

00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:24,020
easier for you to be understanding how

00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:25,940
you can proceed with this in your own

00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:27,380
region it's like it kind of like with

00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:29,240
the bring in to students it's like a

00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:33,340
chain reaction if you can start

00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:36,630
something and sure one

00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:40,480
question asked is what is the end goal

00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:42,010
because they're two very different

00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,510
angles that I can see there one would be

00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:49,020
a force in pretty increasing fedoras

00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:52,680
presence in school of computer labs

00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:55,540
versus an end goal and specifically me

00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:57,130
that means to an end of getting more

00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,930
students and more students who have

00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:02,020
become involved with the project and

00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:05,140
those probably have different needs in

00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:09,220
order to in order to drive that those so

00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:11,800
which one or both is attempted to

00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:13,720
address and how are you folks Katherine

00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,460
for me like I see that as a matter of

00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,230
bull it depends on the person so like if

00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,880
you have a student than spy a little

00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:21,430
more oriented towards exposing other

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,960
students to fedora to open source but

00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:25,180
it's like coming from a strategic

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,800
perspective for the ambassador's you

00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:28,990
know where should they be focusing their

00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:31,480
efforts I mean that are we going to

00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:35,299
throw relay throw funding and resources

00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:37,360
at every every idea or

00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:39,529
really want to push on these ideas I

00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,330
think that's kind of a question that's

00:22:39,529 --> 00:22:43,399
kind of already happening at least from

00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:46,309
what I've seen in family are the masters

00:22:43,399 --> 00:22:47,389
of North America I think they're

00:22:46,309 --> 00:22:48,919
starting to be some discussion because

00:22:47,389 --> 00:22:50,299
like a lot of like the traditional Linux

00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:52,249
events the ones that we've been going to

00:22:50,299 --> 00:22:55,999
for years and then we're well known

00:22:52,249 --> 00:22:57,860
presents there it's usually the same

00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:59,210
like not all the time but it's a lot of

00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,860
times it's the same people that we're

00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:03,080
seeing at every conference or every

00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:05,179
event and we're not having the impact

00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,499
that we think we might have and there's

00:23:05,179 --> 00:23:08,509
nothing especially with like Dana

00:23:06,499 --> 00:23:10,789
grepher and badges we have access to

00:23:08,509 --> 00:23:12,499
this kind of we're getting to a point

00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:14,659
where we have easier access to this kind

00:23:12,499 --> 00:23:16,970
of metrics and evaluation about our

00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:19,159
impact and the one thing that really

00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:21,980
kind of motivated me for this was in

00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:25,309
March we had brick hack at the Rochester

00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:27,230
Institute of Technology and I remember

00:23:25,309 --> 00:23:29,989
that entire weekend like I was comparing

00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:31,460
versus like you know I read studied up

00:23:29,989 --> 00:23:33,799
on a few other events happening before

00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:35,600
then and even years in the past about

00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:37,759
how they were doing with interaction and

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,499
engagement and now the kind of like

00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:41,239
energy that I kind of was picking up on

00:23:39,499 --> 00:23:44,720
a brick kak like I remember we had about

00:23:41,239 --> 00:23:46,879
30 people scan our badge which was about

00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:50,019
attendance is roughly two hundred and

00:23:46,879 --> 00:23:53,149
sixty people which was about one

00:23:50,019 --> 00:23:54,350
somewhere but it was like oh his upper

00:23:53,149 --> 00:23:55,730
limbs a low percent he was under five

00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:58,369
percent but then you look at events like

00:23:55,730 --> 00:24:00,350
foz de mer that badge it has thousands

00:23:58,369 --> 00:24:01,639
of attendees and yeah like 70 people

00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:03,769
scan the badge and it's even even a

00:24:01,639 --> 00:24:05,350
smaller percentage and so it's kind of

00:24:03,769 --> 00:24:09,019
it's not really quite apples to apples

00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:11,809
but I feel like the event that we had it

00:24:09,019 --> 00:24:14,299
Rick kak well it wasn't as like broad

00:24:11,809 --> 00:24:16,190
amounts of people we were kind of zoning

00:24:14,299 --> 00:24:19,909
into a specific amount of like a smaller

00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:21,169
subset of the population and I feel like

00:24:19,909 --> 00:24:22,609
the impact we were having like the

00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:24,019
interest that was generated and even

00:24:22,609 --> 00:24:25,940
some of the contributions that happen

00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:27,859
later on with interest in and

00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:30,080
introductions on mailing lists and

00:24:27,859 --> 00:24:31,730
people wanting to get involved just

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,470
coming up to the fedora table at brick

00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:36,080
hack to me that was kind of the idea

00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:39,409
that maybe there's this beginning of a

00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,850
trend that where we're focusing and it's

00:24:39,409 --> 00:24:43,519
maybe maybe this is a part of the bigger

00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:45,030
discussion than just this one but may be

00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:47,490
considering wherever

00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:50,040
dressing our resources to and measuring

00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:51,450
the impact we're having not sure that

00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,950
actually has a question I was asking

00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:56,150
which was what is the end of all you're

00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:58,110
trying to hit it sounds like you're

00:24:56,150 --> 00:25:00,240
circling around the idea that the end

00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:02,550
goal is increasing control many

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,230
contributors I think then but just put

00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:05,700
it simple adding it's just an increasing

00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:07,770
a number of people exposed am using

00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:11,880
fedora and then on an excessive n again

00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:15,180
excellent exposure exposure to usage

00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:17,310
your Fedora is interesting but not as

00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:19,110
valuable as both as exposure in such a

00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:21,960
way that is providing a path to

00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:25,560
contribution which has a net possible

00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:28,470
right if I can kind of I think that's

00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:30,950
what we've been doing for the last 10

00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:33,810
years and we've got in jelly good

00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:37,140
contributor base or the other he was

00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:40,650
always like the end goal was to have the

00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:42,540
contributors and you we cut into the

00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:45,390
situation that it got conte with this

00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:47,640
that you know build something that I

00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:50,190
wouldn't say no one is using but you

00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:53,880
know come back to like for example 12

00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:56,160
this is huge this question so for me

00:25:53,880 --> 00:26:00,510
right now we should definitely go after

00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:02,160
DRS I mean we shouldn't we shouldn't be

00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:04,800
less focused on you know getting

00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:09,900
competitors but what we like I now is

00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:13,440
the mms users and stuff like that demons

00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:15,540
research division basis like yes this so

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:19,020
that both of the students they know over

00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:22,980
you or like not able to in this case for

00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:26,850
their lack of operating system this is

00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:28,890
tisha but when it comes about actually

00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:31,320
using an opening system to do something

00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:32,880
which is useful for their courses that's

00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,710
where the contribution comes from

00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,870
because after doing first if they can

00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:38,580
become contributors some project may not

00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:41,040
be federal but something which is inside

00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:44,669
the federal land at some sub project or

00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:46,290
some dates of application so like again

00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:49,290
I am speaking only from the media's

00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:52,380
point of view how we went up the number

00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:56,070
of people having transit down and then a

00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:58,710
huge drop 2009 with effort from lot of

00:26:56,070 --> 00:27:01,200
any intruders and then making sure that

00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:03,450
we get our own is part is anyway

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,000
happening like at least in India I can

00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:08,370
say or recognition but our way now it is

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,320
and it was all so that you get more

00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:12,510
conservatives because that's why we are

00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,280
lacking not like you ever miss part so I

00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:16,230
think it's much more depending on the

00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:22,890
area or the region where you're talking

00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:24,840
about now what you said is correct but i

00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:27,380
believe it's more my phone about

00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,380
religion

00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,680
and the last part we were looking at was

00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:37,050
also visibility so if this can extend to

00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:38,370
current as well as moving forward

00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:40,770
creating different possible different

00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:42,120
guidelines but establishing a commons

00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:45,120
for the campus ambassadors will be

00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:46,590
important even if I know there's a few

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,770
other examples of people using other

00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:51,570
platforms but mailing lists IRC have

00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:53,220
their role for a lot of participation

00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:55,140
and meetings and keeping the project

00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:56,490
open but perhaps there's other things we

00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,110
can do to improve the contributor

00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:00,330
experience and a lot of that is things

00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:02,430
we've already seen we have mail man with

00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:05,070
a mailman 3 with hyper kitty which is

00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:07,380
bringing in an entirely new front end to

00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:10,110
the mailing list and one of my favorites

00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:14,760
is fedora hubs which will revolutionize

00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:16,620
the contributor experience but I really

00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:18,060
am really excited on fedora hubs it's an

00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:19,590
incredible project that's bringing in

00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:21,390
all kinds of different places and

00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:23,220
bringing in these different things in

00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:24,930
these different factors of the

00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:27,900
contributor experience and tying them

00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:29,280
into a single place and I'm really

00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:32,430
excited for that because I think it's

00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:34,320
going to bring in a new kind of maybe a

00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:35,760
new kind of contributor different kinds

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,710
of contributions but it's going to make

00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,240
it I think fedora more accessible

00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:41,070
projects and I think things like fedora

00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:43,380
hubs like this is the right direction

00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:46,950
for me to improve our own visibility in

00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:48,810
our own outreach for students and at the

00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:50,430
end of the day however it's done the

00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:52,650
work that's happening needs to be seen

00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:54,120
and easily referenced reports are

00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:56,790
important of course in documenting

00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:58,260
success is absolutely important so that

00:28:56,790 --> 00:29:01,770
way you can replicate it in other places

00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:03,750
and you can see learn by example the

00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:05,820
current method right now is not the most

00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:06,960
efficient and there's other platforms

00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:09,240
are there other platforms for

00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,520
communication we could be using outside

00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:14,520
of just met vent reports even on like a

00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:16,800
blog or are there better tools could be

00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:18,840
utilized social media better and ways

00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:21,360
for this to engage with a younger

00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,860
audience to bring more people in what

00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,840
other ideas could we bring to the table

00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:26,070
for this and we kind of intentionally

00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,230
left this a little bit more open ended

00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:30,150
at the end to kind of see some other

00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:32,490
people's stops in the audience are but

00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:33,600
for that you want to get involved with

00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:36,750
any of this or throw out some of your

00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:39,240
own ideas there's the IRC channel fedora

00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:40,300
campus amb and there's also our mailing

00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,130
list campus

00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,540
rose and a quick special shout out to

00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:45,490
all ready and hack stuff for helping us

00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:47,560
prepare this talk is trying to make it a

00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:49,390
flock but it didn't work out for him but

00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:51,670
special thanks to our DN for helping us

00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:52,870
and I was wanting to kind of see if

00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:54,460
anyone else in the audience had ideas

00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:56,620
especially going forward with the

00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:58,390
bringing in new kinds of contributors

00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:02,440
like I'm a kind of topic of like fedora

00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:03,760
hubs and so because I denies I didn't

00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,190
quite get the closure i wanted on that

00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:09,550
original question but what i was looking

00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:11,800
for was really you talked about how you

00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:13,660
know dr. quo target some students

00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:16,690
students here in target system

00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:18,430
administrators here in fact here where i

00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:20,850
was hoping to hear from it was that the

00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:23,890
specific goal doing those things was to

00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:26,260
eventually contain it converts students

00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:28,420
into participants at least and

00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:29,950
contributors at best i think it's kind

00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:33,040
of a subset of the general outreach

00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:36,580
there like I mean I with sorry well I do

00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:38,770
I mean but we have a limited resources

00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:42,070
and I was just mean money or material

00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:43,840
the Perth about time people and so

00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:48,100
making sure that whatever you're doing

00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:49,540
has the it has the most impact is

00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,260
important and again I'd be a little

00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,640
concerned

00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:53,200
we spend a lot of time for using

00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:56,980
material on how to write it how to build

00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,690
a computer lab that gets used twice you

00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:00,490
know versus I think it's a lot more to

00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:03,310
be said about material to teach a

00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:07,320
teacher to teach open source that I

00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:07,320
think that I would have a huge journey

00:31:07,539 --> 00:31:12,850
to use business terms but

00:31:10,419 --> 00:31:14,200
keeping in mind the end goal is always

00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:16,379
really important in making those

00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,379
decisions

00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:22,740
so in a lot of slides you talk about

00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:25,410
things that we need so like materials

00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:29,480
for on boring who are interested in

00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:32,310
coming campus ambassadors steps to have

00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:34,920
people who are all the campuses not

00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:37,950
really just students rather like the 123

00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:40,350
process those kind of thing is there any

00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:43,020
of that existing or is that still yet to

00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:45,090
be accomplished like there are any of

00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:47,160
those materials at least in draft format

00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:50,040
somewhere such that people can start

00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:52,170
iterating on them or greeting to them or

00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:54,240
is it still just like starkman grazie

00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:56,400
elling is quite start from Ground Zero

00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,960
because we do have like the existing

00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,400
steps for becoming an ambassador there's

00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,550
a series of wiki pages you follow

00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:04,020
through but they're not exactly a

00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:05,730
something you can not saying like the

00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:07,020
speed is so out speeding through it but

00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:08,460
it's not something you can look at and

00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:10,740
like you're like okay here's the things

00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:12,420
i need to do you have six different wiki

00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:14,700
pages that have a long large amount of

00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:17,430
content so there is a there is content

00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:19,290
there but it's nothing is easily in

00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:20,730
something it's not like to the point and

00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:22,680
so synced where somebody can get idea

00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:24,660
here's the steps i need to follow here's

00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,680
my youtube right but specifically to the

00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:27,360
camera then I don't want to like the

00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:29,220
Ambassador joke I think that's a very

00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,320
debilitating to this campus outreach

00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:33,360
there's currently no materials nothing

00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:35,280
that we can easily find there's the wiki

00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,770
page it exists for it and I have tried

00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:41,160
to attempt it a rewrite of it with some

00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:43,290
more clear guidelines it kind of

00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:45,150
stagnated a little bit with is there was

00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:47,790
going to be a fat last month around

00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:49,650
raleigh for looking specifically at

00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:51,600
education i think would be causes

00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:52,770
departure it kind of mix things up a

00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,170
little bit but i think that's something

00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:56,700
that's still on the table because that

00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:58,680
was that was one that i know a spot was

00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:00,030
going he had some one of the club right

00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,790
on for that and i think it's something

00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:05,280
that's in the interest of the project to

00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:06,580
kind of look at that again and so was

00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:10,419
the goal that

00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:12,730
and or this session to kind of kick off

00:33:10,419 --> 00:33:15,460
those types of discussions to get this

00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:16,950
going yes and I think having also a

00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:19,210
fedora community leave would also

00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:22,320
contribute to helping that happen with

00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:25,179
like the rebooting the fat idea too but

00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:27,610
it's as far as like current resources go

00:33:25,179 --> 00:33:30,309
it's mostly just the same the same wiki

00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:32,769
page we've had since more or less 2009

00:33:30,309 --> 00:33:34,390
so for specific content it might be out

00:33:32,769 --> 00:33:35,710
there but from when I was trying to dig

00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:38,679
through and find it I couldn't find

00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:41,590
anything correct i leave them outside

00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:44,380
the campus ambassador term por favor

00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:47,679
wiki page like me from india like we're

00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:49,840
on a regular and he was IRC best wedding

00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:53,169
where the idea is to move people from

00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:55,049
normal users to contributors and it's 90

00:33:53,169 --> 00:33:57,490
are running so we have material ready

00:33:55,049 --> 00:33:59,470
mostly with dogs and questions open

00:33:57,490 --> 00:34:02,380
courses for students and staff which a

00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:05,110
clear plastic produce almost all of the

00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:07,450
like exit a few people everywhere else

00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:09,730
familiar and mirror again actually went

00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:12,810
to that trendy so we actually things

00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:12,810
ready can be reached

00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:23,790
so earlier the caucus Marcus was

00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:26,220
instead of trying for example for people

00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:28,380
before focus or something's for example

00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:31,110
to try to go for full developers focus

00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:34,710
on for pipe is there any thought as well

00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:37,650
for university outreach thing there's a

00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:40,410
little more focused outreach stains that

00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:42,390
at this university which includes so

00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:45,320
many different things perhaps start with

00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:45,320
a little focus for

00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:56,169
so one of the targets for the fat one of

00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:58,089
the things like the beginning steps to

00:34:56,169 --> 00:34:59,800
do this was we wanted to identify at

00:34:58,089 --> 00:35:01,480
least two ambassador or two student

00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:03,760
ambassadors from every region in the

00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:06,130
world to have at least a minimum of six

00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,540
or it was either six or twelve but to

00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:09,940
have a minimum of like this number of

00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:12,970
people who are bought in to be like the

00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:14,589
first era of campus ambassadors and they

00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:16,150
these like these were the resources they

00:35:14,589 --> 00:35:19,720
wanted to develop at the fat and to get

00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:22,030
to get created and then with these

00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:24,310
resources we train the first kind of era

00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:26,589
of and from my understanding of what the

00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:28,839
plans were it was kind of mirroring a

00:35:26,589 --> 00:35:30,310
little bit from programs like I guess

00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:32,170
kind of like Mozilla student ambassador

00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:34,839
program in a way where it's a little bit

00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:36,609
less i guess like comparing the two week

00:35:34,839 --> 00:35:38,950
between like fedoras campus ambassadors

00:35:36,609 --> 00:35:40,720
as is and like mozillas program is it's

00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:42,070
a little bit like I think it's like

00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,930
Mozilla's program is a little bit more

00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:46,300
like stepping like stepping like stairs

00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:47,890
and you're slowly doing more and more

00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:50,140
over time where it was kind of like I

00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:51,880
think a high like a high barrier for you

00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:55,359
to kind of really get going and involved

00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:56,920
with campus ambassadors and so I think

00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:59,260
that was kind of the original plan was a

00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:01,329
start small and a target at least like

00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:03,819
find two and two or three students from

00:36:01,329 --> 00:36:05,440
every region of the world and work with

00:36:03,819 --> 00:36:06,910
them on a very personal level to help

00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,069
train them up and provide them with

00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:11,170
specific resources and target their

00:36:09,069 --> 00:36:14,079
specific needs and then go forward from

00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:15,819
that and start working on training more

00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:17,800
with the two with the two or three

00:36:15,819 --> 00:36:19,810
ambassadors from each region and going

00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,220
forward from there so I think that's

00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:24,060
kind of the direction that they wanted

00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:24,060
to go in the beginning

00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:33,230
you're keen on getting it

00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:35,600
but people are they know what things

00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:38,990
they can move on to Dora people they do

00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:42,309
know that arises a very insistent for

00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:44,920
the robotics world competition

00:36:42,309 --> 00:36:48,160
so saying these things to them and

00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:50,699
marketing those are yes it could be a

00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,699
part of

00:36:56,319 --> 00:37:04,190
silly thing to go around actually what

00:37:01,849 --> 00:37:07,940
was the drama that you could sign up and

00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:10,039
be on the list of companies

00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:12,829
organizations with a definite limit by

00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:19,190
the well then you can stay like a we are

00:37:12,829 --> 00:37:20,720
using Facebook is this may help but I

00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:23,839
think there was some affiliates

00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:25,279
discussion her friends a fedora yeah

00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:27,920
it's an ongoing discussion in marketing

00:37:25,279 --> 00:37:35,660
right now or kind of stepping a little

00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:39,470
bit but definitely ok so now I might

00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:43,760
sound a little bad but i will say now so

00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:46,460
I'm sorry for one since I have heard

00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:48,799
about ambassadors campus stop I was

00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:51,810
always interested I'm very active on our

00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:55,500
university I teach there i was a student

00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:59,340
smoothly and I'm an ambassador but I

00:37:55,500 --> 00:38:01,170
have zero clue what shall I Jean as a

00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:03,390
campus ambassador or whatever my

00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:06,230
activities showing and as an IT

00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:09,000
university so creating a federal lab as

00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:11,100
nonsense it doesn't make any sense for

00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,630
those guys to have a fedora because

00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:14,520
everybody has their own computing and

00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:17,160
stuff and I sign up for something

00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:19,530
somewhere and leaking now there is a

00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:22,110
mailing list I don't even know about it

00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:26,130
and I thought this talk will give me

00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:29,670
some insight about slightly but i still

00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:35,850
have zero knowledge is there is

00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:37,470
something when you see me as a person or

00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:40,380
is it like a larger group is there any

00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:43,140
activity happening I can join to be in a

00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:45,530
picture or this is still like walking in

00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:50,720
the dark and you just want something but

00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:55,580
what's the target as we seen for steel

00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:59,120
sorry like a nice idea but nothing to

00:38:55,580 --> 00:39:02,240
touch sorry for being harsh no that's

00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:04,220
perfectly fine so i think is really like

00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:06,350
the key question on like the akademi

00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:08,840
actions right where did what what what

00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:10,160
to go from here and i think that this is

00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:12,260
definitely something that was like was

00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:14,720
kind of on the verge of happening and

00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:16,250
until a few weeks are really a few weeks

00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,780
ago was that was really looking forward

00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:19,630
to that fad happening and i was hoping

00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:21,800
to really have like resources available

00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:23,990
so i think right now the current thing

00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:25,490
would be did half like bring those plans

00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:26,690
back and i think having a fedora

00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:28,100
community would be one thing i would

00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:30,770
help with that doesn't have to

00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,970
necessarily be the fix all solution but

00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:34,100
i really would like to bring this like

00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:35,870
make this fab a reality again and bring

00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:37,520
it back on the discussion table because

00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:39,320
i think having the the in-person

00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,330
collaboration and focusing on like

00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:42,970
creating the beginning resources or

00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:45,170
discussing how to go about that and

00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:47,120
making a final are making something a

00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:48,620
deliverable of people like regular

00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:50,870
ambassadors who are interested in this

00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:52,490
and they want to participate having

00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:55,070
those resources is a huge thing because

00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:57,740
that's what's going to really start

00:39:55,070 --> 00:40:03,980
making this happen that how do we do

00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:05,450
that okay how does how do we have we so

00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:08,270
there was a bad that's what's happened

00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:11,060
and then Remy love how we make it happen

00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:13,400
again like it was close to home all was

00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:17,690
their budget for that it was going to be

00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:20,870
a local one to raleigh no budget let's

00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:25,480
do it graph to the castle I think that's

00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:25,480
the next step or as low budget

00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:39,480
so I think I could pipe go and take an

00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:41,460
action to bring that back on to the

00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:50,550
council ticket to and help bring some

00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:53,610
direction to that yes in pocket what

00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:57,090
Stevens are there yet I wanted to point

00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:59,850
out that it's really important to see if

00:40:57,090 --> 00:41:02,460
he's going to work out I mean it would

00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:05,310
be pointless to reach out to invest this

00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:08,190
shut up the labs and then no one is

00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:10,020
going to use them so I believe that the

00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:11,520
focal team is going to play a very

00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:13,980
important role in this I mean we need

00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:16,020
pictures with professors or would be

00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:18,330
very motivated very passionate about

00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:20,900
this not incorporating with us with

00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:23,550
their community to make this happen and

00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:24,870
if we manage to do that okay first of

00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:28,290
all we need to to function specific

00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:30,900
universities we should not just yet I'm

00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:32,400
so hostage every parent's try to result

00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:34,770
in to other universities going to focus

00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,290
on specific universities where we have

00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:39,750
contacts with the property and we need

00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:42,390
to make sure that they can help us and

00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:44,310
if we succeed in doing that not only the

00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:47,310
students will start using fedora in

00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:49,200
their lives but you know students are

00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:51,840
very important target group and we're

00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:53,760
probably going to get a lot lots of time

00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:56,550
as contributors that was one thing that

00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,440
we did create a few months ago maybe one

00:41:56,550 --> 00:42:01,080
or two as we have a having a roll call

00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:02,640
for camp are people interested in doing

00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,930
that I know a few of you in the room of

00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,670
who asked questions have you added your

00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:07,710
name to that list to on the university

00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:09,030
involvement initiative page and so we

00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:10,050
kind of have a query of the people who

00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:12,330
are interested to help drive this

00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:14,660
forward to so its information we have

00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:18,300
available I think we we had at least the

00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:20,280
exception of a cup I think one or two

00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:21,690
regions I guess we'll probably could use

00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,400
better communication this really comes

00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:25,020
down to but we do have at least a few

00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:27,000
people across a few different regions

00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:30,510
who are actively interested in paying

00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,970
attention to this or who are ready to be

00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:35,010
you know provided with resources and

00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:37,760
guidance to how they can proceed with

00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:37,760
going forward with this

00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:57,090
so yeah question because so many

00:42:53,630 --> 00:43:00,240
universities to a country bar / mt a

00:42:57,090 --> 00:43:04,680
national time embracing that when you

00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:08,630
talk to the professor the teachers they

00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:12,300
say no but forget about wings forever

00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:20,520
because it's not you it's not using

00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:22,890
professional you want them something

00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:28,050
useful you need to learn something that

00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:32,580
works that you will use in your future

00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:36,630
trap is that way universities in us that

00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:39,480
the teacher training happened mera

00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:41,850
someone say oh yes that's very nice

00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:45,000
words very well but not allowed because

00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:50,040
you won't use this your work you need to

00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:54,450
learn whatever because this is a useful

00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:59,240
thing because we're going to react with

00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:59,240
felt that happens

00:44:00,809 --> 00:44:06,720
yes

00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:11,400
anyway we'll see that I have a little

00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:12,990
advantage of these switches i have i've

00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:16,770
worked in universities in the US so i've

00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:18,900
seen a little bit of that but as most of

00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:21,180
us universities are more focused on

00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:23,280
theoretical so it doesn't matter so much

00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:25,860
which thing it is unless I'm a hands-on

00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:28,530
thing like that but either one that

00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:31,140
hands-on a pretty good response is that

00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:34,110
Fedora is the upstream of record res

00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:36,650
Linux which is the number one lens for

00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:38,809
serious jobs that you

00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:41,029
and if you have fit or knowledge that

00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:42,920
will translate very well to knowledge in

00:44:41,029 --> 00:44:45,770
a job in the future and if you're

00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:48,589
looking for a job in the future after

00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:50,599
you're done with your education starting

00:44:48,589 --> 00:44:53,539
on fedora will put you breaking the

00:44:50,599 --> 00:44:56,390
place to be right tiny the new

00:44:53,539 --> 00:44:59,779
technology when that comes through the

00:44:56,390 --> 00:45:01,640
downstream filters so that's an answer

00:44:59,779 --> 00:45:07,240
to what you can tell

00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:09,250
but I don't know how the solution for an

00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:14,210
exhibition

00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:18,320
if that was dynamic university in the

00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:20,210
haze or if it was different because i

00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:21,119
think it is different because the

00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:24,390
different

00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:26,519
hands-on skills is abstract thing

00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:31,460
they're in places where they're still

00:45:26,519 --> 00:45:34,340
teaching you know tru64 unix or whatever

00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:36,130
happen to have and all the same tnx are

00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:40,110
they

00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:40,110
teaching out of a book the matter

00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:44,510
we're down to the last three minutes so

00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:48,280
we can I have time for maybe two more

00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:48,280
questions where's

00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:54,700
one question that I have any business

00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:58,700
coach about my own experiences with

00:45:54,700 --> 00:46:00,740
academia to answer the question of why

00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:02,150
sure professor care whether or not their

00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:03,590
students are using open source why

00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:06,200
should they bother putting forth this

00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:09,620
effort for the question of how how do we

00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:12,080
find these people but I have had

00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:13,580
conversations with academics before

00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:16,310
where the question who basically comes

00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:20,270
down to what's in it for them do we have

00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:22,190
an answer that I think right now at

00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:23,720
least in the immediate sense that would

00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:24,920
probably a good thing to address in the

00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:26,120
beginning I think it would five start

00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,500
with people who like the professors who

00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,880
already have that intrinsic interest

00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:31,010
like some of the people who are here

00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:33,560
right now or in the teaching field

00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:35,570
starting with people who have that in

00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:37,340
like the intrinsic interest to teach it

00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:40,610
and to spread it I think that would be

00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:43,160
where you pie out to start with honest I

00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:45,050
have a good answer for that as far as

00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:47,120
where to go beyond that but I think that

00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:48,500
would be something that would be a very

00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:50,180
good thing to bring into discussion too

00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:52,490
so we don't have to depend on people who

00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:55,250
happen to like open source and fedora

00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:57,200
and are also professor is going beyond

00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:59,120
that to like if it's a student going to

00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:01,520
a professor trying to convince the

00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:03,740
professor or the faculty member that it

00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:05,960
is important for oh yes to be a good

00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:08,600
thing to bring in and to use I know what

00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:09,770
university is very much a window shop if

00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:11,630
you want to do something that's not

00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:15,530
windows you will have an up mountain

00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:17,010
battle so and i don't i know i think

00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:19,260
that i don't know where the

00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:21,480
the exception or the role or either

00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:23,060
right but those places to exist where

00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:25,380
the problem isn't going to be with

00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:28,650
faculty members it's convincing them to

00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:31,770
start fighting that battle with my team

00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:33,030
right this is program called posse the

00:47:31,770 --> 00:47:35,550
professor's open source software

00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:38,190
experience and i just googled around for

00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:39,600
it looks like it kind of putter doubt a

00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:42,150
couple years ago but i was involved with

00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:44,130
that MRI tea and it looks like a habitat

00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:46,710
about other universities and it was an

00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:49,080
awesome boot camp or sat down i had two

00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:51,270
professors next to me and by the end of

00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:52,770
the day we had true Padgett submitted up

00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:55,920
straining and it seems like a really

00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:58,710
valuable program but the oil can see was

00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:00,630
the vehicle for the teaching at a time I

00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:02,280
don't know if we have something like

00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:05,580
that that we can just bring to a much

00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:08,460
professor in nitrogen so we got to die

00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:10,980
down with the regular of communicating

00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:13,230
from their hat but what this person was

00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:15,090
very speed like he's from grand in

00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:16,890
Singapore and he's actually speed up

00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:18,870
here on the same for sister I know in

00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:21,150
her back in universities because we

00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:23,760
receive emails that he stand you get a

00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:25,710
few of these of contributors who go to

00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:28,470
the spa edges and do the similar process

00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:31,080
stuff because you same things first it

00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:35,280
was a very good example of how to teach

00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:37,200
reach the teachers and I have two more

00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:41,000
inputs for you in general but I want to

00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:41,000
say that after you turn off the vehicle

00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:55,560
very very popular a number of

00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:57,780
universities around and they have

00:48:55,560 --> 00:49:00,540
communities that they have two weeks

00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:02,670
when students can come and to meet or

00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:07,140
any other sense they're all afraid of

00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:08,430
people who work for fedora so they work

00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:16,980
with the students and give them some

00:49:08,430 --> 00:49:18,780
task and it was obviously I hadn't

00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:21,000
considered but seeing as is already kind

00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:22,470
of like a beginning interest there or

00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,930
there's something to kind of go off of

00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:26,460
to begin with um I think that something

00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:28,590
that's probably worth considering at the

00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:31,950
get-go or having a focus on for like

00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:35,460
graduate students and and beyond we are

00:49:31,950 --> 00:49:36,990
out of time for the session off anyone

00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:38,730
out there is nothing else after this so

00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:42,530
I'd be okay with sticking around it i

00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:42,530
