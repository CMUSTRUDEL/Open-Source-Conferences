Title: Flock 2016 - University Outreach: New task or new mindset?, Justin W. Flory and Jona Azizaj
Publication date: 2016-08-21
Playlist: Flock 2016
Description: 
	In early 2015, the Fedora Council proposed a new objective: the University Involvement Initiative. The purpose? Try to increase exposure of Fedora in university settings to gain new users, but also to hopefully gain new contributors. In order to accomplish this, is it a new task, or does it require a new mindset? In this talk, we begin looking at the current mindset and marketing thoughts around attracting university students to Fedora. What is working? What isn't? We will look at personal experiences among the presenters with getting involved with Fedora as a student for an example. We will focus on how changing the ways we approach reaching out to students might be the best way to begin making an impact on students with Fedora.
