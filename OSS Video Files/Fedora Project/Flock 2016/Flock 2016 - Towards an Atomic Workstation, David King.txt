Title: Flock 2016 - Towards an Atomic Workstation, David King
Publication date: 2016-08-21
Playlist: Flock 2016
Description: 
	Project Atomic has been applied to the Fedora Cloud product, and GNOME upstream has been using a similar system called Continuous, both of which are based on ostree; now it's time for Fedora Workstation to get the same treatment! I will discuss what an Atomic Workstation is, why it is useful and how to test and contribute.
