Title: Flock 2016 - Packaging Chromium for Fedora, Paweł Hajdan, Jr.
Publication date: 2016-08-21
Playlist: Flock 2016
Description: 
	Although the popular Google Chrome web browser is official supported in Fedora, there are users interested in its fully open source version - Chromium. In 2009 an article called "Chromium: Why it isn't in Fedora yet as a proper package" was published by Tom Callaway, and even now there's still no official Chromium package for Fedora. In this presentation, Paweł Hajdan, Jr. will review the current state of Chromium packaging, including support for system libraries, new build systems (GN), and better cooperation with wide open source community. It'll be an updated version of LinuxCon 2014 talk http://sched.co/1yFa8g9 , with focus on Fedora. Paweł is a Chromium project developer since 2008. He got a job working on Google Chrome after becoming the first committer from outside the company. Leading a small team of Gentoo Linux developers packaging Chromium, he also helps other Linux distribution developers. Paweł earned a master's degree in computer science from University of Warsaw.
