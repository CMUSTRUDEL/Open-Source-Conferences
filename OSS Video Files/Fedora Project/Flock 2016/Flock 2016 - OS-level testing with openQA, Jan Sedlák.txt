Description: 
	Rapidly develop robust scenarios using just your browser and a few lines of script. Currently used by the FedoraQE team for CI testing of the new Fedora releases and builds, saving the precious resources and allowing us to focus on the other cool stuff too. "Doing something constructive at once is better than figuring out the best thing to do hours later." -- Robert A. Heinlein
