Title: Flock 2016 - Using Fedora Atomic as workstation, Patrick Uiterwijk
Publication date: 2016-08-21
Playlist: Flock 2016
Description: 
	I have been running a custom RPM-OSTree as my main workstation for a few months by this point. Here I will explain how I've built my own tree, what it's like to have a read only main workstation, why you would want to, and how I still get a lot of software developed on a system where I cannot install additional packages.
