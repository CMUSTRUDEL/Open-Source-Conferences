happy for me also together if you ever

00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:33,899
times some new verse that's not yet and

00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:42,690
just so thoroughly with it as the quick

00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:45,960
exercise fortunately it is another will

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:48,690
address the simple question for you you

00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:55,289
think that people can call security if

00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:59,340
so just who are a la now in the care I

00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:03,000
guess maybe other yeah unfortunately

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:08,240
they don't care about security even they

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:15,500
are super nervous so it's it is so good

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:20,130
but either sell even so defining yeah so

00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:22,490
to learn together with do cause we will

00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,490
study

00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,710
performance and usability

00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:39,190
okay I'm Jupiter originally okay yeah

00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:42,200
okay today we will schedule during this

00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:46,900
similar disability and performance

00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:51,280
improvement and javi the husband or

00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:57,020
always before bra and other people's

00:01:51,280 --> 00:02:02,050
fair a security in girl so in the first

00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:02,050
identities because the security or fire

00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:12,440
power security issues rights and stance

00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:15,470
or SME sir have you would be security

00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:19,150
issues from a second traffic I like the

00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:26,140
typical we return you without notice it

00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:29,120
is a very amazing horse is amazing

00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:32,750
amazing energy and a half assume will

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:35,920
help you either shop the butcher trophy

00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:40,630
is it's also my favorite topic because

00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:44,709
we go telling women that s is more heavy

00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:44,709
I understand you Lisa

00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:57,209
us and before discussion and different

00:02:48,540 --> 00:03:02,340
questions too casual how we pursue

00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:09,989
policy and you decide you are you are

00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:16,049
everything for Laura ok so that's out if

00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:35,510
I security I use these parents as well

00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:39,090
ever so hard and so after death

00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:42,629
associate with this true and they

00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:50,400
started and it's too late that they

00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:56,280
start to death in the devices already

00:03:50,400 --> 00:04:00,359
atop so and in the time they start to

00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:04,229
ask they start to ask Hodgins it will be

00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:09,690
hungry security issues a technique and

00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:17,370
they're Christians so for example we use

00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:19,810
my data livery my turtle medicine only

00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:25,540
never I first

00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:28,780
and i bet i can tell you after the

00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:31,660
rotational so the next question is could

00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:39,300
be remarked accountants tara with versa

00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:42,400
or is my head of yours going anyhow and

00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:46,480
sororities artistic institutions very

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:50,910
rustic and protected from these signal

00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:54,940
issues i think i need to think more

00:04:50,910 --> 00:05:00,790
question my abilities are representative

00:04:54,940 --> 00:05:06,130
so and well because you have to go ahead

00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:08,410
with people as purchase the stopwatch

00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:10,479
where the security if you stuff wrong

00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:17,530
what do we let you take you confuse

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:28,510
patel everywhere and access okay thank

00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:30,630
you ah they have your way from several

00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,630
others

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:43,940
they go down and if I be a mistake I

00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:48,020
started to cut and I started to our

00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:55,229
Holies how are these acute issues fixed

00:05:48,020 --> 00:06:02,250
it's simple I guess people also without

00:05:55,229 --> 00:06:05,760
the ass ok so here everything about this

00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:09,570
city it's 0 either you security issues

00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:12,240
issue appears the timeline the

00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:17,100
department when your system is a

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:22,250
perfectly recorded the creditor window

00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:25,840
Bona Bona benefit so it is your nose

00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:29,080
because I ever so

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:33,150
perfectly or later can be found on the

00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:38,410
internet and we can use better guard and

00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:47,169
so on and during them during the time so

00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:52,530
x equals the work or on a fix indiana

00:06:47,169 --> 00:07:03,070
fix with the quantities and we release

00:06:52,530 --> 00:07:07,360
with Amarista sticks in the hurry if you

00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:10,300
have a glue some data so what is

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:13,360
reported important companies that your

00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:19,090
system is not likely for consequences of

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:20,950
exports during the time you wanna go for

00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:26,889
everything it's really important to

00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:31,000
understand and hear em you know where

00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:37,000
the security of us to the day ready

00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:41,080
security the river has a lower energy so

00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:47,530
what does it mean 30 security helps you

00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:52,090
and perfect your system in the result if

00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:54,479
your doors are open so can give you an

00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:54,479
example

00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:12,130
big surprise that I would say so yes a

00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:15,010
sueance when private security your spell

00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:20,350
of is protective protein sequences of

00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:25,860
export and sm is good manhood thank you

00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:29,470
bro 40 desperately stability so I

00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:31,720
services security enhanced Lewis is a

00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:35,220
significant distance bring umbrella

00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:38,710
security for our system so we assume

00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:47,250
your system is perfectly certain

00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:48,940
sentences provinces of experts with away

00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:56,670
you know

00:08:48,940 --> 00:09:04,770
I HDD party members death and just your

00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:04,770
google yeah okay so so whatever level

00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:15,330
expose weed whenever you are able

00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:24,030
process that from one unit to another

00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:24,030
machine so another event to be starting

00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,900
soon

00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:35,760
he'll help you help you the two previous

00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:40,350
discussions on a second condition blood

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:48,050
vs Empire understand so it's very good

00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:51,900
and for example trouser is Braga and and

00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:58,560
assume this amazing and we will show you

00:09:51,900 --> 00:10:02,100
how have you the church oh thank you so

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:04,940
hacking time how many of you normal

00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:10,440
short rock and some technical background

00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:15,240
okay so 12 reminder the point of the

00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:18,090
show is dead after the moment variable

00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,800
after the semicolon you can add any

00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:22,920
arbitrary comment and this command good

00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:25,530
Louis executed so I also use these

00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:29,510
exploit to show you the example how

00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:35,820
things can be hot sellers can be

00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:38,760
powerful so I stand within 7 on this

00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:41,970
server days web server and although that

00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:44,130
service is CGI indiscreet and on the

00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:44,649
other side enough exercise I will start

00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:48,160
missing

00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:50,319
9999 and though i'll try to collect from

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:55,269
the victim machine to do to the otakon

00:10:50,319 --> 00:11:03,449
and get the shelter so let's go look I

00:10:55,269 --> 00:11:03,449
see ya

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:21,410
so in this shower is a written tamanna

00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:25,290
and here is a perkin-elmer Kelly is and

00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:29,010
ok so I start listening using the left

00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:36,170
panel and now I'm listening it's finders

00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:39,360
Bushido even bigger ok and ok so now I

00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:42,330
sent HTTP requests and you can see after

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,070
the simple very easy the direction is

00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:50,550
that standard oculars number it goes

00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:52,980
immediately to work 99 99 so I also cute

00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:58,920
it and here you can see I get them in

00:11:52,980 --> 00:12:04,070
there so I can I decide when I there or

00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:10,260
I can get some thousand et Cie example

00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:12,420
yeah you see ok so this was the case

00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:16,760
with the biggest-selling lips in

00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:24,570
tennessee work under all the victim side

00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:32,179
as you can see so i switched to FFC so

00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:36,689
therefore wrong ok so we tried again

00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:38,519
yes again i sent the HTTP request and as

00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:43,889
you can see I've done get it done in

00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:48,869
here and for example we can travel at

00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:52,199
least ABC's under all the server yeah

00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:55,619
and the less impact on your browser and

00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:59,339
we can see that some I see some CGI

00:12:55,619 --> 00:13:03,839
script with varying perfect design

00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:06,689
collect and on tcp port 9999 and

00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:09,359
disposes rebel and tables management 40

00:13:06,689 --> 00:13:13,459
and this is not allowed in policy

00:13:09,359 --> 00:13:17,100
service finish protects the system yeah

00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:24,449
so these are from you by and is your

00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:26,549
legal in here sorry for that i love the

00:13:24,449 --> 00:13:29,239
conclusion the preparation of this demo

00:13:26,549 --> 00:13:29,239
is that way

00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:19,900
awesomes of 0 also with their new

00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:22,420
examples the arrival process secure for

00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:26,230
example yeah its internal configuration

00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:29,800
of the other of the system of the victim

00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:34,530
seven awesome and my hair erotica is to

00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,530
use the box of it I don't even know

00:14:35,959 --> 00:15:00,979
as far as i know that yes okay so not

00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:00,979
now because

00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:11,910
I use also confined users and on my

00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:15,330
system and I have the buoy which arise

00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:18,120
to to begin with religious condemns all

00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:31,350
awesome or sample is Eastern all on my

00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:35,100
system so I less people it is you see

00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:40,010
that income pig farm I yeah my seven is

00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:40,010
enforcing object haha

00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:12,410
remember yeah I know about these first

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,410
from the singles measure

00:16:15,739 --> 00:16:23,179
is he here I discussing on the steam

00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:31,019
upstream and the fish from github zone

00:16:23,179 --> 00:16:36,499
okay to do that so I ever going to use

00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:41,540
for it right now I will introduce last

00:16:36,499 --> 00:16:45,329
the last we are integers be improving

00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:48,540
and I will describe several the first

00:16:45,329 --> 00:16:52,889
one we interview is very big performance

00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:56,910
gains so vigorously if you have to

00:16:52,889 --> 00:16:59,389
restart the policy or the tycoon disable

00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,389
or enable

00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:12,100
a book of the voicing which means he'll

00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:14,339
dr. Leonard appointee you have you could

00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,339
come

00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:45,330
fortunately

00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:16,650
install the poinciana you decipher no

00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:22,330
remember in this case look at me see

00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:26,940
your eater to approximately 20

00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:29,940
seconds currently he will stop or

00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:35,020
annoyed when you're older until

00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:43,090
approximately five seconds so it was

00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:45,430
rearranged services anesthesia of the

00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:48,700
type of the performance

00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:55,480
is it my man so I think it is really is

00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:59,950
a really huge and that is the weather

00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:04,740
better oh I don't say you can do

00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:07,570
something then so what's written about

00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:13,710
how did you guys make it how much faster

00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:13,710
oh you recovered

00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:23,850
in disguise for her fail with some some

00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:29,080
system working under estimate move and

00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:31,600
they realize level structure so that

00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:36,659
Americans because we depend whose

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:41,539
language it was hard to do some

00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:41,539
oh really late so

00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:51,400
that

00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,400
it's alisa

00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,710
williams prelate face

00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,730
through the night

00:20:29,509 --> 00:20:38,219
so disappear because you either a

00:20:34,999 --> 00:20:44,450
hundred on all estimates policies and

00:20:38,219 --> 00:20:49,109
you guys will call later and mr. heater

00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:54,470
with summer there are numbers an example

00:20:49,109 --> 00:21:00,049
so pure sweet factory star or example

00:20:54,470 --> 00:21:03,950
singles architect each you will get fair

00:21:00,049 --> 00:21:07,520
and you failed you forever before a

00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:16,820
decision will be ready for an error

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:20,720
message we shift our own dr. pulsing in

00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:25,340
distance and if you try to list all the

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:36,100
casinos you can turn the bass you should

00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:41,230
already look at me see and you override

00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:45,740
default good so there are bikinis

00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:50,289
currently we will stop the casinos and

00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:54,789
we very New York and the lessons policy

00:21:50,289 --> 00:21:58,250
you can see to the policies or system

00:21:54,789 --> 00:22:03,110
you can see the before youth solution

00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:05,510
policy with 100 right thing and we can

00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:09,520
see another two points it is 400

00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:09,520
priority so you

00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:18,160
in the same I there is no holy you can

00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:20,950
install your package in this case you

00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:25,780
can start of excellence and then over

00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:30,220
there and even though you are look at so

00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:34,240
police in Russia this point is it wins

00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:38,650
because there's higher priority and let

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:43,860
about several so we are able to assign

00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:50,020
where is two modules so we go eat

00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:54,100
adopted and we perfectly you know the

00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:58,860
middle structure and I fun memories so

00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:58,860
reserve is very cool with something here

00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:15,260
how to cheat on policy and use these

00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:22,460
priorities Phil okay the boundaries will

00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:28,910
be fine fellow la ciudad if you have

00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:37,570
idea Nicola somewhere that said before

00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:41,090
parities is a new path and you have to

00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:45,650
have to respond before therapies the

00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:48,890
first part is 100 peyote if it's the it

00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:53,980
will be for system modules which our own

00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:57,770
policy epic surf on the recent policy

00:23:53,980 --> 00:24:00,940
there is a point which we use in the

00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:05,300
essence polycystic fire and we directly

00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:09,530
because one hand apparently the seconds

00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:12,679
to dance penalty for your honey's coming

00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:17,660
from other piggies come from your from

00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:21,110
your other kitties and rivers in spinel

00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:22,860
your surprise and again I have to be

00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:27,590
defined 200

00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:34,049
is the first one is creating positive

00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:36,750
it's a disorder that and we're all the

00:24:34,049 --> 00:24:39,450
food yourself with the poverty of

00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:44,420
control a signal food so if you

00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:48,510
especially with such as view use

00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:54,980
primarily an Oracle is a default is

00:24:48,510 --> 00:25:02,940
foreign fell before your roofies so you

00:24:54,980 --> 00:25:06,929
even find directly so fabulous we were

00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:10,470
already room yeah so it is a bribe we

00:25:06,929 --> 00:25:14,410
are working on municipal de pedreira for

00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:16,470
laughs so Google

00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:16,470
Oh

00:25:26,179 --> 00:25:38,720
oh this market so I ran out of the loud

00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:42,820
all of that yeah so actually not say now

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,820
you need to run as module dash x

00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:56,150
you know that there will be voluntarily

00:25:48,050 --> 00:26:01,690
by default yeah so okay drama which is

00:25:56,150 --> 00:26:07,840
near programming language both civil and

00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:13,580
I like seriously you try to run home

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:18,190
porcelain toilet yes yes sometimes it

00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:21,860
yet this is complicated so for example i

00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:25,100
was trying to remove to revolution to

00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:30,670
fix our sample some of issues so my

00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:34,850
career overseas my sandboxes of tea ya

00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:37,820
 rumor and some the partisans it's

00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:42,910
sometimes it's restaurant a different

00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:46,940
effect but is being sometime after that

00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:52,670
you need profile that the principal

00:26:46,940 --> 00:27:00,190
you're refusing see reduced extreme even

00:26:52,670 --> 00:27:00,190
realize Massimo PP which is already is

00:27:02,499 --> 00:27:11,299
105 and this is our mission is not

00:27:07,609 --> 00:27:16,190
familiar and hydraulic and after that

00:27:11,299 --> 00:27:22,970
you will you wrote it you know these are

00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:28,369
typically five horses and this is a

00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:33,559
tragic so how'd we do so we have the

00:27:28,369 --> 00:27:38,149
solvency files using SMS to me you can

00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:42,049
adjust PPP then it's a higher hand it is

00:27:38,149 --> 00:27:49,609
a little after that you're a single

00:27:42,049 --> 00:27:53,899
command the policing is level and this

00:27:49,609 --> 00:27:57,049
policy is after that will be awesome to

00:27:53,899 --> 00:28:01,789
the tunnel so too many steps so it's

00:27:57,049 --> 00:28:05,179
also a reason why need to 20 person like

00:28:01,789 --> 00:28:09,200
me seconds before that who is the car

00:28:05,179 --> 00:28:15,619
estate the Palestine is you just before

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:19,210
I lost below it through and give us yo

00:28:15,619 --> 00:28:19,210
Tony so

00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:34,650
that's good the result so far no we just

00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:38,100
do not fear you lose a single plan and

00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:44,160
the pulse eternally and will turn out

00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:47,930
and it's imperative language so we have

00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:55,040
written in family whose conduct against

00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:55,040
Maori language week on the pp and

00:28:55,490 --> 00:29:04,290
there's a potential for higher than

00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:08,100
English you can run double jogging every

00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:11,400
everything good to the world so there is

00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:15,860
a picture so we are integrating language

00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:23,690
and there is a possibility to write you

00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:23,690
are surfing surfer Roberto Yeshua

00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:36,330
itself is being used for local schools

00:29:31,529 --> 00:29:41,309
so we can divide something by i launched

00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:46,259
in that summer I want to read a lot yeah

00:29:41,309 --> 00:29:53,369
if a man well I'll arrange it so device

00:29:46,259 --> 00:29:56,730
because I but without them so the little

00:29:53,369 --> 00:30:02,179
bit for us and Google's is react it's

00:29:56,730 --> 00:30:02,179
literally into the Rockland is

00:30:04,779 --> 00:30:21,340
so it's time and Burrell 7 yes yeah yeah

00:30:25,659 --> 00:30:36,340
yeah figure I'll be bribed

00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:40,950
oh my god keep reading

00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:40,950
so aspect is most people are right

00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:27,650
you needed updating this field 23

00:31:29,059 --> 00:31:33,229
but you know

00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:43,680
yes only thing is our response for this

00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:47,610
little Harley that we have yes Sebastian

00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:51,630
Bach some minor box so the boy is the

00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:56,570
serum stay here so apparently has no

00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:59,790
biggie and we have a foolish person

00:31:56,570 --> 00:32:08,420
because of each person these duplicate

00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:15,660
Avars to see at the film files and these

00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:18,960
 cause I and are useful I will

00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:22,260
prepare policy by Oracle seeing huge

00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:24,840
spikes so it's tough on every specimen

00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:29,610
serviceability improvements they come

00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:36,150
from they come from the new structure

00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:40,860
who knows in stature but also father

00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:44,540
were good has a backer another you know

00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:48,780
in all the risks and he described it

00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:50,029
with some examples okay so he's behind

00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:54,830
these changes

00:32:50,029 --> 00:32:57,399
I read so what do you use myself I was

00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:57,399
no solid

00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:10,170
still be with the peasants former you

00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:17,230
see that piece is that he talked about

00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:23,700
his new space down because the spicy

00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:23,700
Ganges successfully replacing me with

00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:48,160
his intern andrew is a beautiful here

00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:51,430
you God so let's focus and study sauce

00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:54,580
yeah so we're talking about a lot of

00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:56,950
food starving in a students and the

00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:59,230
question is where can we find all these

00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:02,280
all these policies in in pepperell and

00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:06,370
the answer is pretty simple we can

00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:11,080
entertain sense for nice efef NPM

00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:14,200
package and we call this we call this

00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:18,130
policy district policy and this

00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:22,690
Disturbia C is adjusted for her

00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:24,570
especially photograph and this offensive

00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:28,990
contains

00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:33,250
mainly the face is for parents like an

00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:36,520
assist andy and then it will also

00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:42,369
contain spaces for comedy marathi DVD

00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:46,450
DVD a society now and then it also

00:34:42,369 --> 00:34:49,599
contains the user domains of 70 futures

00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:53,500
right to a user Sicily or best for

00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:57,070
example this sir percy does not contain

00:34:53,500 --> 00:35:00,010
any any any policies for third-party

00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:05,800
components this means if you don't have

00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:08,500
any application or or some demon when

00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:12,700
you remain a bit and in stomach and a

00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:17,950
system will be missing you have this rep

00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:21,160
elysium the least among us go find

00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:25,990
another animal and you need to run over

00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:28,480
privacy for this we are trying to cover

00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:32,250
all demons in official federal

00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:37,359
facilities in federal 23 and federal a

00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:44,080
24 we have around 470 sandwich menus

00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:46,420
which is it is not okay so the next

00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:51,480
question is where i can find these

00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:51,480
sources and we are it have

00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:58,920
relax and lay depositary concerns MCM L

00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:03,220
such policies or reach you can find

00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:07,170
federoth in the store there and there

00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:10,330
are some beliefs and if I hissing Hal

00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:19,630
computer or how you package this fantasy

00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:23,830
you can pre government and read it so ok

00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:27,220
maritime girl found out that email we

00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:32,590
never have to write and salute spicy and

00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:35,650
less lover this subscribe easy because I

00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:38,050
believe everybody here listen I read

00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:41,290
some some some recommended by writing

00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:46,150
also needs policy from the resolution

00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:50,590
from them but then a question is can we

00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:53,020
ship this medal easily and I send us any

00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:58,060
sudden it's also very easy and I show

00:36:53,020 --> 00:37:01,310
you how to do that so you can see we are

00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:04,640
named as a package of the

00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:08,870

00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:32,050
seal on a second no no this this change

00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:34,340
is the people using their abilities are

00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:39,230
sometimes you will see in the spec five

00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:44,540
high rise higher semi but it is this

00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:47,450
cooler solution ok so another example

00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:51,230
and you can try this tower Booker on

00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:54,290

make it let's go thank you so as you can

00:37:57,710 --> 00:38:02,960

your daughter yeah and I try I will

00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:08,109
assume of your comment and

00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:11,390
in our group which means there is no

00:38:08,109 --> 00:38:15,500
doctrine of you long needed to the panel

00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:17,809
and then I stop water and the packages

00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:20,839
are installed by the most important for

00:38:17,809 --> 00:38:24,770
our now is dr. SC peanuts package and

00:38:20,839 --> 00:38:28,000
then you see if you stop and then I am a

00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:31,539
senior group and we see these these

00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:35,750
savage model allows it to the colonel

00:38:31,539 --> 00:38:38,359
okay so she figure on excellence not

00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:42,230
your brain several benefits the first

00:38:38,359 --> 00:38:45,079
one in stages in in policy can be

00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:48,260
notified immediately and that means that

00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:52,160
you may need to write the rival library

00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:56,630
so much methanol is me with your fix

00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:59,210
militia when we are also independent

00:38:56,630 --> 00:39:01,970
person with panacea and you're not days

00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:05,450
this means and you may need to lay why

00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:08,450
are you ever afraid to in federal budget

00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:10,430
for example and the last time is

00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:11,119
connected also the first one second one

00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:15,099
and

00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:18,170
it is most important and the fifties the

00:39:15,099 --> 00:39:19,999
URL estimates measures is synchronized

00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:22,460
with your application and listening the

00:39:19,999 --> 00:39:26,089
pharmacy can accept all right ever

00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:28,220
features in your application so did I

00:39:26,089 --> 00:39:32,569
believe this is the matter have nothing

00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:36,529
but I'll sleep in your own policy and

00:39:32,569 --> 00:39:41,539
then I mention how to do this and ruin

00:39:36,529 --> 00:39:46,880
it definitely care packages pattinson

00:39:41,539 --> 00:39:49,519
its policy down and fpm here then we

00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:53,349
will need locking asylum policy fellow

00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:57,019
that next time you'll be the next

00:39:53,349 --> 00:40:01,970
contestant AC and after the spectrum of

00:39:57,019 --> 00:40:05,900
your application yeah so okay some

00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:08,630
turtles is our Becky G by creating my

00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:11,749
environment and he is the really basic

00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:16,430
person its policy where I'm just define

00:40:11,749 --> 00:40:16,839
two dives and 100 rule and me to the

00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:19,150
back

00:40:16,839 --> 00:40:23,920
forcement file here you can see the

00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:26,739
particle text file and it's not

00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:29,019
important right now okay so we have

00:40:26,739 --> 00:40:33,160
prepared our policing it does the

00:40:29,019 --> 00:40:35,769
example and this is a this is an example

00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:39,219
of make fire body as you can see the

00:40:35,769 --> 00:40:42,460
moving of the linings but we play and

00:40:39,219 --> 00:40:46,690
you just make the major premise entirely

00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:49,749
to PB for Mother's isn't mentioned yeah

00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:55,119
so policy is ready now and let's grab em

00:40:49,749 --> 00:40:57,099
security to the spectral firstly in

00:40:55,119 --> 00:41:00,369
their section you need to compile your

00:40:57,099 --> 00:41:03,519
policy to be before ma and then install

00:41:00,369 --> 00:41:07,059
section you will miss our first legal

00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:09,999
interfaces5 the user share as soon as

00:41:07,059 --> 00:41:15,759
that include costly directory and then

00:41:09,999 --> 00:41:19,170
you also install the the Crucifier to

00:41:15,759 --> 00:41:23,440
use SSL expected so it's pretty simple

00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:26,640
and then invest in stock price of

00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:28,680
installation of the package you

00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:32,060
senior commander you'll be lonely the

00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:37,350
camera and you're asking another another

00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:41,250
Rufus is a good and it's you can see

00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:44,850
there is a condition clever that and

00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:48,710
then a PPS member Satori the dress the

00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:53,120
policy is a logic and these beliefs I

00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:56,460
oppose the highest office and cyber the

00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:59,640
movie is easily more and graphics file

00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:08,430
sexual learning information good because

00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:11,970
you stopped because you can hit on some

00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:14,910
if you install some is some young model

00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:28,290
and you need to remember some kind of

00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:31,340
the installation you can you can yes it

00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:31,340
has some function

00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:29,750
inside because I change the power our

00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:34,490
part of it haha so when you have

00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:39,700
information what are the previous sorry

00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:44,180
you are our world and you can generate a

00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:47,660
decision in those products or so looking

00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:51,530
eyes if you can give me the list on the

00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:55,100
past week each other that it finally

00:43:51,530 --> 00:44:01,570
here I go all those files I'm just

00:43:55,100 --> 00:44:06,140
popular oh yes we would we do that in a

00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:13,150
ghostly activity so guess I think you

00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:13,150
know my record we can because we are

00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:28,380
really perfectly

00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:28,380
yeah aha

00:44:51,480 --> 00:45:00,820
thank you if it's am personally now

00:44:56,850 --> 00:45:03,850
father gravity application and it's

00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:06,970
working and also I after change some

00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:10,570
useful links and uses for my for my wife

00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:13,060
and then he's 30 L steps to spend on

00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:16,090
food hi papi burger and uncertainty

00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:18,550
Neverland and she be so if you went to

00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:23,100
drive it in ruins everything to be able

00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:23,100
to stop here okay

00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:30,310
near future and as you had mentioned

00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:34,740
using the similarities or feature makes

00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:39,370
shipping and mothers even easier and

00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:43,740
another example as we saw some

00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:47,620
content also got a package and the

00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:51,010
district area has priority one hundred

00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:54,280
and against some example you can see the

00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:58,770
priority of the packages 100 and there

00:45:54,280 --> 00:46:01,150
is no conspiracy 30m the heat will start

00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:04,120
okay and what will happen after

00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:10,960
installing professionals a great package

00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:14,260
and again you see the reparative are

00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:16,180
having at least on the poker and also

00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:20,740
with a parigi stylist

00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:24,640
relax package and again you can see to

00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:28,000
depend two different assailant members

00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:32,079
and Americana be saying my children and

00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:35,410
Rebecca policies and activities that

00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:39,460
permissive it'll be the hilarity so each

00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:44,740
speakeasy is exchanged in the parameter

00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:48,130
you in the CSE model so it's a vagrant

00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:52,990
book yeah we're equal to y equals happy

00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:55,380
happy GA along with what is with you two

00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:55,380
numbers

00:46:56,859 --> 00:47:04,720
likely I mean I have the policy which is

00:47:01,539 --> 00:47:07,960
the Dalton it is called off and then our

00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:12,670
pencil the one how do I know which one

00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:16,210
is the kind block the number versus the

00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:19,359
both of them pass dr. name none of them

00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:21,750
has give me the distinction which is

00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:25,410
which well the 100 day

00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:30,170
system yes yet 100 yes if we see they're

00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:33,390
gone 300 you know it's funny and 400

00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:37,020
locally that the problem is the reason

00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:40,730
why a little better a part of the puzzle

00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:44,370
typer not mention that we have us

00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:48,060
establish route partners we have the

00:47:44,370 --> 00:47:54,300
papyrus d300 the fairies 400 and these

00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:56,460
days another yep ok we are also admire

00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:59,580
you can be installed without any changes

00:47:56,460 --> 00:48:04,250
in disappointing and this is a sad thank

00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:07,440
you especially me because if you want to

00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:10,140
ship your own measure without the united

00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:13,860
benevolent new user space and firstly i

00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:17,580
need to remember the Pharisee from

00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:22,230
arab-israeli supremacy and these are so

00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:30,050
goofy and grasping is what security will

00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:30,050
be lessening XL is ok any questions

00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,260
Oh
