	00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:10,380
okay hello everyone so I'm going to be

00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:13,349
talked about after control electrical

00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,389
vault and robotics with you not Jes and

00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:17,970
if some I just made some experience with

00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:21,720
it it sort of it's kind of like a there

00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:23,609
is no and there's no way to do one some

00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,039
magical abre to everything in your life

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:27,720
like how you know it's always be like a

00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,789
context you have to do some your own

00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,759
stuff in order to make some things work

00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:37,160
so it's kind of different but it's

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:39,840
working nicely so just briefly hunger

00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,879
basically I have to talk about lawn

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,910
chairs and electronics and robotics next

00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:47,219
to do so oh you know it don't you just

00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:50,750
released very recent times ago it not

00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:55,949
that the recent but it is just a new guy

00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:59,190
and it's doing only you know JavaScript

00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:02,370
engine and it's working nicely so about

00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:04,860
no Jess I'm going to say I think most

00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:07,380
people know it's using a chromate engine

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:10,260
and doing some lightweight and efficient

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,640
staff so it's also using NPM and PM

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,439
depend on the note yes if you want to

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,600
use it you have to use the NPM without

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,280
it it's not going to work so now install

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,640
it's pretty much easy one single comment

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,200
line it's going to work out and and want

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,700
things I like it there's a documentation

00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,560
about every single release every single

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,530
changes its make it easier to understand

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,020
everything on the website too so it's

00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:35,189
really really useful to use that part

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:37,770
and I like it so if you want to use an

00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:39,329
OG there's also the other ways you can

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,400
instil look like you can use some

00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:43,500
version control you can compile from

00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,610
your source but in federal way we can

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,380
just install with tnf to flexure about

00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:50,930
in is

00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:53,119
version they are using the long-term

00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:56,750
version 2 not the latest stable version

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,430
so it's kind of like a Nazi

00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,770
bleeding-edge version it's just like

00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:04,100
malaka in a long term supporting version

00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:07,909
well it's working fine as looks like it

00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:11,120
so about the electronics as I said

00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:14,239
before electronics and robotics is kind

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,550
of like always with if you're building

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:19,310
something at your own it's always gonna

00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:21,080
be a custom so if you just follow some

00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:23,120
sort of an article about it it's going

00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,840
to be like a general way but this is

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,010
only work for that system machine or

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,489
authorization whatever you're building

00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:35,620
on it in my previous show I was working

00:02:31,489 --> 00:02:38,660
on industrial level protocols and also

00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:41,120
building an electronic card so that also

00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,950
give me some time to test kind of a such

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,340
a change which is good to be here some

00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:48,440
extra experience and an extra Hardware

00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:51,799
in my in under my hand and I can do some

00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:54,640
more testing and I like it well there is

00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:58,010
a similar way you can connect your

00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:01,010
hardware with your system which are not

00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:03,260
jas with your main machine or you can

00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:06,230
use some sort of embedded code of

00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:09,410
machine you can also connect the same

00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:12,230
way what you did so at first I think

00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:15,290
probably most people if you using are

00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:17,180
doing your electronics they know the SPI

00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:19,040
and I see two and serial port is the

00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:21,170
first way you can connect with down with

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:25,310
the node.js and it's very easy you just

00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:27,620
have to use NPS NPM you can use some

00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:31,430
serial port and it is going to connected

00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:33,170
hau'oli can does just directly use from

00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:35,000
your system there's ass large tail part

00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:37,940
there is a sailor connection if you have

00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,590
the proper driver on your channel it'll

00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:43,010
work and it is going to just give you

00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:45,079
the connection between your system and

00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:48,040
you rambled card inside of not GS and

00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:52,400
it's working nicely well about the speed

00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:54,410
sometimes II it's become struggling I

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,930
mean like a if you have some sort of a

00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:57,850
multiple machines like a 20 or 25

00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:00,280
machines on

00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:04,180
your system it's become like a problem

00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:06,940
because that so many machines wants to

00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:11,260
request with the uncommunicative is non

00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:14,710
0 GS and it's sometimes stuck at the

00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:17,470
connection if you don't want to I use a

00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:19,630
hash to use and I just suggest one of my

00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:22,330
friends also suggest me use and I think

00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:26,320
from part and it's make it it make it

00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:27,790
easier and as a as a web server and web

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,670
server connection is also other way

00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:33,130
which is nicely but if you try to send

00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:35,950
send something from your even your cable

00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:38,890
collection under seconds it's always

00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:40,780
drop the package and I don't know it's

00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:44,230
going to be reliable on that but if you

00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:46,540
do something in real time always use

00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:48,820
some sort of cable connection other than

00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:51,190
web server because it's never to the way

00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:54,250
I want to do but it's still good way as

00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:56,800
an industrial like I said I was use more

00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:58,540
palace and Backman protocol which is the

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,060
building automation system protocols

00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:04,240
it's also use able on the mode in the

00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:07,890
node.js the basic very basic is there is

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:10,120
some sort of a registered list and

00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,770
register and write lists and read list

00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,140
as in protocol and if you want to

00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:16,510
connect something in your industrial

00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,890
level system you have to use that

00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,750
register late and you can connect it

00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:23,200
with John rjs which is the one of the

00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:25,450
basics as a circuits on board as I said

00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,040
you can use any kind of Arduino your

00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,870
embedded cards and if you want to

00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:33,580
communicate with them you can use not

00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:35,470
chess as a microchip it has to be used

00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:37,840
some sort of a cold inside of the

00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:40,180
microchip then you can use of it and you

00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,790
can also use notches on open wrt devices

00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:45,190
which is recently I found it out and I

00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:48,690
can't have to compile it it's the only

00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:51,490
problem is you have to use external

00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:53,650
external hardware sorry it's not hard

00:05:51,490 --> 00:06:00,340
disk then you can install because it's

00:05:53,650 --> 00:06:04,530
too big as I see to an SPI it's also

00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:05,780
depend on the address list and it's also

00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:08,570
you

00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:10,130
have to know which ship and which

00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:13,190
hardware you have inside the end of your

00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:14,720
hand needs to know which connection

00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,919
needs to which where then we can

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,630
communicate with them because if you

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,700
don't know the address this that we can

00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:23,080
connect it and the good part is about

00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:25,940
the spi and also i see two you can use

00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,650
multiple connection in the same line if

00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:29,540
you just like a given one single cable

00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:30,889
straight line from the one coming up to

00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:33,110
from your motherboard or your embed

00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:35,510
guard which i connect multiple machine

00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:37,100
if just give this number you can connect

00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:39,350
them and you can control it down which

00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,940
is a good stuff we can also use as a

00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:42,890
multiplexer or something different like

00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:46,460
that and if you know the each address as

00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:50,240
i said we can determine it and change it

00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:53,390
I mean is it neat I said determining is

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:56,800
also when I try to say is because there

00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:59,870
is no general libraries for each single

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,640
prevent vendors or manufacturers that

00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,710
does give you the same addresses or

00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:07,460
there's no kind of as I said magic

00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:10,100
library what you do and connection so

00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:11,900
you have to know the list and type to

00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:14,450
the tone and then you can connect it

00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:17,530
because sometimes if you just find some

00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:19,940
sort of a very rare chip and don't know

00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:21,890
what is in there you're going to

00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,450
probably need to know the data sheet if

00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:25,330
you don't tell dulla you can

00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:28,820
probably cannot even connected because

00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:30,320
electronics is also depend on a

00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:32,020
documentation what they give you from

00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,460
the manufacturer if you don't say that

00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:40,550
documentation you can do that with just

00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:42,200
sucks as an exemplary I made some in the

00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:46,640
end of the fight I destroyed I will I

00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:51,590
made some my own robotics projects the

00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:54,050
devices I try to use I was I used AC to

00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:57,560
chill which is the chip is as an

00:07:54,050 --> 00:08:00,669
exemplary there is an NPM for it which

00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:03,380
only works that chip nothing else it's

00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:08,120
as I said there is no general order so

00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:11,580
that chips has a 16-channel 3212 bit pvm

00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:14,400
driver you can just control multiple six

00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:16,620
the servo motors or anything you want to

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,199
use as a PBM signals and if you know

00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:22,469
how's it work and need some soldering

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,750
definitely and it's working very very

00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:31,490
fast and rapidly and the good thing is

00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:34,979
you can actually multiply up to 9 999

00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:37,409
devices with the single line just bottom

00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:41,430
up to the multiple ship if you solve it

00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:42,839
and it'll work 999 device in the single

00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:44,550
line if you just connect it to your

00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:47,490
motor system and if you just type the

00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:52,260
code it along which is the good part of

00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:54,329
the ic2 about IC to a lot a little some

00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:56,550
basics as you can see just need to

00:08:54,329 --> 00:08:59,220
require you know the commands you need

00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:01,769
and you can just call it out and make

00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:03,779
the address make the frequency and just

00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:06,329
when you get the code all you have to do

00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:09,089
is if you want to send a pulse which am

00:09:06,329 --> 00:09:11,310
want to use and which length and which

00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:14,250
duty cycle as a peavey amp signal and

00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:16,800
electronics term and you can control it

00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:18,720
which is very very easy i guess for dead

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:23,670
chip if you know how to control it I

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:26,370
mean it's kinda sometimes you need to

00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:29,940
know what's the duty cycle and you have

00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:32,130
to calculate that but when you found you

00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:33,870
when you have that it's going to be much

00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:36,570
easier after that you just need to find

00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:40,620
that first then you're going to be okay

00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:42,690
most likely a serial port is also

00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:45,449
another way which is I'm using that a

00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:47,279
lot for my own project because it's too

00:09:45,449 --> 00:09:50,100
easy i mean if you want to connect

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:52,500
something with DSP device just so your

00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:56,100
port is the way what we do because we

00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:59,339
like the DSPs and we now have to connect

00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:03,420
it and the way is just need to install

00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:05,220
the driver and have you know others

00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:08,390
which is in the linux system in the

00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:10,769
federal we have slashed under there and

00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:13,470
then reconnected we can get the

00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:16,019
information we won so and we can use of

00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:17,340
it as it right now i have my devices

00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:18,450
connected to bluetooth

00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:20,550
and it's using the serial serial

00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:23,610
connection and just get the information

00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:25,890
I need and I can control it so for this

00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:29,040
serial port it's actually good thing is

00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:31,740
it is a command line two so you can

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,600
actually check which port is available

00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:35,130
and accessible so before the connecting

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,990
that you will have to do some scanning

00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:39,090
before the coding stuff so it's going to

00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:41,520
give you some nice information before

00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:43,460
that as a quick start and it's actually

00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,690
good because you don't want to search

00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:47,970
every single time where is that where is

00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:51,180
that so it's nice to have that surreal

00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:54,840
command line for a full roster and if

00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:56,670
you want to use it it's really very

00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:59,580
simple we just need to know boundaries

00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:02,250
and addresses in the computer or an

00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:05,700
embed code and you can get the

00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:07,290
information and make sure you have a

00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,910
permission because sometimes it's asking

00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:11,430
for root permission in the a.m every

00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:13,980
single embed cards or you have to create

00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:15,720
some special group and you have to be in

00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:21,930
the group as a user done you can't

00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:24,870
control it which is one of the basics as

00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:27,750
a web server as i said before we can

00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:30,000
still connect and talk multiple device

00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:32,130
on the internet if they have an internet

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,950
or by far whatever they have or it can

00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:38,040
be in a broadband it's also can be used

00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:41,940
as a general web device on websites okay

00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:43,800
internet is a good way to building some

00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,850
super clots up to the cloud application

00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,070
or organization application

00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:49,440
infrastructures I mean if you want to

00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:52,200
build on your own you know smart house

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:57,240
project you can use that to which is

00:11:52,200 --> 00:12:01,320
nice but it's also as I said depend on

00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:04,140
which project we'd want to use it and as

00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:07,380
a there's so many different ways to do

00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:09,720
that you can use the libraries also

00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:11,730
already in there with Mitch GTP or you

00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,150
can use a different like an express

00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:16,500
which is also very popular and very

00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:19,500
simple to an HTTP as I understand

00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:23,520
because it's just more shorter than what

00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:26,850
we do as an exemplary this is the HTTP

00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,600
wait we have to do the connection port

00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:29,610
number

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,370
and when you connect it it's going to

00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:34,680
give you a result and if you run it it's

00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:36,209
just going to just point your finger

00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:39,930
there you're going to see this little

00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:41,990
head headline and if you have one target

00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:47,190
you're going to see the console log too

00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:49,050
but as an express its that's all it's

00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:50,880
just that's what we just need the

00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:53,279
library and it's going to make shorter

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,230
but differences you can have to select

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:58,259
sternal ugly down you can have the

00:12:55,230 --> 00:13:01,139
connection and create the same idea as i

00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:02,759
did just before it just as i said same

00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:07,500
you just need to find the port address

00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:10,529
and you can also specify the IP address

00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:14,579
or hostname or it's depend on your you

00:13:10,529 --> 00:13:16,620
know connection system you know it's so

00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:19,560
changeable i mean as i said there is no

00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:22,199
general way to explain it is a it's just

00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:27,149
not that there is a millions way you can

00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:33,509
do that which is nicely okay so there is

00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:37,470
a couple's a couple of hardware sorry a

00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:39,569
couple of libraries using for connecting

00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:42,740
multiple electronical device is a

00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:46,860
general way but it just worked on that

00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:50,519
specific device and the way what we do

00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:55,560
is only support that way which is some

00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:58,620
of them is like a cyclone 25 which is

00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:03,540
other way to do that and and a lots of

00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:06,000
it okay as a cyclone way if you want to

00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:10,170
use circulon you can install cyclone GS

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,569
and there's a tons of supporting which

00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:15,990
is awesome it's going to allow you to

00:14:12,569 --> 00:14:20,759
control a bluetooth beaglebone raspberry

00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:23,639
pi keyboard joystick mouse I don't know

00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:27,259
if you would like to have drawn you can

00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:28,460
use that to and its really really neatly

00:14:27,259 --> 00:14:31,190
documented

00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:36,110
stop dating too and I like it it's very

00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:38,450
nice there is some little example i know

00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:43,690
i can show you right now which is not a

00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:43,690
problem and if you if i can and try it

00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:00,539
cool

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,000
sorry I have to start my services seems

00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,000
to be

00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,980
oh nice work

00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:22,530
why did not working

00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:29,759
yep just work

00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:44,080
why is it not again I'm going to check

00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:48,580
it after after that maybe I can try it

00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:53,460
later and time I don't know why is it

00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:53,460
happen i should for try one more time

00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:09,130
yep I mean this Oh me

00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,140
okay no I heard

00:16:28,579 --> 00:16:39,189
yeah can I break the screenwriter no I

00:16:35,239 --> 00:16:39,189
have to make smaller screen

00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:50,700
so I hear one device is alarmed the

00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:53,040
control if you are I'm working basically

00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:55,770
with robotic sounds so if I want to

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,600
control something with my hands so I

00:16:55,770 --> 00:17:00,540
need some sort of a special camera plus

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:04,020
and our some sort of height anything on

00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:07,920
my high days so the basic idea is I can

00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:09,990
play the screen yep so if I just put my

00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:13,050
head yeah this is the point if on a

00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:16,589
controller and pockets are okay I just

00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:20,809
yeah it's nicely i cannot even all my

00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:30,650
bones and stuff is there which is nice

00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:36,900
but see needs oh thank you sorry ok so

00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:40,309
that's the me idea how close it because

00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,309
I'm go back there

00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:52,179
I have to take it from my presentation

00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:56,410
sorry for that so okay so that's the one

00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:59,470
of two example how I did it and other

00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:02,799
ways like a industrial waste let me try

00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:07,480
it as I said industrial waste is most

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:09,490
likely these two protocols is doing all

00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:12,700
the industrial building authorizations

00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:15,640
as I see as I ever see there's also one

00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:17,950
more protocol but I never ever see it as

00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:21,970
an odious I'd never even try it before

00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:24,669
but these two is most likely to my I'm

00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:28,270
base call my jobs in the others I have

00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:32,080
to use the other language so no problem

00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:34,690
for that but Elizabeth so this is a

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:37,240
Modbus and back net is using as I said

00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:40,330
industrial it's not new and a great

00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:44,100
sounds so wrong well for that and it's

00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:47,740
really fast and really really reliable

00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:49,390
it's easy but the problem is when you're

00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:51,340
starting in the first time party just

00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:54,130
three level connection it's kind of hard

00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:56,049
to learn it because need some time to

00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:59,169
understand the address and stuff like

00:18:56,049 --> 00:19:02,980
that which is kind of pain mobiles is

00:18:59,169 --> 00:19:04,540
all it's using for long times it's more

00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:06,309
like a basics device like I if you have

00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:09,640
a sense or contours something like that

00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:12,549
you can use of it but I as a battement

00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,980
protocol all I see is I always need some

00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:17,320
extra space in my device because if

00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:19,870
you're using some sort of small chips

00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:22,330
it's maybe going to be insufficient as a

00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:24,520
space space because it means so many

00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:26,440
protocols need to be supported so if you

00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:28,840
want to just use some limited support

00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:31,270
you can probably use it but if you want

00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:37,390
to support everything so that's your way

00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:40,660
to need it need more space and as in

00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:44,140
robotics we have as I said awesome

00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:47,860
projects as I saw cyclone Johnny 5 and

00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:51,910
gold history is as a general usage I

00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:53,280
used a cyclone and also some of non-stop

00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:57,810
I just ran earlier

00:19:53,280 --> 00:20:02,370
is a serial port this is kind of like we

00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:05,310
can say the most general library I found

00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:09,090
it but it's all of them is most likely

00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:11,010
focused on our reveal devices but if you

00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:13,440
want to make your own devices supported

00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:15,690
you can do that too because the library

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,390
is not that horrible or not that complex

00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:20,430
you just need to know which port is

00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:22,140
which then you can probably configure it

00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:25,860
for your own usage and you can use it

00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:28,440
very nicely this tree is to is just

00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:31,020
means based on you how to use your

00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:33,840
devices as a library and control it gold

00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:36,240
is like a just you know find device

00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,400
install and just command directly no

00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,040
it's like a quick command line

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:44,250
controlling which is compatible with all

00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:46,680
of this in the top and it's also others

00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:49,110
project like our Ruby base and gold

00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:54,660
language is this is the go language Ruby

00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:56,810
language as far as I remember so I'm

00:20:54,660 --> 00:21:00,360
going to have to show you one of my

00:20:56,810 --> 00:21:02,040
devices I made it it's not in here

00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,830
because of my airport as an alignment do

00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:06,690
that this is the devices i use it and

00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:09,810
i'm going to show it just a second

00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:11,880
slider just a minute later and i sit

00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:13,920
there are things because my i think i

00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:18,270
miss up some simple presentation

00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:21,330
mistakes sorry for that so it's also as

00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:23,250
I said based on I think and you just

00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:25,830
meant that that too because as I said

00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:29,600
it's based on are doing your ass PDP you

00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:32,880
can control so many device like a

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:35,640
different device which is cremated and

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,130
you can control it you can make your own

00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:41,610
control algorithm simple well document

00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:44,430
dated and now i can show you what i did

00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:47,900
in my house in turkey and have I control

00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:47,900
it most likely

00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:00,440
okay let me try it

00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:36,040
Oh

00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:40,150
yep and did it work okay yeah it's my

00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:45,640
one of my tasting times so when I

00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:48,040
complete I was working fully so it's

00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:51,370
still same sensitivity i had i used

00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:55,720
raspy DP with and plus some pie CTO

00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:58,810
protocol okay this is my simple project

00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:01,480
animated i used a different device and

00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:04,990
different way which is working nicely

00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:07,360
and i use advice in my hand which is the

00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:10,240
this is going to be doing white just a

00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:14,050
color difference okay so i'm sure it if

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:16,300
I can okay so as i see i connected my

00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:20,040
computer is there everything is going to

00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:24,940
be a long Cheers I has to calculate that

00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:27,910
look as you can see all I deities okay

00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:30,010
the other two is disabled because as i

00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:32,710
said i was i was building so the

00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:34,660
complete one is like this but as i said

00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:38,380
i didn't bring it I'm sorry it is the

00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:42,910
video i found most recent one so it was

00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:45,850
working i do it I did almost all the

00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:48,730
movements so the basic is you have to

00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:50,740
control all the finger all the muscles I

00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:54,250
have to calculate it which is it's a

00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:55,990
freakin six months so I talked with some

00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:58,780
of my mathematics teachers to do that

00:23:55,990 --> 00:24:02,610
too because I learn some special

00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:05,980
algorithm and it's a a huge line of code

00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:08,590
it's almost complete I'm gonna share it

00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:11,110
on the guitar so everyone wants to do

00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:13,150
that same device I have they can build

00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:17,200
it itself or they can change it use it

00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:18,910
it's up to them are the done I'm pretty

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,790
much I can done so if you have any

00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:25,710
questions on stuff I ok I can get off if

00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:25,710
not i'm done with my presentation

00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:33,520
sure let me tell there's a 80 mg control

00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:38,350
device which is the electron macro field

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:40,659
which is get your muscle puzzles so when

00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:43,120
you get the pulses you get some just on

00:24:40,659 --> 00:24:46,570
the numbers so the numbers is depend on

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:49,990
which part of your body in your in this

00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:51,820
particular part is is a movie if you

00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:55,570
just just just release your hands

00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:58,590
completely it's going to show you 25 20

00:24:55,570 --> 00:25:01,450
mg signals per second per millisecond

00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:03,820
because if you are not do it you are not

00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:06,130
doing anything then your blood line is

00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:07,870
to your blood is still moving so this is

00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:10,059
the what you get it but if you try to

00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:12,520
move something like this is going to

00:25:10,059 --> 00:25:15,429
give you higher result and if you have

00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:18,279
more sensitive device like a morir mgs

00:25:15,429 --> 00:25:21,789
so you can separate each fingers like

00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:23,890
this so in my case I have 6 chapter 8 I

00:25:21,789 --> 00:25:26,830
have to separate them the eight pieces

00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:29,470
to find each finger which is the highest

00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:32,350
point and calculate them with my maximum

00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:34,929
and minimum I just then I become to do

00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:36,460
the general use it for every single

00:25:34,929 --> 00:25:39,130
hands in this room or other in the world

00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:41,559
so when you do this if you understand

00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:45,820
this is finger the higher and it's going

00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:47,980
to be if I remember second and five EMG

00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:49,630
is depend on one of my first finger and

00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:52,149
the others won't depend on the others

00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:54,640
fingers so this is how this world so the

00:25:52,149 --> 00:25:57,909
trick to trick is okay when you move

00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:00,279
your all of your finger so let's say if

00:25:57,909 --> 00:26:02,529
I start all of them so it's going it's

00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:04,419
all of its higher but still there's a

00:26:02,529 --> 00:26:06,429
little trick algorithm it's just

00:26:04,419 --> 00:26:08,039
separate them and which one is moving or

00:26:06,429 --> 00:26:10,500
which one is not so it's kind of like a

00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:13,029
elimination and find the proper way to

00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:15,820
Chicago there so there is a as i said i

00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:17,440
cannot just say this is the way this is

00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:19,390
in the inner left mine in the beginning

00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,289
of my talk as I said it's always going

00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:25,659
to be some sort of an extra

00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:28,580
customization such like this okay

00:26:25,659 --> 00:26:35,750
anything anything else

00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:40,570
I think so why did you choose my nephew

00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:40,570
to use visual center so set up cameras

00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:52,130
camera is my first way as I show it this

00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:54,530
is the device to do that for me but I

00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:57,050
want to do wirelessly which is one of my

00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:58,850
project class so they asked me to viral

00:26:57,050 --> 00:27:02,810
estate and item student wirelessly and

00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:05,150
stick idea come up and because also want

00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:07,640
to want to taste something else and as

00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:09,560
you said I can do that too I can do that

00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:11,750
the other way or other way or other way

00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:21,860
there is no single way yes but I can be

00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:26,270
dr. home anything else ok if you have

00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:29,150
some rock solid configuration this this

00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:32,390
is ok but the camera one if you separate

00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:35,600
every skeletons part this is that that's

00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:37,880
better it's more sensitive and if for

00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,860
this one you need more dmg to a separate

00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:42,050
time and I know one of the university

00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:43,550
working really really hard on that they

00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:46,810
didn't come to the end of the conclusion

00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:50,540
yet they spanned almost three million

00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:52,790
three million dollars more so it's not

00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:55,100
easy but I don't have that resource they

00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:56,810
have so they are using more emc more

00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:58,840
sensitive to us and they try to do

00:27:56,810 --> 00:28:02,630
without camera and it's going to be

00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:05,960
actual working prototype which is one of

00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:09,050
the human is doing is are the same idea

00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:12,200
I did when I just almost finish this i

00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:14,000
watch the video dated that and it's kind

00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,070
of sucks to see that before what I did

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,770
but I respect that they have more

00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:21,470
resources but that's all I can say well

00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:24,500
they're actually using one of the human

00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:26,300
to control his hands he does Petrelli he

00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:28,760
doesn't have a bar just popped up we

00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:32,360
just put the arm the robotic arm through

00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:34,550
this place right here and he's using one

00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:36,350
of them she 12 them on his right there

00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:39,080
which is a little bit extra surgery and

00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:41,360
it's working it's actually he can he

00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:43,190
actually even drive a car in a real Road

00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,610
so I think it's pretty much a success

00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:45,610
like I said

00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:54,190
I mean that cases where people want to

00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:55,690
handle dangerous oh there are probably

00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,830
some special libraries and special kind

00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:58,779
of measures for that so it's not going

00:28:56,830 --> 00:29:04,989
to be general audience or something like

00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:07,480
that but they your experience okay and

00:29:04,989 --> 00:29:09,059
the only problem I encounter it is sorry

00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:11,739
there are several problem i encountered

00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:15,070
one of them is in the first time is the

00:29:11,739 --> 00:29:17,889
timing because when i use i see two or

00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:20,049
serial port I have to find a pigeon's

00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:21,549
fastest way because the problem is for

00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:23,230
this project you have to be a real time

00:29:21,549 --> 00:29:25,149
because you know when Antarctic the

00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:27,070
movie it has to start at the same time

00:29:25,149 --> 00:29:29,350
moving which is right in the video so

00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:31,119
the point is I have to find some exactly

00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:33,159
timing problem just the first problem

00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:34,509
second is the algorithm which are

00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:36,879
between your arm and between your

00:29:34,509 --> 00:29:39,909
robotic arms find which movement is the

00:29:36,879 --> 00:29:43,059
beach so the the last one is the

00:29:39,909 --> 00:29:45,190
bluetooth it has to be used route 24 and

00:29:43,059 --> 00:29:46,509
low-level energy and I have to

00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:48,609
understand between the protocols what

00:29:46,509 --> 00:29:52,950
isn't there painfully they shared the

00:29:48,609 --> 00:29:58,070
source code so it's becoming easier

00:29:52,950 --> 00:30:00,910
other than us okay

00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:00,910
what

00:30:02,139 --> 00:30:10,999
yeah yeah it's going to be in my guitars

00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:13,399
probably I have to update it first so

00:30:10,999 --> 00:30:16,789
everyone can download and do what they

00:30:13,399 --> 00:30:21,139
want to do with that you can use even

00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:24,139
like four normal deck stop controlling

00:30:21,139 --> 00:30:28,070
like a media control you can do or other

00:30:24,139 --> 00:30:32,570
stuff like a robotic stone it's all the

00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:38,690
way out working actually hmm oh sorry

00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:41,019
let me share it okay okay let me open up

00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:41,019
in here

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:53,320
upp exactly exactly my eight o'clock car

00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:55,419
/ my username no problem it's i'ma put

00:30:53,320 --> 00:31:01,090
up just give me a sec I'm connect

00:30:55,419 --> 00:31:06,399
mentally kissing hmm traditional paper

00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:11,159
90 bastard oh yes I just connected so

00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:11,159
everything I got the hair sorry

00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:22,909
ok

00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:25,999
so

00:31:22,909 --> 00:31:30,289
right there this is the link i'm going

00:31:25,999 --> 00:31:32,989
to upload it as a flaw 2016 and all the

00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:36,950
stuff i D it's going to be in there when

00:31:32,989 --> 00:31:40,659
I open up the actual repository become

00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:40,659
private up so

00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:53,290
I'm sorry for that I didn't finish up
