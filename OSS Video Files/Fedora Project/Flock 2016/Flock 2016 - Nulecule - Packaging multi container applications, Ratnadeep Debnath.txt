Title: Flock 2016 - Nulecule - Packaging multi container applications, Ratnadeep Debnath
Publication date: 2016-08-21
Playlist: Flock 2016
Description: 
	Currently there is no standard mechanism for creating, distributing and deploying applications on containers. Applications that need orchestration for multiple containers and hosts require hand-crafted customization that is difficult to replicate and manage, not to mention time-consuming. Nulecule is a specification for defining the packaged contents, including metadata, dependencies and orchestration providers, of container-based applications. Atomic App is the reference implementation of Nulecule that provides an easy method for packaging, distributing and running applications.

okay yes so a to b is a is an

00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:08,849
environment which is easy to start with

00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,750
to build and package containers so it

00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:11,460
comes with all the dependencies

00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,960
installed like a talker community

00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,429
serpents eight meses marathon or the

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,890
infrastructure container orchestration

00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:19,699
engines install and it has all the

00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,480
dependencies and start to build docker

00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:25,140
applications and package them as

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,910
molecules and if you might have set up

00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,130
any of these applications given this

00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,500
open shift or marathon you might know

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,899
that it is not a very friendly and easy

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:37,230
process so it is there to help you like

00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:39,329
it is a background box and you have a

00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:43,920
different one command to set up your

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:45,600
environment and start working you'll

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:52,710
have to speak about containers I think

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:54,690
we've heard so much of them all so come

00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:57,690
into a container packaging right so we

00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:01,170
have got a docker file where we add a

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:04,710
few lines and we built like a container

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:08,220
image of that it seems to be simple

00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:10,010
claim but is it beautiful because it

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:15,450
depends on the people who make it and

00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:17,939
open it is seen that like the wake the

00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,740
number of packages you see in the public

00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:20,939
dock registry right there too much for a

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,340
simple application you can find like

00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:26,040
hundreds of images mainly because like

00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,840
and most of the images should not have

00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,780
proper documentation you can get started

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,670
with it and every image strict for a

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,860
particular user since it's not generic

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,049
you kind of just download the image and

00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,420
use it in any environment you need to

00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:41,700
end that forces you to make other image

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,110
of it and add to the nose you are forced

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,340
to make it custom image and pushing

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:49,110
rockethub for that it's crazy out there

00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:51,990
just for example if you search for the

00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:53,340
images for mario TBH technically there

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,110
should be only one which works

00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,920
everywhere but it's not like every

00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:02,150
community and every organization has a

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,860
I ADB and most of them might not work

00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:08,599
and most of them would be without

00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:12,349
documentation and over time it'll just

00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:14,569
keep on going because every everyone

00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:18,050
needs his own mind in the image and as a

00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:21,800
user can we knew the container ecosystem

00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:23,600
it's confusing I just want one that's

00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,519
why even we go for the official images

00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,709
right but sometimes the official images

00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:29,750
also do not work either they are not

00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:31,730
tested thoroughly for every release

00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:34,010
cycle in fine issue support against them

00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:36,680
so i only have confidence when i move to

00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:40,940
this ecosystem right this is a blocker

00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:43,459
for me as the user but nonetheless like

00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:45,769
condensed are fun because you can like

00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:50,090
package everything in one thing and ship

00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:51,739
it but you we are here to like AG neon

00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:55,340
particular best practices for how a

00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:57,830
biitch containers let's take a example

00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:00,580
of a real world application workplace

00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:03,380
how many of you know about WordPress

00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:06,980
right or everyone might have used it at

00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:08,870
place so if i compare the typical

00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:10,640
wordpress setup we have to like download

00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:12,680
the RPM or tape for wordpress and then

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,810
configure things it doesn't work again

00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,420
with configure things and like after a

00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:19,370
lot of heat on drugs you get it working

00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:21,790
but continuous is that like wordpress I

00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:24,440
need a DB so I have got my ID be a

00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:27,560
container image for that i run the

00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:30,370
container container from that image by

00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:35,900
specifying the database name password

00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:39,829
for that for the database and then I can

00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:42,350
run my wordpress application by linking

00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:45,799
it to the mighty wave container that I

00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:49,549
just booted up and then I just need to

00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:51,260
find the fork in which my 84 of my

00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:53,299
wordpress application is exposed to the

00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:55,340
host and once I find out I hit the

00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:58,100
browser and I see the WordPress screen

00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:00,079
no setup no configuration other things I

00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:03,290
have to do is just there running for me

00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:05,209
so it's pretty easy but here we see that

00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:05,720
like I have got like two containers

00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:08,920
coming to

00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:12,440
to deliver a much richer application

00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:16,549
what if we will take it to more than to

00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:17,840
write that would have like a like a lot

00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:20,480
of convenience coming together to

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,400
deliver a richer application a typical

00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,320
scenario would be if I'd like you have

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,990
my enter production app say an

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,950
e-commerce website be on containers I

00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:32,510
need databases for it I need caching

00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:35,270
cash service for it and in the app and

00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:37,220
multiple applications appz service for

00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:38,870
it and then finally a load balancer app

00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,370
right so and everything can be container

00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:44,930
and linked together to deliver the

00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:46,820
entire website on containers just for

00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:50,950
example you look into an example of

00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:55,100
Hitler so good lab is an open-source

00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:58,580
clone of github it's very famous is used

00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:00,860
in house by many organizations so on

00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:02,540
like superficial they will get lab

00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:04,520
depends on good luck depends on a

00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:06,560
database post-race of money adp whatever

00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:09,590
it could be and it depends on a k-8

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,660
caching server credits and radius again

00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:15,110
could be done as in a marshal slave mode

00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:17,540
right it could have it depends on like

00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:24,260
two other nodes like one of the

00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:26,000
machinery and one is the same node so we

00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:27,770
come to microservices right we're like

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:34,430
I'm containers help us shape

00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:36,380
microservices and if you can / fully

00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:39,200
deploy containers the image is same

00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:40,910
right and if you can write out image is

00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,440
properly so that we can separate the

00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:44,270
metadata of the image and the static

00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,740
image so we can actually deploy the same

00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:48,020
image in multiple environments by

00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,310
configuring the metadata according to

00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,590
the environments and thus we can

00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:53,479
actually orchestrate a containers in

00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:56,060
four different environments and as a

00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:58,700
result a bunch of orchestration tools

00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,380
have come out in our ecosystem for

00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,360
orchestrating containers deploying the

00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:06,919
same image with different parameters on

00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:08,750
four different environments but when it

00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:11,630
comes to like so we have got rid of one

00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:13,080
problem that having a static image which

00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,819
works in different environments

00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,319
now I'm going to ship again and a very

00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:21,449
good piece of data it's a mirror editor

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:22,919
and all the arbitration providers has

00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:26,460
their own delusions of this metadata

00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:28,139
none and now the metadata from one

00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:30,000
platform that looks the same they are

00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:32,939
totally different for example like if I

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,009
have to deploy Iran communities I have

00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:37,020
to download here template format is

00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:41,719
condensing metadata and how to deploy it

00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:44,099
on my ability server so we have got like

00:06:41,719 --> 00:06:45,870
continue orchestration in this like open

00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:49,680
 playin composed message was

00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:51,719
marathon cuban it is Doku terraform shut

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,650
it in the yours so many I'm and more are

00:06:51,719 --> 00:06:57,300
yet to come and yet we do not have a

00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:00,780
particular leader in the market space of

00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:03,750
like container orchestration engines but

00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:05,310
everyone has taken their independence to

00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:07,409
invented new templating language which

00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:09,090
makes it more confusing for users as a

00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:10,680
developer why should I even bother with

00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:13,080
their language I just need to get my

00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:20,039
application into production it is not

00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:21,690
that easy so how the metadata can change

00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:25,139
across various environments right so

00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:26,879
like for example i have got multiple

00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:28,949
environments for my application right it

00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,810
could be staging test equal reproduction

00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:32,699
right so for example if I take the

00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:35,460
metadata for a magical or like postage

00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:38,610
CP whatever so I might need to run it on

00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:40,169
different IPS I my to me I might need to

00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:42,210
run around different force if all the

00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:43,949
environments are all the same post and I

00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:45,810
might need to have different credentials

00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:50,729
for that and I need to be able to

00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:55,139
configure that on the fly and if we look

00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:56,580
into the example of guest book Go app

00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:59,129
which is a sample multi control

00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:01,589
application that Q bilities showcases

00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:05,039
that came up with it's not thurs it's

00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:07,139
like a 75 lengths long so that's not a

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:12,870
quick start guide for you you have to go

00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:15,419
through all of that to get started so

00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:18,449
here we are introducing molecule so

00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:20,039
nucleus spec for building and packaging

00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:23,210
multi container applications is

00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:25,669
basically basically patterned that

00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:27,350
that guides you to build multicultural

00:08:25,669 --> 00:08:30,319
applications and shape them it

00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:32,839
encourages composability of application

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,909
so basically you can compose an oracle

00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:37,729
application of out of multiple smaller

00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:39,349
numerical applications so the benefit is

00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:40,880
that once you package and application as

00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:42,589
knowing you you just forget about that

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,839
thing once you have package stood TV

00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:46,820
properly you don't ever need to do it

00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:48,790
again you just consume it so that's

00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:51,339
where like new look will increase

00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:54,080
composability and it is also like

00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:56,720
orchestration platform agnostic so newly

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,550
cool words as it is it has one common

00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,260
language and it works as it is for

00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:02,330
different orchestration platforms like

00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,770
open shade mera it works on math on it

00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:07,580
works on Cuban it is it works on darker

00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:10,279
and we have got a pluggable provided

00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:13,370
model which allows you to hook any

00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:15,110
provider you want we have a API you

00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:16,670
write your module and you can get

00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:18,320
support for your own provided so you

00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:20,810
talk in the same language in the world

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,420
of nautical you don't bother about like

00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:27,649
other like the native temp artifact

00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:31,480
languages for the different providers so

00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:35,240
I suspect is open it's like contingent

00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:39,140
agnostic and it encourages orchestration

00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:41,360
and it lets you like parameterize your

00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:43,490
perimeter parameterize your requirements

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:49,790
based on the different environments and

00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:53,029
applying it to so why do we like start

00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:54,860
with building and the tool because the

00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:58,370
time we started working on it there were

00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:59,930
no tools as like it which were

00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:03,860
electronic provider at Gnostic or

00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:05,329
orchestration pool agnostic they so we

00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:09,079
had they need to actually work on such a

00:10:05,329 --> 00:10:10,820
tool but now currently I think ansible

00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:12,410
container is doing something similar

00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,959
which is kind of luck appreciation

00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:20,060
provide agnostic we just came lately

00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:23,720
right that's what I'm off but last year

00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:25,430
there's no such tools and as a developer

00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,590
when I want to define my application

00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:28,300
architecture right I

00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:30,070
want to be able to do it in a much

00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:33,490
higher level right I want to say that ok

00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:35,080
this is the application application this

00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:37,900
depends on a DB this depends on the cash

00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:39,520
and just apply it right but again when I

00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:41,650
talk about high level definition you

00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:45,340
don't want to me lose the power of doing

00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:47,260
low level fix so miracle is something

00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:49,300
which gives you an high level overview

00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:50,980
of your entire application architecture

00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,930
but it does not compromise on you

00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:57,280
customizing the low level bits if needed

00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:59,530
and it's and since it is kind of like

00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:01,270
high level is very easy for a junior

00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:02,440
divorce or sysadmin engineer to actually

00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:05,380
take new we can deploy to production

00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:08,560
without being in the fear of legs

00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:10,420
breaking something unknowingly and it

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,010
integrates with other tools as in I say

00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,780
that it integrates easily with other

00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:15,670
orchestration providers so you can

00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:17,500
easily rat models to add support for

00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:20,710
your orchestration provider maybe it

00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:22,240
like like math on we already have

00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:25,120
support for marathon communities maybe

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:29,050
some ex operation platform is Matt come

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:31,570
in the future and and the spec is open

00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:35,110
and the implementation for that is also

00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:36,580
open so it's open source so anyone can

00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:41,560
look into and like improve it and like

00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:44,770
customize it as needed so noodle is

00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:46,720
implemented as a dated a cyclic graph so

00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:48,700
that we can actually like have the

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,100
dependency among the application

00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:53,620
components laid out properly for example

00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:55,780
the casebook would depend on a radius

00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:58,810
and the greatest master itself depends

00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:01,120
on two ladies slaves so we define an

00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:03,940
application as they like like as a graph

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:07,860
and so that the dependency is like self

00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:10,900
evident from the definition itself and

00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:14,050
we manage dependencies as in like honey

00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:16,360
like a pony installed in the Naraka

00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:19,180
application if the dependency they are

00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:21,040
not only system the engine itself takes

00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:23,140
care of pulling all the dependences and

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,250
just running the thing you don't need to

00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:27,940
bother like furthering of the

00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:31,620
dependences pretest so it takes care of

00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:35,050
the dependences for you as well and

00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:37,090
others say it like when you deploy into

00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:39,300
different environments we need to be

00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:41,850
able to configure the metal right

00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:44,459
and we support parameterizing the

00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:47,760
metadata so based on the environment we

00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:48,810
can customize the environment variables

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,990
you can say something like that to

00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:53,670
actually say what they got to use to

00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:57,089
actually deploy for example when I am

00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:59,370
defining here a hello akashe app right I

00:12:57,089 --> 00:13:03,120
can actually define certain parameters

00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:05,670
under this the key params one is the

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,820
image which says what he needs to use to

00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:11,570
run the hd-dvd app here i am selling a

00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:13,880
default for that like Santos httpd and

00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:18,570
this could be operated in as well and

00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:21,630
also i'm mentioning a the host port at

00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:23,730
the port on the post on which to bind

00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:25,680
the 80 power of the container for

00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:27,450
example if I running multiple instances

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,360
of it on the same machine right I cannot

00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:32,250
do that I cannot bind every 80 power of

00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,140
the content with 80 portrait so based on

00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:36,779
that situation I can customize it to

00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:45,120
actually like bind it to any random port

00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:45,990
and also all these like so all the nodes

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,209
in the graph they have their own

00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:50,279
parameters and also the way I can put

00:13:48,209 --> 00:13:55,110
certain restrictions on the parameters

00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:58,860
as well by if you see that on the

00:13:55,110 --> 00:14:01,350
constraints in the second host port so I

00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:04,470
have added a constraint which adds a

00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:06,360
regex that put numb force can only be

00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:09,890
numbers of this pattern so if you try to

00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,890
enter a wrong value it did not accept

00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:16,290
really yet we can do but most of us

00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:19,079
stone but we can root is the feature

00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:22,649
that that allows you to be done but like

00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:24,180
people just skip that and also the

00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:25,860
defaults are for just for user

00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,880
friendliness sometimes when you're like

00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:30,060
when you know that you're going to run

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,290
the posh a server on 80 port you don't

00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,000
want to configure that that's what the

00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:35,310
defaults are there that allows you to

00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,019
override the values if needed but you

00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,850
can just proceed with a policy for like

00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:42,199
if you know that you

00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:45,050
environment will allow it and with the

00:14:42,199 --> 00:14:48,110
parents actually define that what data

00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:50,509
my application or new liquid needs to be

00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:53,569
instantiated right but what did i do I

00:14:50,509 --> 00:14:55,100
need to run and answers file as a name

00:14:53,569 --> 00:14:57,050
so there is an answer to the questions

00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:59,269
that are raised in the params like what

00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:01,399
data do I need and answers file could be

00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:03,680
in any format it could be in JSON format

00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:06,050
it could be in the ml format it's just

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:09,290
say like kind of like a hash of half a

00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:11,569
hash where you have got sections and the

00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:14,089
section if I would go to the previous

00:15:11,569 --> 00:15:15,620
spec definition it's like one of the

00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:17,560
node names right hello patches so

00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:24,459
there's a section for help a shape

00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:29,630
inside the answers yes got in the water

00:15:24,459 --> 00:15:33,079
I don't give you sort of clear bit this

00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:38,209
translate well until i can put click on

00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:40,040
that in a bit yeah so so here we have

00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:42,589
got various sections in ansys file where

00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:44,810
you can pass the data which you want to

00:15:42,589 --> 00:15:46,310
overwrite we can either supplied data

00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:48,889
for the parents or you can override the

00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:52,550
default variables for example like here

00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:54,560
i'm using before i had used centos httpd

00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:56,149
as the default value so it doesn't make

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,509
much sense even if I don't give that

00:15:56,149 --> 00:16:03,290
just pick up centos h3 bit d but if I

00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:05,959
want to run this oz on save on a su very

00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:08,630
content based out of fedora I can do

00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:11,990
this I can even over the port in which

00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:14,269
the my continuous bound in the post so I

00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:15,620
can configure click my answer Square to

00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:20,000
match various of my environment

00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:22,699
requirements and specifications also the

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,259
new local specification has a room for

00:16:22,699 --> 00:16:27,589
various providers providers as in like

00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:32,389
communities talker open shaped and we

00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:34,040
have got artifact files so this points

00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:36,050
to the artifact passes in like community

00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:40,040
templates or open ship templates or like

00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:41,689
talker commands right so the thing in

00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,600
ridiculous that is kind of pretty much

00:16:41,689 --> 00:16:46,189
explicit nothing is magic so the the

00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,079
question that you have set does it

00:16:46,189 --> 00:16:48,980
generate to an artifact file for

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,870
template for

00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:53,060
when shape our communities it does not

00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:56,630
you have to do one time before you have

00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:59,930
to write the templates with which can be

00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:02,089
configured I'll just shoo this so even

00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:03,410
the templates will usually talk about

00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:04,970
like templates are the articles that

00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:06,980
gets deployed in the orchestration

00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:08,299
platforms like we have our templates for

00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:11,169
communities and open shape we have got

00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:13,579
different kinds of files or marathon but

00:17:11,169 --> 00:17:17,689
taka commands which is one liner right

00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:19,309
so we can have placeholders in the

00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:21,410
template like a dollar image straight

00:17:19,309 --> 00:17:23,449
which gets populated founding values we

00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:27,199
supplied in the answers data right so we

00:17:23,449 --> 00:17:29,630
can create dynamic artifact files from

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,400
the templates that we put but yes you

00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:34,250
have to create the tempest manually as

00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,870
in a when a scope newly good we wanted

00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:37,520
that it is it should not be magic you

00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:39,650
should not do too much medical stuff it

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,380
should be explicit and you are in full

00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:43,790
control of what you do so you have to

00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:47,090
write the can back once but once you

00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:49,040
ship it for taking providers you don't

00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:51,620
need to break apart from anything but

00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:53,600
the answers pilot so it's kind of

00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:55,429
explicit and that was one of the design

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,100
decisions that it took so we can keep

00:17:55,429 --> 00:18:00,860
the tooling lenient simple not magical

00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:02,510
end because with magic comes like a lot

00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:04,070
of uncertainty and let things go wrong

00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:06,799
and you don't know what has happened

00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:09,380
here all is just render the templates

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:14,780
with the data we provide and deployed as

00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:17,720
simple as that so coming to at amiga

00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:19,970
soliloquy is a specification it doesn't

00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,890
do anything it just says how you package

00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:24,890
your multi container applications and

00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:26,780
shape it but we need something to run it

00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:28,870
right so atomic ab is a reference

00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:31,940
implementation of molecule which

00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:33,290
installs runs and manages the lifecycle

00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:36,490
of medical app on a particular

00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:38,720
orchestrator so you can fetch medical

00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:41,360
applications with atomic app you can run

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:45,350
it you can stop in on the provider and

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:48,919
and yeah and you can also you also use

00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:52,130
atomic app to build images for local

00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:53,690
images so one of the decisions that it

00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:56,299
took for building new visual images I

00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:59,570
was that like the liquid email should we

00:18:56,299 --> 00:19:01,290
stand alone so the image should should

00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:03,240
contain the code that is necessary

00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:04,800
run and deploy this thing so you don't

00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,430
need to install anything apart from

00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:10,980
rocker on a machine to actually run a

00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:13,160
neutral images yes you do need the admin

00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:15,960
costs and the atmosphere like a man so

00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:18,300
the container so whenever we make the in

00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,980
Oracle image we pace it from the atomic

00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,720
app image which contains the source code

00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:24,300
for a particular version of atomic app

00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:26,490
and if contains certain metadata

00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:28,140
definition and then we axe the meta data

00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:30,810
files like the numerical draaga file and

00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:33,000
the artifact files inside the inside the

00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:34,650
container during the build process so it

00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,930
is standard it contains a code that

00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:39,660
needs to be done to actually manage

00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:42,150
these up in yourself so we have chosen

00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,740
the container format and the mechanism

00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:47,880
system to actually deliver beautiful

00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:50,700
images so no other new delivery pipeline

00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,870
so we use docker bills and dr. automated

00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:57,420
billing service to deliver it has

00:19:51,870 --> 00:20:00,300
containers so will try to look into some

00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:04,980
demos several things make things much

00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:08,940
more clear yeah so the most of the demos

00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:15,050
are made by Tomas my colleague and here

00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:15,050
I need to share mckernon

00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:25,359
ok

00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:25,359
ok

00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,360
who

00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:35,850
the city of the hand

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,140
hmm

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:54,550
us so I'm on an empty territory so i'll

00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:57,280
show you various methods to actually run

00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:59,890
analytical in oracle application so i'll

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,720
take the example of wordpress in oracle

00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:06,990
application which consists of a database

00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:06,990
and the wordpress application container

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:17,350
so i have got the atomic CLA with me yep

00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:19,570
so all i need to do is so let me try to

00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:26,800
run the workers up on talker so all i

00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:32,470
need to do is pseudo atomic install very

00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:35,520
difficult to type like this thomas to

00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:35,520
misspell words

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:59,000
it's correct address oh sorry

00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:13,880
ya know I just need to run this yeah

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,880
guess what happens

00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:27,640
oh so I have no data with me right now

00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:29,800
so adamant gap is designed in such a way

00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:32,050
that for the missing data it will ask me

00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:34,300
for data this is not for diplomas just

00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:36,280
for like Kerry started with it so I'll

00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:45,310
just enter some random values with this

00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:57,940
like position does is it do you run or

00:22:45,310 --> 00:23:06,330
is it a trade Chris battery yep I think

00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:06,330
I'll just I'll slip it up as a cloning

00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:14,130
to my strength is better changes

00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:25,730
is it feasible or do anything increase

00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:31,390
the font size as good I forgot one

00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:31,390
diameter provider docker

00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:45,419
so it says that my application now

00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:47,280
resides in a directory which is gender

00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:49,950
on fly badly we're having a project

00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:54,059
Adamek WordPress end of 7 11 gap and

00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:55,409
then a random number and yeah so that is

00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:59,610
the data Overmind the state of my

00:23:55,409 --> 00:24:02,490
application days so let me do a talk of

00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:07,799
TS and yeah the silver I'll just scrape

00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:10,770
it with a to make yeah yeah so I see

00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:15,049
that my wordpress container and my ID

00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:17,789
badnik container is running I see that

00:24:15,049 --> 00:24:24,350
the WordPress application is running in

00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:28,440
port 8888 so I can try to hit my browser

00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:29,909
localhost yeah and he is WordPress is

00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,799
running I just need to configure the

00:24:29,909 --> 00:24:33,690
language and then enter the calm and

00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:36,090
yeah I'll be set up with what was said

00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:41,250
but that's on docker which is pretty

00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:43,500
kind of that simple so I'll just kill in

00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:45,419
my application right now so I have

00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:50,510
started my deployment application I'll

00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:50,510
gnaw on diploma application wait yeah

00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:59,680
yep yep so i just mentioned the state

00:24:56,730 --> 00:25:01,840
this the folder in with my state of the

00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:08,790
application resided so i'll do against

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:08,790
pseudo atomic run the image name

00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:28,210
so if he says there is stopping the

00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:28,210
images one we want you to do that

00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:48,720
stay some time

00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:00,900
seeing a lot of time for dr. I don't

00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:00,900
take that much time for darker

00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:18,170
yeah it's it has under ployed the

00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:22,910
content applications from my dropping

00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:29,660
Dockers engine and so if I do it talk

00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:33,680
pas grave grave atomic yeah it's been

00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:36,470
such a successful undercard so now I'll

00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:38,780
try to do the same on a marathon

00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:42,980
provider Mrs Madison provided and for

00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:44,900
that i am using our ADV marathon box

00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:46,160
which has already preset up with

00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:48,020
marathon so i don't need to set a

00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:50,510
marathon I'll do it just I have already

00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:53,810
done back end up so I'll do a very end

00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:58,540
ssh to log into my math and box and let

00:26:53,810 --> 00:27:02,240
me switch to a folder for demo yep so I

00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:09,860
just move the wordpress folder from

00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:12,140
there into use sudo let me use at me

00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:14,210
captive fetch the so this time i will be

00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:15,980
doing an unmonitored deployment so that

00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:18,230
i do not need to enter in value manually

00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:19,790
i be using the answers file to deploy it

00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:24,740
automatically that's how to do it in

00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:29,330
production so happy first fetching the

00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:36,050
image for this happening Adam grandpa's

00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:40,310
it back to make word press Santos herb

00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:43,790
an atomic app and I'll be running it in

00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:48,440
a mode of fetch and are they giving the

00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:53,690
destination as a local workspace

00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:56,060
directory yeah it just download the

00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:57,410
image and extracted in the local

00:27:56,060 --> 00:28:00,470
workplace tractors who are seen into

00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:03,200
that directory here I see that it

00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:04,760
contains an answer sconce ample files so

00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,780
that's a pre-populated file with all the

00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:08,840
parameters that the WordPress

00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:11,480
application needs but it is if I just do

00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:13,250
a care of it so most of the values are

00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,440
none which are set it right now and then

00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:17,440
try to start the workers container or

00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:23,110
marathon so

00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:28,090
same answers Oh so first I'll be copying

00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:30,009
it to answers.com because answers.com

00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:31,450
fixity forefathers rate now the sample

00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:38,379
file so i have just copied it into

00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:42,519
answers com I don't have came on this

00:28:38,379 --> 00:28:44,950
machine so yeah so let me say some easy

00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:46,570
Paris password and then I can use the

00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:56,529
word w pay for the name of the database

00:28:46,570 --> 00:29:00,519
and user they'd be WB and 17 to 0 1 i'm

00:28:56,529 --> 00:29:04,659
switching to an absolute a IP address

00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:06,429
because i do not have like a DNS set up

00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:08,080
on my math and set up soldiers i'm using

00:29:06,429 --> 00:29:12,250
the absolute talker preachers address

00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:14,320
for that and who's put 880 music past

00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:17,500
soon as possible again I'll use this in

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,960
lost my ID be in H and username is the

00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:25,139
bleep again and between instantly p and

00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:25,139
i will set up the provider as marathon

00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:35,190
seems too good so let me first run sudo

00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:35,190
at term it run

00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:41,070
what

00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:51,690
tom

00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:53,639
listen

00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:56,639
yeah it says it has deployed this

00:29:53,639 --> 00:29:59,549
application and I have now did the run

00:29:56,639 --> 00:30:01,049
and run in current directory so that's

00:29:59,549 --> 00:30:02,399
why I give daughter for that so that i

00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,990
have got steeped preserved in the

00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:08,669
current directory rather than a random

00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:17,669
directly undergrad lib at me cap so

00:30:08,669 --> 00:30:21,240
let's see the marathon you I oh it says

00:30:17,669 --> 00:30:25,289
that my ebay and wordpress apps are

00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:27,799
running now and it has given me an IP so

00:30:25,289 --> 00:30:30,809
let me click it and see what it is there

00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:33,059
yeah so what this is now running on

00:30:30,809 --> 00:30:35,759
marathon is it the same numerical

00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:40,080
application and I can do and do the

00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:44,789
setup but are not going to this yeah so

00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:47,909
now let me undergo it so I'll to run off

00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:50,190
this image using a modes talk and dot

00:30:47,909 --> 00:30:52,350
for the current folder and it will

00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:57,600
underplay it and if I go to the marathon

00:30:52,350 --> 00:31:00,360
you I yeah so yeah it has underworld all

00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:05,220
the things so I do not see my container

00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:07,950
trying here anymore so now it's time for

00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:11,850
Cuban it is so there is a another way to

00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:16,350
run so till this time as using atomic

00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:18,960
CLI to run at Emma gap so admix CLI uses

00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:20,370
so we have I say that we have a

00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,980
reference implementation of nautical

00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:24,360
that is called atomic app which is code

00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:27,029
that France and managers in medical

00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:29,490
application and atomic CLA indirectly

00:31:27,029 --> 00:31:31,830
calls that code to run it from the image

00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:33,539
so we can also if you want to access the

00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:36,960
cool features that are developing day by

00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:38,940
day every day so we use at mega because

00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,009
as the latest code and it takes some

00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:43,289
time for it to repeal then go to atomic

00:31:41,009 --> 00:31:46,759
say like so i will show you how to use

00:31:43,289 --> 00:31:46,759
erica commands directly

00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:59,370
yep they're okay on the death or nothing

00:31:55,920 --> 00:32:02,750
so so the commands that has showed you

00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:05,580
earlier right so here so atomic ABS

00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:08,070
supports a lot of other commands then

00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:09,600
the command supported a twix a lie so

00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:12,420
that's why we have got an option called

00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:14,580
like mode where we I specified fetch

00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:17,730
some time I have specific run sometime a

00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:19,260
special stop sometimes but in atomic f

00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:21,900
deserve like the first level entries for

00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:25,490
my come online so I can directly fetch

00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:25,490
as I will do right now

00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:51,990
what press and destination has your

00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:53,940
press other branch with sudo yeah so I

00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:55,620
don't need advocacy let you access at

00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:57,780
amika packin to that using atomic app

00:32:55,620 --> 00:33:00,950
come and rightly so I'll sit into

00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:06,780
WordPress again not do the same thing

00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:11,690
sudo CP and the copy answers.com sample

00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:17,040
52 answers.com and i'll go and edit it I

00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:22,380
ancestor calm and just some sample

00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:24,510
values here I don't need to override the

00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:27,240
murdered everything because a Kunis

00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:30,080
comes with a service thing is which can

00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,080
actually map by piece

00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:39,920
yeah and by default the provided

00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:43,970
assistance is provided to the Cuban it

00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:47,900
is and so if i'll just take communities

00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:49,760
if it is running something now Cuba

00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:53,030
ladies has no pores running in on it or

00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:57,080
no services as well oh there is a Q&A

00:33:53,030 --> 00:34:07,700
service on it sir and yeah so I'll do

00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:09,530
sudo atomic app dot through yeah so we

00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:15,230
sensory system deployment so i will

00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:17,480
watch cube CTL the force yeah the order

00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:24,560
came wow this is not come so fastly

00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:27,920
yesterday watch is the application until

00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:30,770
I cannot get him like a pouch projects

00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:33,620
at the namespace since since it is the

00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:35,390
like we use the raw like template files

00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:37,610
for Cuban is you can do eater anything

00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:42,980
and we can define the name spaces which

00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:44,480
get deployed yeah so here the next place

00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:47,990
is by default is default that have an

00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:53,140
overriding so let me have a look into

00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:56,240
the service keeps et al where services I

00:34:53,140 --> 00:35:00,700
see that it is running on the WordPress

00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,700
I can access on this thing try to go on

00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:08,350
yeah so what this is running on Cuban is

00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:13,880
now i can now to an sudo add to make a

00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:15,740
stop dot and you under ploy and if i go

00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:18,710
to keep silicate services the services

00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:21,920
have been taken down and the pores also

00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:24,320
have been taken down it's my to be 44 is

00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,860
lectern anything right now should we

00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,860
come later

00:35:30,259 --> 00:35:35,059
Adams of estimating

00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:47,550
I determinant that's gay that's a that's

00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:49,800
a given a scene i would like to showcase

00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:53,430
one of the new features that have worked

00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:56,730
on so so we have got now add images

00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:58,140
right and it has been posed to github so

00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:00,060
we need a way to actually place the

00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:01,680
article index as in like an index card

00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:03,570
make index where you can go and look up

00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,310
what applications run on which is

00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:07,890
providers and from you know the name

00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:10,260
which you have to image your to download

00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:13,140
to run it the n conceived in your

00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:24,109
application right so we have we have a

00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:24,109
command called index am I using

00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:36,830
well I'm using our updated version which

00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,830
is released

00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:48,029
the Bronx

00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:52,230
get tickle monster

00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:13,599
mm-hmm

00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:13,599
there wasn't any this month

00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:40,440
was it changes merged or direct right

00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:45,150
from Survivor Series its nature is right

00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:48,320
I don't know why it's not showing up I

00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:48,320
try that is

00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:00,240
oh yes

00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:13,840
so we have got a command con list which

00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:16,050
points to the upstream medical library

00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:20,080
depository and it lists on the new local

00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:26,609
medical images that are uploaded there

00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:29,680
so it is yeah this is the repository

00:38:26,609 --> 00:38:32,590
which contains all the beautiful images

00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:36,400
that we have we officially support and

00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:39,840
it faces from that repository but if I

00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:42,940
want I can generate my own index myself

00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:46,540
so all eyes need to go to a local

00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:50,410
medical library depository or something

00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:52,150
similar to that so I have gone to my

00:38:50,410 --> 00:39:01,450
local new club early and I can run

00:38:52,150 --> 00:39:03,640
atomic a index generate and the location

00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:05,290
here so and it will be generating and

00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:07,570
updating the index file from this

00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:09,310
repository so if you have your own in

00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:12,310
expository you can build your index

00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:15,460
yourself on your machine so if i run

00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:18,550
after make appt index list again so it

00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:22,060
will be showing the things from this

00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:24,640
repository which in my lap or both are

00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:26,440
the same but yes it shows the different

00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,869
providers that the a particular image

00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:31,390
supports like t4 docker over open ship k

00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:36,460
for communities and aim for marathon and

00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:38,050
it also tells you the image image name

00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:40,810
to actually pull from the talker public

00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:42,609
registry so these are the information

00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:44,940
that are available from this index

00:39:42,609 --> 00:39:44,940
command

00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:55,030
so the point at the point that we have

00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:57,160
mentioned right regarding like

00:39:55,030 --> 00:40:01,660
generating the temples right so we do

00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:03,700
not want to make a complicated or to

00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:05,620
load it as in making into a lot of stuff

00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:08,410
which then makes things complicated and

00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:10,690
then then a lot of class I even force or

00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:13,590
so we want to be well clean and simple

00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:16,930
but we are considering the option of

00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:18,910
automatically generating the article

00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:21,610
files particular providers based on a

00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:23,590
common language something similar to say

00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:26,440
like what about dr. Campos right son is

00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:28,180
similar but not exactly dr. Campos they

00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,090
are to me in advance that there should

00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:32,920
be an easier way to get into this

00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:34,840
orchestration platforms because given

00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:36,610
the running cup of Cuban it is math math

00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,840
on everything so different like dammit

00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:39,820
really opposite to each other and then

00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:41,590
you'll earn achievements as limp as

00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:42,970
activities is not equal for you you

00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:45,550
learn math on and then you realize that

00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:47,350
Marilyn something good for you so there

00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:50,170
should be some high-level temporal

00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:51,340
definition which tells how to deploy a

00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:54,130
multiple Graham variation the

00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:56,050
perspective of the organization

00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:58,230
providers irrespective of math and

00:40:56,050 --> 00:41:00,430
history irrespective of communities

00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:03,880
symbol to write and simple to understand

00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:05,980
and simple to read as well so you know

00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:08,200
understands something which it takes a

00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:09,820
like universal format and change the

00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:13,180
undercut pass for you and then finally

00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:16,900
ship it using illegal because it does

00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:19,810
what it does quite well is simple but we

00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:21,760
want the msu nice philosophies smallest

00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:24,100
beautiful plump small things together

00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:28,000
and they make it work and deliver a

00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:30,610
bigger story so that's what we are

00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:34,270
exploring and yeah that ends my

00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:36,550
presentation so these are some of the

00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:39,850
things that we have open it website at

00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:42,400
project atomic drop io and those links

00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:45,460
for a repository on github project admin

00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:48,670
/ molecule and atomic stash atomic app

00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:49,760
and you can NHS to us on a mailing list

00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:56,030
of container

00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:57,560
pools a trailer calm so anyone any do

00:41:56,030 --> 00:42:03,050
you have any question regarding we can

00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:04,550
discuss regarding the spec do we yep so

00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:07,220
what problems with action concerning

00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:09,080
engineers fact is that for a basic

00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:11,630
functionality it's possible to actually

00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:15,880
have certain Universal highland white so

00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:18,950
once we get things like mapping for its

00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:20,960
storage shouldn't other areas where the

00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:28,220
difference tration frameworks if arrived

00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:30,500
with each other yep yeah seems a little

00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:32,930
bit more challenging it is to come up

00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:36,230
with a generic approach for that and

00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:39,580
within the existing rules back that's

00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:42,740
you know in issue infinite unresolved

00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:48,110
that is any any thoughts on what that

00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:50,510
would look like in the future the

00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:52,670
challenges in this space is that the

00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:56,000
underlying technologies are so different

00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:57,770
and they are moving so fast is very

00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,570
difficult to like level the surface and

00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:03,370
like fill the common spec but even if

00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:06,350
you do that so the way I see it is that

00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:08,120
when you talk about a front developer so

00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:09,950
we are totally the developer side it's

00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:11,360
like 0 beta entry for developers to

00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:15,500
deflower the containers on production

00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:17,540
without learning anything so T so we're

00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:19,970
at our developer said I don't want to be

00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:23,390
bothered which force to expose myself is

00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:25,730
too or like what networks example in dr.

00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:27,050
compose we can specify which networks

00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:29,540
might contain insurance but as a

00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:30,950
developer what your care choosing

00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:32,990
networks and choosing all the sport

00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:35,180
layers and all this is a job of the high

00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:37,200
tea right as a developer I don't need to

00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:39,030
do that here but everyone right now

00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:42,000
how that works is we used to get a

00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:43,640
little mean found that excluded to

00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,930
writing a bunch of transcripts then

00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:48,570
provided direct mmm which is not really

00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:51,690
a solution it's not a solution but with

00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:53,760
it so what we're targeting is that we

00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:55,890
aren't a product that developer audience

00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,690
so that like it's a it's a spec that is

00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:59,520
very easy to discover nice very high

00:43:57,690 --> 00:44:01,890
level without giving you the details of

00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:04,050
the platform level details right you

00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:06,540
define everything in an abstract way for

00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:08,040
example like networking in Dhaka right

00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:10,350
it's a way to actually a salute

00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:11,730
applications but how you a salute

00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:13,200
applications is totally an actual

00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:15,480
decision right infrastructure decision

00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:18,270
you can isolate application either by

00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:20,340
doing putting parole rules or you can

00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:22,170
create private networks as with them but

00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:24,300
it's totally and infrastructure decision

00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:26,820
a developer should not bother rather

00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:28,890
what should be specifying is that ok I

00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:30,420
have got an application a and it depends

00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:33,180
on application p so i need to action

00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:35,250
access application p and that

00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:36,780
application does not need to depend on

00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:38,760
us for example a DP does not need to

00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:41,430
know about the application right so if

00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:43,830
if it tracks is a application something

00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:45,750
wrong right so you define in a

00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:48,750
high-level way what are you depend s is

00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:51,720
right and let the two pooling underneath

00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:55,050
it figure out what space or the off

00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:58,770
skirts to decide how to achieve that

00:44:55,050 --> 00:45:01,470
level modulation so we are planning to

00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:04,620
come well actually discussing right now

00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:07,800
on those kind of issues that how you can

00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:10,470
like define applications in a

00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:12,450
developer's language without let's

00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:14,570
separate the platform level details and

00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:18,270
the high level architech like

00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:21,420
architecture specification so it will

00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:24,770
take some time because as I said all the

00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:27,930
tooling tools are protein different and

00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:29,040
we have to get people on board when we

00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:31,920
are talking about such a thing because

00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:33,510
if we just do it inside our organization

00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,690
is not going to make sense you have to

00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:39,690
get everyone on board and like here and

00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:42,320
labeling the surface like mesos marathon

00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:45,050
is totally different from Cuban it is is

00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:48,230
it's totally different take on how you

00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:50,720
things right so learning the surface is

00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:54,020
difficult and again if even if you level

00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:55,340
the ghosts are all moving past we will

00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:57,230
always keep on chasing them it's not

00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:59,180
like when delivered came up for the

00:45:57,230 --> 00:46:02,540
virtualization world when things have

00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:04,610
settled they knew like what to do and

00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:06,230
like things were not moving the fast but

00:46:04,610 --> 00:46:08,930
now in the country ecosystem things are

00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:10,130
moving so fast that even if you keep

00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:12,290
leveling you'll keep on running with the

00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:14,390
bulldozer and keeping keep on living the

00:46:12,290 --> 00:46:16,760
road all the way so but still a

00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:18,830
Sagittarius accessory I have spoken to a

00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:21,890
lot of devotion developers they feel the

00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:23,840
need of sense too because I've made a

00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:26,240
lot of people who try a platform and

00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:28,700
they invest a lot of time and energy in

00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,900
doing things in a platform to realize at

00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:33,590
a later time that it does not work for

00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:35,660
them in it and yeah and then they don't

00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:37,280
want to come out of that because I put

00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:39,350
it there there is an investment on the

00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:41,540
platform right but if you have got such

00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:44,440
to really let people expenditures a

00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:46,640
proper tool which suits their purpose

00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:51,050
does that partially answer your question

00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:53,480
or like does it not at all I kind of

00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:58,430
amusing a issues that we need the other

00:46:53,480 --> 00:47:00,860
yeah so is that having having this is

00:46:58,430 --> 00:47:02,020
good but we need the other pieces of the

00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:05,470
apps people can actually

00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:06,490
the developers yeah yep and the other

00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:07,930
piece is going to be a little more

00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:10,330
complicated because we're going to need

00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:13,510
effectively what amounts to a separate

00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:14,680
driver sorcery yeah and there's some

00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:16,840
things that people never be able to

00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:19,330
cover like i was looking at what it

00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:23,830
would take to support Cooper Danny's pet

00:47:19,330 --> 00:47:26,290
set in new liver yeah the first question

00:47:23,830 --> 00:47:31,840
is do we actually want to go there yeah

00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:33,100
or so we are not like still we want to

00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,840
confine answers to just bring the

00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:36,490
packaging for a multicolored application

00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:39,040
so you don't want to do the magic bits

00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:40,810
in unicode but yes the tool for doing

00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,460
the magic words is required we can

00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:43,840
change the articles for you but yeah

00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:45,790
that is going to be complicated but

00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:47,470
that's where the fun is like we take the

00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:49,960
hardships of like the black part of the

00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:53,410
users becomes simple so that's what

00:47:49,960 --> 00:48:00,820
we're ready for ya pull your layering

00:47:53,410 --> 00:48:02,470
and layering image Wilson one stats do

00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:04,120
you mean the compressibility like a new

00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:06,910
eleiko suppose composability as i said

00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:08,800
like so neutral works like this like you

00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:10,900
have got a big a pride it depends on X a

00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:13,120
and B and apps and we could again be a

00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:14,620
collection of miracles so new wrinkle

00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:16,360
once you package something in a new

00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:18,610
decree it's a black box for you right

00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:20,080
you don't want to look in into inside of

00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:21,940
what happens you just consume it you

00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:24,670
have got an end point you know that it

00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:26,080
works that's the conference that milk it

00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:29,610
gives you write once the package it is a

00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:33,880
black box were you it works for you yep

00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:37,060
it's a platform developers right or the

00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:39,130
art say there is a black box for the the

00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:41,260
consuming new legal applications so new

00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:45,300
reader application is consuming p it

00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:45,300
doesn't need to know what beasts meta

00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,920
don't have to care about into such a

00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:55,670
ride yep so as I me as I think of

00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:59,630
century I asked in group f to die campus

00:48:55,670 --> 00:49:03,080
who have to who has to back up for

00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:05,210
example of our DB me as a different

00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:07,520
infrastructure guy don't want to know

00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:11,540
what developers tutor oh yeah I need to

00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:14,180
because it yeah and developers don't

00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:17,930
want to do because he and I me my

00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:20,990
scrotum is not a solution here I go yeah

00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:24,080
so those kind of things will have a like

00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:25,640
we haven't attended yet I think we need

00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:26,990
to talk with more people actually this

00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:30,050
is one of the recommends that you came

00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:31,730
up right so maybe like we need more mind

00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:33,620
share on this tool so that we can hear

00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:35,210
to your needs and come up with the

00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:37,550
tooling that is necessary for this kind

00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:39,380
of issues currently it's not we don't

00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:41,210
have a diet solution for that in Munich

00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:43,640
you'll you can do that you can have

00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:45,200
Lucas again you can write k cubed Reese

00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:47,180
templates and all stuff right you can

00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:49,730
run run something there please keep some

00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:52,520
backing up your data bases start time to

00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:54,260
time but like nothing is not a solution

00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:56,510
that is provided by really cool directly

00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:58,730
but if it is a requirement you must

00:49:56,510 --> 00:50:01,040
consider with love to actually look into

00:49:58,730 --> 00:50:04,750
this and like created to that actually

00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:07,280
solves problems of DevOps and devils

00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:09,430
you're welcome desecrated issue a newly

00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,430
cool

00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:18,740
I think it's time and the others focus

00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:18,740
