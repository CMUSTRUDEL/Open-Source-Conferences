Title: Flock 2016 - Globalization audit of Fedora Atomic, Pravin Satpute
Publication date: 2016-08-21
Playlist: Flock 2016
Description: 
	During last couple of times, when I heard FPL one thing came up on high priority, that is Fedora Atomic. Unfortunately at G11N group we are not that much concentrating on requirements of Fedora Atomic. Most of the things for G11N available in Atomic are imported from Workstation and Server version. I feel there is need to do Audit of Fedora Atomic specifically from the requirements of G11N aspects and will present this audit report in this talks. Following points will be covered.
1. Installation
2. Locales
3. Fonts
4. Lang packs
5. Important packages for Internationalization and Localization in Atomic
6. Communications - WG, meetings, schedules.
