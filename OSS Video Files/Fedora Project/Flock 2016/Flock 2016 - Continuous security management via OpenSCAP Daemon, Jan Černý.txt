OpenSCAP is a set of components to perform security audit of system’s configuration, available in Fedora. The main purpose of the toolset is to verify whether a system is configured in line with given security policy. In this talk we will introduce OpenSCAP Daemon, a new tool that allows both the continuous and on demand evaluation of IT infrastructure. We will discuss its usage for security hardening of bare-metal machines, virtual machines, and containers. The session will also cover OpenSCAP Daemon integration with the Project Atomic. Finally we will conclude with depicting where OpenSCAP Daemon development is heading next.
