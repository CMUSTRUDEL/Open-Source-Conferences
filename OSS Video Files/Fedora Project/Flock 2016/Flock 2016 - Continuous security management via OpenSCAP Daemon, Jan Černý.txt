	(This recording was on a laptop with a defective microphone. Unfortunately, it does not seem like the audio is able to be restored. Please refer to the slides and transcription for the talk, if available.)

OpenSCAP is a set of components to perform security audit of system’s configuration, available in Fedora. The main purpose of the toolset is to verify whether a system is configured in line with given security policy. In this talk we will introduce OpenSCAP Daemon, a new tool that allows both the continuous and on demand evaluation of IT infrastructure. We will discuss its usage for security hardening of bare-metal machines, virtual machines, and containers. The session will also cover OpenSCAP Daemon integration with the Project Atomic. Finally we will conclude with depicting where OpenSCAP Daemon development is heading next.

hello everybody thank you very much for

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:42,480
coming nice to see all you hear my name

00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:45,330
is concerning either in the redhead in a

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,420
security technologies team and I am the

00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:51,559
developer on the open access project

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:55,019
which is a security compliance tool and

00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:59,519
I came to talk to tell you something

00:00:55,019 --> 00:01:02,100
about hope and Escott and also these new

00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:06,210
component within the open esta project

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:09,750
which is called open escape demon but

00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:13,080
let's start from the beginning computer

00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:15,750
security is very gross stop it and today

00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,990
in this day we have to hurt a lot of

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:22,619
talk through which that the security

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:27,840
somehow but from the most high level

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:32,039
point of view we can say that safe

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:35,340
systems or secure systems they don't

00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:38,759
contain vulnerabilities and they are

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:42,749
also configure in a way that they don't

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:47,609
post any classes and our tool of

00:01:42,749 --> 00:01:49,920
openness is is able to detect both

00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:56,280
of those vulnerabilities and weaknesses

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:59,180
and sorry first let's start with those

00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:05,960
liabilities everything has a lot of

00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:08,270
abilities the videos is that fun of the

00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:13,760
smaller abilities have been already

00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:19,459
found and six is bad night and the

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:23,450
details are publicly available but the

00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:26,510
best news is that it occurs tries to

00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:30,200
find some systems just around without

00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:35,060
don't stick is installed sunday would

00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:36,890
like to get like to use those hips

00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:41,720
thighs which are already publicly

00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:44,270
available so some of the abilities are

00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:46,970
well no no they are even can see men's

00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:52,220
you you have definitely helped about

00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:56,420
shell-shocked and Blenheim and so how

00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:59,739
can you detect that our system is

00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:03,670
affected by a lot of those non

00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:07,250
vulnerabilities basically we can compare

00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:13,390
our the thousands of our install

00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:18,830
packages with list of necessities

00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:21,680
provided by the vendor who know in which

00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:26,900
version of the particular package the

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:29,799
space was not in and if we have an older

00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:35,380
version it means that we have installed

00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:40,570
we have on our system vulnerabilities so

00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:42,620
need to operate and talk about

00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:47,570
vulnerabilities and the second thing

00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:48,880
that I mentioned is the population the

00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,770
system of

00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:55,030
must be toxic you all should be

00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:58,680
continued in the way that it very eyes a

00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:03,130
lot of our security issues this includes

00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:05,560
lot of things for example you you should

00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:11,650
have a feeling like that you shouldn't

00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:15,910
run some terminal five tenets which have

00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:19,209
not considered secure you shouldn't

00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:22,770
allow users to login which with the

00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:25,780
little tassel or there are many

00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:31,770
recommendation many recommendations and

00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:35,490
there is no government guidance this

00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:41,020
configuration really depends although

00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:47,380
their fault of the earth or on the unit

00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:49,950
circle system so damn much more there

00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:55,750
are many security guidances for a

00:04:49,950 --> 00:05:00,910
different purpose and how can we how can

00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:03,710
we how can we take it that our system is

00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:06,560
configured in line with Annie

00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:10,520
those liabilities basically you will

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:13,550
have to browse all the configuration

00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:21,710
file and check which services are turned

00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:25,750
on and become available and Judith do a

00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:29,000
lot of stuff to do on the computer I

00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:32,690
know ask your question would you like to

00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:37,270
do that manually definitely not and

00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:42,020
that's why we have a open ESCA openness

00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:44,950
is a significant combines to it provides

00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:48,830
both configuration scanning and

00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:52,520
vulnerability scanning of your system

00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:55,790
opening stuff is already stated racket

00:05:52,520 --> 00:06:09,140
oh we are starting to develop eating

00:05:55,790 --> 00:06:16,150
redhead seven years ago it provides a

00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:16,150
come on line two hasta el which has

00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:24,770
which can you scan your system and open

00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:27,410
a stock is relevant adoro so you can

00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:31,670
solve this package and you will get a

00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:35,330
stop to that hurley my scanner is not

00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:42,509
enough because you need

00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:45,330
or we say security policies and those

00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:48,719
are security policies are indeed for

00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:52,129
openness top Duggar scanner and those

00:06:48,719 --> 00:06:56,719
security policies are machine readable

00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:59,460
implementation of the security guidance

00:06:56,719 --> 00:07:01,860
there are also some standardized

00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:06,180
security guidance for example if your

00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:15,779
server or your your computer to process

00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:18,300
payment of using security guidance the

00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:21,839
payment card industry security data

00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:26,419
security standard and there are many of

00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:30,539
many others depending on the service and

00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:36,749
no tendencies are visual some pitbul

00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:40,310
with a lot of words but we can convert

00:07:36,749 --> 00:07:43,800
them or implement them using esta forma

00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:48,149
estar stands for a security company of

00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:52,080
the nation protocol and it's some of you

00:07:48,149 --> 00:07:57,000
in this area to the ranch checks to

00:07:52,080 --> 00:08:01,199
write benchmarks to write goals so the

00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:05,099
demons are already using analyze and I

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:07,800
thought you would like to develop some

00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:11,189
music summer fire now definitely

00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:18,200
wouldn't but there are some crazy guys

00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:21,320
who do that and bring you know the

00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:24,440
security guys donde esta security guys

00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:30,560
project is the set of open-source

00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:33,620
security policies it provides forma

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:37,550
there for machinery development can be

00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:43,790
they can be used by open eska and also

00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:47,090
provides a human-readable HTML dice and

00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:51,200
we can return why a particular rule is

00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:55,040
good to follow a while your voice is

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:59,800
beautiful and it also from the security

00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:04,610
guys also contains the so-called

00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:08,950
remediation Street those aspects which

00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:14,290
can fix your system you your suspend all

00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:14,290
particular them compliance particular

00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:23,150
you can run the script yeah and those

00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:26,890
clips where I'll fix the particular

00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:30,700
thing so then you will ask and

00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:30,700
aesthetically the guide provides

00:09:42,060 --> 00:10:44,610
and and and also some research funding

00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:48,990
esta esta hold open a Star Trek which

00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:54,360
which can be evaluated by opening stop

00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:56,950
so if you want to so now we have a

00:10:54,360 --> 00:11:01,780
security point is we have the scanner

00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:04,660
and we could start screaming actually it

00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:09,459
would be nice or it would be better to

00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:15,639
start with Esteban men because

00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:22,410
education which else you can in a you

00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:28,059
know in a few stats and this application

00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:34,889
can spend all of the systems and recon

00:11:28,059 --> 00:11:44,529
systems using hesitate and it provides

00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:49,389
provides my support and also initially

00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:54,069
better result so our escape our bench

00:11:49,389 --> 00:11:56,949
can be installed on fedora I have it on

00:11:54,069 --> 00:12:00,670
my laptop so i will show you that we

00:11:56,949 --> 00:12:04,800
have escaped work bench now in for the

00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:08,259
estar security guard as a dependency so

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:13,240
since I'm using as well i will choose

00:12:08,259 --> 00:12:20,079
the benchmark for Federer and here is

00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:21,939
the profile which means that which means

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,500
the particular security fencing we have

00:12:21,939 --> 00:12:27,010
a map nightmare over

00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:30,700
well and for centos federer Israel here

00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:32,860
are some for business purposes and i

00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:35,830
will choose the standard system security

00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:39,430
of profiles across is the shortest so

00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:43,570
the vendor will not be silent i will

00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:48,090
click on scan it will ask me it will ask

00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:48,090
me for my root password

00:12:53,860 --> 00:13:06,790
and it has started to scan my computer

00:12:58,829 --> 00:13:13,200
here are those rules and it takes a run

00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:19,480
or open esta gross is the system and

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:23,070
tries to verify whether we are my

00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:29,170
systems in line with that fool on the

00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:31,589
fulfills peaceful so the important thing

00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:34,450
to mention is that we are checking the

00:13:31,589 --> 00:13:38,980
configuration for example if we will

00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:43,980
have some rule that at all if we leave

00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:50,800
handsome who that little head or whether

00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:52,630
and we have continued it correctly ok we

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:56,339
haven't talked to you that correctly now

00:13:52,630 --> 00:14:00,160
configuration file it is done all but

00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:03,760
before the differences can be started it

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:10,199
it was still more than we spend approval

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:11,510
because it is trying to send up a system

00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:15,050
configuration

00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:19,670
some temporary settings you know so

00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:26,030
destinies and never shall be the return

00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:30,410
where we can see some details there

00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:35,840
should increase the increase the font

00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:41,090
size but ok so this is the heart and

00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:43,780
open eska and here is some disclaimer at

00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:47,240
the beginning not so much interesting

00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:50,090
here it becomes a little interesting

00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:54,020
there are some metadata and here you can

00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:58,160
see that we have checked online loose

00:14:54,020 --> 00:15:04,190
tiles of them passed hotel so we have

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:08,450
fifty eight percent successful and here

00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:13,880
there is rotator of those shoes with a

00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:18,830
bitter detailed results i will show you

00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:22,190
example hear it man system fell on this

00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:25,820
ruler login to accounts with empty

00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:29,900
password impossible and if i click on it

00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:33,230
it will show me again this dispersed are

00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:37,790
some extra security guard and this

00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:41,390
second part down here comes from my

00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:43,950
system and you can see that the room

00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:51,780
decided we shouldn't have

00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:56,630
this configuration file in the fire on

00:15:51,780 --> 00:16:01,470
life depended on this side and the real

00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:04,640
resnet focus so those details can be

00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:09,120
dispensed also for each other area but I

00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:12,860
will not show you now instead I will

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:17,780
continue with the presentation because

00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:23,850
we have seen that we had a rough couple

00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:28,890
days but the problem is that our yoga it

00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:31,790
only once but there are security SAT

00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:33,840
listening or the configuration can

00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:37,020
individually change the system

00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:40,830
administrator contributor you know every

00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:44,700
day when he girl time to enable

00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:48,840
replication horns of some apparel and

00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:53,130
just changing something so here today

00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:54,680
can possibly look back after a week our

00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:57,710
system

00:16:54,680 --> 00:17:04,640
we considered unsecured so we would like

00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:07,939
to would like to do this can all take on

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:14,829
a daily basis or continuously you would

00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:19,220
like to spit on em and let the door

00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:24,380
let's have some service which the dust

00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:27,709
which will do the job emphatically so we

00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:34,400
don't get to run this top one bench

00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:37,750
every day so from this reason we need a

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:41,059
continuous management we have introduced

00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:43,670
a new before end with an hour because

00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:48,790
this time we use for openness Terdiman

00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:53,590
what is openness Terdiman is if this

00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:58,130
automated continuous security management

00:17:53,590 --> 00:18:03,110
on this project has started also started

00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:05,240
last year and it's a smell basically

00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:08,059
it's a small story written in Python

00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:21,940
which let me choose the openness the

00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:21,940
primary so the openness convenient

00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:30,140
service dancing background and it has

00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:34,640
some even schedule or even Kendra and

00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:39,100
exact exact use canon of our security

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:42,520
policies according to death schedule it

00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:45,770
has great results for each soldier

00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:53,540
results of the scan are accumulated

00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:57,530
within the limit and new camera you can

00:18:53,540 --> 00:19:00,650
read them afterwards when you have time

00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:05,500
so within my sister system service and

00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:09,320
you can do it with it using Twitter

00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:13,860
Oscar this year i insert 11 tool to

00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:20,340
manage the demon or it is also

00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:23,190
so he doesn't depend because we would

00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:26,910
like to connect with other tools for

00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:34,740
example now possible to will be possible

00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:38,610
to the great take on people and it is

00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:41,280
important to mention that the basket

00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:44,730
Iman is not only for staining your older

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:48,000
system on local server it can I first

00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:52,380
mr. Borden it can ask Anna remote

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:56,520
machines over ssh but what is very

00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:59,790
interesting it can do an offline scale

00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:02,760
of virtual machine and religious and

00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:06,510
containers what does a compliance can

00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:09,960
mean a wineskin mean that you don't have

00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:12,540
to install any agent inside the

00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:16,530
container you know politically you not

00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:20,450
touch it on Denari you know the you how

00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:26,570
to contain oh the little making it

00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:41,180
our system and you can use my sister

00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:45,470
brie only from hoopin skoda laura is in

00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:50,030
fedora and you can inside and around

00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:56,960
this area and we also provide container

00:20:50,030 --> 00:21:00,160
right well here it is haha this image

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:03,860
called all the rest of the month and

00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:11,540
this is before darkness and jihad is

00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:15,170
inside the container I'll say if I cuz

00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:18,260
you can make the believer and

00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:22,880
communicate with the devel using

00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:25,480
Oscar is comment my manager if it's

00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:30,140
supposed to be an interactive tool

00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:32,270
because the command line tool was quite

00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:39,050
complicated so we would like to des

00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:45,140
moines by typing long IDs and copy some

00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:51,130
files and incidence among some

00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:56,510
complications particles there so

00:21:51,130 --> 00:22:01,670
escapees it's supposed to take great

00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:14,210
task in a few easy steps I will try to

00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:18,230
show you that on my system there is a

00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:20,270
fella staff demon running and I will

00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:25,100
show you how to create a new task using

00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:31,970
the command line interface Oh s cabin be

00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:41,590
here I create task and I will run it in

00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:46,300
the interactive mode solid task create

00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:56,500
ask create

00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:58,480
I choose some title here now it's asked

00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:00,670
for target if I religious dissenters

00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:04,930
worse than my laptop but that I can

00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:07,830
specify a uni of our container or

00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:12,700
virtual machine or a remote server and

00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:18,310
now it detects that we have a star

00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:21,580
security guard installed and it allows

00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:25,720
you to choose I choose federer content

00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:27,970
federal security policy here it asked

00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:31,140
for layering file which is a very how

00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:37,030
you can customize the security policy

00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:39,100
exception yeah yeah exactly and also i

00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:44,440
will read this empty because i don't

00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:46,690
want to tailor it now and you are again

00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:49,450
profile which we have seen in the

00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:54,490
eschaton been so i will choose again

00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:58,650
bails anarcho I'll and here's a

00:23:54,490 --> 00:24:02,940
remediation which were around the

00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:05,650
remediation scrapes after the scan well

00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:09,970
where the remediation scripts are

00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:15,160
available so i will i will not be but

00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:18,460
now and i will stage a raid let's say I

00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:21,900
can specify the time if I leave it this

00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:26,290
until it was it should start now and

00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:29,350
here I can specify how often i would

00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:34,269
like to repeat the scan for example

00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:37,690
every six hours and you just created

00:24:34,269 --> 00:24:43,049
it is now it is desired but now but I

00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:50,349
can enable it using this comment and now

00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:55,989
it will it is the hinder it is in the

00:24:50,349 --> 00:25:00,779
calendar of events and it will does the

00:24:55,989 --> 00:25:06,129
job without my attendance so I have

00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:11,769
using a stub decr I you can you can

00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:19,029
display which tasks are here on my

00:25:11,769 --> 00:25:21,339
system is like I have created two I just

00:25:19,029 --> 00:25:25,529
ran with that I skate is a lot of tasks

00:25:21,339 --> 00:25:28,529
for example we will try the task number

00:25:25,529 --> 00:25:28,529
see

00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:38,910
and here the results is that it was

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:41,850
around twice in the evaluation at all

00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:43,980
means that my system is not confined

00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:48,690
with the security policy that I choose

00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:52,549
when I was creating the task so I can

00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:58,290
display the report the same report as as

00:25:52,549 --> 00:26:01,950
as well generate by Escobar bench Oscar

00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:05,280
this year I resolved now against the

00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:12,440
idea of the task the idea of the Rana

00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:12,440
and I can save it to some file

00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:20,370
and display it using

00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:31,899
and it will generate the report from the

00:26:29,049 --> 00:26:35,169
storage of results from the integrated

00:26:31,899 --> 00:26:39,190
study of results and now me as a

00:26:35,169 --> 00:26:43,179
sysadmin I can build the report it is

00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:46,470
very like similar as we have seen with

00:26:43,179 --> 00:26:46,470
just a moment

00:26:53,299 --> 00:26:55,929
so

00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:06,840
so it was the usage of this as can be

00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:10,800
more in a short email but another is

00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:15,650
entirely started to develop the openness

00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:20,780
Kadima was that pitcher night about case

00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:29,090
containers and it can scan Bernie keys

00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:32,580
come outside because we wanted to

00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:38,160
integrate our open instructor solution

00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:41,370
with project economic project coming is

00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:44,809
a tool for managing containers and there

00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:49,520
is one by one with containers each

00:27:44,809 --> 00:27:54,980
container has inside the set of binary

00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:54,980
but the batteries can contain

00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:06,120
each different they have a difference

00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:09,840
about the violence and so we would like

00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:15,539
to somehow identified our container with

00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:19,350
water level or our issues mother so we

00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:26,539
could discuss amongst many standard

00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:29,970
metrics can do container and identify

00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:34,320
containers vulnerable hola embarrassed

00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:39,690
of the container updated based on the

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:44,990
results so this wine with atomic falls

00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:51,960
we have developed a tonics can come and

00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:56,250
eat onyx can sting on Dana's accuses

00:28:51,960 --> 00:29:04,549
open stop holding them the nice thing is

00:28:56,250 --> 00:29:04,549
that atomic scale camera automatically

00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:18,390
which operating system is inside the

00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:24,000
container container based on and it is

00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:27,830
the appropriate the lcds means the list

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:34,800
open keys which are vulnerable currently

00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:40,500
provides our cds for dell 607 so it left

00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:44,250
containers or based on l6r l7 you can

00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:48,390
use it on extend enter the Google

00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:52,560
offense can and identify whether you

00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:57,230
yawn whether your container is

00:29:52,560 --> 00:30:05,100
vulnerable oh look yeah I will show you

00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:13,790
they ever tried to run some container I

00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:13,790
have some old image a fellow 66 and

00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:24,840
let's say something simple super sleep

00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:31,130
one hour yeah and now i can use Atomics

00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:36,060
can after mix can and be ID container ID

00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:41,840
and it will start the obelisk abdomen

00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:45,020
and identify better

00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:48,100
antonella is based on the six and it

00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:50,809
should report me whether there are some

00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:53,870
vulnerabilities a lot less likely though

00:30:50,809 --> 00:30:56,590
there will be some because we sell 66

00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:56,590
container

00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:10,269
this uses the offline scanning

00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:14,840
capability so actually it doesn't

00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:18,200
doesn't touch the container as doesn't

00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:28,399
make an it does not make any changes

00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:36,740
inside the container we should get

00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:43,129
results in awhile it can become a

00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:47,240
manager yes the same way as i run the

00:31:43,129 --> 00:31:55,700
atomic scale he can provide an ID or the

00:31:47,240 --> 00:32:01,669
name of the week so yeah company which

00:31:55,700 --> 00:32:07,789
random Boehner stock containers I wonder

00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:12,730
I wonder what's happening now tribal oh

00:32:07,789 --> 00:32:12,730
yeah coo coo coo

00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:25,110
in a range where it should show you

00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:30,690
something the feet up I question the

00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:33,830
feet of the open scar is probably in our

00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:33,830
container song

00:32:40,900 --> 00:33:04,220
it's very interesting I won't work in

00:32:49,220 --> 00:33:08,270
our well anyway how is supposed to how

00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:10,790
is it supposed to read the whole man

00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:17,900
stuff is inside the container this

00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:20,930
container is called something like the

00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:26,150
doctor hot pocket price images of

00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:32,570
containers are officially the entire

00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:34,850
head so it when this this image have an

00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:38,470
alternative rock desert on your system

00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:42,740
it will go down will download it

00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:46,900
automatically if you run atomic scale

00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:46,900
for the first time and

00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:55,460
I'm eight pounds don't they added you

00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:59,389
want to scan and it knocks it the inside

00:33:55,460 --> 00:34:03,759
of a container and open it down the line

00:33:59,389 --> 00:34:09,710
scan and it should produce a result that

00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:15,440
the University which packages are

00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:25,119
vulnerable and what cds are no technique

00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:25,119
and it should display also links to

00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:37,940
decide whether he wants to update data

00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:42,500
on for example manner the vulnerability

00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:48,069
is very serious that he wants to deserve

00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:48,069
to the container and do dumb chronic so

00:34:48,310 --> 00:35:00,230
he has now led scan of the containers

00:34:53,690 --> 00:35:07,900
and images but we would like to also

00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:13,060
give a lady a population of the

00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:13,060
containers for example there also

00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:40,600
patelliday you don't really need so we

00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:40,600
are now working on some things like

00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:54,920
inside container within the facility for

00:35:51,050 --> 00:36:00,100
assistance in I mean psycho penis and is

00:35:54,920 --> 00:36:06,200
we have also started to develop the

00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:11,570
security guy to contain a horse to write

00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:17,620
some configurations happy population

00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:20,620
recommendations for the government and

00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:20,620
also

00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:30,240
this should be also used in a

00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:38,610
particularly in the comics and command

00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:44,730
and actually it Alex can't do this can

00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:47,700
you can tether different scanners open

00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:52,920
stock currently you can provide for

00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:56,780
example an image with a black eye and it

00:36:52,920 --> 00:37:01,980
should stand the container using that

00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:07,400
and you can display the list of the

00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:07,400
available scanners using atomic sting

00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:44,330
it would be nice whatever with which is

00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:48,140
something to do with security combines

00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:52,070
