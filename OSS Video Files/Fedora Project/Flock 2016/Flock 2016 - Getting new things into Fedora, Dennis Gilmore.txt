Title: Flock 2016 - Getting new things into Fedora, Dennis Gilmore
Publication date: 2016-08-21
Playlist: Flock 2016
Description: 
	In this talk we will go over the types of things you will need to do, and the communication you need to have in order to get a new type of deliverable into the distro. The exact specifics will depend on the use cases, however we will give a general framework you can work within.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,100
ok so we're boarding

00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:11,269
first burger I'm Dennis gamma and the

00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:14,199
addy

00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:17,310
and really talking it's going to go over

00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:20,160
what you need to do

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:26,950
something new into

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:34,750
the villa as I was saying wasn't it

00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:38,190
it's not your rpm's is not there is

00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:41,290
something that we don't do today so

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:44,830
if we wanted to do something I say build

00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:49,060
rubygems or and chivalry go over you

00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:50,890
don't feel no daya's or yeah suddenly

00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:53,200
contain a phone that comes along that

00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:56,170
kind of thing something that's

00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,960
completely new modularity is something

00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:00,840
that knew that

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,540
at the moment to talk about that kind of

00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,210
stuff not anyone hit Houston and we had

00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:08,939
a process for that it's pretty well done

00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:12,640
it's going to be anything

00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:13,510
so there could be no way s to be really

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,100
done

00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:17,100
a containers

00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:32,909
we come up with a whole new installation

00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:32,909
wait 19 economy to install something

00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:39,009
possibility that is

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:45,160
so if you have anything what do you do

00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:47,850
you want talk to release internet anyone

00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,850
is not the reason

00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:55,680
why that is but it's probably one of the

00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:58,400
most critical things that you need to do

00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,170
they really early in the process and

00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:05,390
more invasive in the morning you and the

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,390
more definitive the early

00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:11,520
like like a whole bunch employ a whole

00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:14,280
bunch of stuff and say here's my thing

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,390
use it and we have zero a way to

00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:21,120
actually integrate

00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:22,820
we're going to have phones and we're

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,680
going to class and it's going to take

00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:32,670
two or three times longer to get it into

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:35,250
pedorra then engage with this girl he

00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:40,050
also use the earth in tests aren't work

00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:44,480
with everyone not just not just yourself

00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:47,100
yeah people have a tendency to want to

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,720
do a thing and be like hey look that

00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,810
make this thing that's what an ensign

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:55,100
Ian you are wonderful and everyone kinda

00:02:51,810 --> 00:03:00,030
go well it doesn't mean that you cannot

00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:02,700
do alchemy work by yourself or you know

00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:05,340
do it and you can sit in your office

00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:08,370
work three months and then come out go

00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:11,190
here's a thing you can do that but it's

00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:13,090
better you're open one of our findings

00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:16,890
is that we have to have everything

00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:20,920
if you want to build it it has to be

00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:22,959
done using open toe years ago come be

00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,670
offered to do three scans of all the

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,920
current door and we had to say no

00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:30,299
because it's a proprietary solution so

00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:32,830
anything you do is going to be open and

00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:35,200
you need to not rely on others to do you

00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:37,420
work so hysterically when people have

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,930
come up with new things to our recent

00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:43,269
near endemic has happened and release

00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:47,190
engineering has very limited resources

00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:51,240
for doing new things we're really busy

00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:55,440
people and so you can't rely on us to do

00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:58,200
all the work for you so you need to be

00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:01,200
in open need to work in the open the

00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:05,130
tent down everything has to be able to

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:08,070
us ever today it's a little city too

00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:11,960
young you can get a pieces of it other

00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:11,960
than it's a little thing to do always

00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:17,549
we want it to be so it's completely open

00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:19,170
and you want to make it in Slovenia time

00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:21,000
you should ever you want to do a

00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:21,470
composite for North you should be able

00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,920
to

00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:30,080
no reason why the manager of the moment

00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:33,440
the testing is not we don't test totally

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:36,830
lab during the outside of liquid or

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,230
environment and some pieces all relies

00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:43,070
heavily on many things on the specific

00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:45,110
architectures so they we do that by og

00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:46,910
we kind of left out you can get up

00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:51,320
because it has

00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:58,060
access to master gee it's a Mason little

00:04:51,320 --> 00:05:01,400
chicken throws an integrated thing we

00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:04,700
won we know the door we have this

00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:07,640
integrated process p1 and hit outputs

00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:10,430
and massive massive number of things we

00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:16,430
have something like 20 25 TVs their

00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:19,040
forties imperative it is we have 11

00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:22,700
citizen still DVD too late for install

00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:25,270
trees we have like 20 milli 20,000

00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:29,150
clothes off the end and something like

00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:29,889
65 70 thousand binary Alfie atoms that

00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:33,870
make up for the

00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:37,569
it's a massive thing and if we end up

00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:40,330
trying to run a process that is on the

00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:42,789
side and it's not integrated into how

00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:45,400
you make the door that means we then

00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:47,080
have to run things multiple times oh we

00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,370
never have to go we want the door and

00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,750
then we're going to run this other thing

00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:55,530
and then something else can

00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:58,240
it's just doesn't scale very well so out

00:05:55,530 --> 00:06:01,000
the way we scale how you can deliver

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,300
oil is we have a tightly coupled

00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,490
innovative I do it all the time we're

00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:09,069
looking at some automation so that we

00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:11,650
can perhaps decoupling some one piece of

00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:14,289
the fedora and deliver them separately

00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:17,979
we have started up with the two week but

00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:21,400
this a victory Katara compose into its a

00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:27,400
composer floors it's the subset of the

00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:29,560
pizza and side of the door so we need to

00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:33,159
integrate in which to develop processes

00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:35,740
we landed up you a hundred things that

00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:38,650
we need to log it yeah we don't we have

00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:41,370
two people to do that so where's I have

00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:41,370
PDC

00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:46,870
oh and it's supposed to be the source of

00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:49,360
all knowledge with and what is in a

00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:52,180
composed in a release you should be able

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:55,290
to go to it and say hey knows you know

00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,290
what was injured or one

00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:02,069
all the stuff that goes in there

00:06:59,059 --> 00:07:06,619
if we have something not integrated that

00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:06,619
makes it more difficult to integrate and

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:17,909
and what that means is we need to know

00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,439
like inputs at one end we need to know

00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:22,729
the build environment compose

00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:25,830
environment we need to be able to

00:07:22,729 --> 00:07:29,250
reproduce the deliverable at any point

00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:30,169
in time so if we say you know in the

00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:34,009
case

00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:36,770
me we know the environment in Sony was

00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:39,529
mayhem we know the audience that went

00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:43,580
into it we have to look at the logs of

00:07:39,529 --> 00:07:46,460
heavy so please a disability is viral

00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:48,560
for a number of reasons may one being

00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,180
that we have an insurance if we can

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,889
reproduce something you have an

00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:54,800
inference that we actually know what

00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:57,949
went into it we know how it is made and

00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,800
we know all the pieces about it serve it

00:07:57,949 --> 00:08:04,879
you know we we can redo it and that

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:07,849
gives us a level one security point of

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,960
view and if the Flores wasn't born

00:08:07,849 --> 00:08:11,880
the certification

00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,470
I don't know if you just

00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,850
or the different government

00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:19,100
certifications to the other one

00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:21,260
operating system in harmonic defenses

00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,630
different government industry different

00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:25,730
government departments require

00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:28,930
certification Flores it's less important

00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:31,880
well as much

00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:34,970
everything needs to be horrible it

00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:38,300
catalyzes reproducibility we need to

00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:43,039
know what went into it what we got out

00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:44,690
of the process from the back so that if

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:48,650
somebody comes on and says hey I think

00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:51,500
that your fedora installer dvds been

00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:53,780
tainted and it's installing now where we

00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:56,090
can go back and look and go no we put

00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:58,960
this in you went through this we got

00:08:56,090 --> 00:09:01,570
this out and it's not painted

00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:04,030
and you know ideally we can reproduce a

00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:06,340
hundred percent and we can go look we

00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:08,520
made it and this matches that there's no

00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,520
way

00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:19,700
so literally everything enables

00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:23,250
accountability so there comes back to

00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:26,190
you know I've Negroes each other we

00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:28,000
handled 30 or we know where the source

00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:31,270
is wrong

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,499
but this again and it was that the

00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:36,129
package maintained

00:09:32,499 --> 00:09:37,959
accountable for what went into it we're

00:09:36,129 --> 00:09:41,799
not fighting that somebody took part of

00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:45,219
the code or they put in fact software

00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:47,349
the upstream happened that's our whole

00:09:45,219 --> 00:09:49,689
was compromised and maintaining put it

00:09:47,349 --> 00:09:53,109
in we can go okay yeah Joseph this end

00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:56,979
on this day and so with their own

00:09:53,109 --> 00:09:59,979
ability of all of the inputs and all the

00:09:56,979 --> 00:10:01,870
outputs we know who that we can you know

00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:05,470
talk to them

00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:08,260
long rather than trying to step ahead

00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:10,490
and figure out who it is we can very

00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:14,750
easily go and get that

00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:16,550
that you want to do in fedora this we

00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:21,500
need to ensure that we have that forward

00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:27,440
ability yeah lets us know what we shift

00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:30,500
in hell because we it's someone with the

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:33,380
update rtm recode said hey late this

00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:36,170
afternoon come from and we have no idea

00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:41,350
that's great cause for concern that

00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:41,350
somebody's done something that fisherman

00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:53,720
what you should needs to be defining

00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:55,430
what that means is in the epidural the

00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,980
component process we have company

00:10:55,430 --> 00:11:01,310
positive define what we what we ship in

00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:03,740
the fedora in the end page we have steak

00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:06,500
files that define how to spell happen

00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:09,620
and lay images we have the gutter files

00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:12,140
with decline you know what goes into it

00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:15,410
what comes out of it so everything that

00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:18,110
we do we can't rely on some kind of

00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:20,120
magic to you know we do this thing and

00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:23,450
it goes open toe stuff and get this out

00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:25,310
we need to know exactly what we put it

00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:27,710
in exactly what we're getting

00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:31,820
what we expect to have all the expect to

00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:37,130
ship it's pretty critical that we did

00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:39,410
you have that now mr. Qi ando ando need

00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:42,520
to know what's being done and that's

00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:42,520
purely because

00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:57,569
if my test what you happily visually

00:11:55,019 --> 00:12:01,379
benefit if darling what about what I

00:11:57,569 --> 00:12:04,230
need to build and competitors and we

00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:10,080
become too

00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:10,080
first car has the technical alafaya

00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:16,240
because if you want something to be

00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:19,959
powerful or you can't just go off on the

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:23,380
side and say hey your latest thing over

00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:29,110
here and I didn't stop them he only

00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:31,040
magic yeah good thing and expect to how

00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:35,850
to hold

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:41,180
good name we hope there is some level

00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:48,600
our test that it's a known quantity if

00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:51,390
verifiable it yeah you're not gonna like

00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,310
it was a play ball you wouldn't know

00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:55,890
whether you know this ain't good or that

00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:59,100
which is kind of some of the complaints

00:12:55,890 --> 00:13:03,020
of things like the doctor ha oh yeah

00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:07,390
like in the someone

00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:07,390
loving dances with me

00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:16,640
attitude with malicious code got in

00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:16,640
there and we won

00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:23,740
like if it says this is pedorra that

00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:30,340
people

00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:36,280
is Papa sizes and redefine it needs big

00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:40,330
available and by the livable we have

00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:45,340
quite a few things that we need to

00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:49,240
happen and will anything new this really

00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:52,270
knows that there's no set formula it

00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:55,240
says you know what I really want yeah

00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:59,490
you have to meet this exact template

00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:03,130
because you know what what's suitable

00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:06,410
wife CD it just needs me out on a mirror

00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:09,589
somewhere where the deadline

00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:12,990
but with something like say oh x3

00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:18,830
deliver ball is a very different thing

00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:21,050
you need to and today I hope it honestly

00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:25,460
because it is one of the more reason

00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:28,380
thank you allah other than his no

00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:35,040
responsible for many

00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:37,200
unix time Thursday os3 doesn't know how

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,170
to cook meals because neither did not

00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:43,170
email it doesn't go to narrow manga

00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:45,890
award there's a lot of the newer

00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,890
technologies

00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:53,850
images is cowardly redirect users to

00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:57,509
nodes to get the content what's up this

00:14:53,850 --> 00:15:00,509
mirror that was because it is from some

00:14:57,509 --> 00:15:02,879
early years but if the dinero cherlyn

00:15:00,509 --> 00:15:06,779
have got more powerful their bandages on

00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:09,920
Vega they're able to deliver a more

00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:12,389
stuff Morris the story is something

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:15,540
difficult leads to say that we wouldn't

00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:19,199
know about the door it's probably

00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:21,509
the two years since split on the account

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,610
like the popular and that's just with

00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:28,440
like everyone

00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:31,620
2 23 24 and ride on that now we're using

00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:35,760
them in hot oil we're putting some

00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:38,600
something all but we both win on popular

00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,600
with sitting

00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:43,500
lights of death and

00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:48,960
the massive amount of scale the

00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:51,720
multi-talented or if we had served

00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:56,520
everything from one point that pointed

00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:59,610
to sleep bottleneck and so people will

00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:03,030
be asking fedora that in the same effect

00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:06,270
that always pick guys interspire in

00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:09,930
there so every single users that using

00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:14,150
OS the atomic as by flora is

00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:16,670
pointed to a single location to download

00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:17,590
baseball at the moment it's not a big

00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:21,850
deal

00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:25,840
not a massive amount of users on likely

00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:27,730
any largest deployment is you know I'm

00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:33,260
building their own dollars please or

00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:35,089
they're doing them during the ocean

00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:37,030
they're pointing all that

00:16:35,089 --> 00:16:40,500
No

00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:40,500
still having all my

00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:47,730
so nothing

00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:53,600
didn't balances has the ability to be

00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:56,840
alert so if you wanted to do something

00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:59,990
like yes they say we wanted time

00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:03,190
tomorrow and start working on reducing

00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:03,190
our Lord

00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:11,250
packages people do not stop come work in

00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:14,010
is working but they can cool stuff from

00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:17,910
drawer and knowing that it's been rather

00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:18,419
in a controlled audible way the content

00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:21,299
that goes

00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:25,649
never liable and all

00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:27,539
be good as being part of it all if we

00:17:25,649 --> 00:17:31,470
wanted to do that we wouldn't want to

00:17:27,539 --> 00:17:34,830
have a single to have everything one

00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:37,409
just meeting which as a if you have an

00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:39,000
ipv6 but as you have issued that

00:17:37,409 --> 00:17:42,830
everyone's point

00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:51,100
okay so have some kind of meh

00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:54,110
into we can point at our mirror list and

00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:59,340
leader like

00:17:54,110 --> 00:18:01,110
get ugly getting faster delivery call it

00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:06,550
up

00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:09,760
the only thing I might get laid off

00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:09,760
like me

00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:18,269
we'll be done with the club

00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:21,109
make us

00:18:18,269 --> 00:18:21,109
and

00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:26,460
so popular

00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:34,409
so I think that something new we

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:38,669
probably don't have to have the net

00:18:34,409 --> 00:18:40,160
integration on day one of the park

00:18:38,669 --> 00:18:42,800
department is in

00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:47,530
deposit that what we need to do we have

00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:47,530
a quieter this is how it's gone I

00:18:47,929 --> 00:18:53,690
but I mean Hayden

00:18:50,710 --> 00:19:01,200
nothing is selling hungry because

00:18:53,690 --> 00:19:03,980
template lily is specifically depending

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,350
on what it is you want

00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:09,740
what we're doing is coming up within you

00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:13,010
yes a container format that can just be

00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:17,000
point yeah we weekly is contained we put

00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:21,049
it on the mirror and you just like the

00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:24,470
user essentially w gets it then you know

00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:27,140
we could take a day off to an extent we

00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:32,720
can take advantage of this using

00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:34,590
oh yeah in the case of the way images we

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,899
likely need to

00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:42,929
integration so how are you leather stuff

00:19:37,899 --> 00:19:45,789
literally depends on what it is having

00:19:42,929 --> 00:19:49,029
interactions of how music scratch you

00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:51,269
know I indicator like Boise days it

00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:51,269
doesn't

00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:58,899
we don't need metal wait

00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:01,929
things like that because you get it once

00:19:58,899 --> 00:20:03,990
and you'll be using manually getting up

00:20:01,929 --> 00:20:07,140
so

00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:10,630
you know I give the download file these

00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:13,300
you can try again and come

00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:14,130
Meredith I vehicle can redirect to

00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,590
somewhere

00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:18,460
the use of the

00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:21,640
well when you're dealing with joy

00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:25,380
particularly when you want to do

00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:28,920
potentially fell over to ya

00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:32,850
so that request this thing from near a

00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:34,530
and it doesn't matter ordinarily and you

00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:36,450
know see and who I guess

00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:39,840
have you know the content that i want to

00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:47,370
add in the case of Muslims coming out

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:50,010
we're going to have to look at how you

00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:52,650
know how the milling that that's going

00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:53,680
to work and how the narrow Valley to

00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:57,600
integrate

00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:57,600
it's not something

00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:02,280
not looking definitely helping deliver

00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:11,610
no never

00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:14,840
as opposed to how to get let people

00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:14,840
the interface is what

00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:22,780
so it's literally you come alive a CDN

00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:26,710
with a lot of the new technology seems

00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:31,000
to be left out the door open ever seen

00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:35,140
yet and to go to a public person yet we

00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,810
have a CD enmity donated to us but I've

00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:39,470
heard

00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:45,650
some other

00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:48,679
that particular CDN it sent too much

00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:52,640
traffic to learn they will eject and

00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:57,159
kick you off so we can't do it we can

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,159
even for some small things but we come

00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:12,310
different things now manager and how I

00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:15,430
take advantage of that it's a lot of the

00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:17,980
working people that as much as the

00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:21,430
technology side of how you build it a

00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:25,139
leadership is important the political

00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:27,190
side of working with people to ensure

00:22:25,139 --> 00:22:32,529
everyone's on board everyone knows

00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:36,100
what's needed is also a critical step so

00:22:32,529 --> 00:22:38,769
quit summit need to talk you need to

00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:40,450
communicate you need to be open and

00:22:38,769 --> 00:22:41,980
transparent and you need to work with us

00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:44,619
they're all essentially the same thing

00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:47,820
and it's probably the most critical

00:22:44,619 --> 00:22:51,399
thing getting something new in fedora

00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:53,649
nothing always will start a fight on the

00:22:51,399 --> 00:22:59,049
legal list and we'll leave together we

00:22:53,649 --> 00:23:01,149
wanted to have a new trademark to enable

00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:06,789
people to be able to build things and

00:23:01,149 --> 00:23:09,369
ship them themselves and his work is one

00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:12,639
question about that and I'm not opposed

00:23:09,369 --> 00:23:16,899
to that but I want to make sure that if

00:23:12,639 --> 00:23:18,630
we go that way we have ever had a nice

00:23:16,899 --> 00:23:21,330
place where people can buildings

00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:25,710
dora and shipment is not something that

00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:29,520
we do today that we ensure that the way

00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:31,590
that they do it is done with all these

00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:36,160
things in mind so it would become

00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:39,940
successful and people want to you know

00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:43,900
the door we don't get to the case on an

00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:47,920
atomic again where you know collinsworth

00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:50,250
is playing on a PMO's 32 votes with

00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:53,970
dolls

00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:57,270
the pieces and it's a great and

00:23:53,970 --> 00:24:01,310
beautiful but it's not a great tool to

00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:07,549
integrate within the process of how we

00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:10,340
compose the door as a home and so

00:24:07,549 --> 00:24:15,639
very difficult to get atomic individual

00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:20,789
and that was the main thing that got me

00:24:15,639 --> 00:24:24,280
to decide to submit this talk on

00:24:20,789 --> 00:24:26,370
because the only fancy I think we have

00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:29,420
at the moment is

00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:34,640
anything yeah

00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:38,650
coming out is I would like to see is

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:41,960
actually do like no jf ruby gem pipeline

00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:45,920
type Weaver's of wholly different stacks

00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:48,380
every part because while I'm a big fan

00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:51,049
of rpms and

00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:54,169
if you do a new install

00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:58,489
today and you want to sit bunions where

00:24:54,169 --> 00:25:01,610
we go you know pmsing skull I are so

00:24:58,489 --> 00:25:05,029
time the first thing it does is tell us

00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:07,460
42 negative metadata for the object it's

00:25:05,029 --> 00:25:11,440
huge particularly given that you know I

00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:14,450
our society is a 200 offended of K

00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:16,399
application you're downloading a message

00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:20,299
amount of data to hit this small little

00:25:16,399 --> 00:25:24,230
thing the meta dollar for the rebuild

00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:27,470
the photo/aleppo is huge and it's

00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:32,289
getting bigger all the time if you look

00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:32,289
at the stuff of food together

00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:39,500
network if you look at the stats of

00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:42,620
Bavaria

00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:10,930
another stupid

00:26:29,909 --> 00:26:35,730
the conclusion slept with anti HPV

00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:46,840
this is revolution and packages and or

00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:59,340
there are 1 student what up to six does

00:26:53,010 --> 00:27:02,400
just one even like the poem 7 is great

00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:04,520
for next week marks and you can see 10

00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:09,030
nothing to go corridor

00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:13,880
point in time apart we have just under

00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:13,880
five pound packages and yourself

00:27:14,259 --> 00:27:20,749
this is so funny this is just the number

00:27:17,239 --> 00:27:24,229
of those packages the makeup lower and

00:27:20,749 --> 00:27:27,229
you see the aggression and because

00:27:24,229 --> 00:27:29,690
everyone likes putting all the packages

00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:32,179
and only the latest releases of fedora

00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:36,379
there's really not a big difference

00:27:32,179 --> 00:27:40,700
between 23 24 25 and 26 at this point in

00:27:36,379 --> 00:27:44,239
time well it's just under 20,000 source

00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:46,070
packages in fedora at the moment so 22

00:27:44,239 --> 00:27:48,229
is starting to broke down boy laughs

00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:53,299
because it's and the wife but at the end

00:27:48,229 --> 00:27:56,400
of its life it has it's got 18,500 I

00:27:53,299 --> 00:28:01,460
think some type of different

00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:01,460
12 and look at this very large

00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:11,080
seventeen thousand 725

00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:22,370
the Lord the

00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,370
agent

00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:30,049
and frustrated it when we get alcohol

00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:32,860
but the packages little you know open

00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:35,830
for a while another shutdown and

00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:38,950
deciding who's backing up please back up

00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:41,510
partly what I just explained easy I

00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:44,059
think it's only going to get bigger so

00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:47,419
lucky I think will help in making like

00:28:44,059 --> 00:28:51,980
the mega Darla smaller I would really

00:28:47,419 --> 00:28:55,970
love to harvest not the liver so much as

00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:58,429
far as updates go so I'd like to get us

00:28:55,970 --> 00:29:02,960
to a point where more hire some more

00:28:58,429 --> 00:29:06,890
high is where developers use and how

00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:10,190
Jesus with and it's a stable environment

00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:12,409
where people can be pretty solid and

00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:18,549
stuff and employ a lot of the guys need

00:29:12,409 --> 00:29:18,549
you to kind of get by using say 24 today

00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:22,170
the

00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:30,710
there's not a dog around ability so I'd

00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:33,770
like to make it smaller whether the

00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:36,170
country system and they like things

00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:38,990
about the ends so I'd like to you know I

00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:42,200
do things in a way where you know we can

00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:47,420
have an oj s I'll heavily ugh have

00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:49,520
enough days nvm leader in flora and so

00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:52,130
the developer can develop in the way

00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:54,080
they like the krankies discipline in

00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:56,179
deploying the white he light they're

00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:59,320
getting the exact same time we could

00:29:56,179 --> 00:30:04,480
build it build native lands no dance

00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:07,060
go harvin packages we wrap up the end

00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:11,250
result in Philadelphia Miguela into the

00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:11,250
mega coma maybe

00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:21,820
to work while giving them the gaieties

00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:25,550
and assurances of something the floor

00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:29,300
but they don't think people that want to

00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:31,450
do it people I even to do it the time to

00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,450
do it

00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:49,149
listen starting

00:30:36,429 --> 00:30:52,720
we're still having people and and people

00:30:49,149 --> 00:30:54,369
were kissing yeah I'm saying we're gonna

00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,879
talk to you we're gonna work with you

00:30:54,369 --> 00:30:58,250
and I making you to do the thing you

00:30:57,879 --> 00:31:01,370
want

00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:02,870
in a way that when you're done we're

00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:09,550
going to be able to incorporate and

00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:09,550
adding to the door is a bientot

00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:14,650
yo

00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:18,989
is anyone or any questions

00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:23,929
we'll be back

00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:27,860
Oh

00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,400
this is

00:31:47,429 --> 00:31:52,539
final kind of pathogens in the

00:31:49,989 --> 00:31:56,889
modularity there like an instance of say

00:31:52,539 --> 00:32:01,309
i would say without any gems and we make

00:31:56,889 --> 00:32:04,540
a native you know who the damn we both

00:32:01,309 --> 00:32:07,780
install food and it's going to give

00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:10,210
the store we generally go in stolen as a

00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:11,030
developer that makes it easy for you to

00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:16,910
develop you

00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:20,180
and then yeah we assuming that we have

00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:21,810
everything providing the developer can

00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:25,040
do like

00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:25,040
store what happened I

00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:31,860
myself but another

00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:33,420
like to work in the native format but

00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:36,030
yeah there would be some method to

00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:38,460
listen this is what I have my dev

00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:43,590
environment they can give that with to

00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:46,250
the yeah this is our then and then he'll

00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:49,430
be messy not the emily go where

00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:52,520
and then install the matching RPM online

00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:56,060
I kind of imagined good what would

00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:59,510
actually be is we had a you know like

00:32:56,060 --> 00:33:02,990
you have a leader to say 5937 nadie le

00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:09,020
doesn't fight in 26 you know once was

00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:13,310
pikin slee hall maybe 153 and it will be

00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:15,800
a you know a baby brothers just for the

00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:19,400
fighting movies so if we had three

00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:22,280
versions of Heartland three versions of

00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:23,750
the door that I fightin 27 the Jennifer

00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:26,900
got more than that at the moment and

00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:29,930
flora it's a three or four days of flora

00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:32,090
you can then in maple valley / on any of

00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:36,260
those releases a fedora get the center

00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:39,090
it's not necessarily tied to the least

00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:42,900
so much as prior to the

00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:46,070
version of the amazing but like I came

00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:46,070
home early

00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:50,480
sorry but

00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:03,940
so

00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:19,100
this kind of speculation examples is not

00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:21,100
and I just never gonna be kind of neat

00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:23,929
to have where we can divide it up and

00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:27,649
you kind of use that thing you can avail

00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:32,320
that we can then take but the dividing

00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:35,210
stuff our and painfully that

00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:37,060
make device

00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:40,020
if you want it

00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:40,020
I want this floor

00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:44,620
love

00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:47,270
and

00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,660
this is

00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:59,010
Oh

00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,760
Oh

00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:25,210
so the question

00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:28,120
boy was the new trademark is for new

00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:31,660
repository that people can build that

00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:39,040
stuff and sugar or like a competent

00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:42,520
thing ain't it it's metal for having

00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:46,360
away people to build things like so you

00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:51,520
go I guess I thought I was free again

00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:55,270
yeah this build is tree and sugar and

00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:58,000
say it's amazing from its components

00:35:55,270 --> 00:36:00,610
within Fodor himself but it's not

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,530
actually in part of its not like an

00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:05,590
official fedora the voids in our Father

00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:07,480
what we define as this is Fedora is

00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:09,720
suddenly it's Brooklyn for those

00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:12,240
compartments but it's good by somebody

00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:14,420
it's not a visual part of it all that's

00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,420
all

00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,520
Oh

00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:24,359
they

00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:26,930
I think the girl

00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:26,930
you found

00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,260
there is nothing

00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:36,650
comparta is not alone

00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:42,470
the line outside

00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:42,470
I

00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:56,330
that in the great

00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,300
Oh

00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:11,730
you are a factory you

00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:18,420
you know a lot of people

00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:21,980
love

00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,980
right from that too

00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:27,780
you know

00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:37,330
so and provided me to put in reality we

00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:37,330
can have to say

00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:47,740
good ideally anything that all the

00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:49,030
pieces of the compose can be run locally

00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:53,220
on the machine you can do it all

00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:53,220
yourself probably also want to

00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:58,720
hollow-point live

00:37:55,240 --> 00:38:02,680
see what is the latest you know what's

00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:05,070
ways plans for a workstation aiza or the

00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,070
latest

00:38:07,509 --> 00:38:13,740
whatever Dakota you can find we want to

00:38:12,019 --> 00:38:15,869
have that hole

00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:21,320
deliver follows the one might call that

00:38:15,869 --> 00:38:21,320
you at home go off and play

00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:28,390
something custom you want to do

00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:28,390
be able to do

00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:37,700
party
