	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,740
oh hello I'm Mike Wolfe

00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:10,830
I work for IBM I work on the power

00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:13,679
systems primarily and what we've been

00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,389
seeing is people get access to power

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,190
systems and they having some trouble to

00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:18,840
install it so today I'm going to talk to

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,210
you a little bit about what's out there

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,970
that people are interested in and can

00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:33,390
get how do you get access to these how

00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:34,950
do you get them installed so what open

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,930
power that's a new initiative that's

00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,350
been coming out there's open power

00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,570
dot-org

00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,730
go out there become a member you can

00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:45,090
look at their summits either slide see

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:47,520
where they're going its systems and it's

00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,620
i/o it's memory it's a bunch of things

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,750
so you're seeing a bunch more systems

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:57,989
coming out producers like Worcester on

00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:03,329
Super Micro tie-in are starting to make

00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:06,650
power based boxes there's also we're

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:09,420
coming on with capi cards for various

00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:12,020
accelerators and things like this to

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,670
help you get some of these functions

00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:20,040
done better select with the copy there's

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:24,240
some 20 solutions it'll show you an IBM

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:27,990
doc is like power copy there's graphics

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:34,200
analysis some eraser colon accelerators

00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:35,700
for hadoo things like that so you're

00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,680
interested in this how do you want to

00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,500
get it well you can go buy the system's

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,869
they tend to be pricey yet I don't think

00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,759
the open power systems are yet down to

00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:46,950
the price or just the guy buys one they

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,990
have it in this home and stuff we might

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,030
see something cheaper coming down the

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:54,090
road some reference platforms a touch or

00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,680
but right now so it's a bit expensive so

00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,939
if you have a project and you want to

00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,689
run on power there's a couple ways we

00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:02,520
can do this one is is at IBM we're very

00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:03,460
interested in having projects running on

00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:08,259
our

00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:10,239
so there's certain ones that we will

00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:12,550
care enough about that perhaps we'll get

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:16,510
just system so please contact Jeff Sheol

00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:19,360
or myself at IBM explain your project

00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:21,849
explain your needs we can work it that

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,319
way the other way to get it the more

00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:24,780
common way to get it is we've been

00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:28,569
working with the universities to have

00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:32,349
systems set up the one I'm most familiar

00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:34,660
with is Oregon State they have a mix

00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:36,790
ways to get a partition on a machine or

00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:40,330
more often now they're starting to go to

00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:43,120
where you just get an instance another

00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:45,040
one is if you're in south america or

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,920
closer to there you can look at UNICAMP

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,410
and then there's also one at the

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,519
University of where hello Dan knows more

00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:58,840
about that is that just called the

00:02:51,519 --> 00:03:01,540
University of Bernal and then at some

00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:04,900
point I get the sign-in sheets on the

00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:08,440
slide it gave the URL for where you go

00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:10,329
all the other to run the same you

00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,579
basically introduce yourself on there

00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:15,220
and there guess what the project is you

00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:17,709
know it comes back to IBM you get a

00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,720
sponsor you get the okay and they touch

00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:21,280
up so when you're asking for the project

00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,989
get all sauce you know like how much

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,299
processing power how much memory how

00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:28,530
much disk anything like that and they'll

00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:31,840
set up the instance and then it and

00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:34,000
which destroy do you want now for the

00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,040
for these they're going to be running

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,630
the community one so you know that the

00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,850
various Fedora flavors out there

00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:43,090
typically they're configuring the latest

00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:45,760
one not too many people ask for older

00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,840
fedora so that's the easiest way to get

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,480
access and then if you're having

00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:52,209
problems you can talk to University and

00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:55,269
then if they can't get you fixed up we

00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:58,249
typically get you think stuff

00:03:55,269 --> 00:04:01,069
well let's say you get a system you buy

00:03:58,249 --> 00:04:01,999
it on your own or we help supply one for

00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:04,579
your project

00:04:01,999 --> 00:04:05,150
you get all racked up you turn on the

00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:07,489
power

00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:12,889
well now how do I get a council how do I

00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:14,900
start getting this installed so the big

00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:17,120
thing about these are is there isn't

00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:20,599
your typical Ethernet or your serial

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,460
connector on the back well send y'all an

00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:26,449
adapter should be in the box

00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:30,430
so that's one way to do it the other way

00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:34,610
to do it is go through the ops panel and

00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:41,210
on the slides basically and it's it's on

00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:43,699
some IBM fix central sites as well you

00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:46,009
can get instructions for doing this and

00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:49,310
what are the standard paths are the

00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:51,560
standard IP addresses as they they come

00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:56,300
with two of them and one of them is this

00:04:51,560 --> 00:05:04,520
the 169 254 2 dot 140 you set up a

00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:06,289
computer subnet of that and then you can

00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:11,930
talk to it directly once you get into

00:05:06,289 --> 00:05:16,070
there if you're using an IBM pony

00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:19,009
we call our Coletta's etc you have an

00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:20,900
MSP in there that's one way to do it if

00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:22,699
you get the open par once you get the

00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:25,669
open BMC it's a little bit different but

00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:27,710
either way you're in there and then you

00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:29,630
can go in and you can change the IP

00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:31,550
addresses which is what most of you get

00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:33,500
it on your subnet and then while you're

00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:36,169
in there there's going to be an IP mi

00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,159
account and that's one where you're

00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,650
going to want to set the password

00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:43,210
because you're going to use IPMI later

00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:43,210
then to connect to these

00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:52,850
so if you don't want to hook up your

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:56,120
computer directly to it on the IBM

00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:57,470
power8 yeah our traditional low op panel

00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,139
so when you look at the finest server

00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:04,880
they'll be a little green screen has a

00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:07,460
little button by it press the button and

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:10,010
you get this little panel comes off has

00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:12,880
I think two white buttons on either side

00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,880
and in the middle one

00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:41,410
and you can do it there so now there

00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:43,140
it's a lot bigger behind you need a

00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:47,440
couple of chickens you make a sacrifice

00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:49,300
all that stuff but now I'm a spy and I

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,160
have it and it's in small print it goes

00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,690
through steps like mail them to Peter I

00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,820
can get into other people that all have

00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:57,420
an ID on Central but it talks you

00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:59,380
through going through those menus in

00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:01,270
finding the addresses

00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:04,150
so I'm each of these boxes there's

00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:07,030
actually two ports on the back

00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:09,220
they'll be labeled hoc agency one HMC

00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:11,230
two they'll have an address book two and

00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:13,570
these are things you're talking to so

00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:17,230
once you get the address you can take

00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:20,170
and plug in to those now you get this

00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:22,660
weird thing where it'll be HM c1 but got

00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:24,850
it going on oh that's you eat 0h MC 2

00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:32,290
will be eat line and get them configured

00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:34,500
up and then you can get them on the

00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,500
network

00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,070
you're looking for like Sony's for

00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:41,220
display

00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:41,220
[Music]

00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:50,289
and

00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,569
I really shouldn't

00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:09,500
one with Linux

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:08,450
does it just need to be don't know like

00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:08,450
1024x768 can't be

00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:24,700
sites here sorry about this

00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,110
so yeah then he could be IP address oh

00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:31,630
shut up

00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:33,760
you've got your IPMI password set up so

00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:37,000
now you can start getting it to it by

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:42,990
the just the network by doing I TMI

00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:45,250
commands so there's also a page and

00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:47,200
Patrick can probably tell you more about

00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:50,020
this he's just topping us all with one

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:56,140
if you're troubleshooting the serial

00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:58,540
connectors it's basically 115 - for the

00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:00,040
baud rate eight one and nine and then

00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:02,020
when you have the adapter Kayla you're

00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,060
hooked in it's another way to get in

00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:05,740
there again once you're in there you can

00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:09,040
go and find where to set your IP address

00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:16,360
of your ipmi address and this is all on

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:17,590
IBM Vic central so now it's just going

00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,150
to talk to you a little bit about the

00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:22,110
code underneath that that's running it

00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:24,250
because when you fire these things up

00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:26,920
the first thing you're really getting to

00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:31,510
is that Opel firmware level

00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:36,730
so Jeremy Kirk Red Hat or at Red Hat at

00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:38,790
IBM is the main guy on it so I've talked

00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:41,920
to him gotten some of his slides and

00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:43,870
basically what it's going to be is you

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,710
got to understand that what we did was

00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:49,270
we moved to basically using Linux right

00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:51,220
down here so we get all the advantages

00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:53,620
of having all the device drivers

00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:57,190
everything else and it should be easier

00:10:53,620 --> 00:11:00,460
we can keep it going so they said they

00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:02,080
wanted this library concept all these

00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:04,150
involved through and behalf of

00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:08,680
interrupts or Linux and they'll

00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:11,650
interrupts no hidden entry points when

00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:13,450
you look at the opal interactions it's

00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:15,490
much like anything you can really see on

00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:18,100
anything else you've got the very low

00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:20,170
layer opal stuff and you just built up

00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,990
to the Linux kernel in the workload but

00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:28,960
again that that first layer that opal it

00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:32,260
it is just Linux and it's out there I'm

00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:35,210
github it's an open project

00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:38,780
anybody can contribute to it right bugs

00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:40,460
against it you can look at the code to

00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:43,210
figure out why it's doing what it's

00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:46,040
doing this see how you get around it and

00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:48,170
understand more what they're doing so

00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:52,400
when that stuff all comes up what you'll

00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:54,590
see we had this is the pedicle level it

00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,670
so that's the pedicle level that's where

00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,290
it's going to show you the current

00:11:55,670 --> 00:12:02,090
devices you have out there to boot from

00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:03,770
your disk or whatever and the point we

00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:05,720
were making here was you can do an exit

00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:07,760
to the shell and you're just at a linux

00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:15,710
shell and you can start doing your

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:20,420
commands so why were they using Linux

00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:22,640
for it reuse the car code it's just

00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:27,370
easier to get all the devices but the

00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:30,370
network protocols got standard input

00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:30,370
devices

00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:43,370
so there's no real mode code and it's

00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:45,500
just using all the regular libraries and

00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,940
utilities so when you're in there it

00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:50,420
shouldn't be learning a whole new set of

00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:52,190
commands or anything else should be very

00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:54,380
much like anything else you've seen it's

00:12:52,190 --> 00:13:01,700
all done given get help on your open

00:12:54,380 --> 00:13:05,060
power and then Pettit booth and then

00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:08,360
there's also they're out on IRC they

00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:12,649
have mail lists I'm out on IRC when you

00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:14,540
have in trouble so the big thing that

00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:16,880
catches people though is right away it's

00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:21,709
getting that IP address so you can get

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:25,100
in and stuff and the big thing there is

00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:26,930
we don't have that standard serial port

00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:31,089
so you gotta have either have your

00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:35,350
adapter or you hook a computer in and

00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:35,350
get to network change that way

00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:58,810
so there any questions so far because

00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,480
they we just use the standard one of the

00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:04,899
ships in fedora Iraq just works out very

00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:13,510
balls cuz they pipe you - its area like

00:14:04,899 --> 00:14:16,329
the land some extensions I'm strange

00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:19,810
right no but that should be up there now

00:14:16,329 --> 00:14:27,209
what we're seeing is actually we got

00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:30,720
some new hardware coming in and it's at

00:14:27,209 --> 00:14:36,730
be the levels if you will it's it's nine

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:38,670
nine release hard learn at this point

00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:43,300
and they're they're having some problems

00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:45,430
holding the ipmi connection if you have

00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,019
to fast of a network link it's dropping

00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:49,570
it you lose your council

00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:51,130
so the solution there was to put it on a

00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:54,160
slower port and then you had to have a

00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:56,709
very latest greatest IPMI to get through

00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:00,790
but in general it's just the standard

00:14:56,709 --> 00:15:03,339
tool set but the whole focus was was it

00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:04,720
was to just use these tools that are out

00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:07,269
there and a lot of other people are

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,610
going to so with the open power we're

00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:13,420
seeing the whole moves to the open or to

00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:16,000
the BMC and use IPM is make it look like

00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:17,510
other boxes the idea e up in Vegas

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,940
it may him say this kind of

00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:22,850
high school I don't know if it's open I

00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:25,520
misspoke there it is yeah suppose the

00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:26,720
industry-standard be I see my school

00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:30,530
management window

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,360
yeah and just trying to keep it as much

00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:34,760
like the other boxes that you got have

00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:37,360
and then make it so you can administer

00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,360
the same way

00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:52,900
more or less yeah so you don't really

00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:55,810
see the the MSP and the agency type of

00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:58,390
koden going to that way it's just having

00:15:55,810 --> 00:16:02,410
the especially than the only powers the

00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:04,360
BMC and then using the IP line so you

00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:07,000
don't quite see as much but it does have

00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:09,730
a lot of your regular sensors fan

00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,380
control he punch those to you if you

00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:14,680
have one you can go look at what it is

00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:16,810
there's web interfaces too long you know

00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:19,980
you can just plug into them that way the

00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,980
same way that you always did

00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:31,240
but that's before me I started with a

00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:31,240
carthorse

00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:38,220
and they changed slot even there but the

00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:40,950
the idea is to just make it simpler so

00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:42,540
like even with the net pudding it's my

00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:44,550
understanding it's more like the pixie

00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:46,170
goo then you can use a lot of those same

00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:51,510
paths and that to get it all up and

00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:53,820
running still does the poopy you can I

00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:57,920
know systems that have DVDs you can

00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,920
still do the ice so that way

00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:08,510
wonder just fell out let's get this down

00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:08,510
for ya

00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:29,079
[Music]

00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:29,079
so are there any other questions

00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:34,800
so Patrick have you run into anything

00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:36,960
else with the weirdness that I missed

00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:44,540
for these guys any kind of warnings what

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:47,540
you wanna watch for well one thing

00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:47,540
wasn't

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:56,990
quite not turn on automatically and you

00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:58,760
need to navigate the menus or navigate

00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:00,950
really charming

00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,840
oh you mean the system doesn't power on

00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:04,520
itself we gotta push like the little

00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:08,260
white button on the front even know

00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:13,280
about someone data center white stays

00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:14,350
it's not actually pong I had a couple of

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:20,130
time

00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:20,130
that's off and then you said it's not

00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:25,149
yeah there's a lot of these boxes I have

00:18:22,779 --> 00:18:27,190
dual power so parts you'll have a lot of

00:18:25,149 --> 00:18:28,899
little blinky lights on the beam and all

00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:31,330
such things like white on black supports

00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:32,980
a whole bunch of things if the system

00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:34,509
has power you get a whole bunch of

00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:36,429
lights on but it doesn't mean it's

00:18:34,509 --> 00:18:38,230
working but I mean they should be able

00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:43,779
to tell because it sounds like a wedding

00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:45,549
planning study so I know Maurice will be

00:18:43,779 --> 00:18:47,409
that way I'm hoping that the open call

00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:51,009
boxes don't quite throne the fans for

00:18:47,409 --> 00:18:53,049
lunch what I'm trying to do is get an

00:18:51,009 --> 00:18:55,029
FAQ kind of going on what people are

00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:57,149
hitting because it has been a couple of

00:18:55,029 --> 00:18:59,289
the same things and I have seen people

00:18:57,149 --> 00:19:00,909
but once they get through it the first

00:18:59,289 --> 00:19:02,649
time it's like oh yeah no problem

00:19:00,909 --> 00:19:09,879
getting them through it the first time

00:19:02,649 --> 00:19:14,019
and has been difficult at times and one

00:19:09,879 --> 00:19:16,059
well and that's something that I'm sure

00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:18,549
Jeremy and those guys will be looking at

00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:21,850
too is the whole point of this is to cut

00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:24,279
that down right I mean it's we we felt

00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:26,019
we had to hire one before and it's

00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:27,669
supposed to make it all easier yet we

00:19:26,019 --> 00:19:31,480
still have it sorted all back and going

00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:33,159
to continue I know from when I first set

00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:38,200
out the power acts even though they were

00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:41,139
partially set up when I saw what we had

00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:45,220
there's issues where the DC would be

00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:46,809
patching in like Ken you got passes

00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:48,940
networking to posting them and we gotta

00:19:46,809 --> 00:19:49,659
catch them and you know you passed him

00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:52,779
the wrong one

00:19:49,659 --> 00:19:56,139
okay they would try and patch but you'd

00:19:52,779 --> 00:19:58,090
want a standard like or running on the

00:19:56,139 --> 00:19:59,470
server network interface and they would

00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:02,320
be patching into one of the two

00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:06,129
management interfaces or vice versa

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:09,340
okay and so even I think to some degree

00:20:06,129 --> 00:20:11,169
just like then having to Google through

00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:12,909
the IBM central to try and find a

00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:14,379
picture of the back of the box so that

00:20:12,909 --> 00:20:17,080
you can actually work it out for

00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:20,470
yourself and send so many explicit

00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:23,080
instructions that you know plug it into

00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:25,359
this one it is in this location and you

00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:28,929
basically attach an image with a red

00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:30,519
circle around where you want it yep and

00:20:28,929 --> 00:20:33,429
that subtle word is getting to a

00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:35,830
confusion about the agency 1 & 2 versus

00:20:33,429 --> 00:20:37,509
what the eSports is the other thing I've

00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:39,549
seen is that people get in the first

00:20:37,509 --> 00:20:41,139
time when you get in the first time it's

00:20:39,549 --> 00:20:44,169
going to ask you to change the admin

00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:45,759
password and people change it and then

00:20:44,169 --> 00:20:49,090
they don't report it up so when you're

00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:50,320
working with your lab folks right make

00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:51,700
sure that they're writing that all down

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,279
they're gonna have that they're going to

00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:56,289
hit that they're gonna sign it and so

00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:58,119
now we gotta get back in if they don't

00:20:56,289 --> 00:21:00,909
there are ways to get you back in but

00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:04,980
you got to get a hold IBM and they'll

00:21:00,909 --> 00:21:04,980
get you in that that's

00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:11,620
you have an older version that is good

00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:19,370
it's looking pretty images in there very

00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:23,080
strict idea that so the version of Penny

00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:24,850
booth of Patrick is referring to was the

00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:27,560
test

00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:30,710
non-supported one that they had on the

00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:33,770
power 7 plus machine oh it gave us a

00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:37,220
little endian KVM support so that we

00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:38,840
could do a platform bringing really that

00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:40,520
is not something that anyone in the real

00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,230
world will actually run into because

00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:44,270
there was only a handful of those boxes

00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:46,190
that actually existed great and we are

00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:49,550
working hard to pull the load of the

00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:51,290
while it's in to announce that the

00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:53,210
fedora infrastructure now that I think

00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:58,280
has a single passive and a little power

00:21:53,210 --> 00:22:00,590
right and again one of the points are if

00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,880
you have something you want running and

00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:05,090
you don't see on power

00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:07,160
you know IBM is motivated to see if I'm

00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:09,380
in power you know contact us let us know

00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:11,060
we'll get you access the holidays we

00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:13,670
show the Centauri infrastructure also

00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:17,390
needing the fedora public cloud instance

00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:18,980
now has two types the rather have the

00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:20,240
ability to run by the beginning of

00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:24,280
melendez Am's

00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,280
and is a request for resources

00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:34,110
yes oh sorry that's actual they Amber's

00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:37,500
running you know for 24 presumably 23 as

00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:42,920
well as necessary that is running the

00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:47,180
publicly accessible infrastructure yeah

00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:50,730
sorry that's where they call the stuff

00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:54,060
hidden in it OSU there's three instances

00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:55,590
to Fedor one openSUSE so if somebody

00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,760
just has some short term they want to

00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:58,830
run or something like that they can get

00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,900
ahold of us and we just give them a

00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:02,310
login or one of those right we make sure

00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:05,280
we got the right release or whatever

00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:07,710
tools and we'll get stuff running there

00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:12,720
as well so there's a number of ways we

00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:15,930
do this and we were mostly concerned

00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:18,300
with the Le versions of stuff so

00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:21,620
typically you'll see the machines had it

00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:21,620
that way and configured that way

00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:44,880
yeah and if it's not answered there that

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:47,460
there are ski boot Penta boot channels

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,010
like that too that are maintained by

00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:51,690
guys in US Australia so we might tell

00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:53,910
you well you got a weight of it right

00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:56,270
and find them but there are as chancel

00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:59,040
point chat those are mail lists and

00:23:56,270 --> 00:24:03,510
they're real good about responding about

00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:06,150
it in places they're they're very active

00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:07,800
about having this all open source and

00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:11,180
out there that people can see it and

00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,180
contribute to it and such

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,020
so any other questions

00:24:17,879 --> 00:24:21,749
I think I got you through everything

00:24:19,409 --> 00:24:25,679
again you can contact me I can get you

00:24:21,749 --> 00:24:27,749
more information we are trying to be

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:30,029
very active on social media

00:24:27,749 --> 00:24:32,369
there's person from the LTC that's on

00:24:30,029 --> 00:24:34,229
blogging on Twitter so you can follow

00:24:32,369 --> 00:24:39,509
updates that way

00:24:34,229 --> 00:24:45,570
pardon what is it LCC FDC it's from IBM

00:24:39,509 --> 00:24:48,539
that loves acronyms so the LTC is the

00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:51,929
Linux Technology Center which I'm a part

00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:54,749
of a couple of my teammates are here

00:24:51,929 --> 00:24:57,119
they're part of that so yeah we handle

00:24:54,749 --> 00:25:02,759
the Linux stuff and we'll get you

00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:04,739
answers that's really all I I had to be

00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:06,539
my promise is like talk too fast through

00:25:04,739 --> 00:25:08,070
this stuff and then I didn't have the

00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:11,039
slides for more questions they're gonna

00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:13,289
make small print for you so if there's

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:15,119
nothing else I can let you go or you can

00:25:13,289 --> 00:25:18,779
just informally out stuff all this day's

00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:26,690
a stupid question okay where do we go

00:25:18,779 --> 00:25:26,690
see which you can make there was a plan

00:25:27,139 --> 00:25:34,889
company right right now if you look at

00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:39,659
the press releases you'll see that IBM

00:25:34,889 --> 00:25:43,249
is partnering with nvidia gpus okay for

00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:47,489
the moment the GPUs are being used as as

00:25:43,249 --> 00:25:50,399
easy as just a graphical processing unit

00:25:47,489 --> 00:25:53,580
just to do vector complications yeah the

00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:56,430
CUDA snap basically when they see Nvidia

00:25:53,580 --> 00:26:00,430
and he's like yeah

00:25:56,430 --> 00:26:07,600
during their pinky yeah goes just puts

00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:09,670
CPUs so wait there's a bit of a split

00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,980
I'm seeing it and I got to go back and

00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:14,500
look at this more when I'm seeing boxes

00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:16,690
actually produced by IBM they're staying

00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:18,790
with the FSB there's no graphics

00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:21,910
anything like that so you go through the

00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:24,880
harder steps the open power stuff there

00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:27,730
they're using the B or C and some of

00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,110
them do have graphics in them because

00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:32,500
the instructions will have that for

00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:34,240
setting that IP address initially is

00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:39,190
will tell you to go get a USB keyboard

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:42,070
mouse okay a monitor up to it and then

00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:44,800
moving it up and get into so if you're

00:26:42,070 --> 00:27:01,590
looking for workstation capabilities I

00:26:44,800 --> 00:27:08,110
would look at the open boxes because

00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:10,050
again not too completely but if you're

00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:12,880
wondering about in an official Fedora

00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:14,050
workstation fully tested everything like

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,440
that right now

00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:20,290
iBM has not been pushing for that from

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,940
water in the secondary team so we've

00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:26,020
been interested in the cloud we've been

00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:27,520
interested in and I'm very server but I

00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:29,710
think you can get it running because

00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:32,550
I've got the old yellow dog system yet

00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:35,580
and every no I mean all the packages do

00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:37,290
they say you would have to honor

00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:39,080
everything network install or the server

00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:42,090
network and store and amidst all the

00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:45,480
workstation components because we don't

00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:49,200
ship either a live image or a web

00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:58,440
station in store but there's no reason

00:27:49,200 --> 00:28:03,720
why if you do like what you like I weave

00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:05,520
graphics card in a desktop machine yes

00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,440
because I know in the past we had the

00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,390
may trucks cars we had drivers for that

00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,130
you could load those in boxes and hook

00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:16,440
up monitors and that but it's never been

00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:22,050
a focus so yeah you think I still hope

00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:24,000
for Florence yeah I keep bugging people

00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:26,520
cuz I want the laptop I don't want just

00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,030
a workstation I want the actual laptop

00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,030
man

00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:39,380
is not dead yet of his lyrical state by

00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:44,630
the please profit I know from the past

00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:47,750
Joe why did you continue to get any

00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:50,900
additional demand interval to be we will

00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:52,760
produce a recording they are still open

00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:56,320
humans of all night version when it's

00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:58,420
out but

00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:02,160
he says ooh the power names of the

00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:02,160
palace yeah

00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:20,090
but the interesting thing all the boats

00:29:14,299 --> 00:29:22,460
always they say he was so mostly what we

00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:26,389
imagined that couple years ago that you

00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:29,750
would choose IBM platform for power

00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:33,100
compartment or private and secure or

00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:33,100
station where everything is

00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:45,090
you see I'd like to see it get there I

00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:46,740
think some people could be really happy

00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:50,070
with it because like they say I work

00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:52,980
with the fedora secondary team and aware

00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:55,530
of what open sis is doing and and their

00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:58,290
build infrastructures are really nice on

00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:59,970
power that the speed they get from that

00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:03,570
and stuff but I think that people could

00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:05,880
be happy with that I mean I think that I

00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:08,520
want like about is everything to the

00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:10,230
right utilities like very much anything

00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:12,810
you need to configure anything all the

00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:16,470
system is completely open-source and I

00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:19,940
shoot out of the box in fedora which

00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:23,010
means we're not screwing around with

00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:25,310
terribly updated proprietary finally

00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:28,310
want things to configure right concurs

00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:28,310
No

00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:52,870
but the yeah I'll have to try and know

00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:53,480
what computer or doesn't have another

00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:58,850
computer

00:30:53,480 --> 00:31:05,270
we change everything yep well thank you

00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:08,470
for your effort you can tell how much I

00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:08,470
give presentations

00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:13,830
what you do this one I'll have to get a

00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:16,429
different laptop you learn to run it

00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:18,990
maybe I give you

00:31:16,429 --> 00:31:23,210
it's all over they don't need to see the

00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:23,210
slides they weren't pretty anyways oh

00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:29,540
yeah they just got all blue penguins all

00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,540
over the place

00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:42,380
yeah sorry about the lack of light and

00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:44,650
such I hope you did get something out of

00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,650
this

00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,460
like I said if anybody was in a server

00:31:52,809 --> 00:31:56,049
meeting one of the big things I want to

00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:59,999
get running on power right now is open

00:31:56,049 --> 00:32:07,320
QA or if I go around I think that

00:31:59,999 --> 00:32:11,049
additional testing would be awesome well

00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:13,570
well just deficit claim no they do I

00:32:11,049 --> 00:32:16,210
know for a fact that they run it on on

00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:17,200
power because I work with dinar but Adam

00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:19,539
was telling me some of what the

00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,940
scheduler in engine and my comment was

00:32:19,539 --> 00:32:24,369
basically yours

00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:32,159
it runs on openness is so so what's the

00:32:24,369 --> 00:32:41,649
problem here so I mean it's triggered on

00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:43,359
primary and it's available problems to

00:32:41,649 --> 00:32:46,570
do well I mean that problem will go away

00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:52,739
in the in some same case with probably

00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:56,049
fedora 47 or wafer dark 27 because we're

00:32:52,739 --> 00:32:57,679
putting our proposal which will be going

00:32:56,049 --> 00:33:00,330
out to the most

00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:04,259
of Reba hiding the secondary

00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:05,580
architecture we're basically doing a lot

00:33:04,259 --> 00:33:08,369
of things with a reddish tint to a

00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:11,609
single instance of ecology at which

00:33:08,369 --> 00:33:13,889
point basically the night they compose

00:33:11,609 --> 00:33:17,249
will run for all the architectures and

00:33:13,889 --> 00:33:20,279
we put out the primary deliverables into

00:33:17,249 --> 00:33:24,349
one directory and the secondary ones or

00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:24,349
the different architectures into a

00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:41,839
directively the moment I 686 a secondary

00:33:44,479 --> 00:33:53,759
Oliver culminated for multiplayer for

00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:56,339
certain cases and then like this deep

00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:58,889
they freeze up like the whole concept of

00:33:56,339 --> 00:34:03,509
in kochi shadow and that sort of stuff

00:33:58,889 --> 00:34:05,639
goes away which means the vast amounts

00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:08,149
of time that people like down myself and

00:34:05,639 --> 00:34:11,909
various others spend on that can then be

00:34:08,149 --> 00:34:14,720
put into dealing with architecture

00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:16,799
breakages

00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,299
yeah i was just wondering if it was

00:34:16,799 --> 00:34:19,950
something like that or if it was that

00:34:18,299 --> 00:34:22,169
you're gonna need more hardware to do it

00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:26,480
or something else tying into being a

00:34:22,169 --> 00:34:26,480
year old Patrick always needs new power

00:34:27,619 --> 00:34:35,010
yes I I mean one of the interesting

00:34:32,129 --> 00:34:36,280
things with the wide-open Qi works is

00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:38,080
that you basically

00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:41,440
dedicated hardware currently for

00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:44,500
tomorrow yep it would be nice if there

00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,940
was some announcements to open QA that

00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:48,580
we're done where I could just one that

00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:50,700
same from local second students because

00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:54,190
I mean it is just spinning up the MS and

00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:56,409
that way we could get away from having

00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:59,550
the dedicated sets apart live just like

00:34:56,409 --> 00:35:01,990
to look away and move to eat just

00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:03,640
consuming all various different

00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:06,460
architectures which we would then put

00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:08,260
into the fedora or the stack instance

00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:11,800
like the power boxes that we have there

00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:15,070
and you can just use your own stack API

00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:18,820
to spit up deployed tests and teardown

00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:21,970
very little stuff but yeah openSUSE has

00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:24,400
a dedicated machine for theirs so when

00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:26,050
that's Christ yes I at the moment it

00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,460
doesn't support that but I think that

00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:29,460
would be I think you I

00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:38,410
and then you're sending the copper so

00:35:36,099 --> 00:35:40,230
put the word out for that stuff you know

00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:43,349
and if you know people that are

00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:45,730
interested in power and looking for it

00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:47,200
you know let me know that we can find a

00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:50,380
way whether it's copper whether it's

00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:52,680
university system whatever we can get

00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,680
them on it

00:35:55,460 --> 00:36:01,060
alright I'll turn off the recording and

00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,060
