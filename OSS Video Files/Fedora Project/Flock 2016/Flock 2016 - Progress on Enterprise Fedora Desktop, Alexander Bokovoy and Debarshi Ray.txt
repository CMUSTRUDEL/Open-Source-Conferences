Description: 
	This is a joint talk by FreeIPA and GNOME developers. Fedora has been shipping FreeIPA integrated security environment for years. As remote work spreads wider, 'an enterprise' becomes a home environment as well: more applications are moved to cloud hosting, both on premises and at third parties' clouds, and more people have to balance their home and work identities and data at the same time. This talk will go in detail and demos on our progress together with GNOME community to produce a desktop environment friendly to enterprise and how it makes our home environments more secure without compromising on usability.
