Title: Using Research and Technology to Tackle Gender Bias - Mollie Marr
Publication date: 2019-05-19
Playlist: CSVConf 2019
Description: 
	Qualitative and mixed methods research studies have provided insight into the language and patterns associated with unconscious bias across multiple fields. These patterns can be converted to rules for NLP and other text analysis programs making it possible to identify bias within a written document. This talk will explore one approach using qualitative research in gender bias and letters of recommendation and evaluation to define rules for a web-based automated text analysis program using NLP. The role of research and technology in addressing structural issues such as bias will be discussed and participants will be encouraged to think about ways in which existing research might be used to inspire new solutions to social problems.
