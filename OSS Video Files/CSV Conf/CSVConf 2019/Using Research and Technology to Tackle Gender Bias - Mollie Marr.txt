Title: Using Research and Technology to Tackle Gender Bias - Mollie Marr
Publication date: 2019-05-19
Playlist: CSVConf 2019
Description: 
	Qualitative and mixed methods research studies have provided insight into the language and patterns associated with unconscious bias across multiple fields. These patterns can be converted to rules for NLP and other text analysis programs making it possible to identify bias within a written document. This talk will explore one approach using qualitative research in gender bias and letters of recommendation and evaluation to define rules for a web-based automated text analysis program using NLP. The role of research and technology in addressing structural issues such as bias will be discussed and participants will be encouraged to think about ways in which existing research might be used to inspire new solutions to social problems.

	00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:04,740
so my name is Molly I'm an MD PhD

00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,090
student at Oregon Health and Science

00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,979
University and I'm gonna be talking

00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:10,560
about using research and technology to

00:00:07,979 --> 00:00:12,780
tackle gender bias so I actually want to

00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,760
start with disclosures because I'm a

00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,680
really early learner when it comes to

00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,450
programming so there was a certain level

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,520
of intimidation about coming here today

00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:22,380
and talking to everyone but I'm happy to

00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,390
if you have questions about some of the

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,510
stuff that we're doing plug you in with

00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,400
people who are way above my level of

00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,830
learning and I'm drying I'm trying to

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,079
keep up and learn all the things so I

00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,359
wanted to start with the way I think all

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,979
of us enter school for me it was medical

00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:40,649
school my first you know first couple of

00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:43,800
weeks and you enter excited you enter

00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:45,719
like ready and jazzed you're you're

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,389
entering academic medicine it's gonna be

00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,889
great and then you go to a lecture by

00:00:48,389 --> 00:00:51,899
one of the professors that you most

00:00:49,889 --> 00:00:53,909
admire and she talks about salary gaps

00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,299
in gender and how you're gonna get a

00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:59,190
degree but not make as much money and

00:00:56,299 --> 00:01:01,170
then she talks about you're also not

00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,780
gonna become a professor because the

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,030
whole leaky pipeline is a thing so it's

00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,830
gonna be harder and longer for you and

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,020
then she shows the leaky pipeline so you

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:12,720
might also not even stay in medicine you

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,480
may end up you may never become a dean

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,150
women are less likely to sort of make it

00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:21,450
all the way to the top and then she does

00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:23,880
my favorite study of all time which is

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,190
where someone looked and said are there

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,590
more women in leadership positions in

00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:31,950
medical schools or are there more men

00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:35,160
with mustaches it's called the mustache

00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,720
index and unfortunately as you might

00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,790
surmise by the fact that this got

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,390
published there are frequently more men

00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:45,450
in leadership with mustaches than women

00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:48,210
a similar study was done in business and

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,940
they looked at men named John versus

00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:52,830
women you might again similar outcome if

00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:56,790
your name is John you're more likely to

00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:58,380
be in power than if you're a woman so as

00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:59,909
part of this talk she talked about

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,680
letters of recommendation and how

00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:03,720
letters of recommendation and

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,520
evaluations influenced all sorts of

00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:08,490
different aspects of a woman's career

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,460
trajectory grading promotion higher

00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:13,650
tenure-tract discussions and how that

00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,850
could potentially influence part of the

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,120
issue that we see with the leaky

00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:19,800
pipeline yeah I was less excited about

00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,390
academic medicine at this point you know

00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,300
like suddenly I'm like what have I

00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:27,600
gotten into and so I started thinking

00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,070
what do we do ah and so I was thinking

00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,960
about this letters of recommendation

00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:33,540
saying and then I was thinking about

00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:36,120
like well I know Excel and one of the

00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,640
things I know about Excel is you can use

00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,590
if-then statements and I know people

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,320
have looked into this because she was

00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:46,590
quoting literature in her talk so I'm

00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:48,960
gonna look into the literature so what

00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:52,170
does the literature say and what's been

00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,760
done so I decided to think about it in

00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:55,620
terms of rules and that's one of the

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,510
great things about qualitative research

00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,340
is they kind of go through they look at

00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,810
themes they look at what comes out of

00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,930
the data so I thought about it in terms

00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:05,460
what are the rules what are the if-then

00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:07,260
statements that we can make about gender

00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:09,270
bias as it relates to letters of

00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,040
recommendation and evaluation and I

00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:12,900
looked at as much of the literature I

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,080
could medicine science there was a great

00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:18,270
paper in geology business computing as

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,470
you might imagine this is not an issue

00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:23,700
unique to the world of medicine so I

00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:26,340
found that letters recommendation for

00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:29,390
these rules are more likely to include

00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:33,090
minimal and assurance she's competent

00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:35,730
she can do the job versus she's

00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:37,110
excellent she excels in this area she's

00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:39,420
one of the best people I've ever worked

00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:42,770
with they're more likely to highlight

00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:44,790
effort she's hard-working rather than

00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:46,380
accomplishment so they're not talking

00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:47,670
about what you've accomplished with your

00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:50,100
work they're talking about the fact that

00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:51,810
you work really hard well you couldn't

00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,700
read that as this person's hard working

00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:56,700
and potentially not getting anything

00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:59,670
done and then they they discuss personal

00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:01,560
life so family children things that you

00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:03,330
normally wouldn't think to include in

00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,560
letters of recommendation or evaluations

00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:09,720
per se they'll often lack formal titles

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,520
and they'll include gender stereotypes

00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,810
or emotion focused words so some of the

00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:16,500
literature talks about this idea about

00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:18,630
communal versus agenting language so for

00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,850
gentlemen usually will be they're

00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,890
independent they're so

00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:23,810
motivated they're driven and for women

00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:25,340
they're compassionate they have empathy

00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:27,470
they're a great team player they're

00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,700
interpersonal and this really has an

00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:30,380
impact when you're thinking about hiring

00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,520
because a lot of times when you're

00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,800
thinking about who you're promoting

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,240
you're looking for self-directed

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,830
independent and team player might be

00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,320
great but not necessarily if you're

00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:40,820
hiring for leadership and then finally

00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,080
they raise doubt and this is sort of

00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,410
that you know they're they're competent

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:48,050
well why are you only saying that and

00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:49,100
they're often shorter so I'd love to

00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:52,100
know what's out there and there are some

00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:54,260
gender bias calculators I reached out to

00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:56,180
textio because I was like they're doing

00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:58,370
this for hiring they're doing this for

00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:01,910
job searches they would be really super

00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:03,920
willing to help they weren't and the

00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:05,300
Hemingway app sort of does looks at

00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,980
complex sentences so it was like there

00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:11,000
is a way that we can do this with text

00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:12,890
analysis this is feasible and then I was

00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,780
like well there are other rules too that

00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:15,860
these text analysis programs aren't

00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,750
going to capture because they're

00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,490
highlighting what's there they're

00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,140
highlighting the presence of female

00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:23,240
associated words or motion associated

00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:25,340
words and they're not highlighting

00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,320
things that are missing and the rule the

00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,940
the letters for written for women and

00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,470
evaluations they're less likely to

00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:32,270
mention publications they're less likely

00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:34,010
to talk about projects and research

00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:38,060
they're less likely to include

00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:41,960
superlatives and use nouns so you know

00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:44,030
she you know she was she taught and he

00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,880
was a he was an excellent teacher so

00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:48,560
this idea of analysis of a verb and then

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,150
finally they they're less likely to

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,000
include this repetition throughout the

00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:55,130
letter of positive qualities so my

00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,260
background I was a theater major and one

00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:59,090
of the things I loved about theater is

00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:01,040
this concept of a Pinter pause because

00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:03,410
emotion takes place in the middle of

00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:06,170
things emotion often doesn't take place

00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:08,360
only on our words so he puts in pauses

00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:10,910
so that we can have space for what needs

00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,650
to be felt and I also did work briefly

00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:14,060
in social justice when I was in New York

00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:16,520
and so one of the things we talked about

00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:18,860
there is who's voice is heard and who

00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:21,740
are we not hearing from and how do we

00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:24,800
represent and bring those voices in and

00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:26,930
then finally I have dyslexia so when I

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,910
look at a page of text I see the white

00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:32,540
space instead of the black space makes

00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:34,430
coding super interesting let me tell you

00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:37,580
and so I'm really fascinated by this

00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:39,050
idea of space and silence and what that

00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,490
means for what's missing from the

00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:42,800
letters which really gets at the heart

00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:46,640
of implicit bias and how that impacts

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,650
everybody so how do we make this happen

00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:51,050
how do you take all these ideas to and

00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:55,430
put them together and what ultimately do

00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:58,160
we want to create so I dove in

00:06:55,430 --> 00:07:00,260
I learned Python I took a quote like an

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,750
intro class to Python and started

00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:05,330
learning HTML and did a crash course on

00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:06,860
github and got involved with Mozilla

00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:09,260
open leaders which was incredible I got

00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:11,810
a mentor and then I ended up on the pool

00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:13,490
side because very quickly to do what I

00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:15,470
wanted to accomplish we needed natural

00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:18,290
language processing and lint and api's

00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:20,600
and view and this the work that goes

00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:22,310
into developing a plugin and it got to

00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,140
the point that I could read the code but

00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:27,680
probably but couldn't totally understand

00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:29,750
what was happening and that's where the

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,180
value of a team really really comes in

00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:34,400
because a lot of people in the

00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:36,230
open-source community came in and are

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,730
helping me make this happen and I wanted

00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:40,940
to highlight them here because otherwise

00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:42,490
this never would have happened and I

00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:46,160
want to show you where we are right now

00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:47,410
so I'm gonna have to pop out of this for

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:55,450
a second

00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:55,450
who exactly let me sorry did not expect

00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:03,120
great everything just went black so all

00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:06,510
right I'm gonna keep talking and see if

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:09,060
it stops being black so one of the

00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:11,550
things okay it's thinking great

00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:13,680
see if I can show you so here's all we

00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:15,660
have so far you paste in your letter of

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,850
recommendation so example of a letter of

00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:21,140
recommendation you're gonna press submit

00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:23,250
and right now it's gonna underline

00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:26,040
violations of the rules that I went over

00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:28,740
before so what and then it's gonna tell

00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,690
you how you violated that rule so for

00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:36,450
example willingness was violated so it

00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:38,160
gives you feedback on that so what's

00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,450
interesting to me and is what we're

00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,890
working I know it's low I can talk

00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:46,440
through it and then it'll come back on

00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:47,970
hopefully check is what the summary

00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,530
statement right so we're gonna we're

00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:51,210
also looking for things that are missing

00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,920
so how do we get that information to

00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:54,990
people so right now what we're working

00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,940
on is creating a summary statement so it

00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:59,970
can talk about missing superlatives

00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:01,920
missing publications missing projects

00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,970
and address that part of it and one of

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,230
the things that was interesting is I've

00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,790
done some beta that we've started some

00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,590
beta testing with it and they're these

00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:09,420
great blended rolls where it's like yes

00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:11,730
they have superlatives but it's the best

00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:13,830
woman as opposed to being you know the

00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:15,240
best person I've worked with so we've

00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:17,280
been finessing it the other one that

00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,260
came out is the issue with sort of nouns

00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:22,260
versus adjectives I did evaluations for

00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:24,960
med students you can be patient or you

00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:26,760
can write a patient history and so we're

00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:29,160
trying to tease apart and add that

00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:31,830
context into the tool as well so it'll

00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,600
be more useful for people and digging

00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:34,530
into the summary statement I put a lot

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,960
of thought into that

00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:38,940
what does feedback look like how should

00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,830
feedback work we know that if you want

00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:43,620
behavior change it's got to be positive

00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:45,120
reinforcement so we need to say hey you

00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:47,550
did this stuff great you included

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,140
superlatives you had this you included a

00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:51,390
lot of statements about research and

00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:53,790
publications great work here are things

00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:56,730
to consider changing to improve the

00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:58,560
letter the other thing is I really I

00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:00,870
want it to be frequency based because I

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,820
I don't want to take all the letters

00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:04,200
written for women and turn them into

00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,750
letters that sound like they're written

00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,520
for men we should be valuing and

00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:10,350
considering the value

00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,590
emotion focused words of communal

00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:14,610
language of interpersonal skills and

00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:16,080
empathy and a lot of the things that we

00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,580
might not think about in hiring and

00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,340
promotion but it's still really

00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,740
important and so ultimately the idea is

00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:24,290
to say you have more of these communal

00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:27,210
words consider adding

00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:29,070
agentic or like leadership or sort of

00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:31,560
more independence focused words from

00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:36,360
this list instead of deleting really

00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:37,980
good content content that's there and my

00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:41,100
hope going forward once we have the tool

00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:43,440
is to find out if people will use it can

00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,060
the tool change behavior what level of

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,740
specificity does it need do we need

00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:49,080
something different for applications

00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:51,030
something for promotion and hiring

00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,410
letters of recommendation or evaluations

00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:54,900
and does it need to be specific for

00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:57,270
fields right what differences are going

00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:59,190
to be there for a letter for a teacher

00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:02,280
or professor versus a letter for someone

00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:04,200
in engineering and then also can it help

00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,960
with personal statements because I for

00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,550
one tend to not follow any of the rules

00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,720
about good writing and personal

00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:12,540
statements because I don't want to like

00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:15,060
highlight that and can we develop rules

00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,770
for other types of bias that's where I

00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:19,400
really want to go next what are the

00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:22,500
other types of implicit bias that we can

00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,820
look make rules for and add in and I

00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,140
started with rule based instead of

00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,640
statistical based because it's what I

00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,320
knew it's what I was sort of the one

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,670
that I could the easiest one to start

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,950
with but I would love eventually to get

00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:36,720
to the more statistical sort of learning

00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:38,640
based approaches to this so I told the

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,070
story in a really specific way today and

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,490
the reason I did that is because this

00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:45,480
idea came because I went to a talk and

00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:46,860
sitting you're sitting together in a

00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,330
room with different people who have

00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,400
different lived experiences and

00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:55,040
different skills and there are there's

00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:57,660
amazing power in these moments I also

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,130
want to talk about the idea I wanted to

00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:01,740
highlight the idea that I didn't have

00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:04,200
any expertise I was new to academic

00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:07,020
medicine I had done zero programming and

00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,180
I still could find people to support me

00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:11,850
and make this happen so don't limit

00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:13,290
yourself by your expertise don't think I

00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:13,830
don't know how to do that it's not my

00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:14,640
field

00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:17,970
therefore I

00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:20,250
can't and finally bring your creativity

00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:21,839
to problem-solving one of the reasons I

00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,190
thought about the absence of things I

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,279
think is because of my history with

00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:28,410
dyslexia and sort of my own experiences

00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:31,200
in different communities and so I want

00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:33,570
to encourage all of you to sort of take

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,579
this as we go forward and I wanted to

00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:37,910
leave time for questions so thank you so

00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:37,910
much

00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:43,279
