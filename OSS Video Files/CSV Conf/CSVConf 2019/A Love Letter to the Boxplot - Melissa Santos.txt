Title: A Love Letter to the Boxplot - Melissa Santos
Publication date: 2019-05-19
Playlist: CSVConf 2019
Description: 
	We'll briefly cover what the boxplot is, why it's so great to look at distributions instead of single statistics, and common boxplot variations. I'll spend at least half the talk showing boxplots of real data and comparing them to other summary methods. The talk will wrap up with some quick info on how to create boxplots in many common chartings/statistics/BI tools. I hope this talk will make people more likely to use my favorite chart!

I'm Melissa Santos I'm a data analyst at

00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:09,019
a little company and I love box plots I

00:00:06,229 --> 00:00:11,450
love them a whole lot I use them a whole

00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:13,039
lot I realized while talking to someone

00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:14,679
else earlier in this conference that I

00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:17,030
don't like a lot of other visualizations

00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:19,550
so it's really surprising that there's

00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:21,830
one that I really love but this is it

00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:23,990
this is the box plot they make fun of me

00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:27,290
at work for it we have meetings that the

00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:29,150
description is to admire box plots they

00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:31,520
joke about how maybe I can get these

00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:36,980
results as a box plot and I'm like yes

00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:38,690
you can you can I'm gonna try so I know

00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,159
not everyone is super familiar with box

00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:42,469
plots so we're gonna do an introduction

00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:43,670
and go through what they are and we're

00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:45,499
gonna spend some time talking about how

00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:49,429
to draw them with computers and then

00:00:45,499 --> 00:00:51,170
we'll just look at some examples it's

00:00:49,429 --> 00:00:55,399
called the box plot cuz it has a box in

00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:59,059
the middle real story true story fronts

00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:00,679
and the box has the median in it and so

00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,300
if you if you teach if you're showing

00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:04,430
someone a box plot and they get nothing

00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:06,290
else out of it just be like that line in

00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:08,840
the middle that's the median now you

00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:10,670
know where the median is that's and

00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:14,750
that's a huge amount of additional

00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:16,700
information then the upper and lower

00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:18,560
parts of the box plot minutes itself of

00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,930
the box are called the upper and lower

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,670
quartiles sometimes they're called the

00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:25,240
fourths sometimes they're called the

00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:27,560
hinges let's just call them quartiles

00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,270
they're like the medians for their

00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,659
halves they're dividing their halves

00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:37,430
into half and the upshot of that is that

00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:39,469
half the data is in the box and that

00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,869
gives you a measure of spread associated

00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:43,609
with box plots we call the area in

00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:46,369
between the area at the height of the

00:01:43,609 --> 00:01:49,009
box the interquartile range it's a

00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:50,630
perfectly good measure of spread it's

00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:52,670
probably more understandable than a

00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:54,530
standard deviation because you can tell

00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:57,679
it's the part that contains half the

00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:59,479
data if you are so lucky that your data

00:01:57,679 --> 00:02:01,460
is perfectly normally distributed

00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:04,189
it is about equal to one point three

00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:06,409
five standard deviations if that is that

00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:09,670
somehow makes it click better for you

00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:12,170
but you really can think of it that way

00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:14,330
we also have this notion of whiskers

00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:17,930
that go off the box plot

00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:19,520
and they they would go to the max and

00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:24,200
the min values of all your data was well

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:26,660
behaved so they don't and that they in

00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:29,840
order to keep them a little bit wrangled

00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:32,060
they allow along the the rules of box

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,530
plots allow that the whiskers go out as

00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,959
far as one point five times the

00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:38,120
interquartile range so I don't

00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:39,950
necessarily go out that far entirely

00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:44,330
they go up as far as the data does

00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:46,489
within that amount and then anything

00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,500
past that as an outlier and I'm not

00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:51,530
seeing that in any kind of statistical

00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:53,930
way I'm just saying that in terms of a

00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:55,550
box plot it's an outlier and if ideally

00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:57,560
if your data set is well-behaved there

00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:00,230
should be so few of them that it's worse

00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:06,310
the chart Inc to let it be a mark of its

00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:08,739
own so I don't have a box plot so much

00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:11,330
because I have to get asked all the time

00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:13,310
well how many people typically do this

00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:17,959
how long does it typically take for this

00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:19,910
to happen so and typically kind of

00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:24,730
implies that the average is meaningful

00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:27,799
and I I don't believe in the average I

00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:29,360
don't trust it and I want to show people

00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:31,130
the range and I want them to actually be

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,650
able to see and compare things a little

00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:35,329
bit better even when the averages even

00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:37,850
when the data is very close to the

00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:40,489
typical value that's something that's an

00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:41,959
important information to know and that's

00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:45,410
not something you get pretending you

00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:46,880
know average itself and so again we get

00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:49,640
the range of the data and we get the

00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,620
full range of the data in a box plot and

00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,030
hopefully your data is pretty well

00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:56,060
behaved and it doesn't have a lot of

00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:57,709
outliers and maybe you'll have a really

00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:00,230
boring box plot and that should be

00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:03,290
wonderful and reassuring wouldn't that

00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:04,670
be great but if you don't have a really

00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:06,320
well-behaved box plot then you've

00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:08,780
learned something and that's even better

00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,250
if you find out that your data has all

00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,489
these wacky outliers and you have

00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:17,150
somebody who took 2,000 days to do

00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:18,709
something wonder what's up with them and

00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:21,079
while we didn't see it in the example so

00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:22,520
far one of my favorite things about box

00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:25,190
plots is they make it really easy to

00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,840
compare groups you can instead of just

00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:28,670
comparing the average or the meat

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,010
you actually have to compare where the

00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:35,180
bulk of the data sits and get a feel for

00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:36,680
how the distributions differ so let's

00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:39,500
talk a little bit about how to draw from

00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,210
box plots with computers I was so

00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,980
excited about this talk that I've been

00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:45,440
excited about it on Twitter for like two

00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:49,790
months so I had a lot of lovely input

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:53,300
from people and this is just one thing

00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:57,310
somebody sent me Vega is an HTML canvas

00:04:53,300 --> 00:05:00,020
plotting library and it draws these nice

00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:01,880
elements and altair is a Python wrapper

00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,740
for it so it's just there's a ton of

00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,660
tools out there that can be used for box

00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,580
plots we're not gonna get into this one

00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:09,830
I just wanted to show there was when I

00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:13,490
had never heard of that someone brought

00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:16,370
out to me and before we get into the

00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:18,590
programming tools I think all these kind

00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:20,360
of the push-button tools the tools where

00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:22,430
you have you have a dataset that you

00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,419
import or you get from your sequel and

00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:28,010
then you push a button to get a graph

00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:29,780
tableau is the one that I see in all the

00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:31,780
job descriptions all the job

00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:34,610
descriptions so it must be important so

00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:36,710
it's very good that it uses box plots

00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:37,880
I've not ever gotten to use tableau so I

00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:39,710
don't know how great they are

00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,620
but there's box plots so they got to be

00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:44,930
pretty great cardio is the one I use at

00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:46,130
work and it has box plots thank goodness

00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:48,890
all right have to go out to Python all

00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:51,620
the time someone on Twitter brought up

00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:53,120
power bi and I looked into it and they

00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:56,870
don't have box plots by default but they

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,669
can be imported many tabs another tool

00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:01,340
in this category that I used in school

00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:03,500
and it it has box plots as well if any

00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:05,300
of you know of other push button e tools

00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,740
that have box plots I would really love

00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,830
to have a more comprehensive list of

00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:11,150
these as part of this is to try and make

00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:16,669
using box plots more accessible to other

00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:20,570
people so I have a nice example dataset

00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:22,220
to show you I used Google dataset search

00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:24,830
and I found this Pokemon data set on

00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,630
Kaggle all you need to know about

00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:29,960
Pokemon and this is just a video game

00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:32,300
data I don't know the specifics is they

00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,970
come in various generations and they

00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:37,430
have a variety of stats there's speed

00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:39,560
and defense and attack and whatever you

00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,920
can add those up and get something like

00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,480
a

00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:47,090
stat that tells you how cool your

00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:49,940
Pokemon is so let's do that and look at

00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:53,660
some look at that some of those stats

00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:55,400
with Python basic map pot Lib is very

00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,710
happy to give you a box but you just

00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,670
pass it any kind of vector and it says

00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:03,380
sure here's your box plot the total

00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:06,920
score for all Pokemon has a median

00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:10,930
around 450 a max around 800 and I'm in

00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:14,090
around 200 here you go here's a box plot

00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:15,710
pandas has a built in box plot method so

00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:17,240
that you if you have any data frame you

00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:18,680
can tell it to do a box plot on it and

00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,110
not only can you tell it to do a box

00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,120
plot on any one column you can tell it

00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:26,240
to divide up by any other column that it

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:29,450
knows about so in this case we divided

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,400
it out by generation and we see that for

00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:32,840
a generation one there's one outlier and

00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,520
there's one really cool Pokemon a

00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:37,040
generation one that everybody wants to

00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:39,800
get and then we can see a little bit

00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,360
that so the range for generation three

00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,160
is wider than for any of the other

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,810
generations or that the median for

00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:49,730
generation four is maybe a little bit

00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:51,350
higher than some of the other ones if we

00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:53,570
want to get fancy then we can use

00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:56,900
Seabourn which is built on top of

00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:59,390
matplotlib and is delightful as well as

00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,310
having our x axis with the generation

00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:04,070
values and our y axis with our total

00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:07,010
score now we can also have a color

00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:09,380
variable so the hue is set to the

00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:10,940
legendary type of Pokemon so obviously

00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:15,160
legendary Pokemon aren't going to be

00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:15,160
better and the statistics reflect that

00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:21,410
our outlier and one is swept up in a

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,000
legendary group and you can see that the

00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:26,000
legendary ones are uniformly and much

00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,620
have much cooler scores and then we

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,250
start getting into variations on the box

00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:33,380
plot a notched box plot has it has this

00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:35,450
little waist that tells you where the

00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:39,530
95% confidence interval is for the

00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:41,720
median which is that I love it like I've

00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:44,060
been talking I saw that four looks like

00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:45,110
it's a little high in that median but

00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,370
then when you actually have that

00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,660
confidence interval to compared to the

00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:50,480
other confidence intervals you're like

00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:51,450
yeah well that's actually a little bit

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,140
of a difference that's

00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:56,760
real and so ideally they have that

00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,740
beautiful shapes but the blue ones have

00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,650
or there's just a notch in the waist of

00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:03,360
the box but in the case where of the

00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:05,460
legendary ones or the median is at the

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,470
bottom of the box sometimes confidence

00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:09,270
interval has to extend out past the box

00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:14,490
and you get this snaggletooth pattern

00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:18,660
that you see here and of course we can

00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:21,420
do all of this in our base graphics is

00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:24,300
very happy to do box plots for us you

00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:28,320
and it immediately lets me split things

00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:31,500
up and we with just with the generation

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,970
and the legendary all in one go and then

00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,700
not only can I do the knotch two box

00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:38,130
plots in are but I have a new function

00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,630
called variable width which lets me to

00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:41,520
have the sizes of the boxes be

00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:44,100
proportional to the size of the data set

00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,690
so for instance here we see that the

00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,280
legendary ones are all there's many

00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:49,950
fewer legendary Pokemon than regular

00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:52,980
Pokemon seems pretty reasonable

00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:54,780
I like far with so much I had to show

00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:57,480
you another example because I really

00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:59,520
love it so I just want to show you that

00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,590
for instance there are far fewer flying

00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:04,140
Pokemon than there are normal or water

00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:06,870
pokemon and the innocent glance you can

00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:12,840
tell that the median power of the flying

00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:15,140
Pokemon is pretty good and of course you

00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:18,810
can do all this in ggplot2 as well and

00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:20,520
there's a Jia MOC spot and GG plot is

00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:27,120
perfectly happy to do both notches and

00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:29,040
var with so I work at a little company

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,040
that does organizational chart software

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,740
and so I count a lot of things about how

00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:38,250
many people you are how many people

00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:39,960
report to one manager how many yeah just

00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:42,090
how many people are using the tool

00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:44,040
yesterday how many people did anything

00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:46,560
so there's I'm just do a lot of counting

00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,850
and then I have to do and then I give

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,320
them a lot of box plots about the

00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:53,730
counting so I'm going to show you some

00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:56,070
examples from work so we have the notion

00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:57,450
of a planning or chart you can invite

00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:59,760
people to collaborate with you on your

00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:01,780
org chart so by default you have 0

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,790
collaborators until you invite one

00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:05,830
and so this is something I do fairly

00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:09,460
often where I do this histogram Escobar

00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:12,130
plot and I also do a box plot because

00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:14,110
they tell you different things from the

00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:15,820
histogram esta bar bar plot we have this

00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:18,370
we can tell right away where the data is

00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:21,220
piling up and that there's this huge

00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:23,950
spike in 0 and it still shows you the

00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:25,420
range which is very nice but the box

00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,980
plot tells us a little bit more about

00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:30,850
where the median sits and the quartiles

00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:32,410
and they also shows the range so being

00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:36,880
able to pull out the median separately

00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:38,380
without having to guess at it by trying

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,090
to add up these bars on your head is

00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:45,070
something that you gain by using the box

00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:48,160
plot as well and then we have a game on

00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:51,250
our yeah we have a game on our mobile

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,570
app called who's who and it shows you

00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,980
someone's picture and you try and figure

00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:55,990
out which name goes with which picture

00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,900
and we want to know how many people are

00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:02,890
playing that game and how viral it is

00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:08,890
within companies and so someone has

00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:10,990
played this game over 600 times and then

00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:13,480
I wanted to show you the screenshot from

00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:15,940
the bottom is a hover over the same at

00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:21,220
box plot from the maximum who's who

00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:22,900
count cardio has this convention that it

00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:25,060
says the maximum and the minimum are the

00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:26,230
ends of thought whiskers and then it's

00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,820
just thickness of calls everything else

00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:31,150
in outlier but it does not call them the

00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:32,620
maximum of their minimum but partly I

00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:34,330
wanted to complain about that convention

00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:37,390
and partly I wanted to show you that

00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:38,950
this tool lets me hover over any of

00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:42,940
these these graphs and quickly see the

00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:44,170
median and the quartiles and sometimes

00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,930
we have sometimes we're not just

00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:49,060
counting things sometimes we turn things

00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:50,740
into percentages or other kinds of

00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,430
metrics and they still can make sense to

00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:54,970
be a boxplot

00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:56,170
if you have a whole vector of data and

00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:58,030
so in this case we looked at how many

00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:00,880
people on a company play if at least two

00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:03,400
people play trying to get it how viral

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:06,160
it is and it's it's not really taken off

00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:08,589
that median is pretty low even at the

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,440
most engaged company is only 40% of

00:13:08,589 --> 00:13:13,980
people are playing the game right it's a

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,980
lot to ask for

00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:19,310
another thing I do periodically is I use

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,230
a logarithmic scale and it takes away a

00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:23,300
little bit of being able to see the IQR

00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:25,850
and get what's going on with that but it

00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:28,700
stretches out the bar pot a little bit

00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:30,139
boxplot a lot so you can see where the

00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,329
median is if it's all squished up at the

00:13:30,139 --> 00:13:34,670
bottom I as you're kind of seeing a lot

00:13:32,329 --> 00:13:38,029
of my data is highly left skewed it's

00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:39,800
all squished up at 0 and 1 so being able

00:13:38,029 --> 00:13:42,170
to see the median on something like this

00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,240
and still see the upper quartile and

00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:46,480
everything and then just see oh it does

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,949
go out past a thousand Gees that's

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,269
that's a lot of nodes before they first

00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:52,190
get to share and share what they're

00:13:50,269 --> 00:13:56,839
doing they must be doing some kind of

00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:58,550
cool import or something sometimes the

00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:00,949
logarithmic scale isn't enough to save

00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:02,740
us sometimes we're just dominated by

00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:05,690
outliers with this highly skewed data

00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:08,889
this is the the days between you're

00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:11,630
signing up and using a CSV import and so

00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:15,740
60% of people use one on the first day

00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:17,990
and then it goes out and out and out and

00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:19,970
so the first box plot is obviously

00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:21,740
useless it does it does nothing for us

00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:24,980
it's just like we have a mess of

00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:27,079
outliers the second one tries a little

00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:29,529
harder but all it tells us really is

00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:34,610
that the median is there at one

00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:36,260
all right zero rather so in this case I

00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:39,250
ended up use I finally had to give in

00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:42,949
and use not a box plot I had to use a

00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:44,660
sadly enough I used like a cumulative

00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:49,250
percentile graph to try and show this

00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:51,949
data taking a little bit of a turn and

00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:53,980
back to the Pokemon data this is the

00:14:51,949 --> 00:14:57,440
speed of the Pokemon by generation I

00:14:53,980 --> 00:15:00,199
want to I want to complain about bar

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:03,079
plots I don't see the point of having a

00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:05,569
bar plot to show an average I feel like

00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:08,050
the it implies something about the

00:15:05,569 --> 00:15:10,040
height and that fully filled in bar

00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:11,990
implies something else about the height

00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:14,540
it's nice that they have the error bars

00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:16,399
from the 95% confidence interval but it

00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:18,360
tells you so much less than the box

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,790
plots telling you

00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:24,180
and just the outliers that are visible

00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:26,100
in generation 3 the the minimum of

00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:28,590
generation 6 being higher than the

00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,940
vanillin any of the other ones all these

00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:31,470
are things that are really easy to see

00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:35,400
with the box plots but completely

00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:36,900
obscured by the bar plot but I guess a

00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:42,360
table of averages didn't look cool

00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:44,910
enough and I will admit it box plots

00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,110
aren't perfect yeah even though I had an

00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:48,360
example where I had to give up already

00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:50,460
and this is some really cool research

00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,020
out of autodesk or they they did an

00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:55,500
entire paper of trying to fool

00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:59,190
statistical methods and so the box plot

00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:03,150
was not the only thing they broke and

00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:05,670
they broke the box plot by grouping the

00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:07,290
data and all these various ways and so

00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:10,170
you have these buildups of data in

00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:12,210
different places so what it showed me

00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:14,570
was that the box plots really not useful

00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:17,430
at telling you where your motif your

00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:18,990
multimodal data is if there's multiple

00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:21,660
Peaks that's just not something it's

00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:24,240
gonna communicate to you which it didn't

00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:28,920
really imply that it would so I'm not

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:32,520
I'm not too upset file in plot is a new

00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:34,530
version that is a an extension past the

00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:38,100
box plot where we showed the density on

00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:39,840
either side of the line instead and it's

00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,780
a little nicer for that but it's a

00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:44,010
little harder to read in other ways like

00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:50,880
I don't know where the medians are on

00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:53,970
these box plots they're wonderful

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:56,790
I love them there's so much more than a

00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:59,190
central tendency and more importantly

00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:00,720
like you can slice and dice your data a

00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:02,640
lot of different ways and see those

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,430
groups and see the differences really

00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:07,440
quickly and easily even if you're not

00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:09,870
expecting outliers you're gonna be able

00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:12,480
to have them show up really quickly for

00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:16,140
you and you can use them on a lot of

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,820
different ways so I love the box plots I

00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:20,960
hope you were not too bored hearing

00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,960
about my enjoyment of them

00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,850
