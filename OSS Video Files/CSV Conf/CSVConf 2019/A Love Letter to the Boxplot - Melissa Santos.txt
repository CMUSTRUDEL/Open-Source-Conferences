Title: A Love Letter to the Boxplot - Melissa Santos
Publication date: 2019-05-19
Playlist: CSVConf 2019
Description: 
	We'll briefly cover what the boxplot is, why it's so great to look at distributions instead of single statistics, and common boxplot variations. I'll spend at least half the talk showing boxplots of real data and comparing them to other summary methods. The talk will wrap up with some quick info on how to create boxplots in many common chartings/statistics/BI tools. I hope this talk will make people more likely to use my favorite chart!
