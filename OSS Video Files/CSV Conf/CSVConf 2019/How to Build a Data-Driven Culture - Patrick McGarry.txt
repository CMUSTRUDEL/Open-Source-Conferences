Title: How to Build a Data-Driven Culture - Patrick McGarry
Publication date: 2019-06-21
Playlist: CSVConf 2019
Description: 
	The world of modern data teamwork isn't one that can be created by software and business process alone. Individuals will need to alter their behavior, which is the hardest part about change. This talk will examine the traits and behaviors that lead organizations to be truly data-driven.

hey everybody welcome as the talk says

00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:09,040
this isn't gonna be about kind of our

00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,699
how to build a day to different culture

00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,049
view it's a lot of material and not a

00:00:12,699 --> 00:00:15,490
lot of time so I'm gonna go pretty

00:00:14,049 --> 00:00:17,050
quickly and I hope to leave enough time

00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:20,050
at questions so we can dig into the

00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,919
parts that people do care about just to

00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:23,410
give you a little bit of history on

00:00:20,919 --> 00:00:24,669
where this is coming from this and all

00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:27,789
of these slides are available right now

00:00:24,669 --> 00:00:29,289
on data practices org we have a series

00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:30,579
of OpenCourseWare that's up there and

00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:32,980
this is one of those things that we're

00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:34,480
drawing from so a little bit about the

00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:37,270
history of where this came from

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,250
about a year ago November now we put a

00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,660
whole bunch of folks that were that we

00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,670
felt we're kind of leaders or

00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:45,489
visionaries across the data ecosystem

00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:47,949
whether that meant the academic world of

00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:50,440
semantics data vis data journalism

00:00:47,949 --> 00:00:51,550
open-source we kind of threw them all in

00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,190
a room and shook it just to see what

00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:55,480
would happen and we noticed that a lot

00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:59,440
of the conversations that were happening

00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:01,329
were very similar to what we saw 10 15

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,180
or more years ago in the software

00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:06,220
development ecosystem and you know we

00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:08,470
decided that you know hey let's skip

00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:10,510
that whole waterfall development

00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:12,490
awfulness that we had in software

00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:14,680
development and let's go straight to

00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:15,760
agile for data and so we wanted to kind

00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:20,080
of come up with some values and

00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:22,660
principles that we felt best enumerated

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,700
what was important about modern data

00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:26,740
teamwork as we saw it and so that was

00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:29,830
kind of the first start and from there

00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:31,750
that community has grown and also helped

00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:34,600
to build all of the open courseware you

00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:37,690
can see that was relaunched in March on

00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,580
data practices org you know that we have

00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:41,620
for kind of core values and 12

00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:44,620
principles had almost 40 authors and we

00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:46,270
have a ton of signatories already so

00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:48,700
definitely some wonderful momentum that

00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:50,050
we really appreciate and I'll skip over

00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,340
some of this just to give you an idea

00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:53,470
some of the people who are involved if

00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:55,150
you look on the left here some of the

00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:57,400
folks that were in the room there was

00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:58,870
some really good brain trust and it was

00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,730
really nice to kind of hear some of

00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:02,950
their frustrations with the data

00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:05,670
ecosystem especially as its you know

00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:08,170
taking off in the realm of the buzzword

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,959
but a lot of times it's not keeping up

00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:13,120
in terms of the you know actual ability

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,680
to deliver there's this really big gap

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,040
the

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,739
between what people want and what people

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,810
are able to get from their workforce and

00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:24,650
a lot of times it's just it's just

00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:26,969
miscommunication so we're hoping that by

00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:28,950
providing some of this courseware and

00:02:26,969 --> 00:02:30,480
and continuing to grow that community

00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:33,900
that we kind of elevate the level of

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,859
data literacy so here you know taking a

00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,900
look at some of the things that we're

00:02:34,859 --> 00:02:39,420
gonna cover mostly I'm interested in

00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,069
kind of framing this problem and then

00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:43,170
looking at some of the things that are

00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:45,150
good indicators or perhaps other things

00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:46,889
that are good places where you can start

00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,680
you know what's the low-hanging fruit in

00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:52,319
terms of I am part of an organization

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,209
whether that's a non-profit governmental

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,769
organization or whether it's you know

00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:59,579
the company that I work for my day job

00:02:55,769 --> 00:03:02,669
how can we make data a first-class

00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:04,500
citizen now I will say that these blue

00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:06,359
slides this is designed as an hour and a

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,280
half workshop for people to actually

00:03:06,359 --> 00:03:10,349
dive into and I've got like 15 minutes

00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,329
to go through it so we're gonna skip the

00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:13,799
exercise portion of this fart but I did

00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:17,010
want to let you know that it is there

00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:18,840
all of these all of these slides does it

00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:20,280
set up on data practices org and if you

00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,629
look at the first slide if you hit that

00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,459
S key when you're looking at the first

00:03:21,629 --> 00:03:25,079
slide all of the speaker notes and

00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:27,629
everything that you need to kind of dig

00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:29,010
into this yourself if you want to do

00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:34,169
something like that is all available to

00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:35,150
you so framing the problem so I wanted

00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:37,530
to kind of look at a few different

00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:40,290
tangible examples of how people are

00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:43,439
framing the problems in the data

00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:46,019
ecosystem I'm gonna look at two books

00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,579
and then just my experience at data that

00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:49,500
world I felt there was some really

00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:50,549
valuable lessons that we've learned over

00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,530
the last few years

00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:55,709
that I wanted to share that I was

00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:58,099
intimately involved with so first I'll

00:03:55,709 --> 00:04:02,579
start with the definition of what is

00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:04,560
data-driven mean so you can see kind of

00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:06,569
the dictionary sort of definition but if

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,150
there's only one thing that you walk

00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:11,639
away from this talk with I want it to be

00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:14,519
that being data-driven is about the

00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:16,169
people it's not about the technology I

00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:18,870
mean if you look at the research that's

00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:21,419
being done out in the ecosystem right

00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:23,279
now whether it's Gartner or Forrester or

00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:25,409
you know academic researchers or

00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:27,000
whatever they'll tell you that you know

00:04:25,409 --> 00:04:27,480
the chief data officer he's the new kid

00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,150
on the block

00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,590
in the c-suite right a lot of times they

00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:36,150
are under you to underutilized

00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:38,220
under-resourced and unappreciated the

00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:40,230
research is saying that fifty to sixty

00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,450
percent of those chief data officer czar

00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:44,970
going to fail in their mission in the

00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:47,490
next three to five years and the reason

00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:50,130
for that that we have seen anecdotally

00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:52,440
is that the ones that are doing well are

00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:54,840
approaching this as a people problem an

00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,640
education problem a culture problem and

00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,870
the ones that are not getting the

00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,400
results that they're really looking for

00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:02,040
are treating this as a technology

00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,590
problem a what can I install what are

00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,240
the tools that I need if I buy tableau

00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:09,060
that's the answer the Silver Bullet

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,290
there is no silver bullet like let's get

00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,240
that right all the way right right at

00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:14,340
the beginning here so if there's no

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,210
other takeaway from this it's a people

00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:20,510
problem so there are a couple of books

00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:26,370
here and the first one here play bigger

00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:27,720
this is not about data so the reason I

00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:32,100
selected this is there's some really

00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:36,180
good lessons about building practice so

00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:38,010
play bigger was all about how do you

00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,560
it's about category design it's about

00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:41,940
creating a new business but creating it

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,270
in a way that there's a new category

00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:47,430
right I am creating a category that's

00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:48,690
called data cataloging and I'm going to

00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,220
tell everybody that's the answer to

00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:52,440
everything and this is how you grow and

00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:55,830
explode and dominate the market by

00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,690
creating the market to dominate so the

00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:59,340
interesting portions of this book and I

00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:01,590
won't dive in too deep just because we

00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:03,390
don't have enough time but I like that

00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:05,280
it starts asking questions about what

00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:07,950
are the problems you need to solve so

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,620
looking at you know are we data driven

00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:13,290
if we're not what can we do to solve

00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:17,070
that problem do we have underutilized

00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:19,050
data so are we getting poor ROI do we

00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:21,300
have disconnected data you know have we

00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:22,980
spent the last 10 years aggregating

00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,270
technologies that now have stuff

00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:27,660
scattered to the four corners of the

00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:29,070
universe and then taking those problems

00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:33,150
and looking at kind of what are the key

00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:35,160
components so is is my data hard to

00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:37,110
understand is it hard to access is it

00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,390
like looking at what are the the things

00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:41,100
that lead to your frustrations and then

00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:42,630
at the end of the day kind of

00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,510
teaching you this book tells you how to

00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:48,030
kind of define the villain and it's it's

00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:50,430
an interesting way to kind of personify

00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:52,110
the thing that you're trying to defeat

00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:54,060
the thing that you are doing battle

00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:56,070
against whatever it is right whether

00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,630
it's you know data silos whether it's

00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:59,250
dumb data whether it's you know

00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:01,560
self-serve analytics that no one's how

00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:03,150
it knows how to self-serve it's looking

00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,000
at ways to kind of do some of these

00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:07,890
things yourself and then the second book

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,510
I would recommend highly recommend for

00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:11,550
anyone in the data space is called

00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:13,680
winning with data I think this is a

00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:16,530
fantastic book and especially as it

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,650
relates to this topic I mean even the

00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:22,290
the first chapter is titled Mad Men to

00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:25,230
math men the power of the data-driven

00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:27,630
culture so it's really neat because they

00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:28,800
kind of they reframe a lot of the

00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:31,680
problems that you see in the data

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,350
ecosystem in a very unique way and a way

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:38,010
that's really easy to kind of get your

00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:39,900
mind around it's a lot less I know it's

00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:42,030
a lot less of that ephemeral well you

00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,530
know data silos are this or you know

00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:45,540
some of these different things that yeah

00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:49,620
they exist but they're talking about

00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:51,300
kind of four key problem areas talking

00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,180
about what they call data breadlines

00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:57,060
data obscurity data fragmentation and

00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:58,710
data brawls and so going through some of

00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,300
those things I like the the data

00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:03,750
breadlines this one is the one that I

00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:07,200
seem to see most often when I go into an

00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:09,780
organization this is the idea that small

00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,940
data service teams exist within the

00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:15,570
organization but they have to service

00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:17,460
the data requests for everyone and this

00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:19,080
leads to that data breadline you can

00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,520
imagine the you know great depression

00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,600
breadlines where there's around the

00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,790
corner and everybody's waiting with a

00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:26,040
soup bowl it's the same thing with

00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:28,110
people waiting for their data right and

00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,430
and a lot of times you may have been in

00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:32,580
line and you may have been ready you may

00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:33,900
had all your ducks in a row but some

00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,219
executive comes along and says I need

00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,960
this right now and they jump the line

00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:40,890
and now you're waiting even longer so

00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:43,229
you know it's this idea that we have

00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,860
data experts and they will answer our

00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:46,620
questions

00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:49,320
they are the black magic box and that

00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:52,980
becomes a problem right because then

00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:54,440
everyone else is beholden to their time

00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:57,440
schedule their workload

00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,900
etc and so you know that's obviously a

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:03,140
huge problem the second one that they

00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:05,030
were framing was data obscurity so it's

00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:07,160
similar but different it's talking about

00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:09,410
how there are very few people within an

00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:11,360
organization that know where all the

00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:13,610
data lives where all the bodies are

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,800
buried right you've got maybe a couple

00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:17,660
of data engineers that know okay I know

00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,010
I have to pull these different things

00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:21,470
from these different pipelines for

00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:23,090
different people but if you ask anyone

00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:24,740
of the subject matter experts or

00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:26,990
stakeholders they have no idea what

00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:30,950
exists beyond their own very small niche

00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:34,040
view of their data universe and there's

00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:36,260
data fragmentation so this is the this

00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:39,110
is the shadow IT problem right this is

00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:41,060
where people got frustrated with data

00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:42,920
obscurity or data bread lines and

00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:45,470
they've decided well the heck with that

00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,240
I'm gonna stand up an Access database on

00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:49,220
a machine that's stashed under my desk

00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:51,230
and then I'm gonna use that to make

00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:54,020
millions of dollars worth of business

00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:56,240
decisions and no one else knows where

00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:58,850
that data came from if it's clean if

00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,400
it's accurate or better yet the hit by a

00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:03,410
bus problem that person goes away now

00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:06,770
how are those decisions being made we

00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:09,350
have no idea and then the the idea of

00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:12,410
data brawls I like this one because if

00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:13,970
you take some of the problems and silos

00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:16,760
and and things like that they're built

00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:18,590
within an organization you look at okay

00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,900
two people have decided that they're

00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:25,130
going to reference our q4 sales from

00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:26,780
last year now they both came up with

00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:28,370
different numbers they may be similar

00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:30,740
they may be close but they both came up

00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:33,350
with different numbers now we spend more

00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:36,230
time arguing about where did this data

00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:38,720
come from how was it generated what

00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:40,640
kinds of transforms were done and so now

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,290
we're brawling about the data we're not

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,260
actually answering the question that we

00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:48,080
came there to address and so those four

00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:51,290
things I think really do a good job of

00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:53,470
describing the problems that you see in

00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:55,790
an organization as it relates to data

00:10:53,470 --> 00:11:01,010
now as I said I wanted to kind of bring

00:10:55,790 --> 00:11:03,260
in my own dated out world POV so early

00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:06,750
on we wrote kind of an internal position

00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:08,370
paper about the data ecosystem

00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,930
and we had a bunch of main points that

00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:12,120
we looked at we looked at community and

00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:14,310
governance and kind of the tool fatigue

00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,170
problem and transformation through data

00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:18,990
and all these other things but I wanted

00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:22,380
to read one excerpt about data just to

00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:24,270
kind of kick it off here so we believe

00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:26,790
that data can transform the world

00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:29,280
causing an unprecedented boom in

00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:31,230
efficiency and effectiveness data can

00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:33,420
make the world smaller by connecting

00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:35,340
people to problems and solutions data

00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:37,700
can radically change company cultures

00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:40,770
too as William Gibson speculative

00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:44,010
science fiction author said the future

00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:48,300
is already here it's just not very

00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:49,830
evenly distributed the future is already

00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,410
here at a handful of these companies

00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:54,330
that have transformed their industries

00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:56,730
Airbnb Warby Parker Facebook Google

00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:59,280
Amazon were literally built from the

00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:02,940
ground up to take advantage of data at

00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:05,370
Airbnb their fifth employee was a data

00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:08,700
scientist today they have their own data

00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:11,220
catalog where 45% of their 3,100

00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:13,110
employees regularly engage with it at

00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:16,470
Warby Parker they have a similar data

00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:19,040
catalog but in this case 80% of their

00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:21,990
employees are regularly engaged with it

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:25,470
traditional fortune 500 and global 2000

00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:27,150
companies are lucky if even 1% of their

00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:28,710
employees are doing the same or if they

00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:30,320
have a democratized data catalog in the

00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:33,000
first place

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:36,720
most don't even measure this percentage

00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,430
asome these traditional companies

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,290
weren't built from the ground up around

00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:42,210
data they were built from the ground up

00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:44,250
around Adam's not bits which is one of

00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:47,040
my favorite quotes from an investor

00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:49,320
named Mike maples jr. he's very quotable

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,540
you can look him up the new order of the

00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,480
world is that bits will control atoms

00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:55,980
this creates many exciting opportunities

00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:58,170
but is very scary for traditional

00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:00,780
companies in the 2018 new Vantage

00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:02,880
partners big data executive survey the

00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:05,310
traditional company's fears of a highly

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:08,580
agile data-driven competitor has jumped

00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:11,790
to 79 point four percent from this is a

00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:15,209
significant drop from like 47 percent in

00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:19,020
2017 so that was kind of our look at the

00:13:15,209 --> 00:13:23,430
data ecosystem and an understanding that

00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:25,680
there is a large gulf between the haves

00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:29,310
and have-nots between the companies that

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:31,920
have incorporated data into their DNA

00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:34,500
and those that are struggling just to

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,150
understand how they can even recognize

00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:39,990
that they have data that that's

00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:42,030
important so I want to look at the

00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:43,940
killers of a data-driven company what

00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:46,920
are kind of the important things that

00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:48,480
that make up a good data different

00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,790
company and so I think the first is data

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,080
infrastructure now this is a tough one

00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:54,810
you know because remember I said that

00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:57,600
this is not a tool problem but the

00:13:54,810 --> 00:14:01,050
problem involves tools we've spent the

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,760
last 10 years or more really advancing

00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:04,350
some of these data technologies whether

00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,180
they're you know data lakes data

00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:07,530
warehouses relational databases all the

00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:10,590
way down to your spreadsheets and flat

00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:12,570
files like we use all of these tools on

00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:15,750
a daily basis we just don't use them

00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:18,780
together and we don't use them well so

00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:21,470
the idea here is looking at these tools

00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:23,790
and trying to find a way that or

00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:26,750
identifying you know what data

00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:29,940
infrastructure looks like from a this is

00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:31,620
disparate this is siloed this is not

00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:34,350
working together well versus how do we

00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,610
put that together and I think the the

00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:37,080
question that you have to the questions

00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:44,030
that you have to ask yourselves are

00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:46,650
around data access data context and just

00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:48,660
making a single source of truth and so

00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:50,570
when you look at these things you know

00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:54,270
data access this is important because

00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:56,160
historically you have had these I'll

00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:57,210
call them the data elite right these are

00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,470
the folks that know how to write a

00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:00,900
sequel query these are the folks that

00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:02,490
are your bi analysts and you know all

00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:06,620
the way on down the data science chain

00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:09,720
and we are doing ourselves a disservice

00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:11,460
by relying so heavily on them we need to

00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,740
start bringing in more of our subject

00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:15,810
matter experts yeah I can be the best bi

00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:17,700
analyst in the world and I can crunch

00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:19,800
all the numbers I want but if the

00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:21,810
numbers are off I'm not gonna know it

00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,790
I'm just gonna know that my math is

00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:26,760
right but the subject matter expert can

00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:29,760
come in and say yeah Microsoft you know

00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:31,870
we we analyzed our gender makeup in

00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,430
terms of our employees

00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:36,670
I know it's bad but I can tell you that

00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:38,770
we are not 98% male so you know it's

00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:40,810
that context that's really important

00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:43,900
it's the ability for you to bring more

00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:45,310
people into that conversation and so I

00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,620
think that's one of the first things

00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:50,020
that you can identify is is there this

00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:52,480
gulf do we have the data people in a

00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:54,640
black dark room somewhere and it's kind

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,550
of this magic in and out or are more

00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:59,770
people involved in this conversation

00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:02,230
then I talk about context this is your

00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:04,060
data dictionaries this is understanding

00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:05,890
if anyone has ever worked with data from

00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:08,680
the federal government you'll know that

00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:10,630
you get a data a you know dump from them

00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:12,850
whether it's a spreadsheet or whatever

00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:13,660
it is access to a database and there are

00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:18,940
these columns

00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:20,290
you know FS 37 2019 AG like what is this

00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,640
I have no context I have no

00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:23,260
understanding so a lot of times that

00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:26,590
data just gets dropped or ignored

00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:29,020
because no one has an understanding of

00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:31,480
it and so bringing the context with you

00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:34,420
wherever you go and trying to centralize

00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:37,030
that context in a single place so that

00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:39,250
the water cooler discussions the tribal

00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:41,050
knowledge that's gathered over time if

00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,730
these things can kind of be centralized

00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:45,100
and they're just as important as the

00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:46,810
data itself so I think that's kind of

00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,700
the other question and then like I said

00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:50,980
bringing this all together into a single

00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:52,600
source of truth you know this is the the

00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:55,540
data catalog movement is something

00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:57,040
that's big in the industry right now as

00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:58,540
people are looking at all of these

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,400
disparate data resources and how do we

00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:02,350
bring them into a single place you know

00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,820
that's what we like to play with but at

00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:05,320
the same time there's a lot of catalog

00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:07,110
vendors out there don't take my word for

00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:11,800
it

00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:13,510
moving on to data governance now I will

00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,730
say this that data governance isn't a

00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:18,940
dirty word like I pour a dirty term I

00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:20,440
guess I should change that a lot of

00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,420
people think about data governance as

00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:25,209
the red tape that gets in the way

00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:29,170
between me and my data and really if

00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:30,910
it's done well it shouldn't be that you

00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:33,250
know we should have the ability for data

00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:36,130
governance to maintain things like

00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:38,440
integrity and security but also promote

00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:42,190
things like availability and usability

00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:43,840
in a way that is coherent across the

00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:45,250
organization so it should establish a

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,900
good framework on how to

00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:50,410
use your data not get in the way of

00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:54,670
actually using it and then data literacy

00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:56,080
you know I think this is important again

00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:58,270
this goes back to that getting more

00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,800
people involved in the conversation you

00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:02,560
know I don't have to even be able to

00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:04,930
spell SQL but I should at least

00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:06,820
understand there are ways that I can

00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:08,710
interact with my data and my data team

00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:10,870
and other things like that without

00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:13,750
having to be super technical and we

00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:15,760
should provide avenues and resources to

00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:17,800
those in our organization you know and

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,210
you look at these big orgs like Airbnb

00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:23,170
or Warby Parker they're great examples

00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:26,050
of you know my receptionist knows my q4

00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:28,540
sale numbers because she can then tell

00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:30,040
people hey this model is selling better

00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:34,030
than that model as she talks to people

00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:37,840
and interviews people or you know our VP

00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:39,600
of Marketing can talk about her you know

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,730
she can talk about the sales numbers of

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,110
in the same way and say look you know

00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:46,210
now I can go out and tell the market

00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:47,350
this whereas one person is talking to an

00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:48,970
individual and the other person is

00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:50,680
talking to the market it's important for

00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:52,360
you to be able to understand the

00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:56,640
underlying data and how it relates to

00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:58,810
the business so data-driven leadership

00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,720
don't want to dive too deep into this

00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:05,290
one but a lot of times we will go into

00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:06,430
an organization and talk and that we're

00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:08,440
preaching to the choir when it comes to

00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:10,810
the practitioners they get it they're

00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:13,120
like yeah I know we have data silos it's

00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:16,450
a problem these edicts have been handed

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:18,550
down on high and it's mostly a lack of

00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:20,140
understanding but you know there's a lot

00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:22,990
of things that go into it and so I like

00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:24,580
to talk about one of the things that you

00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:27,280
can do when you go in and you want to

00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:30,310
establish or build your ability to be

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:33,010
data-driven is find the places where

00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:34,780
when you ask questions someone answers

00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:37,780
with the phrase that's the way we've

00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:39,040
always done it because that is the very

00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,690
first place that you should change

00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,490
something if that's the way you've

00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:43,720
always done it is probably a good

00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:45,010
indication that that's the problem the

00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,630
way you probably shouldn't do it any

00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:49,320
longer the world is changing and you

00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:51,070
need to evolve with it

00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,960
unfortunately you know change doesn't

00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:56,200
happen in a vacuum you know it needs to

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,820
be from ground up and top down so I

00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,300
think there's a lot of things that go

00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:01,160
into this but

00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:04,970
one of the dangers that we always

00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:07,730
caution our executive friends with is

00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:09,800
expert syndrome you've got an executive

00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:11,420
who goes to a conference and listens

00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,610
like to someone like me talk and

00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:15,230
suddenly decides that they have inferred

00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:18,470
the answers to all of the universe and

00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:21,860
that expert syndrome is really tough so

00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:23,450
you got to stay away from that so we

00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:25,640
talked about some data decision-making

00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:27,020
and I won't go too far into this but I

00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,780
think the biggest thing to walk away

00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:31,520
from is just knowing that there are

00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:34,580
questions that every person in your org

00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,890
can answer and being able to enable them

00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:39,520
to do so is important and don't just go

00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:41,990
build another dashboard like go ask

00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:44,390
specific purpose-built questions and

00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:45,440
find a way to answer them because most

00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:46,910
likely you're gonna learn something

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,140
along the way and you're gonna have a

00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:53,590
better answer when you come out the

00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:55,700
other side treating data like an asset

00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:58,520
historically most people have treated

00:20:55,700 --> 00:21:00,770
data like a cost center this is a thing

00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:03,050
that we have to pay to store but they

00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:05,270
don't think about what this means you

00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:07,580
know at the very best the most forward

00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:10,160
thinkers for years just treated data as

00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:12,710
a way to squeeze a little bit better

00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:15,080
efficiency out of some process you know

00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:17,360
how to operationalize that asset yeah ok

00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,500
we've kind of gotten there but sometimes

00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,690
you can turn your data into an

00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:23,480
additional revenue stream or even better

00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:25,880
yet and this is there's a book

00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:28,010
his name's Doug Laney and I'm the name

00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,600
of the book is escaping me but he talks

00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:31,640
about ways that you can use data to

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,700
barter as well and I think there's some

00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:37,400
really awesome potential in the market

00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:39,710
for that going on now let's get past

00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,630
some of this stuff breaking down silos

00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:43,850
you know I think you know we all know

00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:45,800
the restricted data silo this is the I

00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:47,690
can't use that data because it belongs

00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:50,330
to a different business unit but looking

00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:52,940
at dark data and unused data depending

00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:54,410
on whose study you look at up to 80% of

00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:56,750
data gathered by an organization it goes

00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:58,850
completely unused so I think it's just

00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:00,440
looking for what are we gathering do we

00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:02,690
need to gather it if we're gathering it

00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:04,340
we should use it and then dark data the

00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:06,230
stuff that lives on people's laptops and

00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:08,510
underneath their their desktops so take

00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:09,730
a look at those and then just ask

00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,809
questions

00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:16,120
and I won't go into thats pretty

00:22:10,809 --> 00:22:17,350
self-explanatory so I guess the last

00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,960
thing I want to make a point here I'm

00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:22,779
running low on time is just building

00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:25,149
your culture through practice so you

00:22:22,779 --> 00:22:26,740
want data access more collaboration

00:22:25,149 --> 00:22:28,179
we've talked about that data dictionary

00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:30,730
better definitions of your data better

00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:32,740
understanding human readable that's the

00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:34,990
most important part data literacy a

00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:37,539
workforce of people who use your data

00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:41,860
and data decisions so we're actually

00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:45,190
using data and not our visceral you know

00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:47,610
engagement with a problem to answer and

00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:51,250
business decisions so it's the idea of

00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:53,169
let data lead you there be data informed

00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:54,909
sometimes I like to say data driven is

00:22:53,169 --> 00:22:56,320
not necessarily the answer because you

00:22:54,909 --> 00:22:58,210
don't want the data to be doing the

00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,580
driving you want to be informed about it

00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:03,250
and with it but definitely should be

00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:05,799
using data and not your gut so I guess I

00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:07,179
will stop there and see if there are any

00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:11,789
questions but that is an hour-and-a-half

00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:11,789
