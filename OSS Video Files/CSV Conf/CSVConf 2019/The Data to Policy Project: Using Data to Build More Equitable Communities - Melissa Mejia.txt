Title: The Data to Policy Project: Using Data to Build More Equitable Communities - Melissa Mejia
Publication date: 2019-05-19
Playlist: CSVConf 2019
Description: 
	The Data to Policy Project (D2P) is an initiative creating meaningful learning experiences for students by using analysis of open data to generate equity and evidence-based policy proposals addressing local community needs. D2P is integrated into credit-bearing courses where students explore issues like policing and affordable housing in the Denver region. Over the course of a semester, students find, cite, clean, analyze, and visualize data to identify gaps or problems in policing or affordable housing, create policy proposals that address what they found, then create a research poster to communicate their findings. We encourage a critical approach to data literacy that questions the objectivity and neutrality of data and situate it in a socio-political context. The project culminates in a D2P Symposium where students present their research to their peers, faculty, staff, and community members. By focusing on student-initiated concerns and using real data to try and address them, D2P forms a connection between the courses students take and the communities they live in, increasing its meaning and impact. We also partner with local community organizations, governments, and nonprofits to identify and frame the research questions students explore. Our goal is to intentionally include community voices so that the research we work on is relevant, context-specific, and in the interest of the community it will impact. This presentation will communicate the challenges and benefits of this kind of work, how it can be replicated in other contexts, and invite feedback on how to improve the project.

hi welcome

00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:11,370
I am from data to policy project so I

00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:14,310
work out of the Auraria library which is

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:17,609
in Denver Colorado we are a sort of

00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:19,230
central campus in downtown that serves

00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:20,820
three institutions so we have two

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,419
universities one Community College on

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,339
campus and the Auraria library provides

00:00:24,419 --> 00:00:29,189
services for all three of those schools

00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:31,949
we do research support services

00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:33,570
institutional repository stuff data to

00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:36,270
management of visualization GIS

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,370
trainings for students and faculty so

00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:41,550
that's kind of how we ended up creating

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:43,649
this project and the project I'm going

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,420
to talk about is the data to policy

00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:48,120
project

00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:50,300
so essentially what happened is 2016 we

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,370
have two shootings of black men by

00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:55,589
police officers within a couple of days

00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:59,210
this is after a lot of attention has

00:00:55,589 --> 00:01:01,829
been raised about this because of

00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:04,339
information actually getting out on the

00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:06,600
internet and on YouTube basically

00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:07,979
because this is a central campus with a

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,450
really diverse student population

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:12,720
because of the multiple institutions

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,040
there was an event where students could

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,720
kind of talk about it and talk through

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,299
their feelings kind of create a

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,470
community where students could talk to

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,470
each other and what came out of it is

00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:24,210
that a lot of students wanted to do

00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,710
something and they had no idea what to

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,329
do they had no idea how to go about

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,470
creating change they didn't know where

00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:31,110
to look they didn't know what the tools

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:33,590
were and so out of that was born this

00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:37,500
idea of kind of finding a way to bring

00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:39,060
the tools to students and show them the

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,079
action steps that they could take to

00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:46,950
create change in their own communities

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:49,229
and really sorry' expose them to those

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,240
things empower them to use them give

00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:52,560
them an opportunity to try it out

00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,049
so that they could go out in the world

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,729
and actually do this themselves it was

00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:58,200
originally planned to be an independent

00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:00,840
study so that it could be super flexible

00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,189
and we realized right away that that put

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,700
a lot of limitations on who would be

00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:07,200
able to be involved in the project and

00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,869
so it went a different direction

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,569
integrating into courses which creates

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:14,280
its own issues which I will get to and

00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:15,569
we started with the focus on police

00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,630
crime obviously because of the

00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:21,840
inspiration we added affordable housing

00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:23,130
because of students sort of requesting

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,420
that that be a part of it I don't know

00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,920
how much people know about Denver we're

00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,569
going through aggressive gentrification

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,890
for the last ten years so a lot of

00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:30,989
students were asking if they could do

00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:34,170
projects around that so we've added that

00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:35,700
into so the project framework is

00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:39,959
essentially there's the two subject

00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:42,750
tracts and what we do is we sort of

00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:45,030
provide guidance provide these sort of

00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,860
tract instructions for students we

00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,560
provide rubrics to instructors who then

00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:52,080
are able to incorporate it into their

00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,640
existing curriculums and make it work

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,340
with whatever their subject matter is

00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,709
and how much time they have we also have

00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,120
a website where we have program

00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:01,769
information that's sort of a Center for

00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:06,120
the students who are taking part in it

00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:09,810
we provide the datasets there and then

00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,670
resources related to equity the local

00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:14,640
community questions the community has

00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:17,299
and how to present your work so things

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,549
like having a template for a

00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:22,799
professional scientific poster and then

00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:24,780
the data to policy team sort of curates

00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:27,000
and compiles the data from a lot of

00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,880
different resources we use entirely open

00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,200
data for this but it's being given to

00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,570
students who don't necessarily have

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,269
expertise so we make sure to curate it

00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:38,310
have it be accessible and that's all on

00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:40,829
our website and then it ends with a

00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:42,900
symposium where students are presenting

00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:44,310
their work the projects that they did

00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,609
the research their policy

00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:49,620
recommendations to their professors but

00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:52,440
also to people in the community we

00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:54,269
invite organizations we've tried to

00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:57,570
invite local government representatives

00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:59,100
with differing levels of success but

00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,500
giving them an opportunity to actually

00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:05,940
connect with people who can make these

00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:08,070
ideas happen and then we've also added a

00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:11,250
midpoint equity discussion because

00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:12,900
students were not really getting to

00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,640
think about that until the end when we

00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,709
got to the symposium and the panel

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,780
discussion and so we've added one in the

00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:21,060
middle so that students can really think

00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:22,979
about framing their policy

00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,810
recommendations with sort of equity

00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:27,870
local community considerations sort of

00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:30,930
from the beginning so benefit

00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:32,639
to the program specifically for math

00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:34,199
based courses it's connecting a lot of

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,330
the work that students are doing to

00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:39,330
tangible outcomes and impacts rather

00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:41,490
than just use a data sets that are

00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:44,220
perhaps for a certain outcome in your

00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:45,810
statistical model really understanding

00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,310
what that means what the numbers you're

00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:50,120
getting me and what the potential

00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:52,199
impacts of your analysis can be

00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,660
understanding equity and social justice

00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,310
a lot of the students that are in the

00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,479
more quantitative classes have never

00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:59,160
really had to think about that

00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:01,470
especially not in terms of their own

00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,169
classwork and how it is a factor in the

00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:06,840
work that they're doing as well and then

00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:08,580
understanding how to use data and the

00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,100
things that they already know how to do

00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:13,080
in order to address social issues that

00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,870
they maybe don't know that they have any

00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:18,900
power to influence or know how to

00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:21,000
approach and then for these more social

00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:24,479
science courses it's obviously promotion

00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,600
of data literacy understanding that data

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:30,419
is imperfect so really specifically what

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,849
we focus on is that data that they're

00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:35,250
going to be using is incomplete because

00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:39,330
of the way that it's collected and

00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:41,639
because the prioritization of what data

00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:43,800
is collected is influenced by the people

00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:46,200
who are doing the research or are in the

00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:49,560
government and asking for it and so it

00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:51,240
is influenced by human bias and that is

00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,919
not something that a lot of social

00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:56,039
science students have ever had to think

00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:59,550
about and so really understanding that

00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:02,430
it's a whole system and grounding their

00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:05,550
outcomes in data analysis so any sort of

00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:07,070
program or policy outcomes that social

00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,699
science students are thinking about

00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:10,199
understanding that those should be

00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:12,210
grounded in data to be effective and

00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:14,220
then how to also use data to evaluate

00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:16,580
their effectiveness after the fact and

00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:19,650
sort of have it be a cyclical process

00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:21,870
and then for all students it really

00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:25,620
grounds their academic experience and

00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:28,410
local community issues especially being

00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:30,210
a campus that's downtown being connected

00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:34,349
to the community in Denver is really

00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:37,219
important and it really breaks down the

00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:40,110
isolation of just being in an academic

00:06:37,219 --> 00:06:41,490
world when you're doing your work while

00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:43,050
you're in the middle of a city that's

00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:44,370
there a lot of change so it really is an

00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:46,169
opportunity for them to understand where

00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:49,169
they are and how they can influence

00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:50,580
their space it's obviously a huge

00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:53,069
opportunity for interdisciplinary

00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:55,530
coursework or working on pairing classes

00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:57,030
doing one quantitative and qualitative

00:06:55,530 --> 00:07:00,150
class together that so that students can

00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:02,940
support each other and then familiarity

00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:05,069
with open and real data has been a big

00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:07,349
one even students that are comfortable

00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:09,090
using data are comfortable doing

00:07:07,349 --> 00:07:11,370
statistical analysis have never had to

00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:13,650
deal with real datasets and incomplete

00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:14,970
datasets and the messy way that they're

00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:17,849
presented and having to deal with

00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:19,440
cleaning data and so that's been a huge

00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:20,580
thing that they now understand how to

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,430
use all of these skills that they were

00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:25,530
learning in the real world to do real

00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:28,680
work with the kind of data that they'll

00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:30,599
probably be receiving and then the

00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,009
community response has been really good

00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:35,880
it's been slowly building up we're just

00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:38,599
going into our second year participation

00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:42,270
and this has helped a lot of

00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:44,069
participating organizations think about

00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:47,300
the work that they're doing in a new way

00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:50,610
there's a lot of organizations or

00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:52,259
government agencies that have not really

00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:54,389
thought about implementing this kind of

00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:55,740
process into what they're doing it's

00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:57,770
kind of more of an intuitive

00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:00,780
decision-making

00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:02,070
specifically the Auraria Police

00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,840
Department so our campus Police

00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:06,570
Department has been super involved and

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,550
come to a lot of the symposiums and has

00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:10,530
really rethought the way that they're

00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:12,180
developing their programs has tried to

00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:15,150
recruit students to come and help them

00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:17,039
do some data analysis to make better

00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:18,840
decisions about how they approach the

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,250
work that they're doing on campus which

00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,810
is not something that they necessarily

00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:24,150
have the resources to do and now they

00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:25,949
know where to turn and like how they can

00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:27,150
get students involved in helping them do

00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:29,430
that

00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:31,640
it creates connections for students and

00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:34,050
for our local community organizations so

00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,909
hopefully not only getting students more

00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:37,529
involved in a lot of these organizations

00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:38,579
that they might care about that are

00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:40,709
related to the projects that they're

00:08:38,579 --> 00:08:42,719
working on but also supporting the

00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:44,700
organizations we're very careful to make

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,100
sure that it's a supportive relationship

00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,779
and not an exploitative relationship and

00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,400
that anybody who works with this project

00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:51,839
is getting something out of it that

00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,920
there's research that they couldn't do

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,480
that they're getting done now

00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:00,720
alright so I'm gonna go quickly now I

00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,519
have taken too long working challenges

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,540
working with municipal data is really

00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:08,459
hard it's really messy availability of

00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,199
local data is super varied between

00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:12,269
different municipalities because it's

00:09:10,199 --> 00:09:13,529
dictated by what people in the

00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:15,269
government decide is important to

00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:16,740
collect so there's a lot of holes

00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:18,420
there's a lot of stuff that's not there

00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,120
that provides the opportunity for

00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:23,009
students to identify those holes and

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,290
incorporate it in their projects but it

00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:27,060
definitely makes it harder we also have

00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:29,759
to curate it because there's such a

00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,779
range of experience with students making

00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:32,339
sure that there's stuff that people

00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:34,529
who've never looked at this before can

00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,790
use that's really simple for them to use

00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:37,290
and making sure that their stuff it's a

00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:41,819
little more challenging for some of the

00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:44,779
more advanced students integrating it

00:09:41,819 --> 00:09:47,189
into courses is its own thing we try to

00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:49,560
provide a lot of support for faculty

00:09:47,189 --> 00:09:50,970
making sure that it can work with their

00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,160
curriculum making sure that we are

00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:56,480
supporting recognizing that the faculty

00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:58,980
is usually in a position where they have

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,389
expertise in one area and we're asking

00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:02,250
them to introduce something that they're

00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:04,230
not necessarily familiar with so making

00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:06,899
sure we have the tools and the support

00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:08,579
and the trainings to help them walk

00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:10,470
students through either the statistical

00:10:08,579 --> 00:10:14,550
analysis or the policy side whichever

00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:15,920
they're less familiar with so I'm going

00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:18,809
to go through this quickly now

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,829
developing equitable policy has been a

00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:24,779
huge problem especially in the early

00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:26,220
stages when it was a lot of math classes

00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:28,439
and a lot of students that had never

00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,240
thought about equity in their work at

00:10:28,439 --> 00:10:33,930
all we were getting a lot of weird

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,670
policy suggestions and realized that we

00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:37,410
had to provide that framework and that

00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:41,189
scaffolding for people to understand the

00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:43,470
history of the social conditions in the

00:10:41,189 --> 00:10:46,519
community of the policy that existed of

00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:48,809
the influence that that policy had on

00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:51,449
the different communities so that they

00:10:48,809 --> 00:10:53,459
could have a better understanding of how

00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:55,110
to use these tools to address those

00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:57,300
issues and not sort of work in a vacuum

00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:58,529
of we found this and we think this so

00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,850
now we think that more people should get

00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:02,300
married

00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:02,300
and

00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:07,560
by figuring out what policy curtain

00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:09,209
currently exists was a really big one a

00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,890
lot of people were sort of guessing at

00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:12,540
policy and we realized we really need to

00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:15,860
make sure that we have an easy way for

00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:19,680
them to look at it and that's a really

00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:21,029
specific language to learn and a lot of

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,130
these students have never looked at an

00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:27,209
actual like local municipal policy

00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:28,770
before so creating buy-in is really

00:11:27,209 --> 00:11:30,930
important kind of what we talked about

00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:32,610
before making sure that communities

00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:34,709
understand that this is beneficial to

00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:37,320
them and not just a benefit to the

00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:39,029
students making sure that instructors

00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,500
understand that we will support them and

00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:41,730
that this can add an extra layer to the

00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,070
things that they're already doing rather

00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:45,930
than just being a burden on changing the

00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:47,730
way that they're teaching classes a

00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:50,490
tangible application of their skills

00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:52,010
hopefully getting students more

00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:54,120
interested in what they're doing

00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:55,890
understanding how they can really use

00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,620
this to change things in their lives and

00:11:55,890 --> 00:12:02,149
their communities and where they live

00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:04,800
and replicating the program is kind of

00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:07,140
the way that it was designed was to be a

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,970
local focus so it's intended to cater to

00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:11,240
whatever your local concerns are use

00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:14,220
local data whatever's available

00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:17,279
variations and availability provide an

00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:19,860
opportunity to talk about what would be

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:22,950
useful why that data doesn't exist who's

00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:25,440
deciding what data is collected and

00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:27,750
really so whatever is there and whatever

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,970
is not there still gets students to you

00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:34,589
think about data in this more nuanced

00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:36,209
way integrating it into courses versus

00:12:34,589 --> 00:12:37,850
doing an independent study it can kind

00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:41,970
of go either way

00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:46,260
it's super flexible it's designed to use

00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:47,640
the strengths of whatever discipline the

00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:49,230
students are used to in order to

00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,820
understand this new thing whether that

00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:52,920
be students who are comfortable with

00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:55,110
math or statistics or data now

00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,640
understanding social issues or students

00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:59,579
with social issues understanding how

00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:01,470
data influences those issues that

00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:03,720
they're used to talking about it's very

00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:07,110
flexible and going either way and it's

00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:10,920
really helpful in understanding how the

00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:12,910
whole thing works together and

00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:19,350
that question

00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:19,350
