Title: US Energy Data Liberation - Zane Selvans
Publication date: 2019-06-21
Playlist: CSVConf 2019
Description: 
	An alphabet soup of government agencies like FERC, EPA, EIA, PHMSA, MSHA and the ISOs and RTOs collect and publish terabytes of data about the US energy system. It includes operating costs and fuel consumption, hourly power output and GHG emissions, and the age and length of natural gas pipelines, the price of electricity every 5 minutes at thousands of nodes in the grid, coal production numbers and much much more. In theory all this data is public and freely available, but in practice it takes a lot of wrangling to make it usable for analysis. The result: it's packaged up by one or two platform monopolies that charge tens of thousands of dollars a year for easy access, excluding most non-corporate users. But for anyone interested in the ongoing transformation of our energy system and its climate impacts, this data is a treasure trove worth excavating. The Public Utility Data Liberation project (https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl) has been working for the last 2.5 years to liberate this data and make it freely accessible to activists, data journalists, and researchers working on US climate and energy policy. This talk will take a look at what the data is, where it comes from, why it's interesting, how we're processing it and making it available, and some of the challenges we're facing and opportunities we see ahead.

okay so my name is Dane Sullivan's and I

00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:11,290
am the chief data Wrangler or vaakya or

00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:14,620
Dave at those for catalyst cooperative

00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:17,650
and I'm going to talk about public

00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:19,600
utility datasets in the u.s. mostly

00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:22,810
related to electricity but more

00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,070
generally for energy and I definitely

00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:26,440
want to acknowledge my partner in crime

00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:28,690
who's not here with us today Cristina

00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,730
Gosnell who has really been a co-equal

00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:33,039
partner in this process for more than

00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:35,620
five years and she's actually the

00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:37,899
president of our little employee-owned

00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:42,729
consulting co-op so you can follow us

00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:44,469
both so I came I came to this work from

00:00:42,729 --> 00:00:46,600
kind of a weird place I always I think

00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:48,699
it's a weird place I I used to work on

00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,350
space exploration and I went to grad

00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:53,589
school originally because I wanted to

00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:55,120
terraform Mars I read some science

00:00:53,589 --> 00:00:56,499
fiction books by Kim Stanley Robinson it

00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,739
was like that I'm gonna do that screw

00:00:56,499 --> 00:01:02,019
this boring tech job in Silicon Valley

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:03,549
and I you know successfully got in and

00:01:02,019 --> 00:01:05,260
started working with NASA data and ended

00:01:03,549 --> 00:01:06,730
up you know working on Mars working on

00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,860
the icy moons of the outer solar system

00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:11,650
and then I took an atmospheric physics

00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:13,150
class and realized that actually we were

00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:14,620
already involved in a terraforming

00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:18,310
project it was just on the wrong planet

00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:20,050
and also in the wrong direction and I

00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:22,360
kind of had a meltdown and decided that

00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:22,900
after finishing my PhD and like a pit of

00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,580
despair

00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:27,790
I wanted to actually work on addressing

00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:30,550
this problem so I went into climate and

00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:32,890
energy policy after graduating since

00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:35,950
you're here I assume that you also like

00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:38,200
data and probably also live on earth and

00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:43,570
you know may have an interest in similar

00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:44,980
topics so data people when we talk today

00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,780
to people they often think like wow you

00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,830
know a lot about electricity and when we

00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,990
talk to electricity people they're like

00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:52,510
wow you know a lot about data but really

00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:55,390
we're we're just stubborn amateurs on

00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:56,980
both sides and that combination is

00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:58,659
valuable it doesn't seem like there's a

00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:01,150
lot of people that are aware of like the

00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:04,360
policy and advocacy universe and also

00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:06,700
the kind of data and coding universe so

00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,229
we're trying trying desperately to come

00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:11,109
bring these two groups together so I'm

00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:12,909
what I'm hoping we and maybe you will

00:02:11,109 --> 00:02:14,670
get out of this talk is we want more

00:02:12,909 --> 00:02:16,590
data people to

00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,599
understand what energy and electricity

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,370
data there is so that we have more

00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:21,630
people kind of informed and playing with

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,630
it and doing interesting things with it

00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:28,110
and we also want to get more activists

00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:30,420
and policy involved people literate with

00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:32,220
the huge data sets that exist and that

00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,480
could help inform their work so I'm very

00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,739
interested to talk to somebody from the

00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,380
carpentry is about setting up another

00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:39,330
domain-specific kind of track for this

00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:43,650
kind of basic literacy for working with

00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:46,459
data we also really need help it's blank

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:50,310
yes it's supposed to be blank yep

00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:52,350
just so you know stripes we also need a

00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:53,459
lot of help telling these stories and we

00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,200
haven't been able to make any good

00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:57,299
connections with data journalists yet

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,160
that want to work with data on energy

00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:00,390
and climate stories so if anybody you

00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,730
know has connections like that we would

00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:04,890
love love to know more so I don't know

00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:06,299
does anybody recognize these stripes do

00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:09,930
people know what this is and this is a

00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:12,480
color-coded time series of the average

00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:15,959
global temperature on earth

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,870
starting from 1850 on the far side to

00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,730
the present on this side so it really

00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:23,609
there's some crazy stuff happening right

00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:25,500
now and I periodically feel as if I am a

00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:27,989
space explorer who has been marooned on

00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:31,400
a planet with you know a civilization

00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:33,420
that doesn't know what it's doing and

00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:37,440
then I talked about humans in the third

00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:39,120
person so this is from Edie Hawkins and

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,910
the climate lab book and he has lots of

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,320
great graphics really did this so who

00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:46,320
here has been to a public utility

00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:48,120
commission meeting or hearing oh my god

00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,489
that's great that's usually the answer

00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:54,180
is zero this so this is where the magic

00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:56,730
happens in the US as far as deciding

00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:58,500
what our energy system looks like it

00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:00,000
looks like a bunch of lawyers because it

00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,739
is a bunch of lawyers and it's a

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,819
basically a court a court room like

00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:06,989
proceeding in which typical utilities

00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:08,579
come in and say we want to build these

00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:10,530
things we think people use this much

00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:11,940
energy and we think we should make 11

00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,769
percent return on the you know billion

00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:16,019
dollars are going to invest and you get

00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:18,180
a very adversarial kind of conversation

00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:21,120
with you know discovery collecting data

00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:24,000
making cases against each other and that

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,260
the utilities really have a very very

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,390
unfair advantage here and they have a

00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,740
huge information asymmetry they have all

00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:30,259
of the

00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:33,080
information about their system they have

00:04:30,259 --> 00:04:34,819
all the resources in the world to throw

00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,800
at it so every proceeding will typically

00:04:34,819 --> 00:04:38,740
have its own team of attorneys that

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,960
doesn't have to work on anything else

00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:43,550
whereas on the advocate side you know

00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,169
you're probably working for some scrappy

00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,699
nonprofit or maybe in the public sector

00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:49,460
and and maybe you know there are eight

00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:51,139
proceedings going on simultaneously in

00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:53,060
conversation with the same utility and

00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:54,229
they have eight attorneys on every one

00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,300
of those a proceedings and you have the

00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:58,520
same attorney who sleeps on a couch in a

00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:01,240
basement who's trying to like coordinate

00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:03,830
all of those things from the other side

00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:06,560
so this this asymmetry really leads to

00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:09,530
some problems as far as the equity and

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,699
you know you know reasonableness of the

00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:12,199
decisions that get made sometimes

00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:13,639
because the PUC you know they're

00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:15,139
actually they're not often they're are

00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:18,080
not domain experts in this and they

00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:21,139
certainly aren't you know fully briefed

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:23,180
on the opaque models the proprietary

00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:24,560
data that's being used to make the case

00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,060
from the utilities point of view and

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,830
when they get some like you know

00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,270
wild-eyed hippies on one side and a

00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:30,830
bunch of suits from the utility on the

00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:32,000
other side with apparently all the data

00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,310
and the expert witness is getting paid

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,500
$500 an hour to testify they typically

00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:37,820
like the utility probably knows what

00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,469
it's talking about we're gonna go with

00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:43,759
their suggestion you know and what could

00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:44,750
possibly go wrong so these are some of

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,969
the things that can go wrong this is

00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:48,440
just in the last couple of years and you

00:05:46,969 --> 00:05:51,020
you can see we're not talking about

00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:53,719
chump change here this is real money you

00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:55,550
know South Carolina has has decided to

00:05:53,719 --> 00:05:56,870
just totally bail on a nuclear plant

00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:59,750
nine billion dollars in the hole

00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:01,639
literally there is this the you know the

00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:03,560
first kind of at scale carbon capture

00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:06,139
and sequestration plant in the deep

00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,180
south seven and a half billion dollars

00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:10,789
they totally scrapped it and they're now

00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:13,130
being sued by the DOJ for fraudulent use

00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:15,020
of federal loan guarantees and these are

00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:16,370
you know these are spectacular failures

00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:18,380
where they're actually getting some

00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:20,060
comeuppance and in South Carolina

00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:22,460
typically a fairly conservative state

00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:24,409
the legislature wants to rip the face

00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,880
off of the CEO of that company and

00:06:24,409 --> 00:06:27,560
they're actually gonna you know there

00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,449
will be consequences but this is a

00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,069
typical you know usually they get away

00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:32,389
with it they you know convince the PUC

00:06:31,069 --> 00:06:34,039
that what they want to build is a

00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:35,599
reasonable thing they pass the cost

00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:36,979
through the ratepayers and you know

00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:38,779
these nine billion dollars seven billion

00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:40,190
dollar piles of infrastructure are what

00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:45,620
you're paying for and you're you're

00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:47,450
bill so we're never gonna be like I

00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,010
doubt that we'll ever be able to produce

00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:50,900
data and models that are on par with

00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:52,310
what the utilities have but I don't

00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:54,680
think that that actually matters

00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,760
so who recognizes these guys anybody

00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,750
recognize this I'm probably gonna beat

00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:05,120
myself here but this is hank paulson the

00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:07,310
Treasury secretary under bush ii and he

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:11,480
presided over the the mortgage implosion

00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:14,210
a decade or more ago and you know with

00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:15,650
the incompetence did he not understand

00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:17,930
how markets work

00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:20,630
no he understand very well how markets

00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:22,820
work because he's also hank paulson CEO

00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:24,200
of goldman sachs the problem here isn't

00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,640
that he didn't know what he was doing

00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,070
the problem is that his interests and

00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:30,650
motivations and affiliations and you

00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:32,960
know is really allegiance was maybe not

00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:35,300
to the public interest so you can be the

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,500
best in the world at what you do and if

00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,030
you're you know you have the wrong

00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,980
incentives the wrong motives or the

00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:41,840
wrong interests it doesn't matter how

00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,430
competent you are and conversely you

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,710
know if you get people in the room with

00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:48,140
the right incentives and you know at

00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:49,850
least a little bit of material to work

00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:51,440
with you can make real change and I'll

00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:53,300
go through some examples of that later

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,560
on places where this has been successful

00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,419
or where it could be successfully in the

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,760
future

00:07:56,419 --> 00:08:00,110
so our origin story you know we we all

00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,370
started this tiny little nonprofit

00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:04,070
called clean energy action it was

00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:05,780
basically unstaffed and we got very

00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:11,360
familiar with the Colorado utility

00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:13,550
landscape and as a result of that we

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,890
were invited to help with a foundation

00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:17,510
project to understand the finances of

00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:18,980
their coal plants and it went well you

00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:20,330
know we understood you know how much it

00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:22,010
cost to generate electricity from the

00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:23,480
coal plants it was clear that it was

00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:26,240
more expensive than building new rural

00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:28,130
facilities and the foundation which for

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,450
some reason wants to remain nameless was

00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:31,640
like that's great do more of that we'd

00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:33,380
like to do 10 or 15 more utilities but

00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:37,070
we had scraped all of that data by hand

00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:38,539
from PDFs and from crappy spreadsheets

00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:41,659
and were like ooh there's no way we're

00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:43,580
not doing that by hand we'd rather just

00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:44,960
do it generally for all of the data for

00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:47,300
all of the uses that anybody might want

00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:49,640
to you know use this for and it seemed

00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,690
like at the time a kind of brazen act of

00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,399
hubris that would be about the same

00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:56,190
amount of work

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:57,810
so the nonprofit that we were working

00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:59,399
for they're like yeah that doesn't

00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:01,500
that's not grassroots enough it seems

00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:03,510
kind of arcane we're not really into

00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,010
that but there was a seventy thousand

00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,480
dollar grant on the table to do it and

00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:08,010
were like well we would like to do that

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,950
so we're going to spin off our own

00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:13,050
little thing that's called catalyst to

00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:15,029
do this work on our own and so that was

00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,890
our first kind of foray into trying to

00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:20,300
rectify all of this horrible data and

00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,300
what's my time I didn't start the timer

00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:28,830
okay great great so yeah so we're really

00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:31,980
a pile of activists that have you know

00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:33,660
self familiarize er with the policy

00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,640
universe and also with the data universe

00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:42,120
and the tools that are necessary to work

00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:43,440
with the data and so now I want to talk

00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,399
a little bit about what is the data you

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,890
know where does it come from

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,810
what's inside there why is it maybe

00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:50,459
interesting and something that people

00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:52,649
should be paying attention to in plane

00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:53,880
with so most of the data we work with

00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:56,610
comes from the federal government from

00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,920
these different agencies and this is

00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:00,029
like scattered all across the the huge

00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,570
government bureaucracy I've got the

00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:05,910
Department of Interior which controls

00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:09,570
both EPA and Bureau of Reclamation which

00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:11,250
does a lot of hydro projects PHMSA which

00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:13,290
probably nobody's heard heard of is the

00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,580
pipelines and houses materials Safety

00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:17,700
Administration part of the Department of

00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:19,320
Transportation yeah a and FERC the

00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,400
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission

00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,260
those are both part of the Department of

00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,459
Energy we've got the Department of Labor

00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,310
with the mining Safety and Health

00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:27,959
Administration and the castle in the

00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:29,100
corner is the Army Corps of Engineers

00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:32,310
Department of War

00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:34,140
I mean defense and you know together

00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:36,450
these agencies have mandates legal

00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:39,390
mandates typically to publish vast

00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:42,150
quantities of data and you know they do

00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:43,829
that but often the mandates are not

00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:45,510
specific enough to really make sure that

00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:48,420
the data comes out in a way that anybody

00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:50,670
wants to use it or is able to use it and

00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:52,920
that's very frustrating but a really

00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:54,390
nice thing about this is it's all public

00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,589
domain anything that comes from the

00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:57,750
federal government you can just do

00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:59,370
whatever you want with it's it's yours

00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,480
yours to play with if you can get it out

00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:05,079
of the box

00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:07,750
there are other big sources of data too

00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:09,220
this is a map of the ISO s and RT O's

00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:11,079
which are the independent system

00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:13,329
operators and regional transmission

00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:15,459
operators or regional transmission

00:11:13,329 --> 00:11:17,230
organizations these are the people the

00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:20,829
organizations that run the grid in the

00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:22,899
the colored areas here and typically

00:11:20,829 --> 00:11:24,490
they operate in places with competitive

00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:25,720
markets where you know at least in

00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:27,490
theory the people are generating

00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,990
electricity are competing with each

00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:33,639
other to do that cheaply and efficiently

00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:36,610
the the beige areas are a mix of kind of

00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:38,290
traditional monopolies where you have as

00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:40,720
in Colorado where we started doing this

00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:42,490
work somebody with a government mandate

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,260
to provide electricity and a basically a

00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:45,430
guaranteed rate of return and there are

00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:47,230
all kinds of interesting problems that

00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:49,120
come along with that model or Public

00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:50,560
Power agencies like in the Pacific

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,740
Northwest the Bonneville Power Authority

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,690
and in Tennessee got the Tennessee

00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:58,649
Valley Authority these kind of almost

00:11:55,690 --> 00:12:00,610
depression-era large public power

00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:02,199
associations that are truly public

00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:05,470
entities so their data is often quite

00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:07,360
clean and very accessible but the IFOS

00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:11,920
are not govern they're kind of quasi

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:13,720
governmental they don't really land in

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,120
the public sector so they have their all

00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,470
have their own licensing requirements it

00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,390
can be very challenging to get them to

00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:21,070
agree to let you kind of officially do

00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:23,050
stuff with their data but it's all it's

00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:25,660
all available it's online it's is there

00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:28,839
via api's and it's terabytes of

00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:31,480
information so you know these people

00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:33,430
publish every five minutes the prices

00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,949
and a bunch of other interesting

00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:37,930
attributes about electricity at about

00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:39,910
13,000 different locations across the

00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:41,440
u.s. so that that piles up very very

00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:43,420
quickly and also gives it kind of an

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,649
insanely detailed picture of what is

00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:47,500
going on with the electricity system

00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:48,610
day-in day-out every five minutes how

00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,870
much does it cost how much is going to

00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:51,130
cost tomorrow how much does it cost how

00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,810
much is it gonna cost tomorrow who's

00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:53,980
producing what kind of power they

00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:56,260
producing where is it coming from

00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,680
where's their congestion all that kind

00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,329
of stuff

00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,310
and I wanted to just note like a little

00:12:58,329 --> 00:13:04,360
bit about the data sets that these folks

00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:05,560
produce so CIA is kind of a creature of

00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,399
the Carter Administration and does a

00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,740
pretty good job

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,510
it loves Excel spreadsheets almost

00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:12,160
everything is in the Excel spreadsheet

00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:14,230
and they change format

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,940
every year every year has a different

00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:19,569
Excel spreadsheet format and they have

00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:21,069
like 15 tabs and no any values and like

00:13:19,569 --> 00:13:22,029
all of the wonderful fun things that I'm

00:13:21,069 --> 00:13:24,759
sure everybody in there was dealt with

00:13:22,029 --> 00:13:28,779
at some point but they're they're the

00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:32,850
good KITT so FERC FERC is is especially

00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:35,379
FERC form one it's just it's an archaic

00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:38,230
DBF file format so it's a binary

00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:39,579
database format that is undocumented you

00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,839
know they don't give you a schema for

00:13:39,579 --> 00:13:42,670
like what the database looks like what

00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:45,100
the name of the columns are we wrote a

00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:47,439
scraper that greps the binary files for

00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,449
Strings so that you can you know then

00:13:47,439 --> 00:13:52,269
associate the the names of the columns

00:13:49,449 --> 00:13:54,250
with the data that's in them but it

00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:55,750
works and we actually had somebody

00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,509
working with who had been nominated by

00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:00,100
Obama to be the chair of FERC who is

00:13:58,509 --> 00:14:02,410
like oh my god you have the form one

00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:05,139
data I've always wanted to access it you

00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:06,579
know so the the potential chair of FERC

00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:08,350
who is a former regulator in Colorado

00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:11,889
couldn't access the FERC form one data

00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:13,600
so you know that's ridiculous on the one

00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:15,069
hand but on the other hand like once you

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,779
break that out you're the only one has

00:14:15,069 --> 00:14:18,850
it at least in the Civic sphere and

00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:22,959
people are very very excited to get

00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:24,220
access to it finally CIA gives a lot of

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,029
information this is a lot of financial

00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,189
information

00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:28,509
eeew a has a lot of financial

00:14:27,189 --> 00:14:30,759
information also some operational

00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:32,410
information you know about coal plants

00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:33,670
or you know all kinds of power plants

00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:35,380
where do they get their fuel from how

00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:38,170
much it cost how much electricity do

00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:41,199
they generate that kind of stuff the

00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:42,550
pensa data is the stuff that we're in

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,860
students about natural gas pipelines

00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:46,000
they you know every every year they get

00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,470
a report from all of the national gas

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,569
utilities about where are the pipelines

00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:51,459
how long are the pipelines what are they

00:14:49,569 --> 00:14:54,339
made of how old are they so you can you

00:14:51,459 --> 00:14:55,720
can you know guess at when the

00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:56,860
pipeline's will need to be replaced and

00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,899
if you don't want to replace them

00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:00,790
because that's a you know climate

00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:02,259
changing piece of infrastructure you

00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:06,550
know what your kind of timeline on that

00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:08,439
is the Bureau of frac and the Army Corps

00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:12,759
are all about hydro from our point of

00:15:08,439 --> 00:15:14,800
view and then MSHA has data on mine

00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:15,730
production and safety stuff so that's

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,170
interesting and a bunch of different

00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:19,209
cutters and there's also a lot of

00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:21,910
economic information in here about what

00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:23,949
communities will be impacted by changes

00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:24,670
in the energy systems like people that

00:15:23,949 --> 00:15:26,860
depend on my

00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:28,630
depend on power plants for the tax

00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:30,640
revenue for their County and it's like

00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:31,750
90 percent of the property tax revenue

00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,580
for the county and they will implode

00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,840
when you shut down the coal plant which

00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:36,820
is important from a political point of

00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:40,750
view and also a kind of a human decency

00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:43,350
point of view oh and just the scale of

00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:45,640
this like altogether there are there

00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:48,190
billions of Records you know maybe it's

00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,360
10 billion maybe it's it's probably on

00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:51,040
the order of 10 billion records between

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,560
all of us and several terabytes of data

00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,240
between all of it so it's not I don't

00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,440
know if it's really big data it's kind

00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,560
of medium sized data it's definitely

00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:02,470
annoying to work with on a laptop and

00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:04,900
once we kind of integrated the first 100

00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:07,030
gigabyte data set were like and this is

00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:09,790
not going to be a laptop thing anymore

00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:12,700
what do we do and had to start exploring

00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:14,080
out of memory computation and other

00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:16,720
things that we really still don't have

00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:18,760
any idea about or you know if you don't

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,640
want to deal with all of that you know

00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:24,460
difficult tedious data munging you can

00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:27,160
go to S&P global which will you know for

00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:29,380
$20,000 a year give you a subscription

00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,940
to a terminal that has most of that data

00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:32,230
and they've done clean up and they've

00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:34,330
interpolate it and filled in blank

00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:36,520
values and it's you know relatively easy

00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:38,560
to use but aimed at kind of a Wall

00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,810
Street market so it's not even

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,700
necessarily the right thing for

00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:44,740
advocates to use or policymakers you and

00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:46,240
also it's totally opaque like they don't

00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:47,860
give you any information about how they

00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,720
clean the data or what their model was

00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:53,800
for interpolating or filling in those

00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:55,420
n/a values so you know and they have a

00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,220
very traditional platform monopoly

00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:59,500
business model and every time a new

00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:01,810
small start-up is founded to kind of do

00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,550
the same thing they buy them and they've

00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:05,079
been very successful in the North

00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:07,180
American market I just pretty much

00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:14,110
completely controlling access to this

00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:15,910
information okay so what what can we do

00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:18,220
with this data if it's available and

00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:21,100
usable in the public interest what kinds

00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:23,920
of things are possible so does anybody

00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:25,920
recognize this damn probably not if this

00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:30,490
is a local project so this is the lower

00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:31,780
Snake River so it's I don't know it's in

00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:33,850
this state or but you know it's it's

00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:34,900
flowing into the Columbia and you know

00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:36,160
several years ago there were people

00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,690
being like you know do we really need

00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,240
these dams we'd like to restore the

00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,340
salmon

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,770
and maybe some of them should be removed

00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:44,210
and the utility was like no no no you

00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,679
can't remove the dam we need the dams

00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:48,230
the dams are very important and they

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,700
produce three gigawatts of power you

00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:51,080
know and to replace that with another

00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,190
carbon tree power source would be very

00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,620
expensive you wouldnt want to do that

00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:56,240
and typically in a utility commission

00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:58,010
they'd be like well I guess we can't

00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,400
replace the dams or take them out it's

00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:03,140
too bad but Northwest what segal

00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,179
Northwest Energy Coalition actually had

00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:08,030
data from the Bonneville Power Authority

00:18:05,179 --> 00:18:10,340
in this case and they they could see the

00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:11,809
generation that the dam had put out for

00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,550
you know a decade or more

00:18:11,809 --> 00:18:15,050
and they and they it was clear that this

00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:17,030
is a bluff on the part of the utility

00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:18,559
which is a public entity so I'm not

00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,670
totally sure what the incentives are

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:23,150
there that make them want to keep the

00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:24,170
dams in place but the dam on average

00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:25,960
over the course of the year only

00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:30,650
generates about one gigawatt of power

00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:32,540
and you know in reality when when the

00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:35,690
Northwest needs the power when the power

00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:37,010
is is demand is high and supply is low

00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:39,380
because there's so much hydro up here

00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:43,190
it's only generating 500 megawatts so

00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:45,290
you know a factor of a factor of 6

00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:47,420
different really functionally from what

00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:49,340
the utility was saying and you know so

00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:51,220
this kicked off a whole like new

00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:53,750
environmental impact statement process

00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:55,640
just and like how many bytes are there

00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:58,670
in the data that they use to make that

00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:00,200
case you know for not maintaining

00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:01,780
infrastructure that costs a quarter of a

00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,550
billion dollars a year just to maintain

00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:06,250
and instead to explore you know other

00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:07,880
zero-carbon

00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,890
opportunities in the Pacific Northwest

00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,720
you know it was a you know a megabyte or

00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:13,340
a couple of megabytes of data and that

00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,350
they happen to have access to because it

00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:19,130
was published as a CSV file by a public

00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:23,000
agency that cares about data another

00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:26,980
example so this is the thing that we

00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,120
started working on okay five minutes

00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:32,059
which is you know looking at the

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:34,670
economics of coal plants in Colorado in

00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:36,860
2013 we realized you know based on data

00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:38,420
that the utility had submitted that the

00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:40,070
coal plants were no longer economic so

00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:41,570
at that point we didn't have to argue

00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:43,010
with the utility we could just be like

00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:45,020
hey look the thing that you already

00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:46,610
submitted says the more renewable energy

00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:48,800
you add the cheaper the electricity gets

00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:51,800
so that was a relatively easy case to

00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:53,870
make we still in win

00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:56,420
but it did inspire people to get

00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:58,040
involved in like trying to more

00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:00,980
quantitatively make these cases and

00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:04,610
change the utilities mind and finally

00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:06,980
you know six years later just last

00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:09,980
Friday the Colorado Legislature finally

00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:11,950
passed a bill that will allow these coal

00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:14,750
plants to be refinanced and shut down

00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:16,250
you know very early and also some very

00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:18,050
aggressive climate goals and we've been

00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:20,930
kind of providing data to the people

00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:22,280
doing the analysis behind this for for

00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:24,950
like five years so it's very gratifying

00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:30,560
to finally finally see something work

00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:33,620
out politically this is complicated I'm

00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:35,270
gonna skip it another another kind of

00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:38,920
project that we're kind of interested in

00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:41,240
doing going forward is the EPA data says

00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:43,850
how much power every power plant

00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:47,210
produced every hour for the last 20

00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:49,370
years so you can look at and this is a

00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:52,190
graph of a particular power plant put

00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:54,290
together by Joe Daniels and the blue is

00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:55,880
profitable the red is not so profitable

00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:57,680
the yellow is startup and shutdown costs

00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,060
and you can see like they're operating

00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,440
in the profitable regime and then

00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,550
occasionally not but that's because they

00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:06,020
have these these startup and shutdown

00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:08,540
costs but if you were to put a renewable

00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:10,760
energy source in the same location on

00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:12,920
the grid the generated power at zero

00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,660
marginal cost so like every additional

00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,430
kilowatt hour is free because that's

00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:18,410
what we renewables typically work and

00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:20,000
you you made it compete with these power

00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:21,830
plants when they would be profitable

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,740
maybe you could force them offline

00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:27,980
purely economically by strategically

00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:30,370
locating renewables nearby and that's

00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:33,070
that's interesting because then opens up

00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:36,110
transmission capacity which is a

00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:38,450
limiting factor for many you know places

00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:39,620
now as renewables get get cheaper and

00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:45,200
cheaper it's not cost it's like well

00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:46,610
what are we connected to so you know

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,410
there's there's these terabytes of data

00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:49,970
we're trying to break them out and put

00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:52,970
them into the you know real functional

00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:54,470
public domain and even if we're

00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:57,590
successful at that which you know

00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:59,600
hopefully we will be over time this

00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:01,610
problem isn't going away like it's only

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,220
going to get more complicated

00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:04,710
the

00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:06,480
is that the amount of data that's

00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:09,030
necessary to run the electricity system

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,530
is growing exponentially because you

00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,640
have people installing batteries because

00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:14,070
you have electric vehicles charging you

00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,419
have dispatchable demand for electricity

00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:17,880
where the utility can be like no no

00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:19,679
don't consume now okay now consume and

00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,720
instead of having a few thousand

00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,419
entities nationwide that are trading

00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,370
electricity and and putting it onto the

00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:28,049
grid you might not with a few million or

00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:30,929
even you know if it's at the device

00:22:28,049 --> 00:22:32,580
level a billion devices in the US that

00:22:30,929 --> 00:22:33,659
are interacting with the power system

00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:36,390
and the markets that have been

00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:38,039
constructed to serve the power system

00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:42,330
and you know that that's going to be

00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:44,039
truly truly large data and they're

00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:45,330
starting to roll out kind of trials of

00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:48,240
this kind of stuff so there's a group at

00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:51,780
Berkeley that's been deploying sensors

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:53,549
that take two measurements or 120

00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:56,490
measurements every second so twice the

00:22:53,549 --> 00:23:00,179
frequency of the kind of AC circuits and

00:22:56,490 --> 00:23:01,200
they can do things like when I'm sure

00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:02,760
you're all aware of the fires in

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,280
California due to a PG&E and some other

00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:08,730
power line failures the system can sense

00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:10,830
that there is a broken wire and before

00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:13,350
the wire has hit the ground it can de

00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:15,030
energize the line and it can it knows

00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:16,890
that it's broken and it can you know

00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:18,780
prevent that fire from starting because

00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:22,140
it's you know at 120 Hertz it's checking

00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:24,840
in on the system and yeah that's a huge

00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:26,370
huge amount of data and you know people

00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,679
are working on how to visualize that and

00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:30,960
the markets that are built around this

00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:32,970
are there gonna be another opportunity

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,500
for a different kind of electricity

00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:36,480
monopoly a different kind of platform

00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:39,840
monopoly if we don't really do a much

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,309
better job at understanding what data

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,640
should be public how it should be

00:23:41,309 --> 00:23:47,640
publicized and and how people can work

00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:49,230
and should be working with it so we're

00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,490
hopeful that this this project will lead

00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:52,169
into you know kind of a deeper

00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:54,929
discussion about the future of energy

00:23:52,169 --> 00:23:57,360
data electricity data and how we can

00:23:54,929 --> 00:24:01,799
avoid that kind of captive environment

00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:03,539
in the future and I'm out of time so I'm

00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:05,520
going to skip these kind of pipeline

00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:09,450
questions this is our original pipeline

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:11,070
mess pandas Postgres Jupiter but it

00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:12,820
turns out everybody just wants to

00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:14,560
download a CSV

00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:19,570
advanced and beginning users so

00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:20,560
eventually we went to mass pandas now

00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:23,200
we're starting to implement data

00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:30,340
packages instead and then like okay

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:32,230
whatever you want okay 30 seconds and

00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:34,380
thank you to all the organizations that

00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:38,529
have supported us

00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:38,529
