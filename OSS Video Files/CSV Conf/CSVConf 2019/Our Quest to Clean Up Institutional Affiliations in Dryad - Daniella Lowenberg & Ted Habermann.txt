Title: Our Quest to Clean Up Institutional Affiliations in Dryad - Daniella Lowenberg & Ted Habermann
Publication date: 2019-05-19
Playlist: CSVConf 2019
Description: 
	Data publications and other scholarly outputs do not have clean information on institutional affiliations for researchers. This is caused by a mix of not asking researchers for this information up front, as well as incomplete metadata being submitted by repositories to DataCite and (publications to) Crossref. Without this standardized information we can't properly report on or provide statistics on deposits, usage metrics, or reach by institution. Join us for a session about our work using OpenRefine, organizational identifiers (ROR), and some manual sleuthing to update and improve Dryad institutional metadata for 25,000 data publications.
