Title: Qualitative Research Using Open Source Tools - Beth Duckles & Vicky Steeves
Publication date: 2019-05-19
Playlist: CSVConf 2019
Description: 
	Qualitative research has long suffered from a lack of free tools for analysis, leaving no options for researchers without significant funds for software licenses. This presents significant challenges for equity. This panel discussion will explore the first two free/libre open source qualitative analysis tools out there: qcoder (R package) and Taguette (desktop application). Drawing from the diverse backgrounds of the presenters (social science, library & information science, software engineering), we will discuss what openness and extensibility means for qualitative research, and how the two tools we've built facilitate equitable, open sharing.

	00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:06,480
my name is Beth chuckles this is Vicki

00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:08,820
Steve's I'm a sociologist Vicki is an

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,800
academic librarian and here we're here

00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:14,730
to talk about qualitative research using

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,770
open source tools start off just with

00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,590
the basics of what is qualitative data

00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:22,380
analysis to dive right into it so this

00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,900
is a way of collecting organizing and

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,260
interpreting typically textual data

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,520
although sometimes visual data as well

00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:32,700
everything from interview transcripts

00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:34,650
public documents focus groups open-ended

00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,440
survey questions anything like that I'm

00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:40,170
a close reading of this polity of data

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,470
researchers then assigned codes to the

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:45,960
text and the themes or things that come

00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:48,390
out and relevant quotes come out of the

00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:52,890
data it's a very iterative process so

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:54,870
folks who do this are often from doing

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,000
this over multiple times so they might

00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,610
do it and work a little bit more on the

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,730
codes that they're creating and keep

00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:04,620
going as they read more of the analysis

00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:07,440
here's what it's not and this I say this

00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:09,409
because a lot of times folks get

00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,790
confused about what qualitative data is

00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:13,650
anything that you can press a button and

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,060
it comes back and it gives you an answer

00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,710
is not going to be qualitative data

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,110
analysis there's cool things that it

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,330
tells you but you have to do a lot of

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:24,180
the work and the analysis oneself the

00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:26,360
person who's doing the research this is

00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:29,280
not word counts it's not word clouds

00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:31,470
it's not machine learning or text mining

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,360
key word abstractions sentiment analysis

00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,770
those are all great I really support

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,290
them and want more of that

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:40,950
but qualitative analysis isn't any of

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:43,049
those things or data analysis artificial

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,229
intelligence predictive learning it's

00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:46,870
also not mixed methods per se

00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:49,060
qualitative can be of

00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:51,280
part of mixed methods but it's not

00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:55,030
something necessarily that's always a

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,820
part of mixed methods qualitative as I

00:01:55,030 --> 00:02:00,310
say here is deep engagement so you're

00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:02,200
really looking at the textual data or

00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:04,200
the data that you've got really engaging

00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:07,870
with it and trying to come out with

00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,460
specific themes from that analysis so

00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:11,290
why would you do this why would you do

00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:13,900
this research well it's used by a lot of

00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:15,700
fields anthropology sociology are kind

00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,520
of well-known for getting that education

00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:20,440
as well nursing information science

00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,850
psychology and a lot of folks and user

00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,980
experience and marketing are also

00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,600
starting to do this work as well there's

00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:28,090
also a lot of type of data out there

00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,160
that comes out that's textual and so

00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:32,980
this is a way to analyze that everything

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,410
from observations so ethnographic or

00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:37,570
observational research interview focus

00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:40,720
groups as we mentioned also tons of

00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:43,570
public or I cut archival documents memos

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,970
jottings media for instance tweets is a

00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:48,280
really you know growing field of doing

00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:49,750
qualitative data analysis and also all

00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,440
kinds of visual stuff as well there's a

00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:55,330
lot of visual analysis in this field the

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,150
reason to do it is because you generate

00:02:55,330 --> 00:03:01,450
rich detailed data that lets a cultural

00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:03,760
context and individuals perspectives be

00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:05,530
we allow for a deeper understanding of

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,630
phenomena when we try to understand it

00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:10,330
from the words of people who were there

00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:13,720
and often and I say this all the time

00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:15,970
qualitative research should study things

00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,560
that quantitative cannot so we shouldn't

00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:19,360
be doing it if we can just do a survey

00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,060
and find some numbers and answer it that

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,560
way please go do that if you can get the

00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,780
numbers to figure out the answer to your

00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,200
problem qualitative is a lot of work to

00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,090
do

00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,790
for something that you already have

00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:33,430
numbers for but it also really helps us

00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:34,840
understand the whys for whatever the

00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,360
phenomena is that we're trying to

00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,280
understand

00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,780
so how q da works typically there's

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,790
collecting the data of some kind

00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,760
organizing and gathering it pulling

00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,989
together source materials sometimes

00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,599
interviews or you're collecting

00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:50,489
observations then you do this coding

00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:52,530
process that we we I mentioned

00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:54,480
qualitative data analysis of coding

00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:56,489
these specific parts of the data and

00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,860
then finding patterns and there are

00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:00,569
different theoretical ways to think

00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,769
about doing this patterns but you're

00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:03,450
articulating the connections

00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:05,400
relationships and patterns in the data

00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:07,349
that you find and then finally you

00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,549
create this analysis this there using

00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:10,140
the theoretical and substance of

00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:13,079
knowledge that you have to be able to

00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:14,430
understand what you find in the data so

00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:16,049
I'm going to pass this along we're gonna

00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,820
talk a little bit about what exists

00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:18,959
right now for qualitative data analysis

00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:24,720
and then we'll talk about our open

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:26,880
source products so a lot of our work was

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,490
born out of the current landscape of

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,889
qualitative research and what's called

00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:35,010
on Wikipedia computer assisted and

00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:39,030
qualitative analysis software so cue

00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:41,370
does it's it's qd8 tools so you can see

00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:44,550
the list here there is a lot in terms of

00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:46,680
prices so for in vivo for example which

00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,360
is one of the most well used qualitative

00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,370
tools across disciplines

00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,199
it's about fourteen hundred dollars for

00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:55,740
a license and it only works on Windows

00:04:52,199 --> 00:05:00,210
and Mac the cheapest tool is fifteen

00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:02,820
dollars a month and uses flash and it is

00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:06,900
not going to stop using flash so there's

00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:09,419
that and then we listed the three

00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,760
currently maintained open-source

00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:14,130
qualitative tools so one is qual coder

00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,280
which we just happen to find the way we

00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:19,860
surreptitiously found each other

00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:21,750
it works on Linux and it's being tested

00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,760
on Windows and the cool thing about qual

00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,919
coder is that you can use AV so you can

00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:28,409
import audio and visual materials

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,539
there's Q coder which is going to talk

00:05:28,409 --> 00:05:32,280
about which is an hour package for

00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:34,080
qualitative works on all operating

00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:37,380
systems and then I'm going to talk about

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:40,199
tag apps which is the open source one

00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:44,360
that that I work on so the landscape was

00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:47,629
pretty grim before us in terms of

00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,729
accessibility to qualitative people were

00:05:47,629 --> 00:05:52,550
putting together like I'm gonna cut him

00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:54,289
paste quotes into Excel save one column

00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:56,509
that's our code and one column that's

00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:58,280
the text and there are all these very

00:05:56,509 --> 00:06:00,530
happy systems that people have come up

00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,719
with to get around having to pay these

00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:04,819
massive amounts of fees like I always

00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:06,710
think back of the first time I ever did

00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:08,900
qualitative I was working at a museum

00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:10,789
that could not pay for the license and

00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:13,030
so I just kept putting in different

00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:16,129
emails to get different trial versions

00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:19,099
and so it's not sustainable it's not

00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:20,840
equitable and so why floss the first

00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:23,120
reason is equity these are

00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,439
under-resourced disciplines mostly in

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,229
social science and the humanities that

00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:30,710
do not get as much money from funders

00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:32,810
and so this also spans lots of

00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:34,639
geographic areas that also typically do

00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:36,919
not have the resources to pay for tools

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,710
so this makes the default these happy

00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:41,479
systems or people just stay analog they

00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:43,520
print out all of their transcripts

00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:46,909
highlight with different colored markers

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,979
or put post-it notes and this you know

00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:50,509
makes the analysis sort of unavailable

00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:52,729
to other researchers when we think about

00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:54,800
openness and reproducibility and

00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:56,029
quallege about reproducibility

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,960
librarians have talked to me about that

00:06:56,029 --> 00:07:02,210
another time this is just not

00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:05,479
sustainable and part of that instability

00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:07,550
is around lock-in so the export options

00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:09,770
in these paid platforms really vary

00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:12,830
they're not backwards compatible so you

00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:14,960
can lock students which gives me like

00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:16,550
the shivers at night and researchers

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,650
into a platform that have no

00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:20,479
alternatives and so when you leave a

00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:22,460
university you leave a well resourced

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,319
job you have nowhere to go for your

00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:27,560
computer-assisted qualitative data

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,330
analysis there's also a level of

00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,759
complexity that these and that these pay

00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:33,190
packages have tons of add-ons and extras

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,170
they want to sell to you

00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:37,330
really overwhelm newcomers when really

00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:40,750
the basic functionality is highlight a

00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:44,110
section give it a tag that's a really

00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:45,790
simple program to mate however we've

00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:47,530
seen a little bit more standardization

00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:50,190
which I'm going to talk about later and

00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:53,530
some open codebook initiatives as well

00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:56,890
so some of the challenges for for open

00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:59,260
source qualitative packages I put in two

00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:01,810
forms so one is technologically and the

00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:03,100
other is a culture concern so I'm going

00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:04,360
to talk about the culture first even

00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:07,510
though it's the opposite way of myself

00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:09,760
I'm the first primarily is data privacy

00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:10,930
concerns so people who do qualitative

00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:14,860
research are doing things like

00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:16,720
interviewing refugees or celebrities in

00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:20,020
Turkey and and these communities are

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,120
really in danger and so when they think

00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:25,630
about privacy concerns both with their

00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:28,480
own data and with data that exists that

00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:30,760
is findable these folks often don't

00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:33,130
understand that open-source can be as

00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,930
secure as a paid platform and so these

00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:37,479
are some cultural barriers that we've

00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:39,849
seen then the other side is the

00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:42,280
education side so you know folks either

00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:43,510
teach you hacky systems that they've

00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,820
created to get around paying for

00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:48,040
licenses or you get trained on these

00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:50,140
proprietary packages and then again when

00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,200
you leave you have no alternative the

00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:54,790
other on the technological side is that

00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,920
there are often lots of collaborations

00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:58,480
in qualitative research and so people

00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,990
need one the ability to collaborate

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,570
which isn't existing in many open-source

00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:06,400
well in any qualitative pavéd

00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:08,350
qualitative packages and then also

00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,540
there's not really good Providence or

00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:14,710
version control between the way people

00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:16,150
tagged things and gets all tangled up so

00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:17,740
there are some open initiatives in cual

00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:19,930
I wanted to highlight so there are some

00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:21,590
past open source qualitative initiatives

00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:24,680
that are now defunct

00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:26,690
our qda is an art package the other one

00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:29,390
people talk about a lot is the coding

00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:30,860
analysis toolkit called cat the dates

00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:35,420
that you see there are the times they

00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:37,040
were last updated there's also the

00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,810
qualitative data repository which is a

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,760
new and really safe way of publishing

00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:43,220
qualitative analysis that's run out of

00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:45,050
the Syracuse University you can have

00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,700
things like the metadata accessible but

00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:48,350
you have to request access to the actual

00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:50,150
data file so you keep things

00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:52,640
discoverable but lockdown for your

00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:54,110
populations and they also have this

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,270
great initiative called the annotated

00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:58,190
annotation for transparent inquiry so

00:09:56,270 --> 00:10:00,589
this is I really highly recommend that

00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:02,480
you look at it it's about annotating

00:10:00,589 --> 00:10:05,200
specific passages in an article with

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,160
links to data and more methodological

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,690
information than what would normally be

00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,779
allowed in an article so it's a great

00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:13,430
open initiative and qualms and also just

00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:16,040
a one quick note on this thing with the

00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:18,380
Rotterdam exchange format initiative so

00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,540
this is a great open community run

00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:22,310
initiative and qualitative to be able to

00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:24,980
exchange projects and codebook in

00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:26,990
between the charts are kind of big but

00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:29,780
they've been adopted by a lot of these

00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:31,460
paid platforms and so there's some

00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:35,060
movement towards more interoperability

00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:36,800
and qualitative which is wonderful so

00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:38,600
the problem that we tried to solve is

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,970
that qualitative researchers need more

00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,280
equitable access to software the options

00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:45,230
are far too expensive the ability to

00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,540
highlight text and tag it should be

00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:49,760
really easily available in a GUI and

00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:51,440
it's not fair or right that qualitative

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,720
researchers without these massive funds

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,460
can't afford the basic software to do

00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,980
their research and so we're gonna

00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:59,510
describe our two approaches that it's

00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:04,670
going to start with QC coder and then

00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:07,040
I'm gonna talk about technique if you

00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:08,600
get nothing from this that last slide is

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,270
exactly what we want we think that there

00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,550
should be more options and so I was at

00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:14,450
our up inside last year Dan Schuler and

00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:16,519
Elin wearing

00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:17,899
and I we all got together all social

00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:20,480
scientists and started talking about

00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:23,029
this problem and we came up with a

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,529
solution which is still in prototype

00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:25,910
still in development we'd love your help

00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:27,649
if you're at all interested in

00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:30,200
supporting our goal is to create a

00:11:27,649 --> 00:11:32,690
lightweight open-source text textual

00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,519
qualitative dating data coding package

00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:37,100
and we also wanted this to be available

00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:39,709
for existing are quantitative packages

00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:41,870
that are looking at things in in in

00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:44,029
terms of text mining and sentiment

00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:46,519
analysis so we think that this would

00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:48,440
really help to create more capacity for

00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:52,130
mixed methods and more interesting mixed

00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:54,079
methods that might be available we use

00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:56,089
our studio and I and shiney to create an

00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,820
interactive front-end interface for

00:11:56,089 --> 00:12:00,920
users we support at this point doc docx

00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:03,730
and text files and the data remains

00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:08,149
local there's just an example of the

00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:10,250
interface that we have right there we

00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:11,420
have a coding process here and this is

00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:15,139
just gives you an example we're using

00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:18,800
codes of conduct as our test case our

00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:21,380
example for example data we need to use

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,899
that repository to find more examples

00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:25,910
but that's an example of some code books

00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:27,260
that we put together and some of the

00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:30,500
outputs that we might end up using

00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:32,720
getting this is still very much in the

00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,130
early stages of development and right

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,959
now the problem is that you need to

00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:38,000
understand are in our studio to be able

00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:41,360
to use this and that's not particularly

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,920
welcoming we know that we also know it's

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,019
not particularly easy to collaborate yet

00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:47,029
and we need to support more file types

00:12:45,019 --> 00:12:48,940
and extend this a little bit more make

00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:50,449
it really easy to kind of plug and play

00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:53,510
it's in github

00:12:50,449 --> 00:12:55,160
please come support us in any way we're

00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:56,600
looking for collaborators and also funds

00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,019
for development possibly working

00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,120
together

00:12:57,019 --> 00:13:00,960
I should mention what's pretty fun is

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,700
that Vicki and I met each other

00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,370
over this both of us we didn't know each

00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:07,260
other we both kind of put out that we

00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:08,700
had put out these packages and then

00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:11,100
somebody was like you two should talk to

00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:13,320
each other so it's pretty exciting that

00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,610
we can see that there's multiple folks

00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:18,029
that are interested in creating these

00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:19,470
things we also have various stories of

00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:21,779
having run into people that we're trying

00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:23,190
to do the same thing so there's a lot of

00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:25,200
folks out there that really want to have

00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:27,089
an open-source community that does

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,800
qualitative research but one of the

00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:30,270
challenges I think as we've mentioned is

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,800
that a lot of qualitative researchers

00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:33,330
don't have a lot of the technical skills

00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,890
to be able to create this kind of work

00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:36,240
and so we'd love to make that bridge in

00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:38,190
that connection

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,959
Elin wearing who's sort of the PI for

00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:41,430
much of what we've been doing here is

00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:43,230
working with some CS students hopefully

00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:45,589
this summer to further the package but

00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:52,260
again were really open to any support or

00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:56,160
additionals ideas from folks so the

00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:58,020
approach that myself Remmy Tom who is

00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:01,550
the main developer of Tiger and Sarah

00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:04,740
Dumont took is a web-based application

00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:08,160
called ticket and so Remy repellent hi

00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:10,440
he's on the live stream in France he's

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,959
in the u.s. he's but he's just a

00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:15,089
friend's right now so which is why the

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,980
logo is tag it because I like to poke

00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:18,839
fun at who's Frenchness and Scott was

00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:21,600
like its back yet but with a tee and you

00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:24,240
tag things and that's the quality so we

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,250
have kind of fun with that and Tyga is

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,900
installable but locally and on a server

00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:29,400
for a different collaborative work we

00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:32,459
also have a server where folks can use

00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:35,459
to get and the development is on gitlab

00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:38,220
so feel free to also check out the Deb

00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:40,680
human stuff there so this is what ticket

00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:42,959
it looks like it's it's my screen is

00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,760
pretty wide so on my desktop of homes

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:48,959
that this screenshot is it super clear

00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:50,910
but sorry about that but we tagged it

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,950
you can pretty much import anything that

00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:55,350
Calibri takes calabrese an e-book

00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:56,630
manager that we use to basically convert

00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:59,240
all these documents into age

00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:01,940
EML to show you them on your webpage you

00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,860
can highlight and tag different text we

00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:05,600
have this thing called backlight which I

00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:08,410
did not think was gonna be very popular

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,910
but it basically Gray's out the text

00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:13,580
that is not highlighted so the yellow

00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:15,470
pops a lot and when I teach students

00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:18,050
this they always like freak out at this

00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:20,270
backlight and I have no idea why so we

00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:22,640
have backlight it's a thing and you can

00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:24,230
also export different views and you can

00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,760
use group work and you can actually

00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:29,210
collaborate in real time so that's sort

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:32,570
of just how we try to do tag it so like

00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:34,940
I said it's a web-based thing so you you

00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:36,860
can use it on any desktop you can still

00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:39,170
have a server still with Python and

00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:40,790
Calibri all the data is stored in a

00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:42,590
sequel Lite database so its provenance

00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:44,810
aware these are all sort of super

00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:48,400
developing things I'm telling you but

00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:51,110
just it's our technical approach we also

00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:53,780
this again was born out of a need in the

00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:57,620
community for a lack of open and

00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:59,870
open-source qualitative work so we have

00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:02,420
tried to help this community by making

00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:05,570
super intensely commented and

00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:08,210
image-heavy documentation we have open

00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:10,280
educational materials on the RSF we have

00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:12,310
people email us actually with their

00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:16,040
errors all the time which is very cool

00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:18,050
and some some tweets as well the other

00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:21,260
thing about Tyga is that it is

00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:24,350
multilingual so the story behind ticket

00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:26,420
is me complaining for two years over

00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:28,460
dinner with my friend Sarah and my

00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:30,920
partner Remy and he got so tired of

00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:32,960
hearing us complain about open source

00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,310
quality of that he made it and so the

00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,380
cool thing is Sarah and I are then able

00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:38,420
to teach it as a part of our services as

00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:40,580
librarians and she was actually able to

00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:42,080
present it in Vietnam in Syria and the

00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,970
users in these sessions were able to

00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,720
upload their own materials and get

00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:47,750
started right away

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,850
so you can see it's multilingual and

00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:51,110
we're actually actively translating the

00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:52,160
tool in two different languages we have

00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:54,170
French and German

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:58,730
if you speak something else that's the

00:16:54,170 --> 00:17:00,110
link so please feel free and so just to

00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,870
sum up sort of the core of our

00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:02,430
presentation

00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:04,370
that qualitative research has

00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:06,900
traditionally been pen and paper or

00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:09,449
dominated by these super lockdowns super

00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:11,970
expensive proprietary software and so

00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:14,670
only really well resource institutions

00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:17,010
have access that's not fair quality

00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:19,640
searchers need fluff we're trying to fix

00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:22,880
that gap we encourage anyone with some

00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:26,490
abilities in programming to contribute

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:29,160
it's uplifting what Beth said a lot of

00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:31,770
these folks don't have the access to

00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:33,660
learn these like Python and these things

00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:35,760
so we're trying to bridge that gap

00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:37,620
between folks who are heavy and

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:41,700
development and and the communities that

00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:44,100
see this real need so that is what we

00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:46,340
have for you that's it we're happy to

00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,340
take questions

00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:51,979
