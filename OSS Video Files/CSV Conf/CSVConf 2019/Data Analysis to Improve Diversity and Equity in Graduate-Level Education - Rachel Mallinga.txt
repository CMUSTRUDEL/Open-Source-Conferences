Title: Data Analysis to Improve Diversity and Equity in Graduate-Level Education - Rachel Mallinga
Publication date: 2019-05-19
Playlist: CSVConf 2019
Description: 
	This project grew from the need to determine what students of diverse backgrounds need to feel welcomed and represented in their graduate department at the University of Oregon. Two women of color took the initiative to conduct qualitative and quantitative research on how equity and diversity are represented in curriculum, services, and departmental resources. Based on our findings we researched resources on campus that address the problems identified in our data and best practices for graduate education implemented by similar graduate-level programs in Oregon. This talk illustrates how research methods can be used to inform institutional policies and practices to improve diversity and equity.

thank you for coming today my name is

00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:09,120
Rachel I am presenting on my research I

00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:11,099
did with at University of Oregon I'm

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,679
diversity equity inclusion in the

00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:15,750
graduate level education originally this

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,430
was called cultural competency in

00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:22,980
cultural graduate programming however

00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:25,830
cultural competency I pretty much

00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,900
understand that to be your confidence

00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,550
something but cultural confident like to

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,260
understand cultural differences and

00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:36,899
academia is something that's continuous

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:39,840
so my presentation oops it's a basic

00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:42,930
line about the methodology the

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,309
qualitative findings which led us to the

00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:48,480
qualitative how to form the questions

00:00:46,309 --> 00:00:52,320
recommendations and reflection on this

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:57,809
project so the methodology that we use I

00:00:52,320 --> 00:01:01,620
worked with another person another mic

00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:03,660
coat my co-lead on this project the

00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:06,510
program was at the University of Oregon

00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:09,900
it is a program that prepares students

00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:13,200
for community regional planning working

00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:17,070
with policy and general social services

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:20,640
and how this project started there was

00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:24,210
students commented and how they felt

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,259
unprepared to address inequities with

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,210
marginalized underrepresented

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:31,920
communities and they wanted to build

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:34,140
those skills and this was a project that

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,290
we're commissioned to investigate this

00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:39,799
issue and so we had we implemented a

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:43,290
Qualtrics survey with 41 participants

00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:45,720
quantitative qualitative interviews with

00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:50,310
16 and then research and we provided

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:53,869
recommendations so the qualitative

00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:57,570
findings was based around basically

00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:59,759
people wanting to learn about dir

00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:02,219
diversity equity inclusion in the

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:06,180
program and through curriculum they felt

00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:09,690
not as prepared and also the way to

00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:12,270
understand issues that understand issues

00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,100
that impact and how to work with Marge

00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,610
eyes under rivers

00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:19,790
communities so based on our call track

00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:24,170
survey this is what we found about why

00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:27,770
is this important to your field how well

00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:30,470
the clap the curriculum is dealt with in

00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:32,630
the classroom sooo facilitations actual

00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:37,190
readings examples so forth or case

00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:39,110
studies if feeling prepared I'm just

00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:42,860
going through this quickly because the

00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:44,540
limited time have an interest in taking

00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:47,210
these courses to better serve the

00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:48,500
communities and if it should be a

00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:50,900
professional part of professional

00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,910
development or standalone course and so

00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:56,480
meaning professional development in this

00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:58,160
department they have professional

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,280
development class which teaches you how

00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:05,450
to do presentations use like computer

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:09,950
programs like Excel Word what else

00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:12,250
and also like developing your resume and

00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:14,930
cover letter and this would be part of

00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:17,600
that curriculum for to personal

00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:22,160
professional development and also or if

00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:24,830
it should be required course so based on

00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:27,530
the comments that was given to the

00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:30,130
survey a lot of the comments reflected

00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:32,240
that understanding like the lack of

00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:33,950
students feeling that the faculty is

00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:36,620
that not as prepared to have these

00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:39,260
discussions because if either their

00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:41,600
personal research or lived experience

00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:45,110
that this is something very important to

00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:49,640
talk about di issues in curriculum to

00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:51,980
help better prepare and also other the

00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:55,250
students own personal attitude if some

00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:57,130
people felt this was something that was

00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:02,750
valuable to them or not

00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:04,100
so based on the quality the quantity the

00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:06,590
quantitative data of the Qualtrics

00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:09,170
survey we formed for questions about

00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:13,520
student buy-in like why does students

00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:16,010
support this di education to be

00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:18,799
implemented and how their positive

00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:21,109
experiences in the classroom how they

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:23,030
overall dealt with their experience and

00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:25,650
within the department and also input

00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:29,850
from students who took other classes in

00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:32,430
other departments or other like outside

00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:34,889
learning experiences and how that

00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:39,750
impacted them and how they felt about

00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:43,290
those experiences so with classroom

00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:47,280
environment that the main issue that

00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:50,400
stood out from reading for analyzing the

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,400
data and also noting what issues came up

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,930
often was not all students were heard

00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,860
and especially students from

00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,650
marginalized underrepresented

00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:01,889
communities such as students of color

00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:04,020
LBT g/q students and others were have it

00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:07,320
was that put as equal weight or not

00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:10,260
equally respected as gendered white

00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:12,500
males that are spoke up in the classroom

00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:15,240
and they were seen as more valid in

00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:20,210
talking about issues that pertain to the

00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:22,860
subject in this department that how

00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:26,370
equity and diversity is discussed within

00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:28,199
the classroom that it's either something

00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:30,930
very taboo and varying that people are

00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:34,970
nervous to talk about and also the

00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:37,500
importance of learning about history and

00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:39,870
critical race Theory gender theory and

00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:42,900
so forth to help students become more

00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:47,240
effective agents of change or to

00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,240
participate within their future careers

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,689
that

00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:56,689
students did not feel the conversations

00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:58,459
weren't well facilitated that often this

00:05:56,689 --> 00:06:00,229
is gonna be brought up often in this

00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:02,029
presentation that white privilege isn't

00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:05,319
something a taboo subject to be talked

00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:08,539
about that students feel culturally

00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:12,279
emotionally text to bring up these

00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:15,049
discussions and explain people those

00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:17,029
experience of the marginalized community

00:06:15,049 --> 00:06:21,129
from their own personal perspective our

00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:23,839
personal lived experience and also how

00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:26,029
conversations are facilitated if faculty

00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:29,779
or staff is able to facilitate these

00:06:26,029 --> 00:06:35,209
conversations they'll have the knowledge

00:06:29,779 --> 00:06:37,519
to facilitate so based on these themes

00:06:35,209 --> 00:06:40,309
brought up in the Qualtrics survey and

00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:43,549
the qualitative interviews we are able

00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:45,769
to identify five main points that were

00:06:43,549 --> 00:06:48,379
brought up so students don't take

00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:50,599
courses to improve their skills even

00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:53,049
though they are important that this

00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:55,639
department that the department I was

00:06:53,049 --> 00:06:59,719
doing this research with that they do

00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:02,149
offer classes such as policy making that

00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:04,159
impacts immigrant communities gender

00:07:02,149 --> 00:07:06,139
issues so forth but they're not required

00:07:04,159 --> 00:07:08,719
and there are extra curricular they're

00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:11,149
not part of the curriculum and it's up

00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:13,939
to the students to take these classes

00:07:11,149 --> 00:07:16,039
that the student day is assumption from

00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:18,219
faculty or to that students know

00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:21,889
everything that even concepts of

00:07:18,219 --> 00:07:23,749
diversity equity inclusion cultural

00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:26,239
competency that it's already assumed

00:07:23,749 --> 00:07:29,719
that the students already know about

00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:31,879
these subjects instead of students not

00:07:29,719 --> 00:07:35,959
being familiar and like reinforcing

00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:37,489
these concepts to them and also how

00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:39,319
these skills are taught outside the

00:07:37,489 --> 00:07:42,919
curriculum outside the department not

00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:45,379
within this department and also

00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:47,719
understanding from that students really

00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:49,369
feel passionate about learning about

00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:50,749
diversity equity inclusion how to

00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:54,159
advocate for marginalized

00:07:50,749 --> 00:07:58,039
underrepresented communities how to

00:07:54,159 --> 00:08:00,369
better understand or we reach out to

00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:00,369
these communities

00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:09,830
so based on our findings we did research

00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:14,480
on these issues and how to better

00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:17,120
address them what what what research

00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:20,200
resources are available at on the campus

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,520
and also what other Department other

00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:25,580
universities with similar programs are

00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:28,760
implementing currently so based on our

00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:32,000
research is we the four points that

00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:34,430
we're brought up is bring building a

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,500
culture of respect and equity that

00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:38,860
building that culture would look like

00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:41,539
through curriculum services that the

00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:43,820
department would provide increase

00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:48,250
diversity in the department meeting

00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:52,330
either staff graduate students graduate

00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:52,330
graduate teaching fellows and

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,550
representation and direct cultural

00:08:55,130 --> 00:09:00,770
competency not only in the curriculum

00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:03,020
but also in the services that provide

00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:04,850
and also the importance of faculty

00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:06,890
action that faculty is leading this call

00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:10,310
it's not all depending on upon the

00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:13,790
students so as I mentioned before

00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:17,390
faculty leading this charge that that's

00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:20,510
the top-down approach to have a to have

00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:22,970
equity includes include equity diversity

00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:25,280
inclusion to be physically shown through

00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:29,600
the department's vision statement

00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:32,810
mission so forth and so either on their

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:35,600
website and Penton advertisements for

00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:39,340
their programming so forth and also that

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:44,240
the University of Oregon does have many

00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:45,589
programs to help faculty with being more

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,710
inclusive in their curriculum or

00:09:45,589 --> 00:09:50,660
teaching styles such as teaching

00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:53,860
efficiency program which helps faculty

00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:57,740
build on their skills to facilitate and

00:09:53,860 --> 00:10:01,990
educate within the within issues one

00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:04,220
diversity equity inclusion so also

00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:07,190
increased department diversity either

00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:11,930
through hiring staff who faculty staff

00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:13,580
who has research dealing with issues

00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:14,259
that impact diverse communities under

00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:17,259
representation

00:10:14,259 --> 00:10:19,449
also representation of student workers

00:10:17,259 --> 00:10:21,939
when we talk about economic inequalities

00:10:19,449 --> 00:10:24,399
that does impact marginalize can

00:10:21,939 --> 00:10:27,609
represent communities and giving them

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:32,289
the availability to help support and

00:10:27,609 --> 00:10:34,929
retain them as hired by the department

00:10:32,289 --> 00:10:38,679
and also showing that other schools

00:10:34,929 --> 00:10:42,869
within Oregon also has they provide

00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:51,100
scholarship for supporting research on

00:10:42,869 --> 00:10:53,619
dei issues that there needs to be a

00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:56,559
professional development skill set for

00:10:53,619 --> 00:11:00,299
supporting faculty and develop and to

00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:03,609
help build these skills of teaching di

00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:05,889
also building the usage of theory within

00:11:03,609 --> 00:11:06,759
the classroom I'm sorry I'm just going

00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:10,749
through so I have enough time for

00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:13,179
questions and the faculty action is like

00:11:10,749 --> 00:11:15,119
to promote critical thinking that many

00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:18,160
different theories like gent like

00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:20,949
critical race Theory gender Theory so

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,949
forth will help students be able to be

00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:27,579
more efficient in DI issues or working

00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:30,249
with marginalized communities and the

00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:31,989
recommendations based on our findings

00:11:30,249 --> 00:11:33,959
and I think I talked touched on it

00:11:31,989 --> 00:11:38,439
before that there's resources on campus

00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:43,149
that help with teaching more efficiently

00:11:38,439 --> 00:11:44,649
and other schools also what program

00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:47,649
they're implementing and also follow

00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:50,079
follow that lead and could start to

00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:53,829
implement those practices in their own

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:56,859
program so my own personal reflection in

00:11:53,829 --> 00:12:00,189
doing this project is the number of

00:11:56,859 --> 00:12:03,579
responses that from our Qualtrics survey

00:12:00,189 --> 00:12:06,189
to in-person interviews it dropped more

00:12:03,579 --> 00:12:10,299
than half and how I would go about just

00:12:06,189 --> 00:12:12,789
addressing that in the future projects

00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:14,199
that reflect this project the

00:12:12,789 --> 00:12:16,419
demographics that we didn't take

00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:20,559
consideration of demographics based on

00:12:16,419 --> 00:12:22,089
race gender sex so forth because that

00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:25,180
could have better wait out the

00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:28,420
information that we gathered and all

00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:30,100
so well though issues like having

00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:32,230
everyone on board and understanding

00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:35,020
having a common understanding of what

00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:36,910
these terms are that every people

00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:39,250
everyone has different understanding

00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:41,620
what de I what diversity equity

00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:44,110
inclusion and cultural competency is and

00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:46,450
stating like this is the definition that

00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:47,920
we're using in this project and having

00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:50,410
so we have that commonality

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:55,120
understanding and also making sure the

00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:57,610
staff is receptive to this report or

00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,520
project because it might lead up to well

00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:02,350
it led up to defensive Mis and like

00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,910
feeling like defenses up because like

00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:06,340
this comes up is critical but it's not

00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:08,800
but the intention of like to make a more

00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:11,230
equitable program and Department and

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,910
it's coming from a place of what I

00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:15,580
consider love and concern instead of

00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:18,040
like a paid a bad place and pretty much

00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:21,570
that was the gist of it and if there's

00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,570
any questions go ahead and ask

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,119
