Title: Data Analysis to Improve Diversity and Equity in Graduate-Level Education - Rachel Mallinga
Publication date: 2019-05-19
Playlist: CSVConf 2019
Description: 
	This project grew from the need to determine what students of diverse backgrounds need to feel welcomed and represented in their graduate department at the University of Oregon. Two women of color took the initiative to conduct qualitative and quantitative research on how equity and diversity are represented in curriculum, services, and departmental resources. Based on our findings we researched resources on campus that address the problems identified in our data and best practices for graduate education implemented by similar graduate-level programs in Oregon. This talk illustrates how research methods can be used to inform institutional policies and practices to improve diversity and equity.
