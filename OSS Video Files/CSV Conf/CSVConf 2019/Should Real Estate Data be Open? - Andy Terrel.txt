Title: Should Real Estate Data be Open? - Andy Terrel
Publication date: 2019-06-21
Playlist: CSVConf 2019
Description: 
	While aggregators of multiple listing service (MLS) data have opened up much of the process of finding a house on the internet, the data is still closed. The MLS quotes personal security as the primary reason. What data is being protected and what is the impact of that decision? As a consumer of data from numerous sources, REX has routinely been denied access to this data. In this case we make the case for all the societal benefits for opening this data and the implications.

thanks for coming to my talk so I'm Andy

00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:11,549
Carroll I work as the chief data

00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:13,769
scientist at Rex which is a online real

00:00:11,549 --> 00:00:17,130
estate brokerage that doesn't use the

00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:20,550
canonical real estate data or aka the

00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:22,470
MLS to sell houses and here talking a

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:26,730
little bit about you know what is the

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,990
MLS and should it be open and I was at

00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,180
first I was going to talk a lot more

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,309
about data visualization and data like

00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,690
like the things you could do with in the

00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:35,429
last type data but then I heard the talk

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,109
last night very motivated by social

00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:39,359
justice and data ethics and things like

00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:41,399
that so I only show one visualization

00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:42,780
which is what I showed of investors of

00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,050
like all right if you're in LA where

00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:48,449
should you buy and like red is expensive

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,010
bigger dots mean that there's more

00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:51,480
variability in the market so like

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,679
there's a nice big dot in the middle

00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,809
that's like oh that's where you buy

00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:58,109
today right and this is a sort of data

00:00:54,809 --> 00:01:00,809
that we could show to the public but we

00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:03,120
can't because of the MLS data

00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:07,110
regulations and I'll go through some of

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,700
that just some caveats first most people

00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,380
who know me know me from my open-source

00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,420
advocate software advocacy that's not

00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,259
this go visit not focus out of work love

00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,719
to talk about that

00:01:13,259 --> 00:01:17,219
but not in this form right now my

00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:19,950
company does have a financial interest

00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:24,240
of this company so you can take that as

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:27,030
as any sort of like argument in in an

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,000
historical perspective that I do have

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:32,100
some financial interest and while I do

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,810
have a PhD it's in computation math now

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,920
economics or legal scholarship so you

00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:40,020
should really regard me as a lay person

00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:43,259
with that said I have three three main

00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:46,070
points real estate is in full disruption

00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:51,119
mode I don't know if people noticed this

00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:53,219
yeah there's a history associated with

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,200
real estate data and real estate in

00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:56,759
general we talked about first peoples at

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,640
the first day of the conference and I

00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:02,490
mean if nothing else first peoples for

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:05,340
sacrifice was largely in in due to real

00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:07,770
estate rights I would say even the

00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,690
treaty recognized so who can actually

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,800
sell at data enter that in the data but

00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:15,460
at that time actual land

00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:17,770
so it's been controversial for many many

00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:19,390
centuries and then I'm going to talk a

00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:21,540
little bit about how opening this data

00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:26,410
might help us

00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:29,380
so for disruption so this article a week

00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:32,560
ago blue skies ahead or is a market

00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:35,620
falling off a cliff right so everyone

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,300
like remembers 2008 when it did fall off

00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:40,030
a cliff everyone agrees that it fall off

00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,140
it fell off a cliff now not everyone

00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,850
agrees that we're falling off a cliff

00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:44,620
now but there's like some speculation

00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:47,320
and in here there's like just this

00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:49,840
byline there's many misleading facts

00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:53,770
being pushed around

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,960
first SMP which is an index financial

00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:59,380
index company CoreLogic

00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,800
which is a company that sells data case

00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:03,550
Siller

00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:07,240
which is to economists who use open data

00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:10,750
to predict investment markets index okay

00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:14,530
so like so unravel that finance data

00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:15,790
company professors say that the housing

00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:18,130
market is cooling for the eleventh

00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:20,110
straight month okay all right cool but

00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:23,400
they only look at investment

00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:27,430
opportunities next line and our later

00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:29,650
one our National Association of Realtors

00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:32,680
the lobbyist group that represents the

00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:35,580
real estate industry released a report

00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,580
saying no it didn't

00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:42,430
of course with what their society is a

00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:44,680
report of like actual home sales never

00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,450
mind that home sales in the last quarter

00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,090
of last year were significantly

00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:52,660
repressed due to changing tax laws and

00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:56,350
mortgage changes and so on and so forth

00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:59,950
so very hard to put into an article on a

00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:04,750
blog like housing wire okay so the

00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:08,890
market is doing stuff in just here's the

00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:10,390
the actual report that's maybe the index

00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,440
that like financial people actually

00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,810
trade on and so on

00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:17,709
okay so that's going on traditional

00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:19,380
traditional real estate is going through

00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:22,870
a moment we don't know what that means

00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:25,160
at the same time a few days later we see

00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:27,800
this honor the love new york times

00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,200
real estate latest bid Zilla wants to

00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,690
buy your house this turns out to be a

00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:35,300
phenomena that's generally called the

00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:37,940
eye buyer platforms that have come up

00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,890
open door ello and lots of of these

00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:41,450
existed they've existed for very long

00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:43,460
times you've seen those signs that say I

00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:47,660
want to buy your house i buy ugly houses

00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:52,210
calm same thing just sexier because it's

00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:54,800
internet and we have the CEO of red fin

00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:57,230
saying there's a danger in this map

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,370
market and it pours lots of money

00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:01,460
without having clear idea where you're

00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:03,830
going and you're actually gonna put a

00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:09,830
lot of risk into the market awesome

00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:11,680
great Tim the next day red fin looks to

00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:13,730
disrupt the real estate again with

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,900
letting you just buy a home without an

00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:20,720
agent so the day ago the guy was saying

00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:22,370
don't let this thing happen because you

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,070
putting risk of the market is now saying

00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:27,200
don't talk to these agents because they

00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:30,020
were supposed to de-risk the market but

00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:32,620
now you don't need them alright so those

00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:35,420
two core challenges going on first

00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:37,730
investment buyers are providing faster

00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:40,490
turnaround for consumers nobody likes to

00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:42,230
be stuck in a house in a changing market

00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:44,240
as we see like no one knows what the

00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:47,300
markets doing so these Aybar's are very

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:50,900
attractive because I pay you 20% of my

00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:53,770
my mortgage and I get rid of it in seven

00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:56,570
days that's the promise of the I buyer

00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:58,340
but also buyer agents have become less

00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:00,580
relevant with the rise of the internet

00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:03,770
that's where my company kinda comes in

00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:05,870
were you know buyers ages are still

00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:08,270
grasping the market share largely

00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:11,210
through closing the data now they only

00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:13,760
charge 6% for that transaction which is

00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:16,580
hate a lot greater than the investment

00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:19,370
buyer with the international standard if

00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:23,060
you go to Hong Kong or Australia or

00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:25,240
Europe it's typically around 2% so you

00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:27,680
Americans pay more to sell our houses

00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:32,230
and now we're paying even more to do it

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:36,160
faster why this matters to me

00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:39,130
this is a report put out by the NA are

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,590
the lobbyist group this shows like

00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:43,480
equity built up in a home largely

00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:46,600
Americans still build their equity

00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:48,520
through their home but one trend that's

00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,830
happened since world war two is we start

00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:53,770
to move a lot more and if you notice in

00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:57,310
this graph the dollar value of how much

00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:59,290
equity you build in in median jumps

00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:03,760
around seven years to eight years

00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:06,220
jumps huge like four times and that

00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,750
largely comes down to the fees that are

00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,670
associated buying your house and

00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:12,640
mortgage and all those sorts of things

00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:14,710
so if we start living in our houses less

00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:17,770
because we need social mobility to get

00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:20,350
to the better jobs but our fees are

00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:23,710
still the same height like we're losing

00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:26,950
the equity which in turn I believe and

00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:29,950
we argue contributes the income income

00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:32,080
inequality of the country okay so reduce

00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:34,180
fees increase you also increase

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,900
potential buyers of your home making a

00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:39,970
more liquid market and you save people

00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:42,760
who need to go to better jobs and

00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:46,720
actually distribute the the jobs to a

00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:48,970
wider audience I didn't include this in

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,890
here but there's like case studies have

00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:53,140
this happening in Hong Kong and like

00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:55,210
liquidity in the market has just jumped

00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:57,130
dramatically as soon as you reduce fees

00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:59,290
same thing happened in the stock

00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:01,870
exchange as soon as you changed from a

00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:04,420
brokerage firm where you went and had a

00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:07,810
single broker to an e platform we saw

00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:09,400
lots of liquidity in the market so that

00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:11,080
is that's why it matters to me I think

00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,820
that we could have more people

00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,110
participating in home ownership and

00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:18,340
building their wealth through home

00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:21,310
ownership it will reduce these fees okay

00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:22,840
so how do we get here so I wanted to

00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:24,970
give a little bit of history about why

00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:28,900
is what is the MLS and where it came

00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:31,720
from so essentially the the real estate

00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:32,890
market data is the MLS is actually a

00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,590
collection of about eight hundred

00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:37,360
entities so if you think about that if

00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:41,020
you're going to chart to do a national

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,510
sort of internet site or things like you

00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,590
have 800 people to talk to 800 lawyers

00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,230
and so on and so forth

00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:48,110
so

00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:50,120
it the distributed nature of it is mate

00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,710
makes it hard to kind of grasp and

00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,950
people just kind of call it the MLS but

00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:56,150
it really is 800 individual entities

00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:57,860
that have different policies and

00:08:56,150 --> 00:09:00,590
different requirements for working with

00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:02,900
them and so on and so forth they do have

00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:04,040
a common representation by the National

00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:06,140
associated Realtors which they showed

00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,660
some of their data earlier and it is a

00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:13,880
DC lobbying group that likes to sue a

00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:15,620
lot of people and actually there's an

00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,970
Apollo up articles about them suing a

00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:20,060
few other people because of the things

00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:23,060
they're happening today so now to access

00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:24,530
data you have to accept not just you

00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,510
don't just have to pay people for it you

00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:29,210
have to accept terms of like your

00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:30,950
business practice one all your data if

00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:34,400
you accept any other data all your data

00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:38,570
must be uploaded to their their platform

00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:41,270
and any transaction fee that happens on

00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:43,640
your data or any transaction will have

00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:45,050
to pay other members of that that the

00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,760
referral fees and reciprocate

00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:49,310
cooperation there's a lot of different

00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:52,480
types of ways to talk about this fee an

00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:57,680
excellent way to maintain a sustainable

00:09:52,480 --> 00:10:00,770
database okay so becomes a resource that

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:03,230
lots people want to get to and to be in

00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:05,960
it you have to play along seems fairly

00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:08,150
nice except that it does have this

00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:10,580
aspect that you have to play by their

00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:13,760
rules completely which I believe is what

00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:15,920
causes some of the problems but where

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,540
did the MLS come from essentially it was

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,620
just local organization the people

00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:21,950
coming to the other ones buying selling

00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:23,750
houses late 19th century it used to be

00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:25,250
you would have an association where

00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,780
buyers and sellers we have represent

00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,850
represents come together say hey what's

00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:31,660
for sale what's not and so on so forth

00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:33,980
seem like a fairly like you know ground

00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:35,900
ground up grassroots movement to

00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:38,750
actually like help people buy and sell

00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:41,420
houses but the problem is that's a

00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:44,000
backroom deal and backroom deals as we

00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:47,270
know have a large proclivity to

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,220
corruption thus in the last hundred

00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:51,350
years we've seen lots of regulation come

00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:53,660
up I'm fine in fact you see even see

00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:56,240
industries like escrows inspections

00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:58,520
title insurance home warranties all come

00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,100
up to like protect the consumer in this

00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:02,540
action if I asked five people in the

00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,860
room like what are all these things mean

00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,240
I bet there's only two of you who

00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:08,500
actually know every single one of these

00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:12,200
details and it turns out they their

00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:14,330
change per state so New York is way

00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,460
different from California way different

00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:19,610
from Oregon and and even more different

00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:23,180
than Texas and so it becomes kind of a

00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:26,900
mismatch in 1974 Congress saw the

00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:28,370
corruption and passed called the RESPA

00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,860
which is the Real Estate Settlement

00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:34,520
Procedures Act which in essence just

00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:36,320
ended kickbacks so you can't enter in or

00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,090
to a bad deal because somebody's getting

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,110
paid to make you enter that deal so

00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:44,390
alright everything's fixed right sorta

00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:46,220
the business model is completely changed

00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:47,960
at that point so here's a point where

00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:50,750
alright we're going to change how data

00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:52,490
can be used then with the industry do it

00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:54,590
basically broke off the agent and the

00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:57,980
broker completely the agent now becomes

00:11:54,590 --> 00:12:02,390
a 1099 contractor hello big economy 1974

00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:06,140
style and they effectively only get paid

00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:08,150
a set fee in a contract awesome so now

00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:12,260
the buyer knows exactly what they're

00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:13,240
paying 6% and the broker well nobody

00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:16,130
knows what they do

00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,660
turns out they still do they become the

00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:21,200
holder of the data generally continue

00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:22,940
the practice of referral fees and but

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,850
you don't really care because your fetus

00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:27,380
cost is fixed I would challenge anybody

00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:29,180
who actually works with risk agent to

00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:32,120
find out how much money they make off

00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:36,890
your data when they pass it up and how

00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:41,330
against resold by the brokers so in the

00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:42,890
end consumers still lose buyer agents in

00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:45,410
addition buyer a just now seems to

00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:46,580
represent the buyers and in the early

00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,930
days when it was just that nice

00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:50,300
association with people coming together

00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:53,720
very much like the buyer was the one who

00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:56,810
got got paid paid for the opportunity to

00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:59,150
meet sellers now not so much

00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:01,340
fire agents has been shown by many

00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:03,140
economic studies are incentivized to get

00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:05,180
customers consumers and the deals as

00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:07,280
quickly as possible and there's

00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:09,080
incentive to hide those fees to promote

00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,670
bad valuations of homes they can point

00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:14,210
to dozens of

00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:16,360
legal suits now where the valuations of

00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:20,270
those homes in that 2008 period we're

00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:22,480
radically off and ignore things like

00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:26,270
your inspection report and whatnot so

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,620
the the consumer is so the data might

00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:29,450
have have this nice model but it's

00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:33,320
actually hurting everybody in our

00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:34,790
opinion and so give you kind of a view

00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:38,810
of like what actually happens to the

00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:40,460
data like in in reality so the homeowner

00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:42,290
enters and an exclusive licensing

00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:44,030
agreement with a broker and an agent

00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:45,380
usually it's do you think it's just the

00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,520
agent but it's usually the broker you're

00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:48,890
entering an agreement with because I

00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:53,690
agents just the 1099 employee they

00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:55,190
really have no no fiduciary duty to to

00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:57,980
you so it's really the broker you're

00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:59,390
entering the conversation with you give

00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,920
the rights to your images and facts

00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:03,380
about your home to the agent to market

00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:05,990
your home alright that agent writes a

00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:07,460
description these become very important

00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:09,140
and the marketing of things and like the

00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:11,120
studies that show that that can like

00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:13,520
boost the value of your home by 10

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,410
percent at least data is generally

00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,330
uploaded to a company the current like

00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:18,640
managing like large conglomerate that

00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:21,590
manages this data is called core logic

00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:24,110
they were on that first slide where they

00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:25,550
were working with ASP and Yale so

00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:27,680
they're independent from an AR and they

00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:30,890
certainly get sued by an AR a lot too

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:33,590
but they also manage their data in MLS

00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:35,330
rules dictate that all data uploaded in

00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:39,920
this manner belongs to agents of in the

00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:42,980
MLS of that particular MLS so who owns

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:46,430
this data as you can imagine this

00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:50,570
process creates a very complicated nest

00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:53,420
of questions first and foremost facts

00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:57,470
are not copyrightable Thank You Supreme

00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:59,180
Court 1991 that you can't somebody can't

00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:02,830
tell you that you can't represent your

00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:05,870
facts on another website just just can't

00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:08,750
but core logics database is protected as

00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:10,670
a compilation so if someone was to take

00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,800
CoreLogic database and like replicate it

00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:14,000
well there's problems than that and then

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,490
there's a lot of gray area between what

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,980
those two things mean and that's hence

00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:21,560
lots of lawsuits but we're like a lot of

00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,150
the the political or legal ank's comes

00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,890
from is

00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:25,450
around these images user produced by

00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:27,640
professional was hired by a broker who's

00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:31,660
paid fees by the buyer's agent and it

00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:33,460
actually hired by the homeowner in AR it

00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:35,560
likes to call this a fractured model

00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:37,960
most of us just say the the homeowner I

00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,700
was the images I mean the logical sense

00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:42,120
is like it's my home I told you to take

00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:44,440
my pictures I should own those images

00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,450
but the legal world doesn't work that

00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,870
way if you really want to have a fun

00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:49,360
story

00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:51,730
Google costar copyright lawsuit and see

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,770
how many time like there's already the

00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:55,900
co-star suit in the commercial space has

00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:58,240
sued all right seven litigations this

00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:59,440
year on commercial real estate so if you

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,750
see a picture on the Internet of like

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,700
McDonald's or any local business co-star

00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:05,710
probably owns that image because of

00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:11,230
because I realize that's how you control

00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:12,850
this data so I'm running a little bit

00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:15,130
behind so I'm gonna skip some things so

00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:16,780
just go a little bit fast the internet

00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:18,250
comes to play so now we start putting

00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,570
things on the Internet zip really was

00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:23,650
the first one to do this they got sued

00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:25,510
out of existence Zillow launches and

00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:28,510
Zillow changed the game they first they

00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:32,650
encourage homeowners to engage directly

00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:34,090
with homeowners and that actually got

00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:35,650
around a lot of these legal rules and

00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:39,460
made the agents actually dependent upon

00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:41,290
that just because we look at the thing

00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:43,420
that really did it was the Z estimate

00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:44,800
because now every goes looks at they're

00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,690
like what's my homework

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,280
of course that's problematic cuz that's

00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:51,220
not an actual valuation and go back to

00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:55,390
those actual valuation problems like the

00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:57,400
Z estimate very like what it represents

00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:59,740
is not clear to me as a data scientist

00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:01,750
I'm sure there is some margin of error

00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:03,610
on some number that it's very good at

00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:05,940
but I don't know that's always the

00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:08,620
consumers interest but it did require

00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:11,170
the MLS has to respond and start working

00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:13,120
with them and so other companies such as

00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:15,220
right Finch really Easy Street and a lot

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,230
of others have followed long suit and it

00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:22,860
started to go directly to consumer for

00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:25,180
the data NAR built really calm now

00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:26,830
Zillow and NAR start like stop suing

00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:28,180
each other and they start to start

00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:30,100
working together and there's like a

00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:33,400
restriction and programmatic access and

00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:35,220
for most part Zillow exists on pleasing

00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,630
customers and selling

00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,299
Feroze to agents and so they become

00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:44,580
having a big advocate to get your data

00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:47,039
to a wider market but access the core

00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:49,140
logic database still must be MLS member

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:51,240
and I'll still dictates the business

00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:56,100
model of the average real estate brokers

00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:57,659
and nar controls the the data how we

00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:01,230
believe opening this data will help

00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:04,020
first and foremost this system stifles

00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:06,000
real estate market you have to charge

00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,530
the same fees as everybody else there's

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,630
there's dozens of companies trying to

00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:11,460
get around even red fin started by not

00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,200
charging the fees for your buyer agent

00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,220
if you find them on Redfin and the

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,990
seller agent gets you in the door

00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,419
there's no reason for you to pay the

00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:21,690
buyer agent fee and Zillow has done this

00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:24,570
truly uh no Jawara like in racks and

00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:26,100
several others and it also forces you

00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,600
into unfavorable terms that you often

00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:30,270
don't even know about such as the images

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,340
on your images of your home on the

00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:34,470
internet that you can't really control

00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:39,600
because it's this kind of strange legal

00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:42,120
network but also so by not requiring

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,010
membership I say you will pay less fees

00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,419
lower transaction buying a home and

00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:47,460
reduce legal overheads buying and

00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:51,059
selling a home there's other effects as

00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:55,700
well such as today Assessors thank you

00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:57,809
the chefs are like County Assessors

00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:02,370
typically do not price your home based

00:18:57,809 --> 00:19:04,799
on market rates and I had a nice big

00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:06,990
thing with with the Austin Board of

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:09,929
Realtors going after poor logic because

00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:12,450
the Williamson County or travis county

00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:14,429
the texas the county had access to their

00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:16,320
data somehow all right so yeah we don't

00:19:14,429 --> 00:19:18,270
like paying taxes at the same time if we

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,130
don't get access to the the data that

00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:24,390
tells us how exactly how much taxes we

00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:26,190
should pay like there's a disjunct and i

00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:28,740
understand from the cab ride to this

00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:30,720
conference that that exists fairly real

00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:32,070
here in portland as so many people moved

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,860
to washington to avoid some of these

00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:37,530
property taxes so it's a very real issue

00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:41,010
we'd have better policy based on having

00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:42,630
better access to that data also like

00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:44,610
that first plot i showed you it was

00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:46,440
great for investors but it's also the

00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:48,659
reverse gentrification where is it

00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:51,269
happening you can tell very clear

00:19:48,659 --> 00:19:52,919
by looking at the market data market

00:19:51,269 --> 00:19:56,519
data you don't get to see unless you

00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:58,259
have some sort of access to MLS data and

00:19:56,519 --> 00:20:00,479
some sort or some aggregate viewpoint of

00:19:58,259 --> 00:20:02,999
it and so if you want policymakers have

00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:03,749
actual trends to help build better

00:20:02,999 --> 00:20:05,580
society

00:20:03,749 --> 00:20:07,830
give them the actual data that that the

00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:09,509
market is using and also watchdog

00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:10,789
organizations avoid compliance and

00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:12,929
regulation of real estate marketing

00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:15,059
everyone we've already talked about like

00:20:12,929 --> 00:20:18,450
Facebook and and how digital marketing

00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:21,720
has not abided with civil acts civil

00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:23,879
civil liberties acts and that sort of

00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,320
thing it's hard to monitor without like

00:20:23,879 --> 00:20:26,909
actually looking at what's the market

00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:29,700
for sale versus what's being advertised

00:20:26,909 --> 00:20:31,830
and so on and so forth so all in all we

00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:36,659
believe that opening this data will help

00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:38,490
the the art community enlarge any

00:20:36,659 --> 00:20:42,099
questions

00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:42,099
