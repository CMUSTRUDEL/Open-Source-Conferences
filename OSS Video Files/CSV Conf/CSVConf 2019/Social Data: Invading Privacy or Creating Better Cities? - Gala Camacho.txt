Title: Social Data: Invading Privacy or Creating Better Cities? - Gala Camacho
Publication date: 2019-05-19
Playlist: CSVConf 2019
Description: 
	Urban designers have long heralded the value of the public realm in creating stronger communities. Yet, their processes and decisions are based around data that is far removed from the community, outdated and/or based on surveys and feedback forums which are generally attended by the same group of people and which can be overtaken by lobbyists. If we want to create cities that place people at the centre, it is essential that we find data about what makes neighbourhoods connected and wholesome, neighbourhoods which provide safe spaces for their community to engage. Social data (data from social media, crowdsourcing, mapping platforms, review apps, etc) can give us an opportunity to understand how people engage in their communities and interact with the places around them. It can be used to provide insights into the social health of local places and identify vulnerabilities, to feel the heartbeat of the neighbourhood. I will talk about what social data is, some of the challenges of getting it and collating it, the data's strengths and weaknesses, and how we are trying using it to make cities more socially connected.

hi everyone I'm gala and I am from

00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:09,039
neighbor lytx we are a company in

00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:12,100
Melbourne Australia and what we do is we

00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:13,869
collect analyze and visualize social

00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:16,960
data I'd like to start my presentation

00:00:13,869 --> 00:00:20,740
by acknowledging the traditional owners

00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:24,700
of the land and pay my respects to the

00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:25,840
elders past and present right so I'm

00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:31,510
going to be talking about social data

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:34,900
today okay let's get started so to start

00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:37,810
off I wanted to show a video to get you

00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:39,430
in the mindset of a city maker in this

00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:43,810
video you will see four new cities and

00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:45,700
four old cities and I would like to

00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:48,899
accompany the video with a quote by a

00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:51,730
famous city maker called young gal in

00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:54,130
the old urban settlements they always

00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:56,680
did it the other way around first you'd

00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:58,750
have a path and human activity then some

00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,610
sheds along the path and over the

00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:03,010
centuries these sheds turn into

00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:06,579
buildings and streets so it starts with

00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:08,709
life with people moving towards the

00:01:06,579 --> 00:01:10,959
river towards wherever they're going

00:01:08,709 --> 00:01:13,299
and then next it's the spaces that human

00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:15,509
life requires and then the buildings

00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:18,459
were built in relation to these spaces

00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:21,159
this way we have streets formed by the

00:01:18,459 --> 00:01:24,429
feet and the town squares based on what

00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:25,600
the eye can see so one of the things

00:01:24,429 --> 00:01:27,490
that really strikes me when you're

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,579
looking at these cities is the

00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:32,079
difference in the structure and if

00:01:30,579 --> 00:01:34,479
you've traveled to many of these cities

00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:37,779
you will find that there's also a

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:39,549
different in the feeling and some

00:01:37,779 --> 00:01:43,209
questions that I've asked myself is why

00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:45,249
why do they feel so different why why is

00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:47,380
the experience so different and can we

00:01:45,249 --> 00:01:53,020
use data to describe these differences

00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:55,329
and to understand them so what even

00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:57,369
instantly making so I'll introduce it

00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:59,259
for those of you here who are not in the

00:01:57,369 --> 00:02:02,739
urban planning space or city making

00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:05,529
space most times the way that it works

00:02:02,739 --> 00:02:07,569
is they go and they collect just tons

00:02:05,529 --> 00:02:09,880
and tons of data the census data

00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:12,069
disadvantaged data traffic and

00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:14,819
pedestrian flows

00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:16,719
land-use property use or property sales

00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:19,900
infrastructure like the roads and the

00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:21,639
buildings that are there maybe they'll

00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,560
have a consultant walking around like

00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:27,189
this area has a cafe field whereas this

00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,780
area has an industrial feel if they have

00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:30,609
money they'll have a survey maybe on

00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:34,049
this spot at a park or something or

00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:36,250
maybe send them by mail and if there's

00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:37,840
some decisions to be made they'll have

00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:41,709
some community engagement like a town

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:45,579
hall and all of these data just gets

00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:50,109
basically chunked into some analysis and

00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:52,480
a master plan is created and there's a

00:02:50,109 --> 00:02:54,159
lot of issues with this process and and

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,379
one main one that I think is quite

00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:59,290
important is there's not really a way to

00:02:56,379 --> 00:03:00,669
diagnose so you made this plan and ten

00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:03,040
years happen and you built a bunch of

00:03:00,669 --> 00:03:04,030
stuff and did that work did it do you

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,280
said you were gonna build an art

00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:09,219
precinct is it an art precinct how do we

00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,439
define an art president it's not very

00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:13,750
flexible and things change in these very

00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:15,250
large time spans a lot of times the data

00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:17,949
when you're starting is already quite

00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:20,049
outdated like the census maybe it was

00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:22,209
from a few years back and and so by the

00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:25,689
time you end it's not really what it

00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:27,430
used to be a lot of the commuting yet a

00:03:25,689 --> 00:03:29,019
community engagement can be overcrowded

00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:32,709
by lobbying groups if they have a

00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:34,870
particular outcome in mind and well

00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:36,430
surveys I mean they're expensive and

00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,709
also they're only as good as the

00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:40,509
questions that you ask and as we all

00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:42,099
know sometimes when we do surveys people

00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:44,500
will say something but actually do

00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:46,930
another so we've identified a lot of

00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:50,109
these problems and one of the things

00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:52,989
that I found and that in city making we

00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:55,000
find important is well people are gonna

00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:56,500
live in these cities and if people are

00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,659
gonna live there they should be at the

00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,939
center of the city making process and

00:03:58,659 --> 00:04:02,979
one of the things that is very clear to

00:04:00,939 --> 00:04:05,079
me is that of all the data sets that I

00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:07,419
mentioned there was a lot of data about

00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:09,729
what do people like in these spaces

00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:11,769
what are they value what brought them

00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:13,780
there what keeps them there what makes

00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:16,690
you wanna you know be in this

00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:20,349
neighborhood and and and become a part

00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:22,000
of it and so I think city makers have

00:04:20,349 --> 00:04:23,590
really struggled to find this data is

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,540
not quite clear where you go and get it

00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:28,450
from and

00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:31,080
I think they have tried and it's not

00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:34,480
about people it's just so important and

00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:36,790
well we now have a lot of that about

00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,920
people because every day people wake up

00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:40,870
and they talk about the spaces that they

00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,820
use and how they use them they talk

00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:44,350
about the cafe they went to and they

00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,760
talk about the park where they go with

00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:51,880
their family or maybe where they go

00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:53,920
running so social data we define it and

00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,650
by no means do we own this definition

00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:58,750
and this is what I'm gonna mean when I

00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:00,370
talk about social data so we wanted to

00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:04,140
have a geospatial component we want it

00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:07,210
linked to a physical place that is there

00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:09,190
we want it to be made unsolicited so

00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:14,110
kind of organically as people live their

00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:15,610
lives and so therefore you know we want

00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:17,110
it to be place focused because what

00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:19,900
we're interested in is places because

00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:21,520
we're city makers and what we want to

00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,990
understand is that' that will tell us

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,850
about their behaviors of people's in

00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,410
connection with these places so I list

00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:28,450
here a bunch of different sources but by

00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:30,910
no means is this exhaustive this is just

00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:36,640
a subset and these sources will change

00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:38,730
and they will evolve through time so let

00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:42,910
me show you an example of what I mean

00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:45,970
sorry let me talk about my title topic I

00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:48,130
can take this data and I can use it for

00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:50,260
lots of different things I can use it to

00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:52,690
sell you things and I can use it where

00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:55,600
to go for dinner to tell you where to go

00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:58,360
for dinner and one of the things that I

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,920
think is very important is well maybe

00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,630
the biggest problem with this data is

00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,580
not necessarily the fact that it's

00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:06,280
collected let's put that to the side I

00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:09,190
think the most problematic thing is how

00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:11,200
it is used it is being used to work

00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:14,380
against us and so if we change that

00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:17,260
conversation can we use this data to

00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:18,880
make better cities and that's kind of

00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:21,310
the theme that we're trying to talk

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,800
about at neighbor lytx and using social

00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:26,320
data for better cities so I'll show you

00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:29,740
an example so this is MacArthur Square

00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:32,320
this is a park near my house and so from

00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:33,760
a mapping kind of platform we can gather

00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:36,100
that there are some businesses around

00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:39,009
that there's a main road

00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:40,660
that it's long if I then go into its

00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:43,419
Facebook page I can now start seeing

00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:45,850
that there's a picture and that there's

00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:51,060
this community group called Vic rocks

00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:53,770
that seems to place rocks there from

00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:57,639
from public Facebook feed I can see that

00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:59,830
there's this pop-up museum and in my in

00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:01,750
the Instagram feed I can not only see

00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:03,699
the pop-up Museum which is the images on

00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:06,280
the left but I can see that there's dogs

00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:07,690
and that people like the buildings this

00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,280
is not the entire feed but one of the

00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:11,500
things I can see is that people really

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:15,970
like photographing the trees that are

00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:18,100
there from the events so these are

00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:20,169
Facebook events but nothing to stop us

00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:21,880
from using meetup or may be Eventbrite I

00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:25,870
can see that there's some historical

00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:29,410
stuff to this place maybe it may be a

00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:32,410
historical meaning from Twitter I can

00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:35,259
see that people got angry about it being

00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:39,009
off leash dog park and I can see

00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:42,340
pictures of trees again and from Yelp

00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:44,260
and TripAdvisor we can get it actually

00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,729
it's hard to read but it basically says

00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:48,610
that there's some historical buildings

00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:50,470
in the area and so we've gone and we

00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:52,300
queried all these different social media

00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,220
platforms and we now have learned so

00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,720
much about that place and this is

00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:59,650
information that would be really really

00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:01,750
hard to get in any other way and we've

00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:05,260
done that and usually we can do that

00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:07,690
quite quickly so what are some of the

00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:09,880
strengths of social data it's scalable

00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:11,590
if once you've done it for one place

00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:14,169
it's it's quite easy to do it for other

00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:17,500
places in fact if you went to the

00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:18,699
previous talk he was talking downstairs

00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,740
he was talking about

00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:23,039
once you create scripts to absorb some

00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:26,080
of this data you can just reuse them

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,909
it's organically generated so so people

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,180
post about things and there's certainly

00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:32,560
bias about how they post about it but

00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:34,120
they're posting about this basis and

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,430
this is information we want to grab as

00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,860
City makers and the other part is very

00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:40,450
active so by creating these digital

00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:42,520
footprints of their neighborhood we can

00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:44,140
then compare neighborhoods we can also

00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,630
track the progress if a project is

00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:48,750
happening and this is actually really

00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:50,730
useful information

00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:52,860
we can also see a different dimension

00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:54,480
that we might not have seen before

00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:58,890
and I want to show you that by example

00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:00,420
so here is two two areas right and

00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:01,770
here's a classical way I would compare

00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,980
these cities of Singapore and Nairobi

00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:06,900
and I can see that Singapore is more

00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,350
people and it's more dense and it's got

00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:11,610
a better GDP whatever that means

00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:13,320
however these things are calculated and

00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:18,300
as we have solve it we're developing

00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:20,580
ideas about these two places it in this

00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:22,220
map you can see in grey it's all their

00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,780
Facebook pages that have a linked

00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:27,450
lat/long or an address and all in pink

00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:28,980
is all the google places that you find

00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:30,420
in Google Maps and so we can start

00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,820
seeing that Nairobi's actually really

00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,740
dense and so there's something going on

00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,480
here because you know if I was looking

00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,860
at the classical way maybe I would have

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,910
assumed that there was gonna be more

00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:44,550
things in Singapore and so if I look at

00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:45,630
a picture I can see that maybe it has to

00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,190
do with when these pictures were taken

00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:49,170
but at least I'm starting to see some

00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:51,180
evidence that people in Nairobi are

00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:52,770
walking about and in Singapore things

00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:54,900
seem a bit more organized so I'm already

00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:57,090
starting to develop further and deeper

00:09:54,900 --> 00:10:03,680
ideas about these these cities as a

00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:06,680
place right so here's a bit more detail

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,680
um

00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:14,070
Nairobi got 7,000 Facebook pages a bit

00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:17,370
more that's like more than seven times

00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:18,870
but Singapore got and I'm not sure what

00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:20,520
this tells us but it definitely is

00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:21,960
something we should take a look at and

00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,850
we should consider and one of the things

00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,740
we have found is that Facebook places

00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:27,630
are usually linked to a more informal

00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,310
economy and if you've been to Nairobi

00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:30,900
that is something that you will know you

00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:32,400
know these markets they have thousands

00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,980
and thousands of people operating in a

00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,930
very small space and we should know that

00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,970
when we're city making we should know

00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:41,640
about these informal economies green

00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:43,170
fields have a lot of home businesses and

00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,210
we're not gonna pick that up by walking

00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:47,730
around and seeing who's registered their

00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:49,410
business so as we dig deeper we can also

00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:53,700
start finding evidence of things that

00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:54,990
are missing maybe community services so

00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:58,470
what are some of the weaknesses

00:10:54,990 --> 00:11:01,110
I said pseudo open but it's not totally

00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:03,180
open right like these people they have

00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:04,709
different platforms they they have this

00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:08,190
data and they can decide to close it at

00:11:04,709 --> 00:11:11,430
any time there's areas where it's

00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:14,130
there's not a lot of it especially in

00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:16,050
rural areas or obviously areas where

00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:18,899
there people don't use the internet as

00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:20,339
much it's created differently in

00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:22,560
different places so because as that is

00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:24,420
created organically well I don't know

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,420
what are the things that drive people in

00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:30,600
in Australia to post things versus

00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:32,130
America that's something maybe Facebook

00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,329
would know but I don't know it and so

00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:36,560
therefore I kind of have to act

00:11:33,329 --> 00:11:39,480
accordingly it's got our own biases

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,769
everyone knows these have biases but I

00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,750
think one thing I want to highlight is

00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:45,570
so do all the other datasets that are

00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:47,940
used for city making like not many

00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:49,649
people go to these town halls in fact a

00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,420
lot of people are really really under

00:11:49,649 --> 00:11:54,839
under represented in the city making

00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:56,040
process and this data going back to one

00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:00,120
of the strengths that I said is like

00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:01,890
it's generally available and I think

00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,420
that's really powerful because it allows

00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:05,790
us to include more people in the city

00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:07,620
making process and different it's really

00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:09,959
difficult to collate it so how do I know

00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:13,500
that Joe's pizza and Joe's pizzeria and

00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:15,480
Joe's is all the same place that takes a

00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:19,170
lot of thinking especially if you want

00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:21,810
to automate it and and you know it just

00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:28,010
takes a lot of time and it's you have to

00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:33,420
kind of do it source by source okay so

00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:35,459
some concluding remarks so what if I

00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:37,860
told you that I was gonna these pictures

00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:40,560
here from Instagram if I told you that I

00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:45,570
was gonna grab all your public Instagram

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:48,750
feed you would be like hey gala don't do

00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:50,910
that you're invading my privacy but what

00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:52,529
if instead I told you that I was gonna

00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:55,589
use them to make your neighborhood more

00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:57,510
livable to create enhance and maintain a

00:12:55,589 --> 00:13:00,420
supportive environment for those who

00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:03,779
live there and spend time there maybe to

00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:05,279
improve it social data gives gives us

00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:07,560
this ability to look at neighborhoods

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,930
across the world finding differences in

00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:11,940
similarities these pictures that you see

00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:13,529
here half of them are from a

00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,910
neighborhood in Mexico City called Roma

00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:16,650
and half of em

00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:19,290
from a neighborhood in Melbourne

00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:23,610
Australia called Fitzroy but when you

00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:25,890
look at it they seem similar and maybe

00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:28,530
we can learn from one place and the

00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:29,790
other they have similarities no matter

00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:32,100
the fact that they're in totally

00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:33,750
different places in the world this is

00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,930
not something that is easy to see when

00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:39,360
you are making cities they have all

00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:42,600
these points of similarity and we can

00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,010
gain a lot from knowing that social data

00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,600
can give us these unique digital

00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:48,060
footprints which we can turn into

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,070
insights to understand these heartbeats

00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:52,590
of these neighborhoods what makes them

00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:55,710
tick why do people love some and then

00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:58,560
hate some how do people live and how do

00:13:55,710 --> 00:14:00,870
people experience these places this give

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,610
us is these social data can give us is

00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:04,710
very unprecedented ability to learn and

00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:07,980
support city makers when they're

00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:09,870
building new cities sometimes when

00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:13,970
they're growing a city or maybe when

00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:13,970
they're trying to reinvigorate an area

00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:19,590
one of the important parts about it is

00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:22,130
that this data is being posted by people

00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:25,380
and therefore it's people in the centre

00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:30,360
but most importantly is when we turn the

00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:32,190
focus from it being aggregated by person

00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,940
and we change it to be aggregated by

00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:37,980
place then we lose a lot of the harms of

00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:40,280
the privacy and we get a lot of the

00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:46,370
gains of understanding the behaviors

00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:46,370
place-based that's it

00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:51,010
