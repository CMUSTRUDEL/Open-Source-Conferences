hi everyone no my name is Maria gold I

00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:15,230
am here from California digital library

00:00:11,079 --> 00:00:19,490
and today we are going to talk about

00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:22,730
roars not like the lion roar but that's

00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:25,250
how you pronounce it so I'm going to

00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:27,170
talk to you about projects called roar

00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:30,520
in which we're building and open

00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:32,809
registry of research organizations and

00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:36,170
first thing I just wanted to point out

00:00:32,809 --> 00:00:37,789
is how amazing these badges are I don't

00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:40,929
know if you noticed on the back that you

00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:42,199
can plant them they will become

00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:47,059
wildflowers

00:00:42,199 --> 00:00:48,319
it's very Portland and the other the

00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:50,989
other thing that I wanted to point out

00:00:48,319 --> 00:00:53,929
about these badges everybody takes a

00:00:50,989 --> 00:00:56,719
minute to look at the affiliation that

00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:58,489
is on their badge it's probably

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,920
something that you entered when you were

00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:04,190
signing up for this conference think

00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:07,930
about any other kinds of variations in

00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:11,570
how your affiliation could be written

00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:14,210
for instance the images of the badges

00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:16,310
that we have here on the screen for for

00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:19,280
myself and for John shitake have

00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:22,190
California digital library and CDL and

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,900
both John and I have the same

00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:26,390
affiliation because we both work in the

00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:28,880
same place and they are nicely written

00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:32,270
and expressed in the same exact way very

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:35,090
nice very clean not messy at all this is

00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:40,030
not at all how affiliations really work

00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:42,350
in the real world they are complicated

00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:45,170
for instance here is another set of

00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:48,260
badges from myself and my colleague

00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:51,080
Daniela we attended a conference last

00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:53,300
month and we both entered our

00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:57,080
affiliations in different ways when we

00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:58,520
registered for this conference and my

00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,170
affiliation ended up being so

00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:04,310
complicated that it didn't even fit on

00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:06,100
my badge and if you know say for

00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:11,580
instance Daniela and I

00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:14,080
where each submitting papers to the same

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,390
to the same journal or even to different

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,030
journals because we entered our

00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:21,840
affiliations in two different ways it's

00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:24,550
quite possible that whatever kinds of

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,010
tracking systems or analysis work that's

00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:28,420
being done to identify well how many

00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:31,600
publications are coming out of

00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:33,670
California digital library that our

00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,320
processes of analyzing those

00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:37,690
affiliations wouldn't necessarily

00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:40,090
capture that Daniella and I both work in

00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:43,090
the same organization and so this is one

00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:45,670
of the problems that the Ruhr project is

00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:48,310
trying to solve and trying to get at

00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:50,500
addressing a simple yet also a very

00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:53,020
complicated question which is which

00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:58,570
organizations are affiliated with which

00:02:53,020 --> 00:03:00,370
research outputs and so within I work in

00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:05,380
a digital library that's part of a

00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:07,480
massive university system we I've also

00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:10,209
previously worked in an open access

00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,010
publishing and so I'll talk to you a

00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:14,830
little bit about this problem and why

00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:16,720
it's so hard to actually identify which

00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:18,610
organizations are affiliated with which

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,700
research outputs and that is we've sort

00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:23,650
of have a three pieces of this puzzle in

00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:26,769
this world of scholarly publishing and

00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:28,209
so the upper left of the screen here we

00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:30,010
have the people who are producing the

00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:32,410
research who are publishing articles who

00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:34,450
are creating datasets and submitting

00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:36,400
data sets and and the upper right we

00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:38,440
have the those outputs themselves the

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,269
datasets or the articles or the

00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,880
presentations what-have-you and in the

00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:44,920
bottom we have the organizations or the

00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,530
institutions where these people are

00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:50,250
affiliated and so raise your hand as are

00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:51,489
people here familiar with orchid IDs

00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:54,280
okay

00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:57,730
great so we've sort of solved this

00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,260
problem of how do we disambiguate people

00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:01,060
who are involved in the research project

00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:03,400
we have work at IDs they kind of

00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:06,310
function like social security numbers so

00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,290
we can know you know John Smith over

00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:10,480
here is not the same as John Smith over

00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:14,560
there how many people raise your hand

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:17,209
are familiar with do eyes okay excellent

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,840
so we've kind of solved the problem of

00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:23,600
identifying content and that is you know

00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:27,919
being able to assign a unique identifier

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:30,050
to a piece of research and a lot of you

00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:32,120
know and we have these connections that

00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:34,250
can work back and forth between the

00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,169
people who are involved in the research

00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:38,720
project and the research themselves so

00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:40,789
we can say a person who has this do I

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,590
produce this data set or this article

00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:45,590
are sorry a person who has this orchid

00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:47,210
produced this research piece of research

00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:49,820
that has this DOI and we can make those

00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:56,750
connections so how many people here are

00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:59,030
familiar with an organization ID okay so

00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:01,400
this is sort of the missing piece of the

00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:03,710
puzzle or the missing leg of the

00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:07,699
three-legged stool that we are trying to

00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:11,389
work on with roar which is we can only

00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:13,280
go so far in being able to measure the

00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:16,370
full extent of research coming out of a

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,169
given organization or the full scope of

00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:20,120
work coming from a particular research

00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:23,120
community because we don't necessarily

00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,470
have an organization identifier or we

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,330
didn't until recently that's what I'm

00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:28,400
going to tell you about to be able to

00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:30,199
triangulate between people and places

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:34,190
and things involved in the research

00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:37,220
process so this is where the research

00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:40,360
organization registry comes in this is a

00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:43,430
community led project to develop an open

00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:46,490
sustainable usable and unique identifier

00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:50,120
for every research organization in the

00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:53,000
world it is a project for which I am

00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:56,240
working as the project coordinator

00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,669
representing CBL and collaboration with

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,500
a few other organizations that some of

00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:02,509
you might be familiar with we are

00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:05,240
collaborating with crossref and the data

00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:07,419
site and with digital science and all of

00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:11,060
our organizations are contributing

00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:13,550
developer time project support outreach

00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:16,610
and communications to bring this project

00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:19,639
to fruition and we are working as well

00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:21,800
as a community project with a larger

00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:24,530
group of community stakeholders and

00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,630
advisors and all of you are welcome to

00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:28,610
take part because you are all part of

00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:32,060
the research and scholars

00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:33,830
and data community so there are a few

00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,629
things that are important to understand

00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:37,490
about Rohr and a few things that I

00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:39,319
wanted to emphasize in this talk and the

00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:41,599
first thing is that roar is

00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:43,340
community-led and so this is what we're

00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:46,069
working on now is kind of the fruition

00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:48,439
of several years of work by many many

00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:53,030
different organizations from publishers

00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:55,580
to system providers to data analysts to

00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:58,009
really think about how do we solve that

00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:00,590
problem of identifying organizations and

00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:02,900
connecting them to to the people and the

00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:05,629
research outputs and so this is a very

00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:07,310
much a community driven effort the

00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:08,810
second thing that's really important to

00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:12,409
understand about Rohr is that we're

00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:15,229
building an open registry there Rohr is

00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:17,840
not the first organization to to exist

00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:19,819
or the first registry to exist that

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,669
identifies organizations but it's the

00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:26,270
first one to be truly open and so we

00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:27,889
believe that if you're a librarian or an

00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:29,330
institution and you're trying to find

00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:31,189
out information about where your

00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:33,050
researchers are publishing that

00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:34,879
information shouldn't be locked behind a

00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:37,909
paywall it shouldn't be owned by a

00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:40,819
commercial provider and so the things

00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:42,919
that have kind of come before or have

00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:45,979
not necessarily solved that challenge of

00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:48,199
making that data fully open and fully

00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:50,990
accessible and so the raw data set is

00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:54,039
available cc0 it's human and machine

00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:58,099
readable we want it to be used as useful

00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:59,719
as widely as possible and the third

00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:02,020
thing is that we're focused very

00:07:59,719 --> 00:08:04,669
specifically on identifying

00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:08,389
organizations with roar and so that

00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:10,849
means that we're not necessarily working

00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:14,089
on identifying every single department

00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:15,560
that exists within an institution we

00:08:14,089 --> 00:08:17,629
know that's really important to some

00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:21,110
people to be able to answer a question

00:08:17,629 --> 00:08:24,159
like how many people in the Department

00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:26,930
of Philosophy or in the department of

00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:29,089
biomedicine published X number of papers

00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:31,219
and that's a really complicated question

00:08:29,089 --> 00:08:33,909
to sort out what we're focused on right

00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:37,370
now is identifying a top level

00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:39,490
organization building this at a you know

00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:42,490
truly global and open scale and

00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:45,880
other kinds of local efforts can-can can

00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:48,610
fit into that and be built around it so

00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,980
in January we launched our registry

00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:55,210
we're calling it the MVR our Minimum

00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:58,120
Viable registry we have 90 1000 research

00:08:55,210 --> 00:09:04,000
organizations in roar they all have

00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:07,330
their own unique roar ID and you can go

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:11,110
to Rory org slash search right now if

00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:12,610
you are on a laptop or on a mobile

00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:16,390
device it should be working on mobile

00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:18,730
let me know if it doesn't and you can

00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:21,310
look up your own organization right now

00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:22,780
or any other organization that comes to

00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:26,980
mind I'm showing an example right here

00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:29,110
of California digital library so if you

00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:31,690
go to roryd org slash search and you

00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:34,960
look up an organization you'll see a few

00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:38,230
different things in the roar record that

00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:40,450
I wanted to point out so the roar ID is

00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:42,910
in the upper left hand corner it's a URL

00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:44,710
that resolves to the record we're

00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:48,820
capturing a bunch of other metadata

00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:52,270
about the organization so that would be

00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:54,280
an acronym like CDL the website and

00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:57,880
we're mapping to other identifiers as

00:09:54,280 --> 00:10:00,550
well I think wiki data we have a wiki

00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:02,740
data person here in the audience um so

00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:04,840
roar IDs are currently mapping to wiki

00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:07,300
data pretty soon it'll be vice versa as

00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:09,070
well and so as part of building this

00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,960
open registry of organizations it's

00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:12,970
really important that it's interoperable

00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:17,200
with other identifiers that are out

00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:19,090
there we have an API all of this is

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,280
available on our github and you're all

00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:23,830
welcome to play around with it we have

00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:26,110
an open refine reconciler so if you're

00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:28,150
working with your own messy list of

00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:28,840
affiliations you can run it through the

00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:31,540
reconciler

00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:34,600
map it to R or IDs and come out with a

00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:37,930
super super clean list of affiliations

00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:39,850
that are all tied to R or IDs there are

00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:42,190
still a few problems that we are trying

00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:45,070
to solve with roars so remember we're at

00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:47,590
MVR stage right now so we have the

00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:50,850
registry up and running we have IDs for

00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:52,199
91,000 organizations there are

00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,790
still some things that we're sorting out

00:10:52,199 --> 00:10:55,740
in the next stage of the process and

00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:57,740
anyone is really interested in these

00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:00,329
problems I encourage you to get involved

00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:03,870
so one of the things that we're working

00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:05,940
on next is improving the metadata in

00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:07,310
Rohr and also looking at some of

00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:11,509
problems that come up with

00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:14,399
disambiguation and just the nature of

00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:16,230
affiliations and institutions around the

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,389
world a lot of them happen to share the

00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:21,810
same name so there are a number of

00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:24,690
institutions in roar that are all called

00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:26,430
Lincoln University and these three that

00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:28,980
I'm showing right here all happen to be

00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:31,110
in the United States and so they all

00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:34,290
have unique roar IDs and so that's

00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:36,930
really a step toward identifying these

00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:40,440
unique entities and these unique Lincoln

00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:44,009
universities but to show an example here

00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:45,329
from my colleague at CDL Daniela

00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:49,470
Loewenberg we'll be talking more about

00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:53,069
this later today this is a example from

00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:55,589
CDLs data publishing platform and we're

00:11:53,069 --> 00:11:57,959
building a roar integration into this

00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:59,670
data publishing platform but you can see

00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:01,949
in the example I'm typing Lincoln

00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:04,110
University it's pulling up all of the

00:12:01,949 --> 00:12:06,899
Lincoln universities that match in roar

00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:08,610
but there's no way for me to know which

00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:10,110
Lincoln University is which from this

00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:11,819
drop down in roar so that's one of the

00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:14,519
problems that we're now working on in

00:12:11,819 --> 00:12:16,889
roar is how to further disambiguate

00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:20,250
after assigning these unique ids to all

00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:22,259
these organizations another problem that

00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:24,899
we're trying to solve is how we curate

00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:28,949
data in the roar registry over time and

00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:32,069
how do we account for the sometimes

00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:33,630
unpredictable nature of institutions and

00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:37,199
research organizations this is an

00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:39,480
example from my home state of Vermont a

00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:43,889
small college that recently went under

00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:45,769
and so presumably I didn't check right

00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:48,060
before this talk but presumably this

00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:52,050
College Green Mountain College has a

00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:54,600
roar ID but now the college no longer or

00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:56,759
after this semester will will no longer

00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,160
exist and so how do we account for that

00:12:56,759 --> 00:13:00,959
kind of situation in roar what other

00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,930
kind of metadata do we need to build

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,150
into the registry to designate

00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:07,150
organizations

00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:11,530
are obsolete or to institutions that

00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:13,930
decide to merge or how do we add more

00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:15,220
institutions to the registry over time

00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:18,070
and so we're going to be working a lot

00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:20,800
on questions around data curation and

00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:22,740
maintenance and um how we involve the

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,120
community in that effort as well

00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:27,130
questions like should somebody be

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,980
authorized on behalf of the specific

00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:34,030
organization to approve changes or to

00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:35,980
request changes there's a lot of ways to

00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:37,990
be involved I mentioned we have a

00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:41,470
community advisory group we have a slack

00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:44,620
workspace you can email info at word org

00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:47,380
that goes to me we're on twitter at

00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:48,760
research orgs and we're encouraging as

00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:50,440
many people to get involved in this

00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:53,680
effort as possible so if you are

00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:57,520
interested in organizational IDs and

00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:59,740
affiliations in disambiguation data

00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:03,690
governance please come talk to me I

00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:03,690
would love to talk to you thank you

00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:08,440
