Title: Open infrastructure for open science: how Binder powers an open stack in the cloud - Chris Holdgraf
Publication date: 2019-05-19
Playlist: CSVConf 2019
Description: 
	This talk will discuss the Binder Project in the context of open data and open science, two primary use-cases that have driven the project. It will cover the basics of the Binder Project, such as how to define a reproducible repository to share with others. It will then discuss one of Binder's core goals, which is to build on open standards to facilitate the use of *many* open languages, interfaces, etc. Finally I'll discuss how BinderHub, the technology behind a Binder deployment, is itself open source and deployable anywhere. I'll finish by describing a goal of distributed, federated BinderHubs that provide a network of reproducible data analytics environments.
