Title: Spanking and Spreadsheets: Data-driven Sex Journalism - Jacqueline Nolis & Heather Nolis
Publication date: 2019-05-19
Playlist: CSVConf 2019
Description: 
	When we saw that the Stranger, Seattle’s alternative newspaper, was running a survey on kinks and sexual preferences, we knew we had to get our hands on the data. We convinced the that using machine learning methods on the responses would be a good idea, and then we quickly set out to analyzing them. But we had never written an article for a newspaper before—nor had we worked with data even remotely as dirty. It turns out what makes for a good blog post or technical journal is very different than writing for print, especially for such a sensitive topic. In this talk we will cover how we made sense of the lewd data, the statistical methods we used (and failures we produced), as well as the final results that ended up in our feature article: “There Are Four Kinds of Sex Partners (which one are you).”

hi so I'm Heather nullus I am a machine

00:00:03,669 --> 00:00:07,690
learning engineer and this is Jacqueline

00:00:06,129 --> 00:00:09,430
Ellis a data scientist and we are going

00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:13,270
to talk to you about a very interesting

00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:15,250
project that we had last year but before

00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:16,720
I get started this is a talk about sex

00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:19,060
if sex is going to make you

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,920
uncomfortable go ahead and leave it it's

00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:23,650
not just sex it's other people's sex

00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:26,740
lives which can get really interesting

00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:28,180
so if that makes you uncomfortable at

00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:30,160
all please leave if at any point you are

00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,690
uncomfortable please leave we've blacked

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,579
out the worst of it everything's

00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:35,860
consensual there is a reference to

00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:39,750
bestiality but if that's ok with you

00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,750
it's ok with me and we'll keep going on

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:46,750
so I bet you're wondering how we end up

00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:49,870
giving a talk about sex journalism and

00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:51,160
so what happened was periodically the

00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:52,870
stranger which is an alternative

00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,750
newspaper within Seattle does a sex

00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:57,610
survey and it's super unscientific they

00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:59,350
just put out a survey monkey link and

00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:03,010
they have a bunch of multiple-choice

00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:04,839
questions and people give their various

00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:07,240
responses to this survey and like I said

00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:09,429
incredibly unscientific no researcher

00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,049
designed this survey strange questions

00:01:09,429 --> 00:01:14,560
and they designed it to be interesting

00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:17,380
to take and so Jaclyn and I we are

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,789
married lesbians and we own an

00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:20,740
artificial intelligence consulting

00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:23,979
company and coming up through the

00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:27,009
sciences I've seen what happens when you

00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:29,170
give certain people the power to pick a

00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:31,840
part of data set to really amplify

00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:34,329
differences so I've read research papers

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,590
about how the brains of gay people are

00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:37,359
different than the brains of stray

00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,069
people and I'm totally uninterested in

00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:41,709
that and have no faith in the journalism

00:01:39,069 --> 00:01:44,799
complex to handle this concept with

00:01:41,709 --> 00:01:46,840
dignity so as a pair of married lesbians

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,349
and my wife is trans people like well I

00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:54,130
think that I can do this data

00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:55,719
responsibly and so we saw this one

00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:57,999
fateful tweet and we were like if

00:01:55,719 --> 00:02:00,520
anybody can do some good data analysis

00:01:57,999 --> 00:02:02,380
on it it's us so we literally just went

00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,299
to the stranger's website wrote them an

00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:06,549
email being like please give us all of

00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:08,860
this private data I found people sex

00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:10,650
lives I promise we're trustworthy and

00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:13,380
hope for the best

00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:15,300
so getting the data was real

00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,250
strange it started with a few emails

00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,020
where we had a link to our website see a

00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:21,480
promise that were real people and were

00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,070
not creepy and then it navigated to

00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,510
phone calls or they were like well we

00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:26,070
have somebody who's going to do really

00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:28,050
basic analytics on this and I was like

00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:30,330
but we do data science and I think it

00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,920
will be more fun if we can do an

00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:33,600
additional article that applies some

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,490
machine learning techniques to the stuff

00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,780
that's happening and then we had to have

00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,980
an in-person meeting where they just

00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,900
looked us in the face and we're like

00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,350
okay you guys don't look like skeeze

00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,890
ballz

00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:46,500
great like great we finally trust you

00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:49,500
and then they handed us to the single

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,630
fateful flash drive with a single SPSS

00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,350
file on it and they were like here you

00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,390
go

00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:57,210
so then panic sets in what are we going

00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:58,680
to do with all of this data and so we

00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,660
looked at the survey with about 50

00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,880
questions 8,000 people responded and

00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:05,160
again they made it entertaining to take

00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:08,370
and not necessarily entertaining to

00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:12,300
analyze so some of the questions would

00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:15,870
be if you were going to commit a lewd

00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:19,530
act with a CEO of a major corporation

00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:23,940
who would it be like fmk style who would

00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:25,560
you pick which for most people ends up

00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,390
random there's like a whole sect of

00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,280
people who like really are like yes it's

00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:32,610
Jeff Bezos and he's the love of my life

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,080
so it was a really interesting thing and

00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,880
then some of the answers were actually

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,560
freeform responses where people just got

00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,820
to type whatever they went which

00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,350
sometimes would be one word and

00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,090
sometimes it would be four thousand

00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:44,820
words cuz people get really into telling

00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:46,230
you about their sex lives so we didn't

00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,490
really know what approach to take with

00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:49,860
this because again it wasn't designed

00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:51,870
for analysis it was designed to be

00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:54,270
interesting to take so we did the

00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:56,130
classic technique of spaghetti on the

00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:58,200
wall we're just going to throw analysis

00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:00,630
through analysis see what sticks and

00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,980
follow those threads so Jacqueline's

00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:07,650
gonna talk to you a little bit about our

00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:10,080
spaghetti alright so the key point is we

00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:13,890
had 50 different features of a data set

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,090
eight thousand respondents there was all

00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:17,280
sorts of things we could do but there's

00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:19,140
no clear objective except we needed an

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,690
article to write an article that was

00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:24,210
interesting for the stranger so we tried

00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:25,940
lots and lots of things here are five

00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:28,370
things we tried that aren't even

00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:29,690
worth mentioning in this deck barely

00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:31,190
just want to put them on the board just

00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:33,440
so you guys are aware that we tried lots

00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:34,820
and lots of stuff and most of the stuff

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,530
wasn't interesting at all for a number

00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:38,930
of reasons and we're going to go through

00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:40,970
now is like five things we tried that

00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:42,470
were interesting they didn't all make it

00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:44,090
to print but they were interesting and

00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:47,450
what we learned about doing on the

00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:51,590
science of this data so here here we go

00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:53,840
ah ideal ones sexy stories neural

00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:56,300
network so the question was what's the

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,280
sexiest thing you did last year and this

00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,840
is a free-form text and you know there's

00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,430
lots of interesting role networks out

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,250
there where you can train to come up

00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:06,260
with new Pokemon names or new pertain

00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,940
Austin novels and then we thought well

00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:10,430
what if we train a neural network to

00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:13,100
come up with new sexual experiences this

00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:17,540
will be funny people will laugh Wow well

00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:18,710
and here's the result the the generator

00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:21,140
things were less one of the actual it's

00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:23,420
dancers for instance to have sex with a

00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:25,520
guy who had sex with a-- just isn't that

00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:27,920
interesting result nothing could beat

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,169
what people actually wrote and this took

00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,370
hours of programming in our with

00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:33,919
tensorflow to get this neural network

00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:39,140
even to this point and so the payoff for

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:41,810
the joke wasn't worth it idea to dating

00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:44,720
apps and porn so there are two questions

00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:46,580
one was the people I have sex with I

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,960
usually meet through dot dot dot and it

00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:50,960
was multiple choice you could select

00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,640
multiple and the next question was how

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,770
many hours of porn do you watch per week

00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,360
and we said well some of these apps you

00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:58,669
know maybe they feel a little sleazier

00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,100
is there some sort of correlation with

00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:04,400
the dating app to use for finding sex

00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:06,650
and how much porn you watch and so this

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,970
ended up being a bad result and what we

00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:09,530
did was we end up using like a

00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:11,360
regression to trying to figure out what

00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:13,700
was important to predicting the porn use

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,710
and while it did find significant things

00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:18,350
like people who use Grindr if you use

00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:20,000
Grindr you use more porn it use this

00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:21,169
definition of we used the definition of

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,970
importance cuz that's with regression

00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:25,220
and it just end up being too confusing

00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:27,020
for the editors of the stranger and so

00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,060
while the data was interesting the

00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:34,039
result that we did it just didn't end up

00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:36,289
making sense to other people I do three

00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:38,539
related kinks so there are two questions

00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:39,380
that were irrelevant what activities

00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:41,270
have you done

00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:43,280
all sorts of sexual acts and another

00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:45,020
question what kinks are you into and a

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,490
whole bunch of possibilities and these

00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,530
are great because each one of these had

00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,970
about 30 answers they could give yes or

00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:52,430
no to which meant there's a lot of

00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:54,110
relationships within each question so on

00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:55,550
the right you'll see a list of some of

00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,930
the I guess it's a little small but you

00:06:55,550 --> 00:07:02,240
can see a list of some of the kinks

00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:03,080
people could do like pain latex I don't

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,890
want to list anymore because I feel

00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:09,950
uncomfortable Rishi and we really wanted

00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:12,440
to know how do these things relate so

00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:14,060
the first activity we tried was he meet

00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,940
at network where we put edges between

00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:19,850
related activities and there's a lot of

00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:21,050
things blacked out here when we were

00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:22,580
making this presentation that kind of

00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,660
felt like the molar report just how many

00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,850
times you get to put black bars

00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:27,110
everywhere but you could see that

00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:29,150
there's some interesting things at the

00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:30,890
top you can see people who were cheated

00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:33,980
on and have been cheated irad are close

00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:35,240
to each other had sex while watching

00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:39,830
Game of Thrones is disconnected from

00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:41,930
almost everything so there are two kind

00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:43,340
of clusters of black boxes one on the

00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:45,680
lower right and one on the upper left

00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:49,100
these are both related to the gender of

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,510
the person doing the act and so there

00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,100
were some of these and so like it's just

00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:54,310
there were some relationships in there

00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:57,470
but it ended up being largely confusing

00:07:54,310 --> 00:08:00,050
so we didn't go with this but it did

00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:01,730
inspire us well hey let's actually take

00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:04,100
that data and try doing a k-means

00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:06,590
analysis on it and so here what we did

00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:09,290
was we took the questions people said

00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:10,700
for the list of kinks people said and we

00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:12,620
did just a traditional clustering

00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,730
analysis and we end up finding that

00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,680
there were four clusters that were

00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:18,950
really interesting there was the cluster

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:22,070
of people who have no really no kinks

00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:24,080
listed at all we have the list of people

00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:27,500
who real you're into spanking

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,450
blindfolding BDSM that's the second

00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,010
group the third group is people who are

00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:34,219
like to show off so they're into group

00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:35,840
sex exhibitionism voyeurism and the last

00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:38,870
group which we dubbed the kitchen sink

00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,700
is for people who want all of it so this

00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:43,160
was quite quite clear to the newspaper

00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,720
editors they thought it was great and to

00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,040
the point that the actual title of the

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,709
article that ultimately got written

00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:54,779
about our work was based on that graph

00:08:48,709 --> 00:08:56,399
um sir and a finger okay the idea for

00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:58,980
checking out sexting so there are two

00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,620
questions about sexting so one question

00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:05,310
what I'm sexting I'm most likely to send

00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:07,260
a picture of my blank select one what I

00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:09,089
am sexing the thing I want to receive

00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:13,050
from the other person is to send a

00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:14,730
picture of their blank select one so the

00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,500
thing about the stranger is they were

00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:18,810
already gonna publish each question

00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,579
individually so just looking at the rock

00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:22,560
questions on their own we we didn't

00:09:20,579 --> 00:09:24,570
wouldn't add any value but this is an

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,949
obvious opportunity for us to take two

00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:28,860
separate questions and put them together

00:09:25,949 --> 00:09:33,329
in a clear way and get an interesting

00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:35,040
result so how did that look so we made a

00:09:33,329 --> 00:09:37,350
Sankey diagram which this might even the

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,269
weirdest Sankey diagram ever made and on

00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:41,190
the Left we have what people like

00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:42,779
sending and on the right we have what

00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:44,160
people want to receive and if you look

00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:45,630
at first we're like well this is just as

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,070
complicated as that Network we couldn't

00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:48,720
use but then we looked at we realize

00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:51,060
they're like eight funny things in here

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,709
and in particular Heather noticed that

00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,660
there's a one of the things you could

00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:58,199
sent select was that you don't send

00:09:54,660 --> 00:10:01,079
sexist um but about half of the people

00:09:58,199 --> 00:10:04,440
who said they don't send sext actually

00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:06,390
listed things they want to receive we

00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,089
quickly dubbed them selfish sexers and

00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:14,220
heather just made a hunch that these are

00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:15,810
probably sis men this treatmen and it

00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,480
turns out that we looked into it and

00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:23,490
that was right men just tended to be

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:27,140
more selfish than women which we thought

00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:29,430
was a fascinating finding idea five

00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:32,519
across was some of the funny questions

00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:35,279
so as heather pointed out as heather

00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:36,839
pointed out there were some questions

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,790
that really were put in just for the

00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:40,410
benefit of a person taking the test or

00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:42,360
the survey so for instance one of the

00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:44,220
questions was even though bestiality is

00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,500
illegal in Washington State if I have to

00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:48,709
have sex with do something sexual I

00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,910
would choose a any list of answers

00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:54,089
there's that bestiality one Heather

00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:55,800
mentioned earlier yeah now the other

00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:57,750
question is what would you like your sex

00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,860
act to Donald Trump be and then you had

00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,860
a list of things involving pee

00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:04,850
so we looked at things we thought these

00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:06,380
are really funny questions what if we

00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:08,390
could find relationships between these

00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,770
questions and other questions as we

00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:12,380
looked into this and both of these fails

00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:13,880
for two different reasons for the pc

00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,920
allottee question everyone picks centaur

00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,780
and so this is really small but that bar

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,430
graph is for all the different dating

00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:20,090
apps you used how likely are you to say

00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:22,160
centaur

00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:24,140
we figure it like oh the people who go

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,430
and Hoff the only use go to hang out in

00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,870
coffee shops to get dates are most

00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:29,270
likely we saw at the Centaurs cuz that's

00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:31,280
boring that ended up being true but they

00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:35,480
are also ridiculously similar cuz just

00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:37,820
everyone wanted a centaur for Trump the

00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,290
data was more distinctive like really

00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:41,630
there was a good distribution of answers

00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:43,820
but we couldn't find a meaningful

00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:45,200
relationships to other data sets so for

00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:47,540
instance we again tried to use a

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,610
logistic regression to predict if what

00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,020
what would predict someone saying they

00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:53,030
would pee in Donald Trump's mouth and

00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:54,230
almost all that to keep all of all the

00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:55,730
different kings none of them were

00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:57,110
statistically significant except for

00:11:55,730 --> 00:12:01,610
pain and group sex and we could not

00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:03,860
figure out what that meant so with that

00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:04,670
we went through we came up with some of

00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,170
the things that we thought were

00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:08,000
interesting enough to be in a newspaper

00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:13,370
article and it's time to go to print and

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:15,710
so back to Heather okay so we finished

00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:17,600
the analysis which just involved a lot

00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:19,070
of actually emailing back and forth with

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,990
the editors and being like I found this

00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:22,790
is this cool and they're like no it's

00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:25,820
not try again

00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:28,100
okay sure and then we would have as

00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,600
Jaclyn showed these beautiful well you

00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,820
know they would become beautiful graphs

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,160
if we wanted them to be and still it was

00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:36,770
too confusing for the average reader of

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,300
the stranger which is a free newspaper

00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:40,180
in Seattle that you can pick up as you

00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:43,460
exit the grocery store to really parse

00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:45,560
and so what we ended up doing is we had

00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:48,020
three major visualizations and then a

00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:50,240
bunch of supporting facts because for

00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:51,890
instance people over the age of 55 are

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,290
twice as likely to have had sex on

00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:55,730
poppers it's not a good visualization

00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:57,530
because we don't care about the other

00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:01,700
ages however it's a very very

00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:03,200
interesting fact and so we stopped when

00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,540
we first wrote it we thought these are

00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,660
not extremely data literate people who

00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:10,759
are you're reading this and

00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:12,500
we were like we'll just make it really

00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:14,959
funny so the point where the first line

00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:17,449
of our article was if data is the new

00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,610
oil then surely these sex survey results

00:13:17,449 --> 00:13:23,690
are crude and the editor came back and

00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:25,459
said that's way too cheesy okay okay and

00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:27,350
then he also said that our article

00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:28,940
wasn't technical enough he was like just

00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:30,529
by throwing out terms like you've thrown

00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:32,300
out within our conversations at

00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:34,190
establish as you as an expert so go

00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,139
ahead and add k-means back in and add

00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:37,850
the word Sankey diagram just because

00:13:36,139 --> 00:13:39,860
even if people have no idea what it is

00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:41,120
it makes you look important which is the

00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:44,690
thing that I never thought an editor

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,699
would say to me and so we went to print

00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:48,949
very quickly we finished writing the

00:13:46,699 --> 00:13:51,920
article on June 29th and that was

00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:54,319
published on July 4th in the sex issue

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,880
and there was like I mentioned there was

00:13:54,319 --> 00:13:57,829
another article that just included all

00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,750
survey responses and some excerpts from

00:13:57,829 --> 00:14:03,230
some really funny stories that people

00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:04,910
submitted but then there was us and we

00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:07,279
were doing weird data science on the sex

00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:09,470
information and it included our company

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,060
logo and our names and we were a

00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:12,889
brand-new company at that time so it was

00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:15,259
kind of nerve-racking this is our first

00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:18,410
consulting project that we've done it's

00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:20,110
not the most professional and so this is

00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:22,970
one of the diagrams that we included

00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:26,060
specifically the word that's blacked out

00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:27,439
is a word for vulva or vagina which I

00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:30,680
really wanted them to print and they

00:14:27,439 --> 00:14:33,709
were like you can't say dick and say

00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:34,850
vulva or vagina and so they used to do

00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:36,170
it from word that I don't like so we

00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:37,699
blacked it out but this is our final

00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:39,889
Sankey diagram and I think it does a

00:14:37,699 --> 00:14:41,839
really good job of demonstrating the

00:14:39,889 --> 00:14:44,870
selfish textures if you look at the far

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,220
photo its you can just see in the book

00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:47,600
by bringing the blue Ford you're

00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,189
actually able to see all of these people

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,769
who are asking for things that they

00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:53,029
aren't actually sending and if you

00:14:51,769 --> 00:14:54,649
notice from our earlier Sankey diagram

00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:56,630
this took a bunch of the little

00:14:54,649 --> 00:14:58,040
information out so all sorts of body

00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,630
parts and other things that you could

00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,149
have wanted are just completely removed

00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:03,889
to really simplify the image and then

00:15:02,149 --> 00:15:06,110
even after hours and hours of editing

00:15:03,889 --> 00:15:07,759
the clustering on our own they actually

00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:09,470
went through and made it even more

00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:11,089
simplified removing a lot of the

00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:12,829
features that we considered really

00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:14,269
essential and you think oh when I do a

00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:16,069
data visualization I want to visualize

00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:18,230
all of the data but that's not what

00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:20,140
newspaper editors want if they just want

00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:23,769
the data that seems interesting to them

00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:26,290
so we let them cut it down so then it

00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:27,880
went to print and we were like what's

00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:29,440
this going to look like could be cuts

00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:31,269
for context Jacqueline and I have a

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,649
family together at the time we had like

00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:34,480
a nine month old son

00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:36,190
Nola's is the name of our company and

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,200
our last name which we made up were the

00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:39,790
only no Lass's in the world so the four

00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:42,579
beings that have the last name no lists

00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:45,010
are me my wife my son and this company

00:15:42,579 --> 00:15:47,649
and our first thing going to print is a

00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:49,360
sex article so poor child in the future

00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:51,720
anybody Google's his name and his

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,310
parents sex article is going to come up

00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,329
so we were really scared and we kind of

00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:59,440
brace for impact

00:15:55,329 --> 00:16:01,480
and nothing happened the majority of

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,399
responses we got were from acquaintances

00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,810
that we had fallen out of touch with who

00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:06,490
live across the country and saw our

00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:07,839
article and we're like I have no ideas

00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:10,360
that this is what you're doing now like

00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,890
this is incredible and so it just goes

00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,660
to show that you can go and do something

00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:15,370
really weird and interesting with data

00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:17,860
that might seem a little bit risque and

00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:21,070
receive essentially no professional

00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:23,260
feedback to the point where the our

00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:25,060
co-workers at t-mobile would be like hey

00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:26,589
bring in a copy of the paper and there's

00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:29,199
like a copy of the paper going around

00:16:26,589 --> 00:16:32,589
the office because everybody wanted to

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:35,949
read what be dead and so what did we

00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:38,260
learn from going on this sex journalism

00:16:35,949 --> 00:16:40,149
journey where we really tried to be data

00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:41,949
centric and the first thing that we

00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:44,019
learned is that when somebody says

00:16:41,949 --> 00:16:46,449
here's some data please tell us a story

00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:48,790
and we can't do simple aggregation we

00:16:46,449 --> 00:16:50,769
really become the Nola's LLC spaghetti

00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:53,290
factory and we just throw every tool in

00:16:50,769 --> 00:16:55,269
our toolkit at it until something teases

00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:57,940
out and then we learned good data

00:16:55,269 --> 00:16:59,800
science doesn't equal good journalism so

00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:01,750
like I said earlier with a lot of our

00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,490
graphs they had to be deeply simplified

00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:05,199
to in-depth going to print which I

00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:06,520
wouldn't consider good data scientists

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,040
but they did make extremely beautiful

00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:10,900
visualizations and then the

00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,910
visualizations need lots and lots of

00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:16,329
editorial cleanup I'm finishing my

00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:18,250
master's degree right now and in class I

00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:19,720
had to my professor had to be like yes

00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,459
you can go to this conference of Mises

00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,679
class so he's of course read the

00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:25,270
newspaper article and was like it's a

00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,100
shame that I could never show these

00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:29,380
beautiful visualizations to all of my

00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,640
students because they are so horribly

00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:32,590
inappropriate because this is a

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,530
really a masterclass and how to make

00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:37,870
beautiful visualizations and then the

00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:40,450
last thing is that sex stuff is honestly

00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:41,860
really endlessly funny like looking at

00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:45,010
people's sex lives is endlessly

00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:46,390
interesting and intriguing and we

00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:47,650
thought that we would get bored of it by

00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:49,360
the time that we were done and we were

00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,740
still like now let's put it in again

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,840
let's see what we can do let's play with

00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:56,530
the neural network we could really pull

00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:57,790
our hands off of it and so just to round

00:17:56,530 --> 00:18:00,070
it all out we want to say thank you to

00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:02,830
the stranger who gave us approval to do

00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:05,100
this talk you can see the article at the

00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:07,690
bitly link Jacqueline and I are pretty

00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,730
active on Twitter and then if you went

00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:12,670
like super super professional machine

00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:15,360
learning consulting you can go to NOLA
