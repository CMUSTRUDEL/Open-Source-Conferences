so I would like to thank you all for

00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,410
waking up this morning and coming to my

00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,179
talk on the walk over here I almost

00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,980
wanted to skip my own talk because it's

00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:13,349
so wonderful outside so thank you for

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,000
coming here I really appreciate it and I

00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:16,950
would like to give a special thanks to

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,570
the organizing committee thank you for

00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,850
inviting me it's such a privilege to be

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:24,390
on stage today and to share my journey

00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:26,250
into open source and also working in

00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:31,680
data science and some of the projects

00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:33,150
that's change intro to both of those so

00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,120
I have two questions to pose to the

00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:37,140
audience today there'll be more but

00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,200
these are the two that I'm going to

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,900
start with at least what does it mean to

00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:46,170
be human centered and how do we use data

00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:47,970
to empower build and grow so I'll just

00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:52,079
let that percolate for like 30 seconds

00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:53,940
and this is actually the questions that

00:00:52,079 --> 00:01:01,470
I use to anchor the talk that I'll be

00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:03,960
giving to you today okay 30 seconds is

00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:05,600
long that was uncomfortable okay so when

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,460
I was first thinking about this talk I

00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:11,190
went through many iterations one of the

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,500
iterations was I was going to give a

00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:15,420
journey through my PhD experience using

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,000
all the allegories to Harry Potter books

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,590
and they're basically all the later

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,690
books like before through the end

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,070
because that's where things get dark in

00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:25,070
it pretty much from the beginning but I

00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:27,420
wanted to spare everyone like that

00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:30,210
cathartic moment I shouldn't use the

00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:33,080
stage just like event on that but what I

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:36,600
would like to do is talk about some

00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:40,310
friction points in science where it

00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:43,950
comes to doing analyses using tools

00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:45,930
being able to share your work and I will

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,670
walk you through some of the projects

00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,380
I've been involved with to help reduce

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,020
that friction and at least make it

00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:54,420
easier for scientists to get involved to

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,990
contribute and form communities around

00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,490
it but before I do that I would like to

00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,430
ask you another question I told you

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:04,740
there would be more than two is anyone

00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:10,649
familiar with the book that's on the

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:14,459
screen great so this is a human centered

00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:17,069
data product the this product is called

00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:19,439
the Negro motorists greenbook also

00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:22,859
referred to as the green book and it was

00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:25,650
a way for black travelers to navigate

00:02:22,859 --> 00:02:27,569
through Jim Crow in the u.s. I offer

00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:29,790
recommendations for restaurants that

00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:31,590
they'll feel welcome places where they

00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:35,939
can get their hair cut or their hair

00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:38,129
done or their hair did it offered all of

00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:40,620
these opportunities in spaces where they

00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:43,739
will feel welcome and this product was

00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,209
centered on the human experience so this

00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:46,709
is something that I think it's very

00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:48,480
important when we think about what

00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:50,519
products we're building how do we build

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,079
for the users we shouldn't just build

00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:54,629
tools because it's just like an

00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:58,260
engineering feat we need to have it as a

00:02:54,629 --> 00:03:00,930
way of actually tackling issues that our

00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:08,250
users are facing and this was a very

00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:10,739
important one so do data points about me

00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:13,829
I grew up in Charlotte North Carolina I

00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:17,389
went to UNC Chapel Hill go Tar Heels

00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:20,190
guitar Hill fans okay yeah go Tar Heels

00:03:17,389 --> 00:03:22,319
then I studied linguistics and

00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:25,370
psychology very interested in language

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:28,049
and how the brain understands language

00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:30,889
went to graduate school for cognition

00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:34,709
perception and then I did a postdoc

00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:36,569
essentially in plumbing data plumbing

00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:42,510
and I'll talk about that a bit later in

00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:43,979
the talk so here's some guideposts of

00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:46,139
some of the things I'm gonna cover in my

00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:49,650
talk today first is just my journey into

00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:52,009
open source then we will talk about the

00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:54,269
view source for science the tagline for

00:03:52,009 --> 00:03:56,819
iodide in a project that we're working

00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:59,009
on at Mozilla and piight which is a

00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:02,060
project that is an offshoot of the

00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:05,549
iodide to bringing Python to the browser

00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:07,379
next I will be a fanboying one of the

00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:09,569
projects that we have at Mozilla called

00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:11,639
common voice and I'll talk about why

00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:15,810
it's important for free speech and open

00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:18,239
speech and then I will wrap up the talk

00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:20,820
about CL which is the cognitive

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,950
innovation in education labs and the

00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,810
brain waste project which is how we are

00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:27,180
empowering high school students from

00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:29,680
underserved backgrounds

00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:32,680
opportunities to do first in class

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,860
research using high quality technology

00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:38,110
and providing access to course materials

00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:44,729
that most people in high schools just

00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:46,690
don't even have opportunities to okay so

00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:50,260
first I'm going to take you to the

00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:52,840
beginning of my PhD journey so I joined

00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:55,210
the research lab where there is this

00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:58,150
cookbook if you just follow these steps

00:04:55,210 --> 00:05:00,550
these recipes that are very opaque you

00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:02,290
do it and you just hope the guy that you

00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:04,540
can get a Nature Neuroscience paper out

00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:06,760
of it so I'm going to walk you through

00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:10,900
some of the steps of like how this

00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:12,910
looked and why the tools that I end up

00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:15,370
contributing to really helps with

00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:17,470
demystifying this and actually offering

00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:21,160
transparency into the work flows of

00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:23,350
scientists so I worked in mu G which

00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,940
stands for many to encephalography so we

00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:27,220
would measure the magnetic fields that

00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,990
come from the brain activity most people

00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,750
are familiar with eg where you measure

00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:34,539
the voltage on the scalp so what we know

00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:36,100
from physics or at least what I learned

00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:38,530
from physics that I kind of forgot about

00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:40,750
physics but that every electrical

00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:42,479
current makes a magnetic field and this

00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:44,860
magnetic field can be measured using

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,250
squids special quantum interference

00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:50,200
devices just a fancy way of saying

00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:53,349
magnetometer ii measure very my new

00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,940
magnetic field changes into Tesla and I

00:05:53,349 --> 00:05:56,860
can't even give a reference to what them

00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,590
to Tesla is it's just that R is really

00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:01,690
really really really really really small

00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:04,150
so we have this data that's coming from

00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:06,280
our studies where we would have say a

00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:09,639
hundred and fifty seven channels that

00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:11,620
are covering the scalp it's in a machine

00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:13,750
that looks like a toilet bowl so you put

00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:16,570
your head in there and we just read your

00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:19,330
brain activity it's really cool but it

00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:23,760
was developed this this hardware that we

00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:26,410
had was developed by a very nice

00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:29,139
hardware company where they created

00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:32,440
their own data format and didn't share

00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:36,640
any of the data specifications and there

00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:37,720
was no way to really work with the data

00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:42,270
on

00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:46,960
you were familiar with their tools or

00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:50,950
you basically hacked it so I essentially

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:52,570
end up hacking it what we would need to

00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:55,380
do first was just like export all of the

00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:58,630
data into an ASCII text file so imagine

00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:00,790
thousand Hertz data so thousands samples

00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:02,680
each second that you're recording

00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:04,900
someone for say thirty minutes or an

00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,580
hour where you have a hundred and fifty

00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,710
seven channels and then three reference

00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:11,080
channel and then thirty-two Ziller e

00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:13,230
channels so the the data are just

00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:16,140
growing in size and complexity and

00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:18,550
you're exporting to an ASCII file so

00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:23,020
pour some out for the metadata that we

00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:25,390
lost in this conversion so you would do

00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:28,660
all of this takes about 45 minutes to

00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:31,480
get this file out because that's just

00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:34,000
how the software worked then you have to

00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:36,520
go to the bash type in the command and

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,250
basically convert it to another data

00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:41,110
format and that took around 30 45

00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,150
minutes or so so you're spending like an

00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:46,120
hour and a half before you've ever seen

00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:48,160
the data so this is how it's meant the

00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:50,860
first year of my grad school just did it

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,419
because I was in the software engineer

00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,700
I'm not a software engineer I never

00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:57,700
claimed to be a software engineer I have

00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:59,950
very small experience with programming

00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:02,680
it would be pearl I learned a little

00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:04,720
pearl and my research assistantship that

00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,880
I had and I still don't even know what

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,500
it does or what I was doing

00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,479
it was just like scripts that you just

00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,640
like edit and you're like oh I think it

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:15,760
works now so that was my experience and

00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:17,950
I took a MATLAB class that I felt that

00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:21,280
well I didn't fail I got a c-minus but I

00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:23,530
did miserably and I had to rotate a cow

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,950
and that was like the project in I just

00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:29,050
never understood the the delivery of the

00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:31,870
course material was not in a way that

00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:33,909
was approachable for me being a linguist

00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:36,880
in the psychologists it's like it was

00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:38,260
just scared at I don't even know the

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,760
audience I was scared I don't even think

00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:43,330
computer scientists would actually

00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:46,300
appreciate it so I asked over the

00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:47,500
listserv what was did anyone have any

00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,740
experience with the hard word that we

00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,770
had

00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:53,540
a few people did and they were able to

00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:57,260
point me to some files that they've

00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:59,630
collected over the years this tends to

00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:01,460
happen you'll find like say this one

00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:05,210
file that you just stored here but it's

00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:07,250
never put in an open and an open place

00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:08,960
that anyone else can find reference to

00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,940
so I'm pulling together all these

00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:14,900
resources one is telling me where the

00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:17,420
the pointers to the file the data within

00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:19,690
the files are and how to read the data

00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:22,490
plots and what type of sensors it is and

00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:25,970
this is like my first approach into

00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:29,000
understanding programming so the first

00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:32,620
approach that I had was this you type

00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,570
some bash say some incantations you

00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:38,270
cross your fingers and pray to the 0.05

00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:40,850
gods that you're going to get something

00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:45,500
that just squeeze out some significance

00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:48,890
and then you hope that the nature guide

00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:52,220
shine down on you and made grace your CV

00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:54,950
one day so I didn't really want to like

00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:58,700
buy into this system so I tried some new

00:09:54,950 --> 00:10:03,770
approaches so this is a mini Python so

00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:06,860
M&E was first written in C by one

00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:10,420
developer who's a physicist who wrote it

00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:12,800
it works but see it's a really

00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:15,710
unapproachable language if you haven't

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,420
been taught how to first like dive into

00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:19,490
it you have to worry about memory

00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:23,000
allocation you have to worry about a lot

00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:25,010
of things that modern and interpreted

00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,650
languages really handles for you and

00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:29,810
then I just like gifts there'll be some

00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:33,980
gifts throughout the talk so I hope you

00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:36,950
enjoy them so wow I didn't realize how

00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:40,400
small this was but this is like my first

00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:43,280
commit for this project where I was

00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:46,250
trying to take the data from its native

00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:49,880
file format and read it into a mini

00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:52,100
Python the software for data analysis to

00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:54,830
remove this step of like having to go to

00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:57,230
an ASCII file write bash and then maybe

00:10:54,830 --> 00:11:01,699
get some interpretive old data out of it

00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:03,799
so the first commit I wish

00:11:01,699 --> 00:11:06,379
I can read it to you but I can't but it

00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:08,449
goes to say like hey this is like my

00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:11,839
first attempt it's a work in progress

00:11:08,449 --> 00:11:13,449
love feedback I don't know what I'm

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:17,149
doing and that's essentially how it goes

00:11:13,449 --> 00:11:20,149
and then I actually went back and looked

00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:24,919
and saw that I left like really detailed

00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:26,179
comments in my commit message and one

00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:28,850
thing that I would like to advocate to

00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:31,549
everyone to say remember your commits

00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:34,339
are love letter from the past so make

00:11:31,549 --> 00:11:36,350
sure you fill them with rich data so you

00:11:34,339 --> 00:11:43,459
understand why you did the steps that

00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:45,259
you did so it started in January I spent

00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:47,269
the month this was over a winter break

00:11:45,259 --> 00:11:49,879
and then I essentially got to a point

00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:53,079
where I'm like hey I think it works it

00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:56,059
kind of works it's doing what I expect

00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:57,980
what are the tests that I need in order

00:11:56,059 --> 00:11:59,749
to make sure that's going on I knew that

00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:01,819
tests were like something that is like

00:11:59,749 --> 00:12:04,249
useful in software but I didn't know

00:12:01,819 --> 00:12:06,109
what they were so what is a unit test

00:12:04,249 --> 00:12:08,619
like how do I like make sure like the

00:12:06,109 --> 00:12:11,329
code is doing when I think it's doing so

00:12:08,619 --> 00:12:14,169
this was like my first approach into

00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:19,069
contributing to the open source project

00:12:14,169 --> 00:12:22,429
and then there is this discussion and

00:12:19,069 --> 00:12:25,669
then many more comments and then many

00:12:22,429 --> 00:12:29,179
more commits and then the frustration of

00:12:25,669 --> 00:12:33,679
trying to do a rebase or trying to

00:12:29,179 --> 00:12:35,269
emerge in comments that commits that say

00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:37,100
your fellow colleague would like to

00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:39,079
share with you and this went on and on

00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:41,179
and on and like it got to a point where

00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:43,279
the lead developer and I were on a phone

00:12:41,179 --> 00:12:45,769
call just to like walk through how to

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:51,709
rebase my code because they had gone so

00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:53,989
all right then my first a major PR by

00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:55,970
the numbers I opened three separate pull

00:12:53,989 --> 00:13:01,129
requests because the first two were just

00:12:55,970 --> 00:13:03,199
like lost causes I had a it was around

00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:06,639
104 commit so most of them was like

00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,639
discover pep 8

00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:13,430
now understand Pepe Stu don't understand

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,740
Pepe and that just continued on until I

00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:18,200
started to understand what is the style

00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:20,870
and what it is to write Python that code

00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:23,149
and I started learning a lot from the

00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:25,250
people who were part of this project

00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:27,620
they really like helped contribute to

00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:30,019
like my understanding of how to create

00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:34,250
resources that would be shared and

00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:37,700
useful for others and then after 181

00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:40,160
comments I don't understand why software

00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:44,660
isn't just like peer review because hey

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:47,180
I had to do a lot of work it finally got

00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:49,940
merged and it was such a success it was

00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:53,200
such a rush that I continued and I still

00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:53,200
continue to contribute to this project

00:13:53,649 --> 00:14:01,940
so what this led me to understand is ok

00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:05,779
we are using all of these desperate file

00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:08,510
formats and neuroimaging how do I go

00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:10,160
from say collecting data in my

00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:14,570
experiment and sharing it with a

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:16,850
colleague there hasn't been any real

00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:19,610
efforts to really push this forward

00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:21,890
other than ones that laughs what do for

00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:23,600
themselves and try to get other labs to

00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:27,320
just like buy in there wasn't really a

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:29,390
community effort behind it so the brain

00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:34,490
imaging data structure started as a

00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:38,149
project to standardize MRI data so MRI

00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:40,790
stands for magnetic resonance imaging so

00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:43,220
it's what you get when you go to the

00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:46,490
hospital and say you tore your meniscus

00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:48,380
or they want to see if you had a stroke

00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:50,529
they can put you in the machine and you

00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:55,430
can get these images that come from it

00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:57,170
so this was a way for the MRI

00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:59,690
researchers to standardize their data

00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:01,850
and then the nvg community saw I was

00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:05,959
like oh that will be very useful for us

00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:09,920
to also have so I saw that there was

00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:13,190
like calls to participate in creating

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:16,699
this data standard and I had a lot of

00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:17,710
familiarity 5 years later with different

00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:21,850
formats

00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:24,400
I spent I written a handful of other

00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:27,910
packages to convert their data as well

00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:30,430
so this is really about like how do you

00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,970
take data from one person and connect it

00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,590
to another

00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:35,710
it's the plumbing it's the

00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:39,280
infrastructure it's the that thankless

00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:45,400
thing that you know it's necessary but

00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:47,770
you get your hands dirty doing it so

00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,870
this is just briefly to show you like a

00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:52,450
schematic that we had for how the data

00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:55,810
would be structured and this is a way

00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:58,720
that software developers can really like

00:15:55,810 --> 00:16:01,660
write the specification into their code

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:04,720
to have the data come out and this nice

00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:09,910
and adopted way of sharing your data

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:12,010
which is really cool so the M&E team and

00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:15,490
the bits team they have both been

00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:18,130
working very hard to build community so

00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:19,060
scientists can collaborate and this

00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:21,820
isn't easy

00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:24,340
like getting scientists to collaborate

00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:27,130
it's like herding cats it's not an easy

00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:30,540
thing to do there's also not the same a

00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:32,770
sinter structure to really align with

00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:35,080
collaborating with say team science

00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:36,670
versus individual science everyone's

00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:39,040
fighting for that first author of

00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:43,510
publication and where does that come

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:45,580
when you have a team of 50 so this work

00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:50,950
has to be very intentional and it has to

00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:54,120
be very deliberate this is just a photo

00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:56,290
of like a bunch of data nerds in

00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:59,290
Montreal at the neuroinformatics

00:16:56,290 --> 00:17:01,500
conference and then this is a coding

00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:04,600
spirit that I participated in recently

00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:07,360
to help develop a better standards for

00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:10,480
M&E so special shout-out to Chris Hall

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,510
graph and to Dan mccloy because they've

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:16,000
done a lot of great work and just like

00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:18,760
building out the documentation creating

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,730
tutorials really getting to a point

00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:23,830
where like new contributors can come and

00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:25,959
use the software and feel welcome we

00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:27,670
have a code of conduct we have all of

00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:29,920
these new tools that have been put in

00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:30,710
place to really like help our project

00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:34,130
real

00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:38,029
grow and really benefit the whole

00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:39,710
community so I really think the entire

00:17:38,029 --> 00:17:42,559
team for all the work they've been doing

00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:49,970
and we know that there's much much more

00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:52,940
work to be done next up is a project

00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:56,059
that I've been contributing to I make my

00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:57,919
first site PRS just like a month ago but

00:17:56,059 --> 00:18:00,140
I've been using it since they've been

00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:04,820
working on it for the past year and it's

00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:08,230
called iodide so ioud I why I I why the

00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:10,640
name iodide so one has high

00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:12,289
recognizability you can say iodide and

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,799
people are like oh yeah I can remember

00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:18,620
iodide and it has low confuse ability so

00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:21,830
you don't say have a package name go and

00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:24,020
try to search for go ah ha ha in Google

00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:26,000
search it's really hard to like get up

00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:29,450
to the top when you're competing with a

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,250
lot of like other recognize words so

00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:34,250
we're optimizing for search and it's

00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:36,409
kind of cool it's it's like a shout out

00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:39,500
to the science community especially like

00:18:36,409 --> 00:18:42,710
chemistry the fact that we are trying to

00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:47,000
do what we call have the view source for

00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:50,090
science you're able to see how reports

00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,929
are being created by both having the

00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:57,580
narrative in the code nicely blend it

00:18:53,929 --> 00:18:57,580
together and I'll walk you through it I

00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:07,240
promise you more gifts we have more

00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:09,919
gifts so what are we looking at here so

00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:12,169
these are just like some of the

00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:15,380
notebooks that we've created with iodide

00:19:12,169 --> 00:19:18,710
that allows for you to just really use

00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:21,110
the web browser as a rendering engine

00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:24,559
for all your wild dreams for data

00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:27,350
science which is really neat we're able

00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:29,659
to build on top of all of the web

00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:32,480
technologies in order to bring an

00:19:29,659 --> 00:19:36,620
ecosystem that's very friendly for

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:38,630
sharing among your colleagues so what we

00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:40,490
want to do we want to tell compelling

00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:43,010
and expressive stories and you're able

00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:44,240
to do that using these technologies the

00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:46,190
web has been

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,500
that platform and that rendering engine

00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:51,500
for all the content that we normally

00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:53,270
consume on a daily basis now so you have

00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,970
the benefit of that and it's native to

00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:58,070
the web you can think of it as if you

00:19:55,970 --> 00:20:00,920
read the New York Times the upshot you

00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:03,020
see all of these very cool graphics and

00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:06,920
you would love to know how they made it

00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:08,780
but you can't so this is offering an

00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:11,380
opportunity to see like what is the code

00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:14,210
that built that really neat graph so

00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:17,450
these are some examples of using WebGL

00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:20,300
and the browser the one in the middle is

00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:22,730
the Lorenz attractor and then the one on

00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:25,040
the right is all of the eviction data in

00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:28,700
San Francisco so we can actually pull

00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:31,280
from open open data portals and have it

00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:38,660
import right into your native space and

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:41,990
you can build visualizations from it so

00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:42,830
iodide at a glance if you hit the

00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:45,760
explore button

00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:49,010
you're able to see both the code that

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,000
created it as well as the narrative that

00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:53,570
goes along with it

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,460
so what we have here our code chunks

00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:58,010
that are delimited so you can have

00:20:55,460 --> 00:21:00,110
markdown and where you can have all the

00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:02,960
lot tech that you want to add all those

00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:05,720
equations that you can have to really go

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:09,170
well with you can have here as well as

00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:14,300
JavaScript that's ways of importing very

00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:18,490
cool libraries to do charting and other

00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:22,550
infographics so why javascript

00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:25,670
javascript is native to the web but we

00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:28,640
also wanted to expand what the

00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:31,880
capabilities of this notebook were so

00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:35,090
this is where Piatt diet comes into play

00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:37,160
and I'll give a a slide in just a moment

00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:40,970
about it but the idea behind Piatt Die

00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:44,540
is that we can take the Python stack the

00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:46,880
C Python implementation and we can now

00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:49,309
compile it using web assembly it's just

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,720
really cool it's new technology that has

00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:56,210
been adopted by major browsers for

00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:59,919
rendering native compiled code on the

00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:59,919
web which is really neat

00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:07,970
this goes into this exploration and

00:22:05,179 --> 00:22:10,760
explanation that was highlighted in Adam

00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:13,370
rolls paper where you see computational

00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:15,799
notebooks taking a new life in both

00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:18,140
being a way to express research that

00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:20,480
you're doing also ways to explore that

00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:24,080
research and also to ask other questions

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:25,820
of that research so we're borrowing a

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,700
lot of ideas with ayodhya from

00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:31,460
established projects and we love them

00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:34,760
all the same as well we take from our

00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:36,470
studio and we take from Jupiter lab and

00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:40,190
we're really just trying to create

00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:43,370
another way of sharing content and

00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:46,640
addressing our needs at Mozilla so one

00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:48,770
of the things that we had as a pain

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,410
point at Mozilla is that we normally

00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:54,290
work with by large and large and large

00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:57,230
amounts of data so what we tend to do we

00:22:54,290 --> 00:23:00,230
use distributed computing tools such as

00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:02,660
spark or PI spark which is the Python

00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:06,590
implementation of spark where we can

00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:08,900
pull this data into a data cube that is

00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:11,750
much more manageable so we do our data

00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:14,299
wrangling and aggregation and we're like

00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:17,419
okay what is that analysis that we want

00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:21,770
to tell with this what we have done in

00:23:17,419 --> 00:23:24,440
the past is either export to well very

00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:25,970
early on with export to Google Docs you

00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,740
make your figures you write your

00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:28,850
narrative and this is what you can share

00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:32,840
with the product manager or other

00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:35,000
stakeholders but a lot is lost in doing

00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,590
that you no longer have the source for

00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:41,600
what you're creating and you no longer

00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:44,990
have any of the context for how that

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:47,840
figure was created so we wanted to be

00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:51,200
able to bundle both the code that

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:55,130
rendered those images or those graphs

00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:56,990
and have all the data to come along with

00:23:55,130 --> 00:24:00,080
it and this is what we can now bundle

00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:02,809
with HTML you can just package it all

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:07,960
together and you can ship it and that's

00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:11,389
our idea of sharing data at our company

00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:14,059
so as I mentioned pie-eyed is this new

00:24:11,389 --> 00:24:16,879
which is for implementing Python in the

00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:19,279
browser and it comes with three of the

00:24:16,879 --> 00:24:21,440
major packages as well as as well as

00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:23,299
just like the native Python packages you

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,929
have numpy you have tenders you have

00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:28,129
matplotlib

00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:29,959
that are working just fine it's using

00:24:28,129 --> 00:24:32,719
web assembly to compile it you basically

00:24:29,959 --> 00:24:34,579
fetch and you can have like this entire

00:24:32,719 --> 00:24:37,339
Python environment brought into your

00:24:34,579 --> 00:24:40,519
browser and with this you also have the

00:24:37,339 --> 00:24:43,609
opportunity of using all of the Web API

00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:45,889
s that go along with anything that you

00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:48,739
do in the web framework so this is

00:24:45,889 --> 00:24:51,469
really cool if you say want to plot a

00:24:48,739 --> 00:24:54,139
map plot lit figure on your website you

00:24:51,469 --> 00:24:56,899
can now import the document and then say

00:24:54,139 --> 00:24:59,059
document get that ID and then you can

00:24:56,899 --> 00:25:01,669
just say here's my matplotlib figure and

00:24:59,059 --> 00:25:06,919
it will render and have the full

00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:09,829
expressiveness say a TK output of the

00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:11,629
the plot that you will see in a native

00:25:09,829 --> 00:25:17,389
like Python environment just really

00:25:11,629 --> 00:25:19,369
really really neat and we take from it

00:25:17,389 --> 00:25:22,399
take inspiration from prior work in

00:25:19,369 --> 00:25:25,820
related work of like Pat PJs or is zero

00:25:22,399 --> 00:25:29,359
dependency Python and bright on which

00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:31,820
are other implementations and this is

00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:33,709
what we're doing is just taking the

00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:37,249
native C code and using web assemblies

00:25:33,709 --> 00:25:39,039
so that there's a clear provenance and

00:25:37,249 --> 00:25:42,529
how the work is being done

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:44,359
no transpiling this is actually native C

00:25:42,529 --> 00:25:48,559
Python code running in the browser which

00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:50,659
is pretty neat so we also have some

00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:55,299
experimental packages that we were

00:25:50,659 --> 00:25:55,299
working on so we have support

00:25:55,450 --> 00:26:00,919
experimental support for sy PI you can

00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:05,450
also use scikit-learn in the browser and

00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:07,309
we have support for some parts of the

00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:10,549
for training packages this is like

00:26:07,309 --> 00:26:14,450
Fortran 77 and if you wanted to use like

00:26:10,549 --> 00:26:16,179
more modern Fortran light for 1095 we

00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:18,679
really don't have that support right now

00:26:16,179 --> 00:26:20,209
but the reason that we're interested in

00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:21,960
the Fortran is not because we really

00:26:20,209 --> 00:26:23,940
want to bring Fortran to the

00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:28,019
to the web is that we want to bring our

00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:30,570
to the web and being able to bring our

00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:34,590
to the web will allow for all of those

00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:36,809
saying nice tidy verse implementations

00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:39,509
of your workflow to be able to be

00:26:36,809 --> 00:26:41,369
imported into the space so this is

00:26:39,509 --> 00:26:43,679
really neat and we actually have a call

00:26:41,369 --> 00:26:45,360
for proposals out right now so if you

00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,100
know anyone who's really big into

00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,350
compilers or if you're really big into

00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:52,860
compilers you can apply for the script I

00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:55,289
think I put a slide up here these this

00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:58,019
slide that will be shared after the talk

00:26:55,289 --> 00:27:01,529
so feel free to check it out we're

00:26:58,019 --> 00:27:03,419
taking calls up until the 31st and we

00:27:01,529 --> 00:27:05,190
also have eight other projects that you

00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:08,610
can also apply so maybe

00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:10,549
compilers aren't your huge as there are

00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:16,350
other things that you can also apply for

00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:18,690
so with with this iodide is it's

00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:21,029
building the iodide project it's

00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:23,309
building tools to allow for you to tell

00:27:21,029 --> 00:27:25,499
stories that are kind of compelling in a

00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:26,999
very interactive way and this is just

00:27:25,499 --> 00:27:29,639
one way that we're approaching at

00:27:26,999 --> 00:27:32,159
Mozilla how we can share the reports

00:27:29,639 --> 00:27:36,240
that we're doing and we'll be talking

00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:39,389
much in in the near future I'm working

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:42,179
on a project to bring data science blog

00:27:39,389 --> 00:27:44,730
for Mozilla so we will have a way to

00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:47,100
communicate with our users share the

00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:51,179
reports and be fully transparent with

00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:53,789
the types of things that we're using to

00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:56,519
make our decisions we are only data

00:27:53,789 --> 00:27:59,129
stewards of the data that you allow for

00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:00,570
us to use and we want to show how we're

00:27:59,129 --> 00:28:03,720
using in and how we're informing

00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:06,869
products and this will be one way that

00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:09,990
we can share the reports that we have

00:28:06,869 --> 00:28:12,710
done in order to make better decisions

00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:15,649
on your behalf

00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:19,379
so try it out feedback is welcome

00:28:15,649 --> 00:28:22,169
contribute you can check out these links

00:28:19,379 --> 00:28:24,049
it's a neat project and we would love to

00:28:22,169 --> 00:28:26,549
collaborate with other projects and

00:28:24,049 --> 00:28:29,039
really like figure out how can we

00:28:26,549 --> 00:28:31,590
develop synergy across like all of these

00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:33,550
other projects doing similar things and

00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:41,260
figure out where we can converge

00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:42,580
and work together so another project

00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,930
that we're working on at Mozilla is

00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:45,940
called the common voice project

00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:49,840
I'm not directly involved with this but

00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:52,840
I am such a fanboy of it the idea behind

00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:56,890
all of these lies for the common boys

00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:58,630
have been given to me from our open

00:28:56,890 --> 00:29:00,940
innovation team so you can thank them

00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:04,410
for these like beautiful illustrations I

00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:07,630
really wish I had that design capability

00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:12,550
but the idea behind commonplace is that

00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:16,510
we're trying to allow users to

00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:19,480
contribute to an open data set that is

00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:23,350
privacy protecting done in an ethical

00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:24,910
way and that can be shared freely we

00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:27,450
also would like to build community

00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:30,610
around this project so that we can build

00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:37,560
datasets for the communities that we aim

00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:40,780
to serve so why free speech so this is a

00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:42,520
market segmentation of like voice

00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:45,940
assistant products that are being used

00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:49,120
in the US and what we see is that

00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:53,230
there's an estimated 35 percent per year

00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:56,950
growth from now until 2024 and the use

00:29:53,230 --> 00:30:00,190
of voice assistance so hey Siri hey

00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:02,350
Google hey Alexa these are the voices

00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:05,200
that we've been interacting in the world

00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:07,060
and it's becoming a much more intuitive

00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:10,450
way for us to interact with the

00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:13,720
technology that we use on a daily basis

00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:16,480
but what's happening we actually see

00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:19,480
that even though we have such a huge

00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:22,900
growth in the uptake of voice assistance

00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:28,420
it's being consolidated among just a

00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:32,170
handful of companies which doesn't

00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:34,000
really provide data to the public to

00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:38,410
build their own work and we think that

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:42,430
this is stifling innovation so we as

00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:45,440
Mozilla like to be rebel rousers we like

00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:49,029
to the store of the market our idea is

00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:52,730
if we are able to build community and

00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:56,149
crowdsource and do it in ethical in safe

00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:58,519
ways how can we build tools that can

00:30:56,149 --> 00:31:02,000
compete against these really really

00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:05,539
really big Giants in a ways that empower

00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:12,320
the contributors and the developers to

00:31:05,539 --> 00:31:16,580
create tools using open data so the main

00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:17,929
ingredients behind this is that the main

00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:21,200
ingredients we have behind this is the

00:31:17,929 --> 00:31:26,419
project common voice what common voice

00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:30,019
does is that we take CCO data of like

00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:33,559
written text and we ask our users would

00:31:30,019 --> 00:31:37,610
you read this text and donate your voice

00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:42,169
samples to a collective so the idea you

00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:45,769
go to about the website you read the

00:31:42,169 --> 00:31:48,620
token sentence and then you submit it if

00:31:45,769 --> 00:31:50,779
you would like to contribute this was

00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:53,480
really cool this is a way that we can

00:31:50,779 --> 00:31:57,100
amass the thousands and thousands of

00:31:53,480 --> 00:32:01,580
hours you need to actually make a very

00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:04,700
human-like voice recognition software so

00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:07,460
all of this data is publicly accessible

00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:09,409
we are the second largest public

00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:11,299
accessible data set I think we may have

00:32:09,409 --> 00:32:15,350
become the first but don't quote me on

00:32:11,299 --> 00:32:18,500
that but we have really amassed a lot of

00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:22,399
data from our contributors in ways that

00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:27,100
we are able to build a voice recognition

00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:30,169
model for English that is at around 95%

00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:33,200
human-like which means that it gives an

00:32:30,169 --> 00:32:37,460
error around 5% of the time and this is

00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:44,750
expected in terms of like the

00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:46,759
performance given our data set size so

00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:50,149
the collection of the data is common

00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:53,629
voice and the model that we're using is

00:32:50,149 --> 00:32:58,519
part of the project deep speech so deep

00:32:53,629 --> 00:32:59,330
speech is creating a voice recognition

00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:02,170
model

00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:05,360
that we will actually publicly share

00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:08,510
with the users taking the data from

00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:12,230
common boys as input and then model as

00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:14,150
output it's all in the git repository so

00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:15,020
if you would like to check it out see

00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:18,170
how it works

00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:20,030
offer some suggestions to fine-tuning

00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:23,240
the model you're more than welcome to do

00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:27,740
so and you're more than you're more than

00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:29,810
welcome to join the project so the idea

00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:32,420
behind common voice is part of the

00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:36,320
Mozilla initiative to teach machines how

00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:38,890
real people talk I mentioned English but

00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:41,420
what this project is also doing is

00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:45,920
tapping all of the communities around

00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:48,920
the world Spanish Spanish Portuguese

00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:51,950
French all of the languages that you

00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:56,630
would like what we will do is help you

00:33:51,950 --> 00:34:01,190
find datasets that are openly licensed

00:33:56,630 --> 00:34:03,410
so that we can use and then allow for

00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:05,810
you to use the platform where all the

00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:09,050
data is accessible to you in your

00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:12,620
community and it's creating this way for

00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:18,470
you to crowdsource among your community

00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:25,550
and really have the the opportunity to

00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:27,669
empower and really grow this project so

00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:30,230
karma voice connects the dots at Mozilla

00:34:27,669 --> 00:34:35,030
around our mission around privacy

00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:40,100
diversity and creating the community to

00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:41,870
speech space it's pretty neat and common

00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:45,760
voice empowers our contributors to build

00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:45,760
open voice datasets for their community

00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:51,919
the last project I would like to talk

00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:57,550
about is CL or the cognitive innovations

00:34:51,919 --> 00:35:00,380
in education labs so CL is newly formed

00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:02,390
as of like the past three months and

00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:05,510
there are three of us who are working

00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:08,690
very very hard to get it off the ground

00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:10,390
and really reach out to schools in the

00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:12,099
New York City area

00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:17,589
and I'll tell you a bit more in the next

00:35:12,099 --> 00:35:20,440
slide so our mission as a nonprofit we

00:35:17,589 --> 00:35:23,619
have the aim to deliver high quality low

00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:25,240
cost hands-on real research experience

00:35:23,619 --> 00:35:29,289
to underserved communities in

00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:31,329
underrepresented communities so I'll

00:35:29,289 --> 00:35:34,990
give you some inspiration for some part

00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:39,069
of for why we did this project I taught

00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:42,160
a workshop in Thailand with a colleague

00:35:39,069 --> 00:35:44,410
of mine from undergrad Pia who is a

00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:48,630
Fulbright Scholar and we had this idea

00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:51,579
of blending engineering education and

00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:55,539
cognitive science education in a way

00:35:51,579 --> 00:35:59,079
that's very hands-on fun and engaging so

00:35:55,539 --> 00:36:02,430
we called it DIY cognitive side and the

00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:07,750
idea is that we created to research

00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:10,809
devices one was eye tracker an eye

00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:13,119
tracker that we use a PlayStation Eye

00:36:10,809 --> 00:36:16,359
we got really cheap cameras and we were

00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:21,390
able to tear it apart and retrofit it to

00:36:16,359 --> 00:36:25,750
our needs and then we also 3d printed a

00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:28,630
headset so that we can install an

00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:31,480
open-source EEG microcontroller so that

00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:33,279
we can record brain activity and show

00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:35,650
students their brain activity for the

00:36:33,279 --> 00:36:38,670
first time so it was really neat we were

00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:42,730
taking like off-the-shelf parts and

00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:44,710
low-cost equipment and access to 3d

00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:47,019
printer and putting all these parts

00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:49,660
together to teach both how we're

00:36:47,019 --> 00:36:52,180
building the research equipment and how

00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:54,490
this research equipment can be used in

00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:57,130
order to answer questions that we might

00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:59,049
have and we focused on cognitive science

00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:00,490
because I'm a cognitive scientist and

00:36:59,049 --> 00:37:02,500
I'm really am interested in how people

00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:04,920
think for see you've been act in the

00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:10,200
world and it's a very good way for

00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:14,950
teaching students how they can think

00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:21,400
about the world in a very grounded

00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:24,490
empirical way what came out of this was

00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:28,570
another project called open it's

00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:31,870
which is branded brainwaves brainwaves

00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:34,180
is a project that we received the NIH

00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:38,170
grant for so we have five years of

00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:40,150
funding to teach neuroscience education

00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:42,160
to high school school high school

00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:44,980
students in New York City so the first

00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:48,760
and fifth years for implementing for

00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:51,310
development and implementation and then

00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:54,370
for evaluation and then two three and

00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:56,830
four is for classroom implementation so

00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:58,870
first year for development two three

00:37:56,830 --> 00:38:01,140
four for implementation this for

00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:04,600
evaluation I kind of stumbled on that

00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:07,510
and the idea behind it is that we are

00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:09,820
creating an all-in-one application that

00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:13,120
allows for the student to connect to

00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:16,980
their hardware see the data that is

00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:19,330
streaming in run a psychology experiment

00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:20,800
cognitive neuroscience experiment once

00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:24,700
you throw the brain in it becomes a

00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:29,260
neuroscience experiment and then they're

00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:31,060
able to analyze the data and then write

00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:34,750
a report based on the data and this is

00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:37,000
all built around web technologies that

00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:39,910
pull from open source projects that I've

00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,280
contributed to over the time so this has

00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:45,250
been my way to stitch together say my

00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:47,170
M&E contributions and my JSI

00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:48,910
contributions in the other open source

00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:50,890
project and really bring in those

00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:53,980
communities in a way that we can all

00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:56,470
like bills toward making an app that

00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:58,480
will be used for teaching at high school

00:38:56,470 --> 00:39:00,910
that can be taught in colleges and

00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,860
taught in many other places where you

00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:09,070
really want to give a hands-on

00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:11,200
experience for research methods so this

00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:12,790
is you can actually go to our github and

00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,010
like download it and check it out if

00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:17,590
you're interested you can also send us

00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:20,410
issues in file for requested you're

00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:24,340
really daring but what we have now we

00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:26,890
have we have a way of visualizing the

00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:30,130
brain data and then we can run this

00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:31,900
thesis versus houses experiment and we

00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:34,390
were able to time what the brain

00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:37,240
activity did that's coming in with the

00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:37,880
screen presentation so students are

00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:42,680
starting to

00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:46,190
understand how we tackle these issues in

00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:48,950
the lab for trying to make inferences on

00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:54,140
what we see and how the brain responds

00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:56,450
to it we also do a professional

00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:58,970
development training where we train our

00:39:56,450 --> 00:40:01,610
teachers so our approach is that we work

00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:05,450
with teachers because they're experts in

00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:08,360
teaching and we are providing domain

00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:11,300
expertise in cognitive neuroscience so

00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:15,130
we doing a lot of lateral transfer of

00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:20,690
knowledge so we come in as partners and

00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:22,790
with this we are able to do a unit where

00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:24,530
we do sheep brain dissections which is

00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:26,570
really cool and the students actually

00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:27,920
you get to die set sheep brains and then

00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:30,410
we run through a host of other

00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,450
experiments in our first unit and then

00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:34,250
in the second unit they get to use the

00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:36,650
brainwaves app where they're developing

00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:40,160
their own experiment and run it and on

00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:43,430
the classmates and it's a really great

00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:46,130
way for them to engage in the scientific

00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:48,590
method it puts them in the driver's seat

00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:50,990
and it gives them opportunities to

00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:55,040
really explore what it is to be a

00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:58,340
scientist and really have like true

00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:59,930
grounding and what goes on and all of

00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:02,300
the text books that they read they have

00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:05,090
like some idea how the information got

00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:06,680
there and our target demographic is that

00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:08,720
we're working with title one schools in

00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:10,850
New York City so that means that half

00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,770
the student populations on free or

00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:16,460
reduced lunch and it tends to be

00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:19,850
disproportionately people of color the

00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:22,700
kids so we're really trying to tackle

00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:24,770
the intersection of both the underserved

00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:26,900
community the underrepresented community

00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:33,080
in those who lie at the intersection of

00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:35,300
both so CL and brain ways they both help

00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:38,960
foster growth and hands-on experiments

00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:42,560
and data collection and this has been my

00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:44,870
way of navigating through both the

00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:47,030
projects that I've contributed to to the

00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:50,270
work that I'm doing now I'm Mozilla and

00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:51,170
then also work that I'm doing in the

00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:53,390
community

00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:56,750
in ways that we can really like Center

00:41:53,390 --> 00:42:00,920
people and the way that we create data

00:41:56,750 --> 00:42:04,099
tools and ways that we approach looking

00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:05,530
at the world around us so I'd like to

00:42:04,099 --> 00:42:09,579
thank you all for your attention and

00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:09,579
