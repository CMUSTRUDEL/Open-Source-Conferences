Description: 
	Despite the tech world’s image of being fast-moving and constantly evolving, segments of those working in, or wanting to work in, tech are often told to wait. It’s no secret that the tech and data worlds do not reflect the nation’s diversity. And for those of us working in Civic Tech or Public Interest Technology, the struggle to secure long-term funding for projects or identify career paths is real. What if we shifted our mindset from “with a lot of time and a lot of work, we’ll figure it out,” to “let’s experiment and incite change today.” The time is now to tackle the question: as the data-driven community matures, how does it do so in a way that’s inclusive and sustainable?

hi my name is a FOA Bruce and I'm until

00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:08,850
the time of now to start this

00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:13,140
presentation so I will kick it off a

00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:15,690
couple of caveats for you one if you

00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,820
were looking for someone to just talk at

00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:20,160
you for the next 20 or 25 minutes you

00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,869
are in the wrong place I hope that this

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,900
will be a discussion and that we all can

00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:27,180
talk amongst each other because we are

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,890
here not just to make friends and to

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,410
have a good time but also to figure out

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:36,179
some real solutions to some challenges

00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:37,920
that we're facing and then secondly I am

00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:39,510
director of engineering of new America's

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,149
Public Interest technology program

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:44,219
Public Interest technology is the term

00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:46,949
that we use and how we define the

00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:49,019
industry that we're in for how we can

00:00:46,949 --> 00:00:50,850
develop technology and policy better

00:00:49,019 --> 00:00:53,159
together I know that there are other

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,239
terms other people use just Civic tech

00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:56,909
tech4good

00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:00,089
Java Tech and a whole list of other

00:00:56,909 --> 00:01:02,100
things if you feel strongly about a

00:01:00,089 --> 00:01:05,040
different term please put that aside for

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,270
at least the next 25 minutes because

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,450
I'll be referring to the Public Interest

00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:11,430
technology and so with that we'll go

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,860
ahead and get started and tell you how I

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,740
found myself in the field of Public

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,690
Interest technology how many of you

00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:23,820
would describe yourself in some type of

00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:27,000
tech for a good work space okay so most

00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:28,500
of us and as I have done research and

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,880
read a lot of research we've got some

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,100
research being conducted through near

00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,080
America what I am finding is that most

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:37,230
people did not plan on this career path

00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:39,360
when they were in school or at any time

00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:41,320
and they just sort of happened in to

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,300
where they are my story is

00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,250
learn my undergraduate degree is in

00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:48,850
computer engineering and I started off

00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:51,010
my career expecting to be making a lot

00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:53,170
of money for a big tech company I

00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:56,890
started off my career working as a

00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:58,810
software engineer at IBM working on some

00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:01,390
of their big servers and big

00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:03,400
applications from there I went back to

00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,100
grad school after doing suffering for a

00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:08,679
few years and made what was the next

00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:11,380
obvious logical decision which was to go

00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:15,250
and join the FBI to do strategy of their

00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:17,320
science and technology program so I did

00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,480
that for a couple of years before then

00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:21,550
going to the White House where I ran the

00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:24,070
National Science and Technology for a

00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:25,690
couple of years and doing a lot of

00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:27,880
policy work the National Science and

00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:30,730
Technology Council for those of you who

00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:32,170
are not familiar it coordinates about a

00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:34,959
hundred different federal interagency

00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:36,580
groups federal government invests about

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,590
a hundred and forty billion dollars a

00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:41,320
year in science and technology research

00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:43,390
and development and the NSCC is the

00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,350
primary coordination mechanism between

00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:48,970
all of those agencies and finally I

00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:50,260
ended up where I am now as director of

00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:52,930
engineering for Public Interest

00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,850
technology and so really looking at how

00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:57,160
can we develop technology in better ways

00:02:54,850 --> 00:03:00,340
how can we develop policy tech policy

00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:02,440
specifically and better ways how can we

00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:05,049
take some of the technical thinking and

00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:07,299
technical innovation and apply it to the

00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:09,640
policy making process so the policy

00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:13,030
making process can be more reflective of

00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:15,579
people's actual needs and interests and

00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:18,040
we've done in a way that gets better

00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:20,500
outcomes for people and similarly

00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,450
similarly for technology development how

00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,730
are we doing that in more ethical ways

00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:27,090
in ways where we are thinking through

00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:30,190
the long-term implications of our work

00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:32,980
and ways that take into account policy

00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:35,530
because especially as policy and

00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:37,810
regulation don't keep up with technology

00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:39,970
development by designing technology

00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:43,480
people essentially design policy

00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:46,120
themselves so part of what attracted me

00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:49,329
to this phase was that technology moves

00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,630
quickly my mind is like many of yours

00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:52,970
problem

00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:56,030
is always thinking of something and

00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:57,890
because of my passion on making a

00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:59,720
difference in some of the really big

00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:02,210
intractable problems that we face in

00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:04,400
society it makes sense that we had

00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:06,590
applied technology it's may be so fast

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,600
these big problems because then we would

00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:11,840
be able to solve all these big problems

00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:13,490
so quickly right that's all we would

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,100
have to do unfortunately

00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:18,800
yes you all know that is not all we had

00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,209
to do or we wouldn't have the

00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,800
homelessness rate that we have we

00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:23,660
wouldn't have some of the hunger issues

00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:28,430
that we have and a whole host of other

00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:31,670
issues and so technology goes hand in

00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:33,710
hand often with innovation I did a quick

00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:36,260
Google search on technology and

00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:38,240
innovation earlier and nearly 1 billion

00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:41,750
headedness came up because that is what

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:44,390
everyone thinks and so it would seem to

00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:46,250
me that we should be able to apply

00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:48,230
technology in this innovation and to

00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:50,210
solve these big challenges that no one

00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:52,550
has ever solved before right if we can

00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:54,800
move quickly and if we can innovate and

00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:56,840
do technological innovation we should

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,540
surely be able to quickly solve

00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:03,860
everything because that is what we as

00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:06,260
technologists can do if any of you I

00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:09,620
have figured out how to solve

00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:11,870
homelessness or hunger or climate change

00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:14,270
and are sitting on the idea for

00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:17,210
ourselves now is a great time to share

00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:20,150
it any time is a great time to share it

00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:23,480
but but that's not what I see instead I

00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:25,220
see myself and several other people who

00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:28,840
are doing this type of work and leading

00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:31,670
Public Interest technology programs

00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,980
taking on the same thing so my life is a

00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:35,960
program lead for a Public Interest

00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:37,580
technology program there are four main

00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:40,130
categories of work that I do

00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:43,280
the first is managing our implementation

00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:45,410
projects because we need to be actually

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,270
doing this work not just talking about

00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:49,330
the need for doing this work or talking

00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:51,340
about the problem themselves

00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:54,490
a problem admiration that I think we can

00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:57,039
also we can often fall into but actually

00:05:54,490 --> 00:06:00,490
doing work and making a difference in

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:02,139
people's lives and structures I have

00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:04,539
created this society that we're and now

00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:07,300
the second thing that takes up a lot of

00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:09,189
my time is fundraising for both pour

00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:12,250
costs and operating costs how are we

00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:15,280
paying people what we hope is a good and

00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:17,530
fair salary to do this work as well as

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,560
creating and infrastructure so this work

00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:21,930
can continue and that people from all

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,629
different backgrounds and all different

00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:28,000
situations can have access to technology

00:06:25,629 --> 00:06:31,509
to top-of-the-line technology solutions

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,819
and policies the third part is building

00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:35,440
partnerships with governments nonprofits

00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:37,990
and communities in themselves so that we

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,930
can actually do this work for public

00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:43,719
access technology type work it shall we

00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:45,909
say will not work if you are not

00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:47,699
actually partnering with the communities

00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:49,960
that are effective you are not actually

00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:52,689
partnering with nonprofits that are

00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,310
doing this work on an ongoing basis if

00:06:52,689 --> 00:06:57,460
you're not partnering with governments

00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:59,379
it does us no good to sit in our own

00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,779
silos and think about how the world

00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:03,819
should be and design solutions for those

00:07:01,779 --> 00:07:06,279
worlds if we haven't taken the time to

00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:09,129
build partnerships to actually implement

00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:11,589
those solutions and to carry them on and

00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:13,300
also to actually get input from people

00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:16,509
who will be affected by what we're doing

00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:18,159
and implement from there and then the

00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:20,409
final category is learning from other

00:07:18,159 --> 00:07:22,599
people in this space and teaching others

00:07:20,409 --> 00:07:24,849
in and about the Public Interest

00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:27,159
technology space so I will be the first

00:07:24,849 --> 00:07:29,440
to admit that to new America is not the

00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:31,240
are not the first people to sit around

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,129
and think hey maybe we should do

00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,810
technology and policy development in a

00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:36,760
different way maybe they would go and

00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:37,900
again it's been going on for

00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,370
time and it's important that we've

00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:41,410
learned some of the lessons of people

00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:42,760
who've been in this space for a while

00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:45,220
and what's got a while in what hasn't

00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:47,410
gone well but also as we continue to

00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:49,450
evolve our model of how we operate in

00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:51,490
our models of how we do business it's

00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:53,500
important to share back those lessons

00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:57,310
learn the broader community so that we

00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:59,860
can all move forward together which

00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:01,630
brings me to the common struggles so as

00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,010
I go to different conferences and build

00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:05,680
these relationships with other people

00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:07,960
who are doing this work it can really

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,750
put me boil down to people who are

00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:12,580
passionate about a mission always see

00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,650
additional things things that can be

00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:17,380
done as much progress has been made

00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:19,180
we may have pat ourselves on the back

00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:21,760
and they congratulate each other for a

00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:24,010
little bit and we quickly moved to what

00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:26,200
else can be done or we quickly moved to

00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:28,210
how can we assisting in this how are we

00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,070
going to fund this work or you're going

00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:31,540
to find more people to do this work how

00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:33,790
we're going to continue to attract

00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:37,090
people to do this work and make these

00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:41,200
ideas scale and grow and so we're all

00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:44,410
facing these problems and part of I

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,960
think what this boils down to is really

00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:48,930
what do we mean by innovation so that

00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:52,390
idea the tech and innovation go together

00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:55,390
innovation being creating new things or

00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:56,770
creating things in a new way I think we

00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:59,020
really need to ask ourselves in this

00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:00,730
space are we innovating what we work on

00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:02,560
and just applying techniques that we've

00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:04,990
seen in other sectors in other

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,240
industries or are we actually innovating

00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:09,790
and how we do the work and I would argue

00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,530
that we should continue to be more

00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:14,110
mindful or try to be more of mindful

00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:16,150
about innovating how we do the work so

00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:18,610
how we structure ourselves how we search

00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:20,560
for funding how we actually organize

00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:22,360
ourselves and build different models to

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,300
do the work I think that if we continue

00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:28,150
to rely on models that have been

00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:29,770
successful in other spaces we will

00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:32,410
recreate some of the challenges that

00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:35,980
we've seen in other spaces I think that

00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:37,209
for continued progress and sustained

00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,829
impact in the state

00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:41,259
for good or Public Interest technology

00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:44,619
space we really need to focus in on

00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:47,410
three main areas the first is diversity

00:09:44,619 --> 00:09:48,999
inclusion inclusion the second is the

00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:50,829
working model so exactly how we

00:09:48,999 --> 00:09:52,660
structure ourselves and how we organize

00:09:50,829 --> 00:09:55,709
ourselves to do the work the third

00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:58,329
category is funding the work itself oh

00:09:55,709 --> 00:10:00,819
and on the first point diversity

00:09:58,329 --> 00:10:03,819
inclusion this is one of my favorite /

00:10:00,819 --> 00:10:06,459
least favorite topics because for as

00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:08,170
much as I think we use the terms we're

00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:10,089
struggling with diversity and inclusion

00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:12,249
I sometimes wonder if people are

00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:13,899
actually struggling with it or if we

00:10:12,249 --> 00:10:16,959
have mentioned it once and assume that

00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:20,019
it's going to take care of itself so

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,850
Paulo Pitino who's the founder of the

00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:23,920
company named hilarya and also the

00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:25,899
quantitative study of diversity and

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,819
inclusion at the City College of New

00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:30,129
York describes that as without

00:10:27,819 --> 00:10:34,360
intentionality you'll regress demeans

00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:37,569
with diversity inclusion and mean for

00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:40,240
white the diversity makeup of at least

00:10:37,569 --> 00:10:42,399
big tech looks like is not good and that

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,869
it doesn't reflect what America looks

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,879
like and it doesn't reflect what the

00:10:43,869 --> 00:10:48,160
world that's like in general I think

00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:50,019
it's important that we be intentional

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,480
about the stories that we tell about who

00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:54,220
is doing this work and the roles that

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,990
people have to play and we also

00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:58,119
acknowledge that there's the difference

00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:00,999
between designing for people and

00:10:58,119 --> 00:11:02,879
designing with them and also including

00:11:00,999 --> 00:11:04,839
people at the table and actually

00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,399
inclusion which would mean that you

00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:08,610
actually hear everyone's voice as

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,290
opposed to just having them at the table

00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,999
the second category that I would earn

00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:15,610
that I would argue that we need to

00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:17,319
really think awfully through is our

00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:20,049
working models or how we do this work

00:11:17,319 --> 00:11:22,149
I'm a new America and one of our big

00:11:20,049 --> 00:11:23,709
funders is the Ford Foundation who is

00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:26,410
funding a lot of fellowships in the

00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:28,720
Public Interest technology space in the

00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:31,089
broader Civic tech and more space there

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,089
are fellowships after fellowships after

00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:37,410
fellowships which are great they are one

00:11:34,089 --> 00:11:39,440
model could there perhaps me another way

00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:42,250
organizations that

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,940
in this space probably tend to fall into

00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:46,129
organizations that are doing some

00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:49,370
combination of consolidating analyzing

00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:51,440
or presenting data other organizations

00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:53,540
really base their work on community

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:57,170
partnerships being placed within a

00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:59,870
community or around a specific specific

00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:02,000
mention of thinking of a couple of

00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:03,019
mission technologist organizations where

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,329
they are really embedded in the

00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:08,540
community and using your data to advance

00:12:05,329 --> 00:12:10,189
those community issues and the fourth

00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,720
category of the working models and are

00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:13,759
people who just create a standard

00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,410
business and say here's what we're

00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:16,899
serving and here's what we're selling

00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:21,350
and go from there

00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:23,509
the third category is how we fund the

00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:25,610
work so again I think there four areas

00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:28,129
here we have our philanthropic dollars

00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:30,709
going which brings with it is a struggle

00:12:28,129 --> 00:12:33,290
with managing expectations and desires

00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:36,740
of funders finding a multi-year funding

00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:39,350
covering core cost academic grants a lot

00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:41,389
of research especially and test cases

00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:45,199
are done in the university space and

00:12:41,389 --> 00:12:47,750
looking at how universities apply for

00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:52,399
and receive grants the third or fiscal

00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:56,180
sponsors such as such as just different

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,649
organizations that hold the entity is

00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:59,810
essentially so that they can process

00:12:57,649 --> 00:13:02,810
their money from corporations or other

00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:04,310
places to fund operating expenses and

00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:06,439
the fourth category of social

00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:08,720
enterprises of people who use that

00:13:06,439 --> 00:13:13,269
designation to create essentially a

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:16,759
business to to market and sell our work

00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:18,589
and so with these three categories I'd

00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:21,709
like you all to be able to think through

00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:22,180
what is one thing that you can do and

00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:23,529
one

00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:26,470
these three categories that you can

00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:28,720
leave here this week and do differently

00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:30,100
or once throughout the rest of the

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,440
conference because I know this is our

00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:34,510
first session of the two-day conference

00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:37,180
what is something that you really want

00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:38,589
to key in on and take from the rest of

00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:42,330
the talks and the keynotes

00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:45,760
to address in these three areas and so

00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:48,160
we have a few more minutes ten more

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:52,149
minutes and so I would like to actually

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:55,089
take five minutes for you to pair up or

00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:56,890
in groups of three and talk with your

00:13:55,089 --> 00:13:59,760
neighbor I'm gonna be your new best

00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:02,260
friend for the next 12 minutes anyway

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:05,020
what is one thing you'll do in one of

00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:07,300
these categories and so don't want you

00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:09,310
didn't necessarily try and solve the

00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,510
world's problems if you can in the next

00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:12,580
five minutes awesome

00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:15,790
please come tell me afterwards but in

00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:19,240
groups of two or three pick one of these

00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:20,709
three areas and talk through what is

00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,680
something you could do differently or

00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:25,510
someway in your day job you could make a

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:29,110
difference and think of new ways to

00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:31,480
improve how we conduct business is in

00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:33,459
regards to diversity and inclusion in

00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:37,089
regards to different working models and

00:14:33,459 --> 00:14:42,060
regards to finding the work yeah start

00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:42,060
my time okay oh great

00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:09,730
[Music]

00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,459
check

00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,000
check

00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:35,169
[Music]

00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:19,619
[Music]

00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:26,489
[Music]

00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:51,130
[Music]

00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:56,980
about one more minute

00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,629
check

00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,110
to

00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:40,899
- truth

00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:40,899
check

00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:52,310
all the mics are working now

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,250
[Music]

00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:20,160
all right

00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:23,550
so

00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,050
I love hearing the engagement looking

00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:27,630
around I didn't see any conscientious

00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:31,550
observers from this process so that is

00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:36,690
great I have a wonderful mic runner here

00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:38,430
Daniel and so I am curious in the five

00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:41,310
minutes that we have left because they

00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:43,470
Daniel forcibly pushed us out at that

00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:46,560
time is there anyone who would like to

00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:49,590
share back either question based on my

00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:57,900
talk or more importantly what you talked

00:19:49,590 --> 00:20:01,130
about in your soccer's is there anyone

00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,130
who has a joke they want to share

00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:14,970
no jokes and ok wait how does an ocean

00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:16,800
say hello it way it ways my girl I was

00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:18,210
excited to see the framework that you

00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:22,080
presented with these are the three

00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:25,380
priorities so we're a non-profit also in

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:27,660
I like tech friggin space and we've

00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:30,990
identified these as priorities for us as

00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:34,440
well around accessibility operational

00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:35,940
efficiency and revenue generation so if

00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,040
you're like even just hearing you

00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:41,580
articulate those as shared challenges is

00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:42,930
really valuable I don't know what we

00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:45,660
want to say that we're doing

00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:47,730
specifically on those but in terms of

00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:50,550
the intentionality around equity and

00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:52,950
inclusion that's something that we're

00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:56,400
really focusing on and maybe a question

00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:58,530
for you is we're realizing you know this

00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,150
is obvious but you need to put real

00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:02,490
resources towards this you know that

00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:05,820
staff time that's maybe spending money

00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:10,350
on things and how you talk about that in

00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:12,450
order to get the funding required to be

00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:14,730
intentional and making people realize

00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:17,490
that it does require real working real

00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:19,419
resources yeah excellent I'm I won't

00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:23,229
quickly respond

00:21:19,419 --> 00:21:25,269
on someone else so I I think admitting

00:21:23,229 --> 00:21:27,849
you have a problem is the first step to

00:21:25,269 --> 00:21:29,049
fixing the problem and so I think I find

00:21:27,849 --> 00:21:30,279
it actually really encouraging when

00:21:29,049 --> 00:21:32,619
other organizations in the public

00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:34,899
interest acknowledges please recognize

00:21:32,619 --> 00:21:36,789
that there are actual challenges that we

00:21:34,899 --> 00:21:38,919
need to like you said put resources

00:21:36,789 --> 00:21:40,659
buying them I think one of the things

00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:43,299
now we have found at new America to be

00:21:40,659 --> 00:21:45,009
successful and also we found through

00:21:43,299 --> 00:21:47,379
research of other organizations to be

00:21:45,009 --> 00:21:50,229
successful is really embedding the

00:21:47,379 --> 00:21:52,329
equity and inclusion conversation into

00:21:50,229 --> 00:21:54,669
the work itself and so not trying to

00:21:52,329 --> 00:21:58,509
fund it necessarily as a separate task

00:21:54,669 --> 00:22:01,149
that is off here we do our work and we

00:21:58,509 --> 00:22:04,299
do diversity and inclusion but really

00:22:01,149 --> 00:22:06,399
building that language into the grants

00:22:04,299 --> 00:22:08,019
answer the program's themselves and so

00:22:06,399 --> 00:22:11,070
it's vetted throughout the organization

00:22:08,019 --> 00:22:13,929
as opposed to being its own fertile

00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:15,879
other reflections or other insights from

00:22:13,929 --> 00:22:21,339
conversations or responses tonight I

00:22:15,879 --> 00:22:23,440
think ok I don't work in tech for good

00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:25,209
but I work out like a big company and

00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,469
one of the things that I'm on a design

00:22:25,209 --> 00:22:28,229
team one of the things that stuck with

00:22:26,469 --> 00:22:30,849
me that I want to take back is the

00:22:28,229 --> 00:22:32,440
concept of designing way instead of

00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:35,799
designing for exciting if that's

00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:44,559
something that gets lost very easily so

00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:46,869
yeah thanks so our group talked about

00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,219
diversity inclusion and I think we we

00:22:46,869 --> 00:22:49,779
all shared the frustration that probably

00:22:48,219 --> 00:22:52,359
many people in this room felt that you

00:22:49,779 --> 00:22:53,649
have about how can we do it but the one

00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:55,539
thing that we felt that actually can

00:22:53,649 --> 00:22:57,399
really be effective is mentoring people

00:22:55,539 --> 00:23:00,039
in a very young age because the

00:22:57,399 --> 00:23:01,539
diversity at undergraduate level is it's

00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:03,609
much higher than when you get higher in

00:23:01,539 --> 00:23:06,339
career so encouraging young people to

00:23:03,609 --> 00:23:09,039
stay on that path can and we think we

00:23:06,339 --> 00:23:10,239
hope really make a difference yeah I

00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,999
think that's I think that's right on

00:23:10,239 --> 00:23:14,709
mentoring is important the legally leaky

00:23:12,999 --> 00:23:17,289
pipeline if you are people familiar with

00:23:14,709 --> 00:23:17,809
the term leaky pipeline some people are

00:23:17,289 --> 00:23:21,019
not

00:23:17,809 --> 00:23:22,820
it's essentially excuse me especially

00:23:21,019 --> 00:23:24,349
when looking at diversity just the

00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:26,389
different points at which people fall

00:23:24,349 --> 00:23:30,379
out of the pipeline for various reasons

00:23:26,389 --> 00:23:32,539
even when you look at rates of interest

00:23:30,379 --> 00:23:37,789
into technical careers for example at

00:23:32,539 --> 00:23:39,950
the high school level black girls have I

00:23:37,789 --> 00:23:41,659
think the highest interest in STEM

00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:43,519
careers and yet when you look at the

00:23:41,659 --> 00:23:45,109
number of graduates or even 10 years out

00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:48,559
of graduation what that looks like and

00:23:45,109 --> 00:23:50,719
so the resources that should be applied

00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:53,330
mentoring and others to address that

00:23:50,719 --> 00:23:55,099
linking pipeline are really important

00:23:53,330 --> 00:24:06,080
I think we've time for wire to more

00:23:55,099 --> 00:24:08,960
reflection one thing that I really

00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:11,629
noticed helps is explicitly inviting

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,599
single people like when I have

00:24:11,629 --> 00:24:16,339
conversations about this a lot of our

00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:18,109
groups kind of just give a call out like

00:24:16,339 --> 00:24:21,409
we want people of color to come to this

00:24:18,109 --> 00:24:23,629
event and that that's like something a

00:24:21,409 --> 00:24:25,909
lot of people don't show up to but if

00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:27,649
you're talking to these people one thing

00:24:25,909 --> 00:24:29,960
that I've started doing it's just if I

00:24:27,649 --> 00:24:31,909
see someone a woman who wanted the

00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:34,669
smallest interest in program name is

00:24:31,909 --> 00:24:37,729
like a personal mentorship like I'm here

00:24:34,669 --> 00:24:41,839
for you I am ready to do this I think

00:24:37,729 --> 00:24:44,089
and now oh and the other point is to

00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:45,889
also team up with organizations that

00:24:44,089 --> 00:24:49,519
that's their goal so recently I started

00:24:45,889 --> 00:24:51,769
working with an organization in Arizona

00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:55,460
that especially for Latin acts

00:24:51,769 --> 00:24:57,200
communities and there's a whole slew of

00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:59,359
people associated with that community

00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,399
and have the passion for that as opposed

00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:03,950
to just kind of like giving the call out

00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:05,330
and I don't know I'm trying to kind of

00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:07,519
think about that it's like a more

00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:09,190
focused and it takes a little bit more

00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:14,749
effort but I think it brings a lot more

00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:17,509
to the table yeah so I we're finished

00:25:14,749 --> 00:25:19,369
I'm sorry targeting specific

00:25:17,509 --> 00:25:20,899
partnerships and invitations are really

00:25:19,369 --> 00:25:22,460
important thank you so much for your
