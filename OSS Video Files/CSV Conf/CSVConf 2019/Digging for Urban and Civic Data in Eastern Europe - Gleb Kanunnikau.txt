Title: Digging for Urban and Civic Data in Eastern Europe - Gleb Kanunnikau

Description: 
	The Open Data and Open Knowledge movement in developing countries is constantly bumping against the paradoxical question: is there a way to open up data when the datasets aren't yet present? Where do you get the data to make your effort worthwhile and how do you scale to make the initiative relevant to the larger society? More importantly, do the data producers (the state bodies and the surveillance apparatus, social networks or municipal service providers) share the interest of publishing data for everyone's and society's benefit? Is there a way to dig out interesting and relevant datasets that people didn't know existed to show new ways to analyze and fight urban problems, educate people about the environment, propose solutions to post-Soviet problems like unemployment, decaying public infrastructure, never-digitized cultural assets? Do we cooperate with the fashionable "Smart city" projects funded by Chinese state corporations or remain vary of the surveillance methods they introduce in cooperation with the police and other government structure? Practical cases, civic hacking and citizen data science, establishing cooperation between unlikely partners and other questions of interest for anyone interested in the community building process from scratch.

my name is grabbed I'm from dorms we run

00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:14,559
an open beta group in Minsk and the

00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:17,230
several dozen public around more than

00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:20,380
100 people participating mostly students

00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:25,239
researchers from scientific libraries

00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:27,669
and there are some journalists and we're

00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:30,220
trying to find sources later that will

00:00:27,669 --> 00:00:32,500
help to understand what's happening in

00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:37,030
our country and how to deal with social

00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:39,579
and civic issues according to open data

00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:42,760
barometer the station with openly taking

00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:45,910
dollars is pretty bad because you're

00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:48,519
ninety three out of ten and fifteen

00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:49,870
countries surveyed which basically means

00:00:48,519 --> 00:00:51,820
that there is some data that the

00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:55,989
government is collecting but it's not

00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:58,120
sharing almost anything and the problems

00:00:55,989 --> 00:01:00,370
are basically that even if there is data

00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:02,289
the government either wants to sell it

00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:06,310
because it costs them money to produce

00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:06,700
it or sometimes the people who are in

00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:09,070
charge

00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,930
hold it and they just don't want to be

00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:13,390
responsible for any mistakes that are in

00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:16,960
the data there is no freedom of

00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:19,960
information a legal framework just no

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:23,320
law at all and we cannot find out with

00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:25,450
of Freedom of Information requests there

00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,280
is a procedure for a spur to ask for

00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:30,219
basically a response from the government

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:35,110
but it can come as you know printed

00:01:30,219 --> 00:01:37,930
letter and see this data could be

00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:43,119
available but it's not so there are no

00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:45,609
possible and most people are journalists

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,229
and researchers don't know about wicked

00:01:45,609 --> 00:01:50,670
eat OpenStreetMap and we are trying to

00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:53,950
change that but there is a special case

00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:57,609
some of the data is closed as national

00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:59,790
security staff basically KGB archives

00:01:57,609 --> 00:02:07,340
and archives about what

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:10,410
was happening during the USSR period so

00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:13,080
yeah I just want to give a bit of

00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:14,820
background about the country is

00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,120
basically the population of New York

00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:19,860
City in terms of population size there

00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,720
are two official languages the ocean

00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:24,990
Russian which makes things a bit more

00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,880
complicated because we have one off

00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:31,110
about but two variations so special

00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:34,050
characters who any work with archived

00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:36,660
data from let's say 100 years ago we

00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:40,370
have five or six or seven or eight

00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:42,300
languages that were in official use

00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:44,280
basically there are no minorities

00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,290
because everyone is multilingual so in

00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,720
my family speak four languages because

00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:52,530
of real parents were from four different

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:55,500
communities and the cities which had

00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:58,650
traditionally more scientific data

00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,660
collected and archived data saved were

00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:04,610
traditionally Jewish Polish and Russian

00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:08,489
and the determination the option was

00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:10,380
less had less access to education and it

00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:12,270
was concentrated in the rural areas so

00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:16,620
it's much harder to find information

00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:20,760
about the only rational approach and you

00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:22,920
know Hebrew sources and it's all

00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,410
changing very fast material if in a

00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:28,350
matter of days it's been changing as

00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:30,690
there are waves of migration before the

00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:34,590
Soviet Union is again integrated and

00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:36,810
after that but it's it's a really

00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:39,600
interesting place so you could say it's

00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:44,459
a flyover country because when people

00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:46,560
track planes flying over risk most of

00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:49,500
them are just passing through powers

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,570
over powers from Russia and Asia over to

00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:55,860
Western Europe and that's an actual

00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:57,840
picture from fight writer and despite

00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,900
that it's it's an interesting voice to

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,850
explore and and I'm sure that the

00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,220
situation is really really different

00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:07,350
from where you come from but I think

00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:09,349
there are some similar problems and

00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:14,390
similar approaches that maybe

00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:19,459
could be interesting so just as a random

00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:21,199
art example of using data as art people

00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:25,070
in our community looked at the map of

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:29,300
dollars and split it into organs and

00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:32,389
looked for the geographic names like

00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:35,870
real names and village and city names

00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:37,250
and in the patterns that are continued

00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:39,979
of those names and it turns out that

00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:42,110
those patterns contain lead about the

00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:46,880
Sinister people who live there obviously

00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:49,009
and there are local reference to animals

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,680
and things like that and you can group

00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:53,539
them and it's kind of an interesting

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,979
data set to play with so all the data

00:04:53,539 --> 00:05:01,990
comes from OpenStreetMap containing

00:04:56,979 --> 00:05:04,610
twenty three thousand location names and

00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:06,680
it's just interesting to see how Baltic

00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:10,009
for example when these names are

00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:16,159
concentrated in the north so which is

00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:18,590
closest to the Romanian border and here

00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:24,470
are voices that contain more Russian

00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:25,940
specific home suffixes so it's not true

00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:30,860
that there is no data at the recent date

00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:35,870
and it's interesting to discard and this

00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:40,060
is more like this rapid erosion language

00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:46,490
oriented suffix on the map of borders

00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:49,130
and so about less art and more data

00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:52,070
oriented projects if we try to get civic

00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:53,720
data out of news reports and press

00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:56,479
releases from the police from the

00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:59,240
government ministries and sometimes from

00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:01,340
the burkas are too lazy to use the same

00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,500
template so they use the same kind of

00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:07,550
sentence over and over again and we try

00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:09,409
to parse that for actual numbers I'll

00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:12,199
show some examples later there are four

00:06:09,409 --> 00:06:14,930
police reports we try to look at the

00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:17,620
municipal services and also the fault

00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:23,229
line reports about

00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:25,919
like what the herbs and illegal parking

00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:27,580
and things like that look at maps of

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,169
transportation because public

00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:33,270
transportation is really bigot bombers

00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:36,220
most people use it if you look at some

00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:43,090
environmental data it's it's really

00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:46,270
important that mowers because well it's

00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:49,030
so it used to be a mostly rural country

00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:52,930
most people lived in in the countryside

00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:58,479
up until the eighties so the landscape

00:06:52,930 --> 00:07:01,210
is very well organized and the

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:05,520
population densities kinda long so most

00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:08,080
of the relevant areas for sand wetlands

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,410
we also look at how public

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:15,039
transportation is given away to private

00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:17,740
cars and car ownership and we also try

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:21,370
to extract data about house ownership

00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:24,220
because it is basically the net

00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:26,139
apartments officer the base the best way

00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:28,030
to understand how our cities are

00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:30,250
changing the government doesn't publish

00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:33,880
enough urban data so we're trying to

00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:38,740
understand this from classified ads for

00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:41,080
example we try to work with commercial

00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:43,510
data as well because the companies

00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:48,570
accumulate more and more detail compared

00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:52,539
to the government services nowadays and

00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:54,220
we try to use as much open-source data

00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:57,840
sets as possible from Open Street Map

00:07:54,220 --> 00:08:00,910
and Wikipedia and try to popularize that

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,849
so that's an example of government data

00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:08,500
that we try to parse and the animation

00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:11,020
in the first Prasad was from us trying

00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:14,169
to parse the official zoning map of

00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:16,060
Minsk the major city into polygons and

00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:17,560
to understand what the population

00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:20,620
density was in different parts of the

00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:23,229
city and we actually get this s g-packs

00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:25,150
that's the best you can get it's kind of

00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:26,560
secret you can only get it and you know

00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:29,560
someone

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,680
but once somebody got it it was sure

00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:35,529
tell community and the reason it's

00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:40,240
secret it's because people started

00:08:35,529 --> 00:08:43,209
protesting against shrinking of green

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:46,329
areas and parks and all the public

00:08:43,209 --> 00:08:49,690
places that were given to do commercial

00:08:46,329 --> 00:08:54,670
construction to foreign and domestic

00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:56,740
investors building shopping centers and

00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:59,649
new apartment buildings and it's kind of

00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:03,040
a mess and the discussion process is

00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:05,529
really really a conflict into for the

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,709
government so they don't want to publish

00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:13,720
in his own maps but we tried to get this

00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:18,570
data's as much as we can so about

00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:25,240
parsing news reports and police reports

00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:27,490
it's again the map of Minsk but we had a

00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:33,100
person running for three years that

00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:35,320
extracted every daily police press

00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,839
release report about all violent and

00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:43,560
violent crimes and dollars in desk

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:46,810
I think this data shows only did only

00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:50,320
reports from one or two months so the

00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:52,149
numbers are not the torch it was

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,880
actually useful you could see which

00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:58,600
areas had more crime and Alicia was

00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:01,600
helpless so in general the crime level

00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:05,130
is very local dollars I think it's kind

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,130
of terrible to portent

00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:11,810
the number that stuck in my head is that

00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:16,820
the number for murders in bars per year

00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:20,470
was warden then in Malta but I guess

00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:22,580
that's completely not a fair comparison

00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:27,260
comparing the population gives you an

00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:29,320
idea and here's another example where we

00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:32,560
extracted all the human rights

00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,730
organizations reports about always

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:38,240
arrests and harassment

00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:40,940
during ports and demonstrations because

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:45,760
other word major waves of demonstrations

00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:51,020
against government austerity plans in

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:54,530
2017 so we extracted data about all the

00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:59,780
arrests and all the punishments that was

00:10:54,530 --> 00:11:04,430
given to people so 224 people were given

00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:13,190
arrests on average of around 10 days in

00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:16,250
jail and around $250 on average fines so

00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:18,620
that's some information that's a map

00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:22,600
showing the concentration of four people

00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,600
arrested in different places and dollars

00:11:26,589 --> 00:11:34,060
another interesting source of data is

00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:37,940
the traffic police reports and here I

00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:40,250
know it's I know the those visualization

00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:44,630
is kind of small but yeah you were just

00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:48,710
trying to show how different types of

00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:53,290
traffic incident reports were split

00:11:48,710 --> 00:12:02,110
between men and women and the blue part

00:11:53,290 --> 00:12:08,089
is who participated means incidence and

00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:08,900
increase and it showed data from 2012 to

00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:11,300
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,450
it was just a random thing that we want

00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,880
to

00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:18,550
to try out and it shows all the

00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:21,860
incidents incidents caused by

00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:24,890
intoxicated drivers so we basically

00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:30,110
non-existent there and incidents

00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:34,070
accidents with injuries and accidents

00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:37,820
with fatalities so yeah but now there is

00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:41,570
a discussion online about women drivers

00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:43,550
and drivers it I don't know how popular

00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:45,740
this discussion is in this part of the

00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:52,670
world button lower somehow it's kind of

00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:57,550
very active yeah it's it's another and

00:12:52,670 --> 00:13:05,390
yeah the the right part shows split by

00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:07,910
age so 19 to 23 24 to 28 29 to 33 and so

00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:12,050
forth so the younger drivers cause the

00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:14,840
most accidents this is another view of

00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:19,610
the same data and it shows this number

00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:23,500
of accidents by D and so this whole

00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:26,720
chart shows these and accidents Peaks

00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:29,720
per day and most of the peaks were

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:32,750
either holidays or this the first day

00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:35,270
after holiday or there was one huge peak

00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:39,590
during the hurricane and the snowstorm

00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:41,780
basically cost a lot of accidents and

00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:45,050
you can find other different things that

00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:47,330
matter okay

00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:49,280
and another major source of data is the

00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:52,720
municipal what one date and then they

00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,720
published completely accidental

00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:56,980
basically the government is trying to

00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:58,150
use a private company to build this

00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:01,240
portal

00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:04,090
showing all the really scoop problem

00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:06,580
reports and it's working really well

00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:08,440
it's just that all the Jason's are

00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:10,840
continuing all the data about people who

00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:18,160
are poor stuff and all the reports

00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:21,430
themselves are polluting so it's it's a

00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:24,250
huge data set and it's growing it's not

00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:26,050
full yet because right now most of the

00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,910
reports are submitted by phone and not

00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:29,980
by app and we only get the data through

00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:33,670
the reports that were submitted through

00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:35,770
the app and actually there are really

00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:38,380
nice people when we talk to them and

00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:42,310
with total totus data's available and

00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:48,700
they were like yeah you know don't do

00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:49,990
anything bad about so so yeah it's a

00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,150
picture a nice picture of the

00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:54,580
instruments it's showing all the

00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:57,430
requests that were reported through the

00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:59,350
app and it's the actual number of

00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:03,640
reports reporters will form through the

00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:06,430
forum hotline is of magnitude larger but

00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:08,740
they don't get all the data there the

00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:11,800
dataset they're trying to switch to this

00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:14,290
new system but it's really expensive

00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:16,720
because the private companies using

00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:20,340
Oracle as a database and I think they're

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,340
not the were yet how much it would cost

00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:26,200
and when we put this data set we try to

00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:29,080
split all the other user names which

00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:31,060
contained first names we threw out the

00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:33,220
last names because we didn't want to

00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:35,320
keep this personal data so the first

00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:38,020
names actually gave us the information

00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:41,110
about generous so we tried to split how

00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:44,589
many reports were concentrated in

00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:48,400
different categories of issues so

00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:49,580
reports about sidewalks had about

00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:52,679
promised speed

00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:55,410
[Music]

00:15:52,679 --> 00:16:01,179
like barks and things like that and

00:15:55,410 --> 00:16:02,559
versus bonds with staircases and doors

00:16:01,179 --> 00:16:05,319
in the apartment builders and things

00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:08,019
like that and it turned out that men

00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:11,739
were much more active in reporting

00:16:08,019 --> 00:16:15,910
problems with sidewalks that were

00:16:11,739 --> 00:16:17,859
closest to bike paths and women about

00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:20,619
more active about reporting problems

00:16:17,859 --> 00:16:22,869
with the infrastructure inside their

00:16:20,619 --> 00:16:25,329
apartment buildings so that was only

00:16:22,869 --> 00:16:27,970
just a bit of information and it also

00:16:25,329 --> 00:16:33,029
gave us an idea about the difference in

00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:35,709
terms of time that was spent in

00:16:33,029 --> 00:16:38,379
correcting those reports I have

00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:41,889
incorrect even one third of the data but

00:16:38,379 --> 00:16:45,339
I think I'm wrong in start of time so

00:16:41,889 --> 00:16:47,769
this shows the split by district in the

00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:50,980
city and how long it takes different

00:16:47,769 --> 00:16:53,410
parts of the city to fix problems it's

00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:55,389
all from the same data set this is from

00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:57,759
the KGB data it's completely unrelated

00:16:55,389 --> 00:17:00,639
to any spot I'm just showing a map of

00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:03,519
four we worked with human rights

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:07,000
activists who collected data from the

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:09,819
KGB archives and it's showing all the

00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,370
people who are arrested and it's sent

00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:16,929
away to Siberia or to local prisons

00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:20,589
during the standard repressions so the

00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:25,269
dots show places with the most arrests

00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:27,990
per year so there are waves of

00:17:25,269 --> 00:17:32,470
repressions you can kind of see that

00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:34,179
you'll see some pirate data because it's

00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:37,090
not possible to get all the data you

00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:37,929
want officially so SCI hub which is the

00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:42,149
pirate

00:17:37,929 --> 00:17:42,149
scientific database and

00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:48,130
Madewell boss and download information

00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:51,820
about different countries so we were

00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:53,590
able to see what people buy IV ranges

00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,120
and what people from dollars were

00:17:53,590 --> 00:18:00,310
downloading and what types of

00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:03,100
publications and what journals sections

00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:04,180
of journals and different topics and it

00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,060
gave a lot of interesting information

00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:11,080
that we published online as actual

00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:15,190
scientific publication traffic date is

00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:17,410
interesting and we also had some

00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:19,530
community and activists projects for

00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:22,330
people just go outside and measure

00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:26,080
pollution in the local water sources and

00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:28,120
we love that I think you just have to do

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,860
end presentation leave the links if

00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:33,730
you're actually interested or just talk

00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:38,800
to me later because there's too much

00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:40,450
that I wasn't able to show and just one

00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,520
random source of information information

00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:45,430
that was really interesting to use or we

00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:47,890
don't want it all them classified as for

00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:51,490
the used cars in waters around 200,000 I

00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:53,860
would pause for a month and we did it

00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:57,820
for five months and then we looked at

00:18:53,860 --> 00:19:02,380
the oldest cars per city and the most

00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:04,390
polluting cars per 1000 population in

00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:05,860
different parts of the country and it

00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:08,260
showed really significant variation

00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:10,660
because the oldest cars pollute salt

00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:12,930
more and we concede offered classified

00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:17,920
data and from the others

00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:20,200
yeah that was real estate data and there

00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:22,810
is dust data and all that can be

00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,160
combined to gain insights into what's

00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:30,940
happening in different parts of the

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:32,590
cities and when you use Open Street Map

00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:34,920
on top of that you can actually see

00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:38,450
which parts of the city have fun most

00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:40,609
beer stores our district

00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:44,419
and whatever that correlates to the

00:19:40,609 --> 00:19:48,279
dusty it doesn't it's a risk list to the

00:19:44,419 --> 00:19:50,359
lumber for cheapest apartments and

00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:51,259
places where people don't have anything

00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:54,320
else to do

00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:56,330
it's interesting how much that you can

00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,519
get out of open straight laughing the

00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:00,980
state doesn't publish anything and

00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:02,899
according to Tim berners-lee actually

00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:06,769
the screenshot from his dad

00:20:02,899 --> 00:20:10,460
this circle shows borrowers on the

00:20:06,769 --> 00:20:14,570
OpenStreetMap activity timeline so how

00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:17,359
can proud and be wrong infographics

00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:21,529
school for seven years of five years now

00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:23,059
some courses for most courses that teach

00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:26,179
journalists and activists to use data

00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:27,919
and most of the screenshots were from

00:20:26,179 --> 00:20:31,759
things that people did in this school

00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:33,880
fill cracks thank you and happy to

00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:39,949
answer any questions

00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:39,949
