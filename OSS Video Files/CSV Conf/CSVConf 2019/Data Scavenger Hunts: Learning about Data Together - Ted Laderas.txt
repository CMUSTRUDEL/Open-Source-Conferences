Title: Data Scavenger Hunts: Learning about Data Together - Ted Laderas
Publication date: 2019-06-21
Playlist: CSVConf 2019
Description: 
	Data exploration and visualization are a highly accessible gateway activity to learning data science. In this talk, we discuss our experience with "Data Scavenger Hunts" using web apps to democratize data science and make it accessible to a wide variety of audiences. In order to achieve this, we have developed an R package called `burro` that can enable public datasets to be explored together via a sharable web app. In this talk, we talk about our experience with using data scavenger hunts to teach each other interesting things about data. In particular, we share our experiences with exploring the NHANES (National Health Nutirition Examination Survey) data and the insights we have taught each other. We show that this guided and communal data exploration leads to increased confidence and curiosity about data science in Biodata-Club, our learning community. `burro` apps can be deployed by anyone to start conversations about data.

so thank you everyone for sticking

00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:11,350
around the conference I know I'm like

00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,910
the last speaker and probably energy is

00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:16,690
super low right now

00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:18,699
but I just you know this is like as you

00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:20,199
can see I don't have that many slides so

00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:22,570
I'm hoping this is going to be more of a

00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:24,699
discussion kind of showing you the

00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:29,439
inspiration behind this idea of a data

00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:31,570
scavenger hunt so this is just kind of a

00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,449
quick overview so I'm just going to

00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:36,010
introduce myself I'm going to like you

00:00:34,449 --> 00:00:40,390
know I'm trying to keep the questions

00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:46,840
very simple why what who and then who

00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:48,850
and then a call to action so Who am I so

00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:51,460
I'm an assistant professor at Oregon

00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:54,309
Health and Science University I

00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:57,219
my specialty is bioinformatics but you

00:00:54,309 --> 00:00:59,710
know I have really kind of gone full

00:00:57,219 --> 00:01:03,190
tilt into teaching and like part of that

00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:04,989
is that I really love to see I want

00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:07,260
people to really understand the data

00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:08,980
that they're generating and

00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,830
visualization is kind of the other

00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:12,760
component I just kind of when I learned

00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,070
ggplot2

00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:18,090
like my head exploded and I was like

00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:22,510
this is awesome everyone should know it

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:25,870
so I mean like let's get at the why so

00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:28,510
why I look at data together well I think

00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:31,270
number one like it the number one thing

00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:34,180
is that visualization is like a really

00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:36,670
empowering thing so a lot of people like

00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:39,010
kind of feel like data data science

00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:40,960
might not be for them but like you know

00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:43,120
kind of discovering that you know like

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,450
we're using these visual visual tools

00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:48,130
that people can easily grasp like I feel

00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:52,890
like you know it's it's very kind of

00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:56,860
empowering that same that same kind of

00:01:52,890 --> 00:02:00,760
vein like I feel it's very accessible by

00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:02,200
a lot for a lot of people and again this

00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,990
is like you know in terms of thinking

00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:07,450
about like how can we invite more people

00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:10,000
to learn data science like you know I

00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:14,230
feel like visualization is a good path

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,060
to for inclusivity finally

00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,890
like looking at the same graph together

00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,409
like doing visualization together it

00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:22,269
lets us have a conversation like what we

00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:27,129
like you know do we believe that things

00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:30,940
are real in the data or or not and then

00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:33,400
finally I just feel and this is I know

00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:35,560
I'm not casting shade on any data

00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,200
science programs or anything but I feel

00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,239
like like visualization and interpreting

00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,120
the data is like such a valuable skill

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:48,459
and sometimes it's something we kind of

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:50,769
gloss over so that's kind of a lot of

00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:52,870
setup for this this is it's kind of a

00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:56,109
simple activity so it's we call it a

00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:58,390
data scavenger hunt and so the the core

00:02:56,109 --> 00:03:00,609
of it is really this idea of it's a

00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:05,620
social learning activity that's based

00:03:00,609 --> 00:03:07,810
around a data set and so you know when I

00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,190
was when I was in school I spent a lot

00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:10,629
of time doing an exploratory data

00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:15,010
analysis and I thought it was the

00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:18,849
greatest thing you know so basically you

00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:20,380
know pioneered by John Tukey but I think

00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:22,510
Behrens has a much better kind of

00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:24,489
description of it like basically finding

00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:29,470
patterns and revealing structure in the

00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:31,239
data and then you know the other key

00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:34,060
part of a data scavenger hunt is

00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:37,329
basically giving people focus questions

00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:40,389
to look for in the data so this I one

00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:41,829
example and well hopefully the the demo

00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:45,220
will work

00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:47,680
so it basically this idea so can we look

00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:51,430
for associations between variables such

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:54,160
as body mass index and diabetes and like

00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:55,810
the final piece of it is really the idea

00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,579
that we need to reflect on our

00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,930
discoveries and we need to present them

00:03:57,579 --> 00:04:04,060
as a group and we need to talk about

00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:07,540
them so in terms of what like this is

00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:10,780
kind of this is the heart of it and this

00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:13,060
is this is a package our package that

00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:16,599
Jessica Minnie a and I have been working

00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:19,090
on called burrow yes the the mascot is a

00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:22,240
donkey but it's basically a pun you can

00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:25,240
burrow into your data and what it does

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:28,090
is like you can basically you can like

00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:30,130
this is our goal eventually is

00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:33,220
to throw like you know a wide variety of

00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:37,630
datasets into it and it will basically

00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:40,120
pop up a shiny app for exploring lots of

00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:42,940
different data types and the the cool

00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,830
thing about this is that the basically

00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:47,980
builds all of the Chinese a pod for you

00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:49,810
and so if you wanted to kind of bring

00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:52,600
people like other people who aren't

00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:54,639
necessarily like our programmers you can

00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:58,270
basically spin it up as a website and

00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:00,580
they can start exploring the data so

00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:02,800
part of it part of the idea is like you

00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:05,050
know very carefully going through this

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,540
idea of exploratory data analysis and

00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:09,729
like mapping all of the different kinds

00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,979
of data to like the appropriate kinds of

00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:14,889
visualizations and you'll see the app is

00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:18,220
very simple but I think simple is really

00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:20,560
good in this case because it allows

00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:25,120
people to like ask questions and look at

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:28,200
the data very quickly so this is this is

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:31,150
just kind of the this is kind of the

00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:33,430
thinking behind it like like I mentioned

00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:36,580
you know the app is very much organized

00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:39,760
by like the variable types so and this

00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:42,520
is I'm sorry this is not this is not

00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:45,419
visible but yeah the basic idea is that

00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:48,520
you have an overview of the data here

00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:51,130
and then like you know there are really

00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,080
cool tools for visually summarizing and

00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:56,020
like tabulating and summarizing the data

00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:58,210
and then you can look at single

00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:00,100
variables so like you know the two

00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:02,580
variable types we really focus on right

00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:05,620
now are continuous and categorical data

00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:08,169
so you can examine kind of what is what

00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:11,410
exists kind of within a single variable

00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:13,150
and then kind of based on the question

00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:15,789
that you're asking you know there are

00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:18,310
different visualizations that like we

00:06:15,789 --> 00:06:20,560
map to like for example if you have two

00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:22,870
continuous variables we do a stacked bar

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,539
plot to kind of examine things like

00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:27,970
proportions if you've got a continuous

00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:29,710
and you a categorical variable like a

00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:32,260
box plot is kind of a natural way to

00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:34,860
visualize the data and then obviously if

00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:37,570
you have two continuous variables a

00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:40,810
scatterplot

00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:44,620
so the example I'm going to show you is

00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:45,280
for it's it's the N hinge dataset anyone

00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:50,130
here

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:53,260
has anyone here heard of N Haines

00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:59,050
something yeah I just I really hope

00:06:53,260 --> 00:07:01,210
you've heard of n hates so it's it's

00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:03,160
this dataset it's called the National

00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:06,760
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey

00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:10,090
and it's basically a survey of nutrition

00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:13,090
habits but they're also like outcomes

00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:14,980
that are measured so like for in this

00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:19,900
example we'll we'll look at depression

00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:21,820
as outcomes so this is just like a

00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:24,970
little gift to kind of give you an idea

00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:29,050
of what like the app is doing so I'm

00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:30,580
going basically the first thing is like

00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:32,560
we're going to look for episodes of

00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:35,260
little interest with depressive episodes

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:38,050
and so you can see basically we've got

00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:41,050
this this variable we're looking at kind

00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:42,760
of the distribution of things and then

00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:45,450
we're looking at the association of

00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:49,810
little interest with depressive episodes

00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:51,790
and so this is like the hard part about

00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:55,090
gifts is like kind of trying trying to

00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:58,030
time things but you can see you can see

00:07:55,090 --> 00:08:01,740
like what when we get to the the

00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:03,850
Association you can see that there are

00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:05,740
like when you get too little interest

00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:08,350
you can see that like this is like the

00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:11,200
most the most depressed people also have

00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:16,690
the most depressed episodes of little

00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:20,680
interest so like I said the app is

00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:23,200
really it's just kind of a conduit to

00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,580
really answer the questions so this is

00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,220
kind of the other side of a data

00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:28,900
scavenger hunt is to have pre-prepared

00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:32,349
questions that really guide the

00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:34,060
exploration and one of one of the

00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:35,979
guidelines we've kind of done is that

00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:37,720
the question should be very should be

00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:40,419
simple like maybe they should be

00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:43,540
answered answerable by one single part

00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:46,090
of the app to more complex so like

00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:47,890
assessing things like like is the data

00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:50,040
missing and can we even answer the

00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:52,380
question

00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,180
and like I said like the like the the

00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:56,040
real goal is to like you know give

00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:58,770
people like a tool where they can have a

00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:04,400
question and we can give them kind of a

00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:07,290
visualization so I know Wi-Fi is spotty

00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:09,210
but like you know as I'm talking like

00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:14,190
you know there it there is a not like if

00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:16,470
you can get to the app like take a look

00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:20,460
at it and so there are three questions

00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:22,440
that I have free for you to answer so if

00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:26,730
you look at the age variable why is it

00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:29,100
capped at 80 years in the data set is

00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:32,580
marijuana use associated with number of

00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:34,890
depressive episodes and our hours of

00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:40,320
sleep associated with depressive

00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:45,620
episodes so anyone want to tackle the

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,620
first question yeah sorry

00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:13,010
sorry it doesn't seem to be zooming in

00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:13,010
up and sorry

00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:26,610
is that better so take it take a look at

00:10:22,319 --> 00:10:28,230
this I'm going to kind of kind of for

00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,819
those people who can't get onto the app

00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:32,699
I'm just going to kind of show like a

00:10:29,819 --> 00:10:35,879
short kind of summary of what's going on

00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:37,800
so this is the first thing that this

00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:40,649
like you know the students see when they

00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,300
open the app and this is basically this

00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:46,379
is a very cool kind of visual summary

00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:48,059
tool called visit by Nick attorney and

00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:51,629
when I saw this I was like this is an

00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:55,800
awesome teaching tool because you can

00:10:51,629 --> 00:10:57,569
see and this is again I should have made

00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,399
things a little larger but like you can

00:10:57,569 --> 00:11:01,019
see that like it classifies the

00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:03,209
different variables into the different

00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:05,790
data types you know so the categorical

00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:08,850
data numeric the end the numeric data

00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:11,279
and these gray these gray sections are

00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:15,629
actually where the data is missing so it

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:18,329
gives people like an idea of what like

00:11:15,629 --> 00:11:20,519
you know if the like you know what what

00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:22,559
parts are missing from the data and like

00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:29,579
you know to think of like you know why

00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:32,910
why is this data missing this is this is

00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:35,279
kind this is another tool and that of

00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:37,079
course it doesn't show up right but this

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,929
is just basically kind of a tabular

00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:42,300
summary of the data so we ask things of

00:11:39,929 --> 00:11:46,589
the students like so how many how many

00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:50,929
complete cases are there for depression

00:11:46,589 --> 00:11:53,519
for example or how many missing cases

00:11:50,929 --> 00:11:56,189
they also have access to a data

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:59,279
dictionary that like you know let's kind

00:11:56,189 --> 00:12:01,410
of look and search search for different

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:04,470
kinds of variables so for example I ask

00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:06,329
you to look for alcohol so you can

00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:08,939
search and like you know will tell you

00:12:06,329 --> 00:12:15,990
the name of the variable and this kind

00:12:08,939 --> 00:12:18,869
of thing so it's really so really the

00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:20,939
the base of the the idea behind like the

00:12:18,869 --> 00:12:23,579
app is really to kind of empower people

00:12:20,939 --> 00:12:28,339
and to like you know give them the idea

00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:28,339
that they can do data exploration

00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:42,430
so the final part of like the the the

00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:45,580
data scavenger hunt is this idea of

00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:48,130
reflection and discussion so like you

00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:50,080
have like it's not enough to kind of

00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:52,060
discuss things in a little group you

00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,700
have to bring back your observations to

00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:56,200
the larger group and so we provide

00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:58,270
people like a really kind of simple

00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:02,260
template to kind of present things so

00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:05,290
it's it's less less stressful like you

00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:07,420
know what was your question and then

00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:09,970
basically show us in the app where the

00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:11,950
where you found your evidence and then

00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:13,899
you know if there are other any other

00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:16,690
variables that might be associated that

00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:19,149
we should look at and at the end like

00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:20,920
you know the activity is really like

00:13:19,149 --> 00:13:24,820
what did we learn learn as a group

00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:27,370
together and I feel like you know really

00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:30,910
I kind of gloss about the boss over

00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:33,130
about the social parts of this but you

00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:35,320
know see like we've we've run this kind

00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:39,160
of data scavenger hunts in a lot of

00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:42,220
different situations yeah so luckily I

00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:45,430
have that so we've run it with graduate

00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:48,100
students and like you know Portland

00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:49,630
State University rent like we've used

00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,670
this as part of our clinical data

00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:54,070
wrangling course so this is kind of a

00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:56,110
course our incoming informatics students

00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:58,690
take to really kind of understand issues

00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:00,400
with clinical data and they used this

00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:03,490
data set called the sleep heart health

00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:05,920
study data set and a lot of the material

00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:07,930
is online unfortunately due to the data

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,209
use agreement we can't publish the sleep

00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:12,779
heart health study data so I'm going to

00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:16,360
try to produce a synthetic version so

00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:18,070
other people can use this this group

00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:21,400
that like I helped moderate called bio

00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:23,620
data club we did we used Ann Haynes as a

00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,959
scavenger hunt and Jessica mini a was

00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,940
part of that like so we thought of like

00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:29,650
really interesting questions it wasn't

00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:32,589
just depression there was physical

00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:35,380
activity and type 2 diabetes so we all

00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:38,649
learned a lot about the data set like

00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:41,620
you know with that so and I also teach

00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:44,140
an undergraduate course and in this is

00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:46,000
part of our data literacy unit so

00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:48,940
they're Public Health Education students

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,460
so they looked at the N Haynes data set

00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:53,500
you know interesting interesting results

00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:55,150
so you know there was a lot of

00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,730
interesting discussions one of the

00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:59,890
students actually didn't believe like

00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:02,290
the visualization so like you know that

00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:05,320
was a not that was kind of the basis for

00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:07,000
an interesting discussion so I don't

00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,950
know if she still doesn't believe the

00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,340
data but at least we had a discussion

00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:14,740
about it so this is just some feedback

00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:17,410
from like the bio-data Club session you

00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:19,800
know it seems like people really enjoyed

00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:22,390
this kind of collaborative exploration

00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:24,520
and then you know I really like this I

00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:26,890
like the data set in the open curiosity

00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:30,160
element of the workshop so like I really

00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:32,440
want people to be curious about data and

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:36,030
like if they have questions like you

00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,030
know if they can try to answer it so

00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:42,790
this kind of gets into like you know

00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:45,580
would this be useful for other other

00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:47,740
audiences you know there's like you know

00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:50,050
as we've seen a lot of the presentations

00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:54,340
here about like you know citizen driven

00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:56,110
data efforts and like my question for

00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:59,110
you is what would it take to make this

00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:01,930
useful for like citizens in the world

00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:03,430
I think probably you know one of the

00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:06,220
things we need to do a much better job

00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:08,020
of is like having better just-in-time

00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:12,010
kind of documentation that kind of

00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:14,500
explains things to people you know can

00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:16,840
can we use this as it as a you know

00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:21,970
framework to teach graph literacy and

00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:25,150
data curiosity and you know I I want

00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:27,070
like maybe I'm thinking too big but

00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:30,160
maybe we can use this framework like as

00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:35,920
part of a ability to kind of democratize

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:38,460
data science so what's kind of next for

00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:41,860
the the borough the borough package

00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:43,600
we're you know this and this really

00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:45,220
directly has to do with like you know

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,570
the public health students have been

00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:48,040
working with I've been trying to think

00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:50,140
of what data is like you know

00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,520
interesting to them and thinking about

00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:54,940
things like social determinants of

00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:57,250
health you know I've just been kind of

00:16:54,940 --> 00:17:01,080
learning basically how to kind of

00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:04,290
integrate shiny with spatial data

00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:08,819
like such as shapefiles and there's

00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:13,949
basically this SF format within our and

00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:15,420
like you know this isn't it my my Wi-Fi

00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:17,760
isn't working I'd show you an example

00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:20,280
this example but like it's the idea of

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,260
like you know having having things that

00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:25,170
are appealing to like a wide variety of

00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:28,350
students that and like to help them kind

00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:32,010
of learn data science principles so this

00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:34,290
is my call to action I really would like

00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:36,059
to hear from like beginners and novices

00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:38,370
and like you know I'm trying to be as

00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:41,970
welcoming as I can to like people who

00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:44,340
want to be first contributors I really

00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:46,230
need help with kind of making this like

00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:48,450
the the app is really rough around the

00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:52,200
edges and I need help to kind of make it

00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:53,790
more usable and then like you know for

00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,130
like the different data types we're kind

00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:58,230
of looking at like you know I need kind

00:17:56,130 --> 00:18:00,870
of some help and like you know

00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:03,480
understanding like basically testing it

00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:05,550
on different data sets and then thinking

00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,140
about like you know doing a very kind of

00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:11,520
standardized template for the scavenger

00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:13,110
hunts so this is my funding

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,270
acknowledgement so it was partially

00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:17,730
funded from the National Library of

00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:22,620
Medicine through our training grant and

00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:26,130
then also and cats the translational

00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:29,660
Science Center for ends for the through

00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:37,710
this Center for data to Health Project

00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:40,650
so this is probably very small but if

00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:43,080
you want to take a picture so this is

00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:47,160
all of my info so the slides are here

00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:49,080
and then you know like this is the main

00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,240
burrow site so if you're interested in

00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:55,040
the package or the app like you know you

00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:57,690
can go here I just added a contributing

00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:59,850
section so if you're interested I've

00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:01,530
still been thinking about how like you

00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:04,110
know the best waits for people to get

00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:07,530
involved but I have a mailing list sign

00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:09,510
up there which is also here and then

00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:12,030
just a little plug for our group called

00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:14,519
bio data club so it's our local Portland

00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:16,590
Club that most of its

00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:18,990
kind of spans a lot of the universities

00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:22,740
here and it focuses of on learning about

00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:26,159
data we're all about kind of exploding

00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:30,649
hierarchies so it's not just it's not

00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:34,230
just students its students staff faculty

00:19:30,649 --> 00:19:36,360
postdocs we want basically people to

00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:38,249
like if you're interested and you're

00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,110
curious about data science we want you

00:19:38,249 --> 00:19:43,860
and like if you want more information

00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:45,480
about that go to our website so that's

00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:48,149
about it

00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:53,580
did anyone was there anyone able to

00:19:48,149 --> 00:19:57,059
access the app so of the three questions

00:19:53,580 --> 00:20:00,570
what did you find so let's go back to

00:19:57,059 --> 00:20:03,149
the questions so anyone find out why

00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:16,379
ages capped at 80 years in the data yeah

00:20:03,149 --> 00:20:18,720
Jim yes and it's it has like we just

00:20:16,379 --> 00:20:20,610
actually dove into this and like she

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:24,629
found out it's about identifiability

00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:27,600
issues because there's not many 80 year

00:20:24,629 --> 00:20:30,440
olds anyone find out anything about

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,440
marijuana use

00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:49,870
so there is a there is a variable called

00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:51,640
marijuana and I'm sorry I just kind of

00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:53,350
threw this at you I didn't give like

00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,210
when we do the scavenger hunts there's a

00:20:53,350 --> 00:21:00,400
lot more kind of tutorials on how to use

00:20:55,210 --> 00:21:03,190
the app so we look at marijuana use over

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:06,430
50% of the data is missing so that gives

00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:08,320
us kind of an idea that maybe this is we

00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:11,860
don't have enough data to ask this

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:13,780
question but you can see that there's a

00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:17,440
higher percentage of marijuana users in

00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:21,460
non marijuana users here so if we

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:25,330
actually look at marijuana use and

00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:27,910
depression so there is basically the the

00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:28,300
data is you either use marijuana or you

00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:31,810
don't

00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:38,380
and like the people who have like the

00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:40,030
most basically the most the proportion

00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:42,640
of people who have the most depressive

00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:48,400
episodes actually increases slightly

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:55,450
like if you use in marijuana did anyone

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:57,670
look at the last question okay so I'm

00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:59,830
not I'm going to I think I'm going to

00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:04,420
end here because I feel like you know I

00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:07,450
don't want to drag everyone dry like um

00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:08,980
pull everyone by the ear so anyways

00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:12,540
that's that's basically my presentation

00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:12,540
so are there any questions

00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:17,090
