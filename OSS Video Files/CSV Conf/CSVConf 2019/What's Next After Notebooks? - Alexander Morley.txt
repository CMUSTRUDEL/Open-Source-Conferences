Title: What's Next After Notebooks? - Alexander Morley
Publication date: 2019-06-20

Description: 
	Jane is a data scientist. Jane uses Jupyter notebooks as her working environment, and her presentation environment. These “computational essays” allow Jane to present her methods and her results to her colleagues at the same time. Jane is happy with this. But sometimes it’s difficult for Jane to share notebooks with her colleagues, and even harder for them to re-mix or re-use parts of the notebook, or to share their changes back to Jane. And sometimes Jane finds it hard to explain the flow of a particular notebook, or how different notebooks are tied together. There’s no provision for keeping things modular. First, I will discuss a few up-and-coming projects that are leveraging the power of new web technologies and faster browsers to solve all of fictional Jane’s problems, and more. Second, I will present a prototype for my own solution that is also web-based, and draws inspiration from some now-uncool graphical programming languages.
