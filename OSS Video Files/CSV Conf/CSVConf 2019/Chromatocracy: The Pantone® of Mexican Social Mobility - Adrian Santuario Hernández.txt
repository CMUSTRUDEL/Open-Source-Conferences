Title: Chromatocracy: The Pantone® of Mexican Social Mobility - Adrian Santuario Hernández
Publication date: 2019-05-19
Playlist: CSVConf 2019
Description: 
	Skin colour ratings have been used in several studies about racial discrimination and racial attitudes but have rarely been used in Mexico. Although since 1917 the Mexican Constitution establish a legal equality of citizens without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion, it is common to see several discrimination on work spaces, educational facilities and government offices based on skin colour. Despite the last surveys leaded for INEGI (National Institute of Geography and Statistics) shows signals of racial discrimination in his reports, a glance at the map will suffice to see clearly that colour skin is an important issue for mexican social mobility. For example: 95% of the presenters on Mexican TV Shows have 1-3 colour skin tone (Based on PERLA Colour Palette) while 85% of the total Mexican population have 5-7 colour skin tone; that gap on the tones generate an aspirational sentiment of status: whiter is better. To support that correlation between skin color and social mobility I developed a Web Scraping, Machine Learning and Facial Recognition algorithm to answer two questions: Who is more successful in Mexico? (95 percent of CEO tend to have whither color skin (1-3 PERLA) that the rest) and, Are there a correlation between your political affiliation an your tone skin? (Right-wing party (PVEM) is wither that the left-wing party (PRD)). The work demonstrate how technology (Machine Learning Color Algorithm) can help to unravel hidden social dynamics in mexican culture.

	00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:09,750
so it's called chromatic I see the

00:00:04,769 --> 00:00:12,570
panettone of Mexican social mobility few

00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:15,870
words of me I'm the work in the war of

00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:20,580
Technology but all the speech bow figure

00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:24,180
out how to simply monetize projects with

00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:30,570
AI or data science absolutely bores me

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:33,749
to tears you know I'm really a really

00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:37,140
cool article on world magazine about the

00:00:33,749 --> 00:00:40,170
new washing machine that predicts with

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,949
AI when the soup container is going to

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,609
be empty

00:00:40,949 --> 00:00:48,679
it's like watching paint dry for me what

00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:52,769
I do care about however is how to

00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:57,799
translate and use this technology with

00:00:52,769 --> 00:01:00,690
AI our data science to improve the

00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:05,100
knowledge of our society

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:06,960
so another thing I'm I'm just learned in

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:10,440
started learning English

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,680
five months ago so though maybe

00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:20,760
something my English I'm going to do my

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:23,760
best okay so the question that I want to

00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:26,580
answer is is there a mathematical

00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:35,360
formula for succeed in Mexican social

00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:39,240
mobility is there a model or formula and

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:43,680
the first part is since before it became

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:46,590
an independent nation state in 1821 in

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:51,710
Mexico Mexico's population has been

00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:56,909
troubled by issues of race and class

00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:59,159
anything from Spain here no okay

00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:02,070
because when Europeans arrived to

00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:05,340
colonize the Americans more than 500

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:08,819
years ago they introduced a hierarchy

00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:12,289
based on skin color and race that

00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:12,289
persists to this today

00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:24,160
this is called Casta pintura castor

00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:26,500
painting that represent all the older

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,740
hierarchies based on skin tone and

00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:34,680
raised in Mexico no one if you are an

00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:39,480
expanding and a Creole you have less

00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:44,170
social mobility on the ancien Mexico and

00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:46,890
also in contemporary Mexican advertising

00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:51,430
and films lower classes people are

00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:55,120
almost always shown with darker skin and

00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:59,200
richer and richer class people are shown

00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:02,560
with white skin the lead character in

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:06,790
the oscar-winning film Roma for example

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:09,910
is a Vulcan skip main representing some

00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:15,000
somebody considered poor in Mexico

00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:18,520
her boss in other hand is rich and white

00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,760
some Mexican companies choose to feature

00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:25,530
white skin models to represent their

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:28,840
Mexican brands there is this so called

00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:30,880
aspirational advertising has become

00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:34,720
common practice for most advertising

00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:49,240
companies in Mexico this is we are going

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:52,380
to see a little video about this is a

00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:56,010
recent campaign creating the last year

00:03:52,380 --> 00:04:00,250
2018 for the luxury department store

00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:03,950
chain called Palacio de Hierro

00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:08,450
they try to make the brown clear givers

00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:12,349
by feature an androgynous model African

00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:13,599
model and disciple person maybe this

00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:18,280
sounds great

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:21,200
except they are grow all still

00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:25,400
light-skinned people so did you want

00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:28,910
this is a commercial brand from Mexico

00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:31,760
but you don't recognize Mexican people

00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:37,340
in the advertisement it's maybe I US

00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:41,510
people no this is no this is this is

00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:47,499
Mexico but the people it's not Mexican I

00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:47,499
[Music]

00:04:48,639 --> 00:05:00,380
lost my so well the perception within

00:04:57,139 --> 00:05:02,990
the Mexican advertising industry is that

00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:05,690
if a white person use an a specific

00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:09,050
brand the product is considered to be

00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:11,450
desirable Mexican marked marketers

00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:16,180
believe that if a consumer buoys an

00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:20,240
aspirational product that is used by a

00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:22,789
skin lighter skinned person the consumer

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:26,630
of things they are participating in a

00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:30,410
desirable wide lifestyle so what

00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:33,260
happened next the National Institute of

00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:36,680
statistics and geography in Mexico each

00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:39,740
bike year produce and study about social

00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:43,550
mobility in Mexico no it's what happened

00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:46,220
if I live better than my parents of my

00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:49,639
parents life the style life is better

00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:52,940
than my grandparents no but since the

00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:57,050
last year they include another feature a

00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:59,650
new a new feature in the story that was

00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:06,740
the skin tone

00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:10,250
they found that whiter people have

00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:13,010
better social mobility that

00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:16,580
darker people are darker skinned people

00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:19,960
know this is this is grassroot exchange

00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:24,020
in Mexico because for our culture it's

00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:32,420
we don't we think that we don't have we

00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:36,200
don't have Russians or ORS or fix

00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:38,180
Russians in our culture within our this

00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:41,810
is a this is for other countries not

00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:44,710
happens in Mexico but when the the

00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:47,900
Institute publish their work all the

00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:50,000
journalists start to screaming it's

00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:52,520
mostly because they don't harvest they

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,770
don't know statistics but the other

00:06:52,520 --> 00:07:00,290
thing the other journalist is start

00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:03,860
thinking that this is not happen

00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:07,510
the Russians bus based on core skill in

00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:13,790
Mexico doesn't exist so to prove that I

00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:16,220
made an algorithm first I made a web

00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:21,800
scraping of the Congress website in

00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:25,490
Mexico I allowed to have the photo of

00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:30,410
the Congress people the name and the

00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:33,400
political part okay then I have all the

00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:38,450
data of the Congress Congress women

00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:43,080
women and congressmen on Mexico and then

00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:46,110
with with the photo I train a model

00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:50,340
for the automatical google image search

00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:53,130
so I found I know this is the

00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:58,090
congresswoman jahil Abdullah Carmona I

00:07:53,130 --> 00:08:03,340
know one photo I'm searching in the

00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:06,310
Google image database Google tell me ah

00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:09,340
though all these pictures are for the

00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:13,720
for the congresswoman and I'm trained

00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:17,770
the model to recognize her on the on the

00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:22,510
on all images the next step last

00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:24,610
favorite cognition algorithm to to tell

00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:28,900
the mother this is that this is a person

00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:31,630
that you are looking for so that was in

00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:35,860
this step was a funny thing for me

00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:38,530
because I'm from science but also I'm

00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:42,219
from the art I am an artist and a

00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:45,520
scientist and I collaborate for the face

00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:48,460
recognition algorithm I'm Dre use

00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:55,210
another algorithm that that I use for an

00:08:48,460 --> 00:09:06,400
art project let me play the video to the

00:08:55,210 --> 00:09:09,210
degree this piece I made it do it with

00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:12,040
the Mexican artist called

00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:14,830
profile of Santo hammer is the most

00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:18,910
famous electronic artists in Mexico I

00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:22,330
made the algorithm to these piece the

00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:25,060
piece is called level of confidence it's

00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:28,210
an art project to commemorate the mass

00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:31,320
kidnapping of 43 students from

00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:34,450
ayotzinapa normalistas school in Iguala

00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:37,270
the project consists of a favored

00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:40,480
cognition camera that has been trained

00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:44,380
to tire of this look for the faces of

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:48,820
the disappear students as you stands

00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:51,700
front of the camera the system used an

00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:54,570
an algorithm to find which student

00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:57,990
facial feature looks most like

00:09:54,570 --> 00:10:02,630
Jules and gives a level of confidence of

00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:02,630
how accurate the match isn't a percent

00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:08,820
the biometric civilians algorithm used

00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:11,300
are typically used by military and

00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:15,270
police forces to look for suspicious

00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:17,640
individuals whereas in this project they

00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:21,000
are used to search for big victim

00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,980
instead so you can this is open source

00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:28,410
project for face recognition you can

00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:33,180
download it in on github it's a little

00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:40,950
you can I'm going to share the video

00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:43,530
also but when I'm use this album that I

00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:45,660
develop with Rafael asana for this

00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:50,850
project for face recognition

00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:53,790
so the first step I have all the photos

00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:57,060
and the data of the Congress people know

00:10:53,790 --> 00:11:00,990
I'm automatic I use an automatic google

00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:04,380
search image then from the image I used

00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:06,630
this algorithm that I take for the art

00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:12,090
piece that I collaborate with Lozano

00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:15,540
hammer to identify the face of each

00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:20,850
person and then and make an intense

00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:24,050
abstraction and calculation I made

00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:28,470
another model to recognize the skin and

00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:32,850
I calculate a really really accurate

00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:38,220
tone skill by sit on the of the average

00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:41,160
of all the photographs now with that we

00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:45,660
realized something really really strange

00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:50,070
in Mexico they write wine political

00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:54,210
parties in Mexico are are whiter that

00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:58,860
the left wine parties no the left called

00:11:54,210 --> 00:12:01,270
part the left wine parties are darker

00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:05,740
than the right wine

00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:10,300
that for Mexico and maybe we think that

00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:15,899
but by sit on data confirmed that this

00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:15,899
is happen in Mexico this was a shocking

00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:27,040
discover so then I have these I have I

00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:29,100
have the results of energy the

00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,860
nationalistic Obama statistics I have

00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:36,790
dissolved by said of our Congress the

00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:40,360
next step is is to define who is more

00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:43,540
successful in Mexico know for that I

00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:46,990
made the web s web scrubbing on of

00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:56,520
linking searching all the people that

00:12:46,990 --> 00:13:03,089
presume to be CEOs in Mexico so that

00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:08,230
that happened I found below you can find

00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:12,370
the six first skin tones but based on

00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:15,660
the Perla skin color palette and you can

00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:19,930
find the three first of them

00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:24,520
45 plus thirty five plus nine is 80

00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:28,649
something no 80 something percent of all

00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:33,100
the CEOs in Mexico have white skin tone

00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:38,290
now an only less than ten percent of the

00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:42,220
CEOs in Mexico have a brown have darker

00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:45,940
skin then the next is only for

00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:48,310
Geographics this is where the CEOs are

00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:51,010
located in Mexico in the main series no

00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:54,670
principal in Mexico City and the state

00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:58,510
of mix on Mexico Monterrey Angola Hara

00:13:54,670 --> 00:14:00,430
have that are currently are the most

00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:04,000
important cities on Mexico there are

00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:10,060
located the CEOs the next one is were

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:12,430
the CEOs story you can see this this is

00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:13,850
the 14%

00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:19,420
it's the

00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:24,009
National Autonomous University of Mexico

00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:27,110
but is that only it is the only one that

00:14:24,009 --> 00:14:29,240
that is free to enter the other the

00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:31,579
other universities are private the

00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:35,870
universities not the first one it is

00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:39,259
booyah are both private unum is the only

00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:41,180
one that have that is the free eater

00:14:39,259 --> 00:14:44,149
Managua and the habla

00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:50,930
the last one there are there are all

00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:53,600
private schools no so the 80 85 % of all

00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:56,389
the CEOs came from private schools

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,579
universities in Mexico but there are

00:14:56,389 --> 00:15:01,370
there is a difference this is for

00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:02,019
example were the were the students of

00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:05,630
CEO

00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:08,690
where the CEOs came from attempts one of

00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:12,620
the private schools this is how is

00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:15,230
separated by a area of a stream the area

00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:18,920
one is the engineer engine Aires and

00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:21,860
science the two ERA its chemical and

00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:29,480
biological the three it's all the stuff

00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:32,360
about how do you say management and all

00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:35,899
this stuff and the four area its

00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:42,470
humanities you can see the the CEOs that

00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:43,550
came from private schools have training

00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:47,779
in area 3

00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:52,490
no its management all this stuff of the

00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:57,050
area tree but the CEOs that came from

00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:59,360
the National University they they they

00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:03,259
study something related to engineering

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:06,100
or science and this is really strange

00:16:03,259 --> 00:16:08,269
because of the way that the private

00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:10,699
universities and the national

00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:15,230
universities form their students they

00:16:10,699 --> 00:16:19,069
have maybe a bias no and and Andy and

00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:23,000
that was funny no the only thing the

00:16:19,069 --> 00:16:28,720
gender of the 93% are

00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:32,990
man and only the 7% in Mexico are CEOs

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:35,120
and this is the model from the

00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:38,600
mathematical formula for succeed in

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:41,870
Mexican social mobility know if you its

00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:45,890
statistics is not a law no but if you

00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:48,830
are if you are white and you come from

00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:52,400
private university the probability to in

00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:53,770
Mexico to became a CEO it's higher than

00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:59,390
the others

00:16:53,770 --> 00:17:02,060
than the other options we present this

00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:04,400
study and became really famed

00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:07,850
our little famous in Mexico and in the

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:13,400
TV and this the revista Chilango

00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:16,430
is one of the most famous ruby reviews

00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:20,030
newspapers I don't know how to say

00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:22,220
revista a publication it's a really

00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:23,060
famous publication in Mexico City is

00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:27,260
called Chilango

00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:31,640
they dedicate the number of the February

00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:34,900
issue to ice for my study they dedicated

00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:38,900
all the number for for thinking about

00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:42,460
the racing's Basin I'm a skin tone in

00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:46,730
Mexico thank you

00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:52,760
when when when the when the editor came

00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:55,070
from me to write average are a review or

00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:57,920
something like that I told you I don't

00:17:55,070 --> 00:18:00,410
know how how to cry because I'm a

00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:04,040
scientist I know how to write but not

00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:06,890
like that for a journalist level so both

00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:09,440
I make a stuffed with program through it

00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:14,120
with computers with program with

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:20,750
programming so we decide to make this

00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:25,810
interactive calving it's like a photo

00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:29,010
booth calving you can stay

00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:31,840
no the same algorithm recognizes you

00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:36,970
take your skin tone and a curate the

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:42,310
skin tone with tencel flow with tencel

00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:48,190
flow technology and you can the

00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:50,740
algorithm measure all you want there the

00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:59,200
algorithm the algorithm and the photo

00:18:50,740 --> 00:19:06,510
booth I give the people this this thing

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:06,510
is a photograph of her skin tone and

00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:14,890
data related with your skin tone your

00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:18,070
your degree were you from something like

00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:23,590
I don't know the the 2% with your same

00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:26,580
skin tone and your and your level of

00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:30,370
study in Mexico half and I don't know

00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:33,960
something access to water or no I don't

00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:37,360
aesthetics is only for it's a project to

00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:40,060
take a look about the skin tone

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:46,000
discrimination in Mexico so for this

00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:49,960
project we won the National humans

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:54,130
rights price from media and we are

00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:57,550
really really excited about it so for me

00:19:54,130 --> 00:20:03,340
cold and data is a creative tool not

00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:08,110
only primarily for unravel the hidden

00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:11,230
dynamics on Mexico and for for me this

00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:14,920
works very very well so you can download

00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:17,470
all the cold it's on github you can you

00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:21,610
can use the face tracking the skin color

00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:25,500
tracking for whatever you want so thank

00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:25,500
you for being with me

00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,780
