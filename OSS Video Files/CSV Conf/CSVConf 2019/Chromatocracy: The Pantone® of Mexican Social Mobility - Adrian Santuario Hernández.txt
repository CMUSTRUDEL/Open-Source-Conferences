Description: 
	Skin colour ratings have been used in several studies about racial discrimination and racial attitudes but have rarely been used in Mexico. Although since 1917 the Mexican Constitution establish a legal equality of citizens without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion, it is common to see several discrimination on work spaces, educational facilities and government offices based on skin colour. Despite the last surveys leaded for INEGI (National Institute of Geography and Statistics) shows signals of racial discrimination in his reports, a glance at the map will suffice to see clearly that colour skin is an important issue for mexican social mobility. For example: 95% of the presenters on Mexican TV Shows have 1-3 colour skin tone (Based on PERLA Colour Palette) while 85% of the total Mexican population have 5-7 colour skin tone; that gap on the tones generate an aspirational sentiment of status: whiter is better. To support that correlation between skin color and social mobility I developed a Web Scraping, Machine Learning and Facial Recognition algorithm to answer two questions: Who is more successful in Mexico? (95 percent of CEO tend to have whither color skin (1-3 PERLA) that the rest) and, Are there a correlation between your political affiliation an your tone skin? (Right-wing party (PVEM) is wither that the left-wing party (PRD)). The work demonstrate how technology (Machine Learning Color Algorithm) can help to unravel hidden social dynamics in mexican culture.
