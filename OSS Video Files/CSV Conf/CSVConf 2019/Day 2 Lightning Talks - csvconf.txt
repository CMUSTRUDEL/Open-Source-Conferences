hi people um I'm just gonna go cuz we

00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,840
have short amounts of time okay got it

00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:12,030
I'm Georgia Bolin I'm gonna talk about a

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,340
game I have been designing as a side

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,590
project at the moment is called the tech

00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,480
policy card game I am taking name

00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:21,840
suggestions you can even do it on the

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,720
github if you want yeah so first like

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,029
Who am I my background is in

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,400
human-computer interaction in UX I've

00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:30,990
worked a lot in database technology and

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,759
a lot of like community and research

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,289
work I'm currently the executive

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,999
director at a nonprofit called simply

00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:37,079
secure I won't read that but that's up

00:00:35,999 --> 00:00:38,819
there

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,949
I'm also an advisor at measurement lab

00:00:38,819 --> 00:00:42,059
and at Tech Congress and I was

00:00:40,949 --> 00:00:44,100
previously at the open Technology

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:45,479
Institute which is where we started this

00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,350
project and the spatial information

00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:50,729
design lab so the idea was how can we

00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:55,289
use a game to better understand the

00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:57,299
policy space so policies pretty obtuse

00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:58,920
to most people I would say and people

00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:01,289
who work in policy aren't really great

00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,140
at making it approachable as a usability

00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:05,610
person and techie I was like let's do

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,380
something about this people love games

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,110
maybe we can make a game to make it

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,610
easier to understand there's a lot of

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,320
alignment like structures systems

00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,090
thinking you have opportunities for

00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,980
creativity so maybe we can get better at

00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,530
problem-solving around policy if we have

00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:20,640
games to play and that makes it a

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,740
lightweight way to understand those

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,750
concepts we could use it for workshops

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,180
and teaching and honestly just to

00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,430
decompress a little bit because when you

00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,470
lose the net neutrality fight again you

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,490
get kind of tired and maybe you want to

00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:36,810
be able to joke about it with your

00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:38,820
friends so I pitched a game company I

00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,080
reached out to Looney labs that makes

00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,810
flex because that was what we were

00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:45,060
basing it off of I was like hey super

00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,600
cool idea and they were like yeah that's

00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,159
cute

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,380
we don't think that'll make any money I

00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,380
was like too bad doing it on our own

00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:56,220
so actually that was just made it fun

00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:59,070
for us so we did this basically through

00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:02,130
a bunch of workshops started at the open

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:03,659
Technology Institute we did some there

00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:05,450
with like the lawyers and techies to

00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:07,520
work in the in the office

00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:09,410
we did some with some people who work in

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,720
like movement hosting so groups like

00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:14,720
rise up electric embers things like that

00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:16,310
I've took all those ideas and tried to

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,760
figure out a way to then pull that

00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:21,410
together my lovely partner twins built a

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,240
way for us to quickly prototype that so

00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:25,459
all the cards are defined in JSON

00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:29,660
there's a Python converter to turn them

00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:31,910
into printable HTML and then we printed

00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:35,390
at Moz fest and workshop that some more

00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:38,900
and have actual cards so this is all

00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:40,370
available on github you can modify it as

00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,200
you want so some things we've learned

00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:44,480
people are really good at coming up with

00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,489
hey these two things should mean this

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,310
thing they're not really great at making

00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:50,630
rules or actions they were really

00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,670
excited about it as something different

00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:55,519
people get really into the game which is

00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:59,870
fun lawyers really don't like to know

00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:01,610
how their work can be simplified so I

00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:03,800
have threatened by it and then we in

00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:05,840
playtesting at Moz fest we really found

00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,340
some issues around the like global and

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,160
local scale things that we think are

00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:13,040
general knowledge acronyms or concepts

00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:15,140
or agencies don't always translate so

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,290
yeah that's the github

00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:20,769
please fork remix it is super simple if

00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,769
you a question

00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,580
[Applause]

00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:31,629
hi I'm Stuart Geiger and I am going to

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,650
talk to you today a little bit about

00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:35,379
documentation

00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:36,760
I am the staff ethnographer at the UC

00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:38,680
Berkeley Institute for data science

00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,090
which is a kind of weird role I come

00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,530
from a background of anthropology and

00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:43,629
history and philosophy of science and

00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:45,129
very interested in sort of how we know

00:03:43,629 --> 00:03:47,620
what we know and how that's changing

00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:48,519
around data and computation and I want

00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,019
to talk to you a little bit today about

00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:52,390
a project at sign and collaboration with

00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:54,280
several of my colleagues at bids and

00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,599
around sort of documentation which is

00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,220
something that is sort of crucial but

00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,010
often something that we have a lot of

00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:01,599
issues with and this is a pizza came out

00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:03,639
of a sort of interview and field based

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,959
study around documentation in free and

00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:06,879
open source software particularly in the

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,079
day of science space initially around

00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,120
this event called the doc Athan

00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:11,409
which was sort of an event around sort

00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,269
of saying that you're going to only work

00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:15,670
on documentation for a week as opposed

00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:17,260
to working on other aspects of software

00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,130
and the paper is now published in the

00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,079
Journal of computer-supported

00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:23,020
cooperative work so go check it out at

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,699
Bentley slash OSS Docs and I'm gonna

00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,169
give you some brief high level sort of

00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:27,639
findings and sort of tease you about

00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:29,770
some things that are sort of interesting

00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:32,020
and that we've learned from this so

00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,940
first off almost everyone routinely

00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:36,039
relies on documentation especially

00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,449
veteran programmers one think it's

00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:39,520
interesting is that many newcomers to

00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:40,960
programming Berkeley students sometimes

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,810
think that Doc's using the documentation

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,830
is cheating or it's sort of wasting time

00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:46,330
and so this is one thing to sort of an

00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,380
education and training that you know a

00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,970
lot of this is something that science

00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,889
education also deals with this sort of

00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:52,599
rote memorization versus learning sort

00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:54,909
of higher-level concepts learning how to

00:04:52,599 --> 00:04:56,740
use the documentation and divisions okay

00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:57,550
is an important part of you know

00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:00,310
computer science and programming

00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:02,500
education there's also kind of the

00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:04,120
paradox of documentation which is often

00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,979
that sort of those who are best able to

00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,320
write documentation are often those who

00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:10,389
need it the least which is sort of an

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,159
open source there is this sort of it's

00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:14,349
based on scratching your own itch which

00:05:12,159 --> 00:05:16,360
in the case of documentation can have

00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:17,889
sort of you know caused some issues if

00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,690
it's sort of just relying on people to

00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:21,880
do to Authority to produce things that

00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:24,909
they themselves need for their their own

00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:26,050
sort of position a letís we also sort of

00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:27,340
find that time that sort of a.m.

00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,659
interview so documentation work was

00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,400
often perceived that's not being

00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:33,480
technical work but it involves many

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,830
technical and non-technical skills too

00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,600
we also doesn't most sort of opens our

00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:38,890
straight open software developers said

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,750
that they didn't enjoy writing

00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:42,520
documentation as much as they did sort

00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:44,470
of writing code and they feel like they

00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,000
get less credit from their peers for

00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:48,790
doing various kinds of documentation

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,010
work we also find that documentation

00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:52,390
work is not equitably distributed in a

00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,740
lot of these communities it can also be

00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:55,780
gendered but in the way that a lot of

00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,730
sort of community work is in these kind

00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:59,350
of projects and some projects that have

00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:01,630
require have policies requiring

00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:03,460
documentation for new features or give

00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:05,140
maintainer authors status explicitly for

00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,950
people who do documentation work but

00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,810
many do not

00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:09,490
instead of wrap up this is sort of part

00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:11,110
of a much larger ongoing project on

00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:12,460
sustainability invisible work and

00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:14,440
burnout in free and open source software

00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:16,780
it's been funded by the Sloan and Ford

00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,340
Foundation so if you'd like to talk to

00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:20,080
us about these issues please get in

00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,220
touch my contact info is there we love

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,050
to talk to you if you're sort of in

00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:24,700
these sort of spaces or have thoughts

00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,970
and feelings about them so thank you

00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,970
very much

00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:33,650
[Applause]

00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:35,570
all right hello everyone my name is

00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:37,940
Gabrielle Hayden this is Vickie Steves

00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:39,980
and we are both librarians for research

00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:43,760
data management and reproducibility I'm

00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:48,680
at U of L and Vicky's at NYU and we are

00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:50,690
here to say that when you think about

00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,580
reproducibility and communities of

00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,660
shared responsibility around

00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:56,000
reproducibility

00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:58,000
I think librarians the job of the

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,530
library is to use cutting-edge

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,990
technologies to disseminate reproducible

00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:05,510
knowledge from the papyrus to the

00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:08,450
printing press to the repository our

00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:10,460
titles talk riffs on Walter Benjamin's

00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:12,590
famous essay the work of art in the age

00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:17,750
of technological reproducibility and

00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:19,460
there he talks about the ARA write the

00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:22,070
the place and time in which someone is

00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:25,010
something is created so with apologies

00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:26,450
to my former career as a humanist let's

00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:32,120
think about the era as the computational

00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:34,190
environment right and as dr. Whittaker

00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,140
noted given the pace of computational

00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:40,370
change these days that ara is

00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:44,060
increasingly difficult to replicate to

00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:50,390
approximate when we want to make our

00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:51,410
research reproducible so and she did

00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:53,510
such a great job of talking about

00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:56,600
reproducibility I'm not gonna belabor

00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:58,520
that definition here but then but really

00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,200
just say people have started to really

00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:03,290
think of libraries when they think about

00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:05,600
research data management but the role of

00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:07,580
libraries in assisting and

00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:11,900
reproducibility is not just in data

00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:13,970
management but in everything that is

00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:17,450
goes into data management best practices

00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:20,180
plus capturing the workflow and

00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:24,410
provenance of workforce of research

00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:26,530
practices and really capturing as we say

00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:29,510
that are about computational environment

00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:31,430
and so I'll just say an overview of sort

00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:33,500
of what data librarians do which is sort

00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:36,169
of the niche of librarianship in which

00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,790
Gabriella and I are situated is that we

00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:39,649
provide services for data and

00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:41,300
information literacy we collect

00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:44,149
data for reuse by our community we

00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:46,639
support you and your grants we provide

00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:48,470
repository services and we do digital

00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:50,269
preservation and digital preservation is

00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:52,759
not just about keeping bits safe it's

00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:54,470
about enabling reuse and so you can see

00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:56,179
we're weaving these together could

00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:57,980
really have a lot of potential for

00:08:56,179 --> 00:09:00,470
holistic research reproducibility

00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:02,990
services and so here are a few ways in

00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:05,470
which I've worked in reproducibility

00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:08,360
services in the library and in which

00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:10,459
Gabrielle will also be working a few of

00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,470
these just to gloss over infrastructure

00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:15,079
so providing funds labor and use of

00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:16,850
floss reproducibility tools no corporate

00:09:15,079 --> 00:09:19,879
capture of reproducibility you know who

00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:21,920
I'm talking about education we teach a

00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:23,839
ton of classes on helping folks work

00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,629
reproducibly the biggest area of

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,189
improvement for libraries is making sure

00:09:26,629 --> 00:09:30,619
that the things that we are collecting

00:09:28,189 --> 00:09:33,230
are reproducible and then in digital

00:09:30,619 --> 00:09:33,800
preservation land we see it's timed

00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:36,499
myself

00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,970
this is emulation as a service as a

00:09:36,499 --> 00:09:39,350
means of preserving software and

00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,610
operating systems and making those

00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:43,369
available to researchers for

00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:46,029
computational reproducibility called

00:09:43,369 --> 00:09:46,029
action this

00:09:52,280 --> 00:10:02,060
oh so I'm a little stressed out but I'll

00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:04,280
try to tell a story so I'm I come from

00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:07,250
Belarus which is the country's not many

00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:09,830
people know about or not many people

00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:13,040
know about what's going on there it's so

00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:16,370
a place where there are 23 universities

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:19,690
also educated people but not a huge

00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:22,490
impact on the scientific or publishing

00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:24,200
worldwide so there was an attempt or

00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:26,780
there was a chance for dollars to be put

00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:29,300
on the map of the big science in the 30s

00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:31,850
when Albert Einstein applied to get a

00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:34,310
job at the Minsk University because his

00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:37,340
favorite assistant was teaching there

00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:39,260
but the decision was escalated all the

00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:45,830
way to Joseph Stalin who said that's not

00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:49,280
and no so I think there is a chance for

00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:51,320
people to put dollars on the map of

00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,360
science now and there's something that's

00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:56,780
happening that's kind of like a

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:59,150
revolution because ten years ago the

00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:00,530
librarians from 23 universities all the

00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:03,470
universities and dollars got together

00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:05,750
and made their universities publish all

00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:07,400
the research online and all the

00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:11,060
syllabuses and all the teaching

00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:13,700
materials in an open format all texts

00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:17,870
everything fully searchable on an open

00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:22,100
source port OD space and right now it's

00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:24,200
six hundred thousand articles and it's

00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:26,890
about topics about things like what

00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:31,070
happens when a part of your country's

00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:33,020
operated by fallout from Chernobyl and

00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:34,790
there is a part of dollars that's

00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:38,500
completely cordon off and there are just

00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:43,490
wildlife things happening there and

00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:46,190
scientists and you can find out about

00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:48,530
what happens when from from these

00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:51,260
publications I mean what happens when

00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:54,160
there is a language disappearing in real

00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:56,960
time because 20 years ago 30 years ago

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,600
there were 4 million people speaking my

00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:01,400
language and now there are probably two

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,440
hundred thousand so it's happened right

00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,960
now and there are studies about that or

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:09,190
maybe just not the data set about

00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:11,510
how things are changing in the

00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:15,380
generations in the academic setting in

00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:19,339
the non-english speaking area or country

00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:21,770
so any of those are things can be

00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:24,500
uncovered if you need this dataset talk

00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:28,270
to me I'm happy to open this up to

00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,270
anyone else thank you

00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:44,370
low my name is Asura and I'm here to

00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:45,870
present open knowledge maps which is a

00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:47,610
project that wants to change the way we

00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:49,650
discover research how do we discover

00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:51,720
research we usually go to these to our

00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:56,730
favorite search engine type in our

00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:58,560
keyword get a lot of results and then as

00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:00,030
we don't have the time to skim read two

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,180
and a half million papers we'll probably

00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:05,430
head over to the most cited one and for

00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:09,020
reasons that are probably not good

00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:12,810
lighting talk we believe this is bad and

00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:15,150
suggest an alternative which is a visual

00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:17,790
approach we create knowledge maps based

00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:19,710
on these results extract key topics

00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:22,470
build clusters you can dive into these

00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:25,380
you can read the papers and we try to

00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:27,270
create all our software all the projects

00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:30,720
all the content is open it available

00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:32,850
opening license and please head over to

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,500
open knowledge labs org and try it out

00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:38,970
the second issue that I want to address

00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:40,800
to lightning talks goes back to this

00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:42,840
issue all of us use Google Scholar

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:46,230
everyone does this is part of research

00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:47,790
culture and second of all and the more

00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:49,200
important fact is that this is bad

00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:52,470
because Google Scholar does not provide

00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:54,600
api's we do not know how they rank the

00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:59,490
results we have no access to historic

00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:03,630
data and this is bad because it not only

00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:05,880
affects researchers and institutions but

00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:08,220
also institutions and as a matter of

00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,900
fact by doing this we're running into a

00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:12,860
wall of dark knowledge this term coined

00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:15,120
by yes get out 2016 please look it up

00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:17,520
basically refers to the knowledge lost

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:21,680
not only behind paywalls but also behind

00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:24,600
the missing reproducibility behind

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:27,150
privatization behind commercialization

00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:30,990
and does also apply to all these other

00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:33,270
platforms that all of us use so this is

00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:35,520
why we at acknowledgments also support

00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:38,520
open infrastructure for discovery for

00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:40,140
knowledge discovery and please two

00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,700
things head over to Oakland Orange Maps

00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:43,350
if you're interested and also check out

00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:46,550
hashtag don't leave it to Google on

00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,550
Twitter thank you

00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:52,549
the students
