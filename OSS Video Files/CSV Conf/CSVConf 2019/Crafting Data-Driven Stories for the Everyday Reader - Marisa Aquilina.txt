Title: Crafting Data-Driven Stories for the Everyday Reader - Marisa Aquilina
Publication date: 2019-05-19
Playlist: CSVConf 2019
Description: 
	Journalists don’t write for other journalists—they write for the curious and community-minded public. In the same way, statistical journalism should not be a black box of visualizations and narrative meant only for data makers like us. Crafting data-driven stories for a general audience means giving readers an opportunity to interact with a fun and practical use case while explaining the interpretative thinking that lies under the hood of statistical methods. I am an undergraduate at Cal Poly that writes and builds interactive, data-driven publishings with a team of students. I'll walk you through how we ideate fascinating questions, make methods explainable, and use Jupyter Notebooks to share reproducible code.

hello my name is Marissa I am an

00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,980
undergraduate at Cal Poly San Luis

00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:12,110
Obispo and at school I lead a team of

00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:14,570
students and together we write data

00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:16,280
trippin stories I also do software our

00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:18,020
project Jupiter so I'm really happy to

00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,060
be here to share just a sliver of what

00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:24,020
I've learned with some of you about

00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:25,610
writing data-driven stories so foremost

00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,770
I want to assure you that you've seen

00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:30,590
many many data-driven stories if you've

00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:33,949
used the web and so they all look very

00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:36,350
similar they look like this and so I

00:00:33,949 --> 00:00:39,140
want to first outline a few of the main

00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:41,239
elements that are shared across all of

00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:43,969
data-driven stories and then I want to

00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:45,969
suggest to you a new type of element

00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:48,289
that you may or may not have seen and

00:00:45,969 --> 00:00:52,999
encourage you to use it if you ever

00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:55,100
decide to write a data-driven story so

00:00:52,999 --> 00:00:58,729
the three elements across any

00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:02,780
data-driven story are charts tables and

00:00:58,729 --> 00:01:05,899
prose so charts are just the graphs or

00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:09,100
the plots and these are summarizing the

00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:10,790
patterns or behaviors of your data and

00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,930
sometimes it compares different

00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:14,360
variables

00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:17,149
sometimes it compares different groups

00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:20,930
but overall it just summarizes general

00:01:17,149 --> 00:01:24,110
trends if you want to show your readers

00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:26,240
a more specific value you can use a

00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:29,119
table and two that way your reader can

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,960
pinpoint exactly the data point or the

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:34,759
value you want to emphasize and then

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,130
there's the part of a data-driven story

00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:41,270
where the story comes in and that's the

00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:44,299
prose so prose is just general plain

00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:49,070
language about what your data says and

00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:51,890
what that means for the reader and so if

00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:54,049
you're a reader that sees a lot of these

00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:56,289
you're very used to these types of

00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:58,640
elements but if you're a reader that is

00:01:56,289 --> 00:02:00,859
naturally curious about the world around

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,320
them but maybe not so much about the

00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:05,030
data in and of itself like some of us it

00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:09,259
might be overwhelming to see all of

00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:11,180
these elements at once and so whenever

00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:13,819
you're making a data-driven store

00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:16,189
consider using one more type of element

00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:19,370
and that's the interactive component of

00:02:16,189 --> 00:02:21,319
it and so present your readers with some

00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:24,319
sort of interactive component that

00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:26,720
allows them to see a practical use case

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:29,510
and play with some of the data so that

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:33,170
they know or they're shown what you mean

00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:35,810
before you tell them and so I'm going to

00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:38,840
show you a few convincing examples that

00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:41,209
other people have done and use these

00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,819
type of interactivity in their stories

00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:45,950
and I'll walk you through why that's so

00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:47,780
important when you're thinking about the

00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:49,730
types of questions you want to address

00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:52,340
in your story and how you're gonna

00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:55,730
convey your statistical methods to the

00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:58,519
readers so you may have seen the first

00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:01,010
one this is from the upshot and it's

00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:03,379
called what is your twin city and you

00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:06,500
can go and you can put in Portland as a

00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:09,430
city and it will spit out a city that is

00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:12,049
like Portland but not Portland so it has

00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:14,209
it has similar characteristics to

00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:17,720
Portland and here we see it's Kansas

00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:20,030
City Missouri and you can also see that

00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,970
the writer has pulled apart different

00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:25,099
types of categories to see what other

00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:27,230
types of cities are like Portland but

00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:30,620
maybe voted differently or maybe is

00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:33,260
located on the East Coast instead so as

00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:36,290
a reader if I'm going and I'm changing

00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:39,079
input and output I'm able to compare

00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:41,329
these different values and I'm able to

00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:44,720
compare what the reader or what the

00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:47,720
writer is trying to tell me so through

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:50,209
this type of interactivity readers can

00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,579
ask their own questions about how the

00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:55,069
data behaves and they can do their own

00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:58,280
comparative reasoning by changing the

00:03:55,069 --> 00:04:00,290
input and changing the output so I'm

00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,139
going to show you another example that's

00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:07,310
a bit more technical but still for a

00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:10,790
general audience and so this is called

00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:13,129
how algorithms know you'll type next so

00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:15,709
anyone that uses their phone to text

00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:19,370
know that there are algorithms that

00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:21,239
exist where you can put in a word and it

00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:24,889
will predict what the next we're

00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:27,810
say we'll be and so this is trying to

00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:30,389
demystify how that works to a general

00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:33,030
audience and so without saying Markov

00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:36,060
chain or any type of complex statistical

00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:38,940
model or even a simple statistical model

00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:41,370
it shows you that if you go to change

00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:44,520
the word for different types of people

00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:48,720
the output will be different and readers

00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:50,669
know that the language the data set that

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,889
is used to predict these values are

00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:55,289
coming from the Twitter accounts of the

00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:58,380
individual people so without knowing

00:04:55,289 --> 00:05:03,240
anything about probability as a reader I

00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:05,639
might guess that depending on the word I

00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,280
use in my Twitter account so if I use a

00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:10,440
specific word more maybe I'll predict

00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:14,039
that word more with higher probability

00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:15,840
and this is not exactly how it works and

00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:17,970
the reader might not know exactly how

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,699
that works but the fact that they even

00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:22,949
have this preliminary idea of how

00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:25,310
something works is helpful for you as a

00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:27,270
writer because you can use their

00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:30,509
conception of how things work around

00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:32,550
them as a springboard to explain the

00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:35,759
actual statistical model that you used

00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:40,169
so you might say something like not only

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,940
do people who analyze data care about

00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:44,460
how many times you say we're in your

00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,810
language but maybe you care about the

00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:49,139
number of times you say that word

00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:51,659
following a specific word and so that

00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:54,509
way it's easy to understand and digest

00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:56,430
these concepts that are most technical

00:05:54,509 --> 00:05:58,110
but they already have some sort of

00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:02,880
intuition about the way things work

00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:05,070
around them the last example is a more

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,889
practical example a little more

00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:10,440
scientific so I am from California and

00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:13,949
last year there was a lot of wildfires

00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:16,050
and so the New York Times decided to

00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:18,719
write an article with an interactive

00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:20,909
component about how the particulate

00:06:18,719 --> 00:06:24,060
matter from the smoke in the air it's

00:06:20,909 --> 00:06:26,940
drifting from region to region and so

00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:29,230
this is and this is what it looks like

00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:30,790
now so it's not updated

00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:33,340
because all that has pretty much

00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:35,230
vanished but you know there was a lot of

00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:38,140
red in California you can see some of

00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:40,240
that had drifted up to here Oregon and

00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:42,520
so because they put together this

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:46,000
interactive component readers already

00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:47,560
see how it's related to them and they're

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,690
more likely to stick with you through

00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,760
the rest of the article and see what you

00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:54,220
have to say about it so this type of

00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:56,830
interactive component gives readers sort

00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:59,680
of at stake an end result they saw um

00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:01,750
like how you want to present that

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,820
information and they see it happening

00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:07,110
and now they want to see what you have

00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:10,900
to say as a writer about that end result

00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:13,360
so I talked a bit about how my team at

00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:15,730
Cal Poly writes data-driven stories and

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,640
I feel it would be very unfair not to

00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:21,070
show you some of those tools that we use

00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:22,720
so we use the Jupiter notebook which I'm

00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:25,510
sure you've heard about a lot of this

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,400
conference and so we write our code in

00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:29,050
the Jupiter notebooks and we can share

00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,370
it through github so it makes it super

00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:34,090
easy to collaborate with different

00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:38,020
branches we also use Python and pandas

00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:40,330
so all of these libraries all work

00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:42,040
cohesively together so we chose Python

00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:44,500
and pandas as their data analysis

00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:47,500
libraries and it works together with

00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:51,250
plotly which is also a Python library

00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:53,290
and plotly is for graphing and the

00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:56,290
reason we specifically chose plotly is

00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:58,600
because there is a framework called dash

00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:00,580
and it allows you to create interactive

00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:03,490
web apps and so you can actually just

00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:07,360
copy the code from plotly and place them

00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:09,880
in - and your pots will render so using

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,490
these tools um was super helpful and

00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:16,600
these are what we use to to create our

00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:18,550
data German stories okay and also I

00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,770
would hate to leave you with the

00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:23,470
inability to go ahead and make your

00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:27,850
phone so I actually put together a repo

00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:30,490
and you can form the app dot PI file so

00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:32,410
it's a Python web app and if you fork it

00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,870
it gives you instructions in the readme

00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:36,510
on how to set up

00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:38,849
Oh super simply and so you can get your

00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:42,830
own web app or data-driven story up and

00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:42,830
