Description: 
	Journalists don’t write for other journalists—they write for the curious and community-minded public. In the same way, statistical journalism should not be a black box of visualizations and narrative meant only for data makers like us. Crafting data-driven stories for a general audience means giving readers an opportunity to interact with a fun and practical use case while explaining the interpretative thinking that lies under the hood of statistical methods. I am an undergraduate at Cal Poly that writes and builds interactive, data-driven publishings with a team of students. I'll walk you through how we ideate fascinating questions, make methods explainable, and use Jupyter Notebooks to share reproducible code.
