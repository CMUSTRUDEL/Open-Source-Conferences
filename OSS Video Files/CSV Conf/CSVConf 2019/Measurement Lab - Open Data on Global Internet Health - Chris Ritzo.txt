Title: Measurement Lab - Open Data on Global Internet Health - Chris Ritzo
Publication date: 2019-06-21
Playlist: CSVConf 2019
Description: 
	Measurement Lab (M-Lab) is the largest open internet measurement platform in the world, hosting internet-scale measurement experiments and releasing all data into the public domain (CC0). We are an open source project with contributors from civil society organizations, educational institutions, and private sector companies, and are a fiscally sponsored project of Code for Science & Society. Our mission is to Measure the Internet, save the data, and make it universally accessible and useful. M-Lab works to advance network research and empowers the public with useful information about broadband and mobile connections by maintaining a scalable, global platform for conducting internet measurements, and by supporting an ecosystem of external partners and users around the world interested in using the resulting open data. Our users are researchers, activists, analysts, journalists, experiment developers, hosting providers, regulators, municipalities, and every day consumers. M-Lab works to enhance internet transparency, and help to promote and sustain a healthy, innovative internet by supporting our users in their research and data analyses, developing and publicizing new use cases for our datasets, forming collaborative partnerships, and building open source measurement tools. In this talk we will introduce the M-Lab platform with the csvconf audience, share how our open data and open source tools are being used by communities around the world, and provide resources on how attendees might use them as well.

hi everyone thanks for coming I'm Chris

00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:12,940
Rizzo and I'm with the measurement lab

00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:15,400
project and I'm our program management

00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:17,550
and community lead a new title for me

00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,689
since we just shifted and became a

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,849
fiscal sponsor program at code for

00:00:19,689 --> 00:00:24,099
science and so we're really happy about

00:00:21,849 --> 00:00:27,759
that and being part of that family now

00:00:24,099 --> 00:00:29,589
my goal with this talk is to expose you

00:00:27,759 --> 00:00:31,329
to a measurement lab and our data set

00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:34,270
and see what people are doing with it

00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:34,840
and see what you might be able to do

00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:37,120
with it

00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,629
if you're interested but also to give

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:44,079
kind of an overview of the project and

00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:47,050
Sue we're an open data platform that

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:51,100
provides a measurement service internet

00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:54,399
service measurement platform so we host

00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:56,739
measurement tests well on servers around

00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,039
the world and then people can run tests

00:00:56,739 --> 00:01:00,910
against them to understand the

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,989
characteristics of their internet

00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:06,340
connections so their speed latency you

00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:08,620
know how fast is your internet

00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,750
essentially and then all of the data

00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:13,810
goes into a public domain data set

00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:15,400
that's available openly to anyone and a

00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:18,460
big part of my job is supporting people

00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:21,190
who want to use that data the github

00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:23,220
repo well our organization is up here on

00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:25,960
github so you should check those out and

00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,780
there's a lot of repos in there so if

00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,940
you're getting into the code just come

00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:35,950
up to me and we'll talk more about what

00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:38,140
you're looking for so a real quick quick

00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:40,300
start if you're in the room and you want

00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:42,400
to just start diving into ideas code

00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,900
what's there I wanted to put this slide

00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,300
up here to highlight a couple quick

00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:49,900
things we have a visualization website

00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:51,460
that aggregates our data by location in

00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,280
different locations around the world and

00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:58,180
a couple little screenshots here

00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:00,400
illustrate that comparing ISPs in this

00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:03,040
case in Portland over the last six or

00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:05,710
eight months and this little graph and

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:09,220
then the right-hand or this side runs

00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:11,890
the data it shows you know that you can

00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,810
access that data via the n API so that's

00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:15,140
a quick way to get started looking at

00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,790
our

00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,590
if you want to saw if you're building

00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:22,840
your own applications just start using

00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:25,760
that REST API with or download raw data

00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:28,250
and then of course if you want to dig in

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,989
more deeply and do your look at

00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:36,409
individual test rows for a specific

00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:37,849
location or time in time period we have

00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:40,220
all of our data is stored in bigquery

00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:41,329
and there's a QuickStart guide that

00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,430
we've written that helps you get started

00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:46,040
with that and of course the support

00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:50,480
address if you want to contact me or

00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:53,030
some of my colleagues to get help so our

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,010
mission is here on this slide measure

00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:57,650
the internet save the data and make it

00:02:55,010 --> 00:03:00,859
universally accessible and useful this

00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:03,379
is quite huge and aspirational but it

00:03:00,859 --> 00:03:05,060
keeps us moving toward a real that

00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:08,510
really aspirational goal so I'm going to

00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:10,280
talk about some of how we measure it how

00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:11,900
we save the data and then we'll switch

00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,700
and look at the accessible and

00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,489
universally accessible and useful part

00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:18,530
because that's I think the the bigger

00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:22,419
the bigger thing that we can't do by

00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:24,739
ourselves and this slide kicks off this

00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:26,239
this part of the talk because our

00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:28,370
community is made up of a lot of

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:32,150
different types of communities from

00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:35,629
companies who donate money or server

00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:37,819
space and transit to our servers to the

00:03:35,629 --> 00:03:40,480
folks who design researcher research

00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:43,459
experiments that are run on the platform

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,349
to the policy space and academics who

00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:48,319
want to use this data as a secondary

00:03:45,349 --> 00:03:50,540
resource and they're in their work so

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,579
tons of different types of audiences and

00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:55,310
this is a big challenge for us to try to

00:03:52,579 --> 00:04:00,229
you know balance meeting all of their

00:03:55,310 --> 00:04:02,840
needs we run a bunch of different types

00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:04,940
of experiments our tests and these are

00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:08,629
some of the ones that we've hosted over

00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:10,669
the years that most highly used is this

00:04:08,629 --> 00:04:13,190
network diagnostic tool from that was

00:04:10,669 --> 00:04:17,150
originally built by internet2 and it's a

00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:18,799
speed test it's you know measures much

00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:20,870
like some of the commercial speed tests

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:23,010
you might have encountered like

00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:24,610
speedtest.net or

00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:26,350
[Music]

00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:28,510
but all of that data is openly available

00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:31,510
and all the code is open so people can

00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:35,110
integrate that code into a web site or a

00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:39,280
software or hardware product these are

00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:42,100
all tests that have come from the

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,710
academic community primarily so folks

00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:47,889
studying Internet studying the internet

00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:49,780
and about 10 years ago started to think

00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:51,190
well we needed a scalable platform to

00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:53,680
try to understand how to make the

00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:57,550
internet better and that's how M lab

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,919
eventually came to be so we have quite a

00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,570
number of tests that originated through

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,160
the computer science and network

00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:08,440
measurement internet measurement

00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:11,470
community at different universities over

00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:13,030
the last 10 years we've grown from and

00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,950
this is sort of a platform growth slide

00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:16,510
to show sort of how long we've been in

00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:18,430
existence and where are some of the

00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:22,900
milestones of where we've placed servers

00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:24,240
over time we have servers in lots of

00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:29,380
places

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:31,300
about 130 locations 500 plus servers not

00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:34,660
in all areas of the world so we're

00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:37,210
working on that but you can see we've

00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:40,360
got a pretty heavy North American in

00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:44,140
Europe but a smattering across the rest

00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:46,330
of the world all this means that users

00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:49,060
will be directed to the tests based on

00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:51,010
their geography so if if you're in South

00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,229
Africa you'll be directed to our servers

00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:57,160
in South Africa and unless you use a

00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:58,979
tool that lets you select that color in

00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:02,669
this case is a bit dated

00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:05,890
it excuse me sorry

00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:09,910
yeah color so these dots essentially

00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:11,320
come from the map on our website red are

00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:13,210
some servers that we are that are

00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:15,550
currently offline or when I took this

00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:19,479
snapshot and then because each of the

00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:21,820
servers hosts a series of experiments

00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:23,440
some of them are fully available and

00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:26,940
some were not at this time so that's the

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,940
different shades of green there

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,370
we do all this work through a variety of

00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,220
partnerships and so you know different

00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:37,140
companies can and an organization's can

00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,670
contribute in a variety of ways and this

00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,890
is just a smattering of the different

00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:43,350
logos from our site we get a lot of

00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:46,470
corporate funding and and we're working

00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:48,300
on sort of diversifying that but many

00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:51,150
much of our hosting already represents

00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:53,280
that diversity from the global research

00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:59,880
and education network of which some of

00:06:53,280 --> 00:07:03,330
these folks represent now the volume of

00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:06,030
data is quite large so we currently get

00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:07,980
about 2 million speed test measurements

00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:10,800
a day from the network diagnostic tool

00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:14,220
and we hit a milestone two years ago

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,800
with a billion rows of data so it's

00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:18,600
quite large and that doesn't include any

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,760
of the other tests that we run so

00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,280
there's a rich rich data set for

00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,870
researchers and advocates to use to

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,090
understand it and it serves a variety of

00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:31,200
ways I am gonna get to the data just

00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:33,810
wanted to call that out and what what

00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:38,340
some of people are looking looking using

00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:39,570
it for the real spike in volume over the

00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:42,990
last three years came when the Google

00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:45,030
search team integrated NDT into a little

00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:48,120
widget when you search how fast is my

00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:49,860
internet or internet speed test Google

00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,020
provides this little widget where you

00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:54,030
can run your run our speed test that

00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,500
data goes to M lab and it provides a

00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:58,560
service to anybody who's doing that

00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,960
search so that's that huge spike and we

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,570
have other integrations that have also

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:07,470
you know helped with with getting test

00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:09,270
volume so I'm going to show some of

00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:12,150
those but fing box if you've used the

00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:14,310
fing app that is a measurement of kind

00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:16,020
of network quality speed they have a

00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:18,000
little device that you can place in your

00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:20,100
home that runs a speed test every so

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,070
often and gives that information to

00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:25,560
their their users EMA lab also has a

00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:28,230
Chrome extension for Google Chrome and

00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,940
if you'd like to run our test and save

00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:33,330
the results locally that's a quick and

00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:34,350
easy way for you to gather data about

00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:39,780
your own

00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:41,550
connections so those are more software

00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:43,200
and website type things but some web

00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:46,110
integrations are actually quite

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,420
interesting this is a screenshot from

00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:50,970
the Canadian internet registry Authority

00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:53,220
and they have built this Internet

00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:54,870
performance test portal that integrates

00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,870
our tests and some other types of

00:08:54,870 --> 00:09:00,450
network measurements like DNS SEC and

00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:05,010
things like this and then they've mapped

00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:07,650
the data in Canada across you know in

00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:09,210
little hexagons down there on the map

00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:11,580
this is a really great partnership

00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:13,470
because it not only did they integrate

00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:16,320
our tests but they also hosts and

00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:17,700
sponsors servers in Canada so this is a

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,400
really good example of the type of

00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:26,390
partnerships that we we that help us do

00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:29,220
what we do so that starts to get into

00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:31,230
the last part which is how do we make it

00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:34,320
universally acceptable accessible and

00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:36,510
useful and we can't do that alone so

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,490
it's a huge huge goal so what we do that

00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:40,500
is also through partnerships and

00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:42,390
supporting developer communities who

00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:46,140
want to use our infrastructure as a

00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:51,390
service and provide the data to their

00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:55,980
projects or analyze it in some way so

00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:57,570
how is the data used is a good segue to

00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,400
this because it gets to the end point

00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:01,830
what are people doing with this data and

00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:04,020
this is a link to our publications page

00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:05,280
on our website where we try to listed

00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:08,880
some of the different types of things

00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:10,860
that people are doing and so from left

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,540
to right we have an academic paper that

00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:15,690
was recently published it was just using

00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:19,080
our data to estimate households speeds

00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:21,330
and tiers of service in from the

00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,040
University of New South Wales and some

00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:26,610
academics who are working there and they

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,770
published a nice methodology we did a

00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:31,590
paper with Alliance for affordable

00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:34,260
Internet last year where we took our NDT

00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:35,910
data and segmented it by mobile and non

00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:39,020
mobile tests and then kind of looked at

00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:41,910
the aggregate for a short exploratory

00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:45,120
report with them on mobile broadband

00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:48,300
service in various countries and then

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,310
the third example is is an example of an

00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:53,220
advocacy organization that's looking at

00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:56,189
media ownership and consolidation issues

00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:57,870
in Venezuela and for the last year year

00:10:56,189 --> 00:11:00,720
and a half we've given them some data

00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:03,149
exports to support their journal is the

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,339
their advocacy and this particular one

00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:06,899
was around their elections their special

00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:13,439
elections last year so they were looking

00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:17,069
at public media and how how much did

00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:18,629
independent media independent

00:11:17,069 --> 00:11:19,860
journalists how much of a voice were

00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:21,870
they getting and they were doing some

00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,639
traditional type of election monitoring

00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:26,519
as well sending people to polling places

00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:29,040
and seeing if they were you know asked

00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:31,560
to stop taking pictures or something and

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,649
then they also looked at internet speeds

00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:40,019
in aggregate for the different areas in

00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:42,389
Venezuela around those election dates we

00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:44,430
we don't often go out and seek to find

00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:45,689
these these publications but some most

00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:48,269
of the time people just tell us about

00:11:45,689 --> 00:11:50,250
them we're not doing a ton of data

00:11:48,269 --> 00:11:53,089
mining this isn't on that where it's an

00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:55,800
area where we could we could expand

00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:58,620
another project that actually brought me

00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:00,600
out here last week was this was a

00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,680
project that we're doing through the

00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,050
Institute for Museum and Library

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,819
Services where we're taking our client

00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:08,399
tests code and putting them on small

00:12:05,819 --> 00:12:11,730
computers placing them in a library and

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,800
those computers are automated to run our

00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:15,899
tests at regular randomized intervals

00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,910
and that data will then go to a digital

00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:21,449
visual ization platform that we're

00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:24,389
building for that project it's a really

00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:26,970
exciting connection to the the element

00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:29,399
ground use of why why would we have this

00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:32,670
why would we do this to help public

00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:35,990
institutions understand the types of

00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,990
speeds that they're getting

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,399
so now I'll get into a few more web

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,339
integrations and this is kind of

00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:49,519
illustrating a few mapping initiatives

00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:51,769
so combination of like a website that

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:55,730
runs our speed test and then aggregates

00:12:51,769 --> 00:12:59,450
the results on a map in this case and in

00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:01,519
in some cases asks communities to answer

00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:04,810
a survey set of survey questions so

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:08,060
these are targeted more at cities

00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:09,860
regional governments that are you know

00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:11,480
wanting to understand the state of

00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:14,240
broadband in their communities with an

00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:16,250
open data set and open source code and

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,720
so that they've done and we've done in

00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:23,839
partnership with many cities and and and

00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:28,760
groups or to build you know build this

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:30,740
website or help them work on it to build

00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:33,620
kind of a community engagement tool and

00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:36,529
like planning an analysis tool so we

00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:38,029
partnered with this year and last year

00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:41,120
with the Center for rural Pennsylvania

00:13:38,029 --> 00:13:43,760
at Penn State University the Institute

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,290
for local self-reliance and they are

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,360
building a report and have published

00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:50,810
that back shared that back to the state

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:54,140
legislature in Pennsylvania and we've

00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:55,880
done some other smaller scale with like

00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:58,010
pilot studies in partnership with

00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:02,740
Seattle and some other rural communities

00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:02,740
in eastern Washington State

00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:10,529
and then this is another example that

00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:13,920
was built not by us but was supported by

00:14:10,529 --> 00:14:15,750
M lab Louisville Kentucky did a website

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,410
like this that aggregated our data by

00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:19,190
zip code

00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:22,740
same idea take a test answer a survey

00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:25,139
give the community data aggregated by

00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:28,290
zip code in order to really understand

00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:30,120
like where they have good service in

00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:32,639
their community and where they don't and

00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:35,610
they leverage that to decide where to

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,529
build out fibre to areas that were

00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:41,639
underserved and so this was a really big

00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:46,260
Digital Inclusion win that and this code

00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:48,990
is now being taken up by the tech

00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:53,430
Association of Oregon and they did a

00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:54,959
hackathon last two weeks ago where

00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:59,040
they're trying to build a national model

00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:01,290
out of this code to aggregate and share

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,560
make it something that many communities

00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:07,320
can use so that was it was a great

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:10,079
opportunity there but the same sort of

00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:12,630
thing you know they're running a test

00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:15,480
doing a survey looking at the results

00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:17,430
and making decisions about it one other

00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:20,220
example in the same vein that we

00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:22,170
published worked with the merit

00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:25,829
researchers and education network and

00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:27,810
Michigan State University this year the

00:15:25,829 --> 00:15:30,630
same kind of idea but they hooked in a

00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:32,459
homework gap component where they built

00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:36,329
the sites and then they are engaging

00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:38,100
with a sampling of k-12 districts across

00:15:36,329 --> 00:15:39,870
the state to take a home an assignment

00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:43,290
and run a speed test from their home to

00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:44,639
understand like where two kids in the in

00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:49,980
their homes you know what is their

00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:52,760
service like and a couple of their

00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,760
screenshots there

00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:58,470
and then this is another example that's

00:15:56,310 --> 00:16:00,240
looking at the large scale at the US so

00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:03,000
this is a project that's soon to be

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,010
published from our friends at open

00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,230
Technology Institute at New America

00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:10,440
Foundation in DC where they're looking

00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:13,500
at speeds from measurement lab in

00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:17,100
comparison and difference between our

00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:19,710
data and the FCC's data that is P submit

00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:22,710
about where they provide service and how

00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:28,890
fast it is it and what type of speeds is

00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:33,060
it and then the last example is sort of

00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:35,040
a it's a mix so right now

00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:39,660
this is a great tool for aggregating

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:42,540
data of various types including m labs

00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:45,810
data called internet is infrastructure

00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:48,570
org and the i3 connectivity Explorer and

00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:54,450
so the developer of this product has

00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:57,210
this this site it has done lots of gray

00:16:54,450 --> 00:17:01,320
is work to bring in many different types

00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:03,950
of shape areas and to bring in data from

00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:06,990
the Census API and the ProPublica API

00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:09,750
lots of different data sources to

00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:12,150
understand and and look at public data

00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:16,380
alongside of M lab data and other data

00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:20,220
sources to really get to interesting

00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:22,710
planning outcomes for for communities

00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,300
that that's his goal so it looks at

00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:26,340
County you can do look at counties you

00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:28,770
can look at sub county regions you can

00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:32,160
look at tribal communities you can look

00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:34,100
at micro urban communities and shapes

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:38,250
and areas it is a really powerful tool

00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:41,330
and so what is all this being for us is

00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,330
the next bit

00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:49,600
Emily I've supported quite a number of

00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:51,639
these initiatives and that's why we're

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:55,269
here talking about our data and with you

00:17:51,639 --> 00:17:58,240
because you know we we have supported

00:17:55,269 --> 00:18:00,429
lots of different individual initiatives

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,429
but to really scale and grow the power

00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:06,370
of our data in communities thank you

00:18:03,429 --> 00:18:09,730
we are wanting to bring all these things

00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:12,549
together into a unified set of community

00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:15,549
tools that give communities and

00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:18,159
organizations options for doing what

00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:20,950
they need to do for their for their

00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:23,169
communities and so we're planning as a

00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:24,909
developer and stakeholders convening to

00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:26,740
scope and build that project and if

00:18:24,909 --> 00:18:28,629
you'd be interested in that we can talk

00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:30,879
more about that but that's kind of the

00:18:28,629 --> 00:18:34,529
the reason we I wanted to share a kind

00:18:30,879 --> 00:18:34,529
of that ecosystem of different tools

00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:43,600
just dipping into the possibilities of

00:18:38,379 --> 00:18:45,460
what we can do with our data and to give

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:49,600
a few examples and now I'll just stop
