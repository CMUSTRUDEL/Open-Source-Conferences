Title: Creating Space for Inclusive Practices in Academia - Antoinette Foster & Lucille Moore
Publication date: 2019-05-19
Playlist: CSVConf 2019
Description: 
	With the advent of big data, many people are beginning to explore fighting social inequity and structural systems of oppression with data in order to (1) define the problem and (2) affect changes in policy. We are learning that, for the most part, much of the data around these issues don’t exist, which largely reinforces systems of oppression. At Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, OR, a group of people have come together to focus on the lack of representation of historically underrepresented minorities (URM) in science as well as the lack of inclusive culture within OHSU’s graduate programs. Our group is called the Alliance for Visible Diversity in Science (AVDS). We found that data on a variety of topics, e.g. statistics on the number of URM graduate students that are interviewed/accepted/decide to matriculate, and well-designed climate surveys to assess the culture of inclusivity are lacking. This leads to decision-making and policies based on incomplete data that disproportionately hurts already vulnerable populations. For example, many programs require that applicants report their score on a standardized test called the graduate record examination (GRE) despite the fact that research shows that GRE scores are more highly correlated with socioeconomic status than student success. We would like to share what we have learned through the process of forming AVDS: our successes, our challenges, and the imperative idea that we must in part approach social inequity issues with scientific and data-driven approaches.

	00:00:00,549 --> 00:00:06,490
okay hi everyone my name is Lucy Moore

00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:08,980
and this is Antoinette Foster and we are

00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:10,780
founding members of a student group that

00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:13,090
we started at the Oregon Health and

00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:15,000
Science University in Portland here and

00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:17,170
the name of the group is called the

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,530
Alliance for visible diversity in

00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:23,289
science and in today's talk we want to

00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:26,080
first highlight our stories and

00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:27,880
experience with starting the group and

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,760
specifically started a group that

00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:33,370
focuses on you know these complex issues

00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:35,560
of diversity and then the second part of

00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:38,140
the talk will address the importance of

00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:40,350
using data to drive decision-making

00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:42,700
surrounding these issues within academia

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,829
so we'll start by telling you just a

00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,430
little bit about ourselves and how we

00:00:44,829 --> 00:00:50,380
found ourselves working in this space

00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:52,390
I'm originally from Alaska and that I

00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:54,250
came down here for college went to

00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:57,340
University of Puget Sound in Tacoma

00:00:54,250 --> 00:01:00,550
Washington then I found myself at OHSU

00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:02,649
for my PhD in neuroscience and I

00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:05,829
graduated in January and I'm currently

00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:08,109
postdoc in there I got involved in these

00:01:05,829 --> 00:01:10,209
diversity issues during my graduate

00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:13,749
career because it's always been very

00:01:10,209 --> 00:01:16,539
apparent to me that there are serious

00:01:13,749 --> 00:01:19,329
social inequities and these just become

00:01:16,539 --> 00:01:21,729
further magnified as you kind of climb

00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:24,909
the ranks of academia and it's always

00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:28,119
been a point of frustration for me and I

00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:29,619
think that both of us as scientists for

00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:32,529
both of us as scientists it was very

00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:35,939
clear that these issues needed to be

00:01:32,529 --> 00:01:38,679
approached in a more scientific manner

00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:40,719
and I'm and for that I'm originally from

00:01:38,679 --> 00:01:43,119
Denver Colorado I'm a neuroscience

00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:44,859
graduate student at OHSU which is what

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,209
brought me here about six years ago and

00:01:44,859 --> 00:01:49,659
I've been working in diversity equity

00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:51,099
and inclusion for about 10 years so in

00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:53,469
order to get started I want to take a

00:01:51,099 --> 00:01:57,759
brief detour and ask you to imagine this

00:01:53,469 --> 00:01:59,439
scenario okay so imagine you move to

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,289
another country and you're the only one

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:05,529
there from the country that you're from

00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:07,840
maybe the language is the same but but

00:02:05,529 --> 00:02:11,410
small things like the food and

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,599
references are and there's nothing wrong

00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:17,050
with experiencing another color another

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:18,700
color another culture well let's say

00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:21,099
that this is what your situation is

00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,480
every day and you fight and it's so bad

00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:25,150
it gets to the point where you feel

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,129
socially isolated that doesn't sound fun

00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:30,040
right

00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:32,590
but now picture this brutality against

00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:36,549
people from this country is seemingly

00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:38,769
normalized and seemingly legal you're

00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:41,440
afraid to be out in public you fear for

00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:42,819
your family and your friends the larger

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,910
community of people like you that you

00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:47,769
don't even know some people in this new

00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:50,440
place don't know that this terrifying

00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:52,720
issue is a problem and others don't seem

00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:56,530
to care and this increases your feelings

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,209
of social isolation this was my

00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,810
experience starting graduate school here

00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:01,269
in Portland

00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:03,730
I thought socially isolated not only

00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:06,670
because I was the only person of color

00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:09,400
and the first black person and the only

00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:11,049
not just the first black person not just

00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,769
the perspective but also the first black

00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:16,660
person in my program but also because

00:03:14,769 --> 00:03:18,010
this was around the time when police

00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,810
brutality against black people is

00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:22,709
becoming more mainstream knowledge and

00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:25,389
no one around me care to talk about it

00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:27,579
oftentimes when minorities express their

00:03:25,389 --> 00:03:29,530
feelings of exclusion others can

00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:31,630
minimize the depth and importance of

00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:32,950
social isolation injustice and

00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:36,040
frustration that were constantly

00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:38,169
surrounded by I knew I needed more

00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,209
support for my environment and if I felt

00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:42,910
that way than other must've others must

00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:45,280
as well this led to the creation of our

00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:46,750
student group which this led to the

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,639
creation of our student group and we

00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:51,669
quickly found out that my experience was

00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:53,019
not unique I also want to emphasize that

00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:55,299
throughout this talk we'll be drawing on

00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:57,489
examples coming from OHSU but this is

00:03:55,299 --> 00:03:59,739
not specifically to sue at all these

00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:03,010
issues are found across institutions and

00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:04,630
across places of business so before when

00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:06,910
we tell you about our group we want to

00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:08,829
take some time to defer we want to take

00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:10,940
some time to define some terms of Leaves

00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:15,560
frequently so that we're all using

00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:18,110
definitions okay so the first term is

00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:21,019
under represented minority which will

00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:22,970
refer to as Yoram these are individuals

00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:24,320
from racial and ethnic groups that have

00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:26,480
been shown by the National Science

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,910
Foundation to be underrepresented in

00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:31,550
health-related sciences on a national

00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:33,830
basis and this is determined by looking

00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:36,080
at the percentage of each racial and

00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:40,400
ethnic group and comparing that to the

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:43,040
national percentage diversity Carrie did

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,350
a very good job of defining this so I

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,940
won't go on too much about this but I'll

00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:49,520
just say all the ways in which people

00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:51,740
can be different and this encompasses

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,520
basically any kind of spirit you can

00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:57,710
think of and then finally inclusion

00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,290
Carrie also did like a lovely job

00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:02,840
describing what inclusion is and what it

00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:04,850
looks like but it's the act of creating

00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:07,310
environments in which any individual or

00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:11,420
group can feel respected valued and

00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:14,780
welcome to fully participate so you can

00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:17,630
think of URM and diversity as who was in

00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:19,720
the room and think of inclusion as how

00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:21,770
do they feel about being there

00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,690
historically with affirmative action

00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:26,750
policies we've typically thought about

00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:28,610
numbers and so most initiatives are

00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:30,890
targeted towards getting diverse

00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:32,660
individuals in the room but haven't

00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:34,550
thought about ways to adjust the culture

00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,050
to accommodate different people or about

00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:38,330
creating environments where everyone

00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:41,570
thrives so keep these terms in mind as

00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:43,910
we move through this talk okay so about

00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:45,380
our student group we establish the

00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,840
Alliance for visible diversity in

00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:50,990
science and we call it even almost four

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,630
years ago and this and we chose to

00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:55,790
specifically focus on race and graduate

00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:58,580
studies we chose this focus because

00:05:55,790 --> 00:06:00,140
every form of diversity needs separate

00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,940
consideration to understand their unique

00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:04,430
challenges and race was receiving very

00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:06,560
little attention at OHSU it's also

00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:08,000
important to explicitly talk about race

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,340
in the context of scientific research

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,190
because unlike medicine there is no

00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:15,740
patient population that drives the need

00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:18,380
for racially diverse team so diversity

00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:21,560
efforts become voluntary and ultimate

00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:25,550
optional become an ultimately optional

00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,900
activity so these are the faces of the

00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:29,450
people who played a pivotal role in the

00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:31,660
creation of this group our mission is to

00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:34,490
recruit retain and most importantly

00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:37,280
support graduate students postdoctoral

00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:40,910
scholars staff and faculty members from

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:43,280
underrepresented backgrounds our group

00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:44,510
takes a two-pronged approach first we

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,700
focus on community building and

00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:48,590
education a major part of diversity

00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:50,630
equity and inclusion work is building

00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:52,820
community this is especially important

00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:55,250
and in research research where lapse can

00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:56,960
be relatively silo this physical

00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:59,090
restriction makes it just generally

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,110
difficult to build connections but it's

00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,850
even more challenging for

00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:03,200
underrepresented minorities is there a

00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:06,260
few of us and we're not located in the

00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,750
same space so building a community where

00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:10,250
everyone could gather was essential

00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:12,740
another important aspect of our group is

00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:14,210
education issues surrounding race can be

00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,460
intimidating and challenging to talk

00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:18,110
about so we wanted so we strive to

00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:20,000
create a safe space to teach others

00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:24,080
while cultivating a safe space for us to

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,970
do so ourselves we also work on policy

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,530
reform we work with the OHSU

00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:30,530
administration to create more effective

00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:32,480
policies practices and initiatives once

00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:34,280
we got started we quickly realized that

00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,500
this work came with considerable

00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:41,630
challenges and expected considerable

00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:44,810
challenges okay so one of the challenges

00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:46,520
we met quickly run into was vastly

00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:49,670
different understandings of the problem

00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:51,680
so we try to explain to administration

00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:53,750
that the lack of inclusive practices

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,240
created a problematic environment at

00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:59,270
OHSU and the responses actually

00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,910
disbelief and invalidation to the point

00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:03,560
where many people didn't seem to

00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:05,600
understand the problem to begin with and

00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,030
this makes sense because we were all

00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:11,720
coming in with vastly different personal

00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:13,850
experiences and perspectives without any

00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:17,810
mechanism with which to get us all on

00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:19,430
the same page and then of course this

00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:22,500
led to different understandings of

00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:26,220
solutions and what effective actions and

00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:28,440
might look like so for example OHSU

00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:30,450
created this diversity wall that

00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:33,900
highlights the history of diversity at

00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:36,150
OHSU and in oregon and though there was

00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:37,770
good intention behind this it doesn't

00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:40,020
really do anything to push forward

00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:42,360
inclusion so if you think back to

00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:44,130
Antoinette's experience entering grad

00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,350
school and not feeling supported and

00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:49,440
then being told by administration that

00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:51,600
there wasn't a problem with support for

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,340
diversity on campus you might imagine

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,990
that walking by this wall would feel

00:08:53,340 --> 00:09:00,510
more insulting than inclusive another

00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:02,370
thing of course we experienced was

00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:04,380
discomfort around the topic of grace

00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:07,260
because even though these conversations

00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:09,150
have increased in frequency in recent

00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:11,370
years it's still not particularly easy

00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:13,230
to talk about and we weren't all only

00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:15,480
talking about race but also wide the

00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:18,870
efforts around diversity and inclusion

00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,700
were lacking so the creation of the

00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:22,410
group was pretty uncomfortable for a lot

00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:25,640
of people and the way to see community

00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:27,810
and oftentimes these feelings were

00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:31,320
manifested in offensiveness and

00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:34,410
avoidance so for instance many people

00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,940
would ask why we focus on race whereas

00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:39,570
other groups would not be asked this

00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:41,820
question such as the LGBTQ group it's

00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:44,430
not questioned about their focus while

00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:46,500
we are offering kritis were criticizing

00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:48,120
questioned we're focusing on race

00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:51,480
without including other forms of

00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,640
diversity and to us this response just

00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,550
indicates a discomfort around the topic

00:09:53,640 --> 00:10:00,360
and a hard time acknowledging race as an

00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:03,870
issue and finally and most importantly

00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:06,900
there was little to no data around these

00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:09,150
issues to allow anyone to assess to

00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:11,190
assess the problem effectively and of

00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,990
course data are important to get

00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:15,780
everyone on the same page about what the

00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:18,720
problem actually looks like and are

00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:22,530
needed to formulate effective policies

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:26,850
versus taking the same approach over and

00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:28,230
over without metrics for success so it

00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:29,850
would be like if you were asked to make

00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,830
a cake but you weren't given

00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:33,750
instructions on how to do it or you

00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,920
weren't given a list of ingredients you

00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:37,970
may intend for your

00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:40,500
take two look like this but more likely

00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:42,899
when end up looking like this or worse

00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,910
so trying to create policies about data

00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:48,380
is a way to do it but there are better

00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:50,490
ways in other words we can use

00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:53,190
evidence-based practices and make

00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:55,380
data-driven decisions we're all critical

00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:57,630
thinkers and we understand the value of

00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:59,970
data and empirical investigation we

00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:01,800
apply this way of thinking to all facets

00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:04,320
of our lives yet when it comes to race

00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,600
this critical thought is often tanks

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,970
abandoned we rely on anecdotal evidence

00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,699
and opinions to inform our policies

00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:14,310
rather than research it we should

00:11:11,699 --> 00:11:15,870
probably just stop doing that because it

00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:19,500
doesn't make any sense and it actually

00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:21,870
hurts people so and these problems are

00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:27,870
not a black box they're sob about just

00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:32,370
like any other problem so what type of

00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:34,800
data might be helpful we can start with

00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:37,139
diversity which remember is who is in

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:40,140
the room and something that would be

00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:42,600
useful for instance is statistics on

00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:44,850
graduate school the regular school

00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,490
application and recruitment process and

00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:49,949
this might include percentage of neurons

00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:51,720
who applied percentage interview why

00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:55,649
people were denied and why people

00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:57,630
declined other information includes

00:11:55,649 --> 00:12:00,959
understanding what your admissions

00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:03,230
criteria are the cells obvious but most

00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:06,570
graduate programs don't have

00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:09,089
standardized rules around who gets in

00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:12,720
and why and this lack of standardization

00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:15,839
leaves too much room for personal biases

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,910
of all types to creep in so it would be

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,190
useful to understand what strong

00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:23,250
predictors of academic success are and

00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:26,120
adjust admissions requirements based off

00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:28,709
of this data and evidence so a

00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:31,079
well-known example of this is the GRE

00:12:28,709 --> 00:12:33,660
which is the standardized test for

00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:36,029
graduate school admission and obviously

00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:38,579
a better score increases your likelihood

00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:40,740
of acceptance and I've personally sat on

00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:44,250
admissions committees where there were

00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:47,150
certain professors who regarded the GRE

00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:50,810
as pretty much like the single

00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:53,330
metric for someone's intelligence but

00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:55,160
recent studies have shown that the GRE

00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:56,990
is a weak predictor of how people

00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:00,860
perform in graduate school and actually

00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:02,840
relates more to socioeconomic status so

00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:06,740
that now that we understand that the GRE

00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:08,870
is actually discriminatory institutions

00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:13,850
are slowly shifting away from including

00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:16,280
them in the application process also

00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:19,040
anytime we talk about diversity we need

00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:20,990
to add inclusion which remember is how

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,260
people feel about being in the burden

00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:26,150
and because this is about how people

00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:29,450
feel and work together qualitative data

00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:31,460
is invaluable and this data can be

00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:33,920
collected through well developed and

00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:36,770
through collect climate surveys although

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:39,170
this type of data is seen to some people

00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:41,570
as less important that couldn't be

00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:43,520
further from the truth because we see

00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:47,000
examples all the time of how the culture

00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:49,010
of an environment influences outcomes so

00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,580
these were just these are just a handful

00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:54,650
of examples of what kind of data would

00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:56,240
be useful but this really is a whole

00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:58,940
field there's a whole body of knowledge

00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:05,600
around this and there are infinite more

00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:08,900
questions you could ask so what is the

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:11,360
best way to collect these data okay so

00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:14,240
if you just glance at these terms

00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,190
they're probably familiar to you and we

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,900
we understand the importance of

00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:20,720
standardized definitions and external

00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:22,130
review but I want to explain them I want

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,570
to clean how these concepts can be

00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:25,840
applied to diversity equity and

00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:28,130
inclusion efforts so for example

00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:30,530
consulting the literature and experts is

00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:32,000
a basic first step there's a body of

00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:34,130
literature on this top on these topics

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,840
as well as other institutions and

00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:37,850
businesses working on that such as

00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:40,580
Google Google's Google and other

00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:42,430
institutions consult and collaborate

00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,540
instead of recreating the world

00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:47,570
transparency and accessibility is so

00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:49,970
important for racial issues in order to

00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:51,500
build trust there's a history of data

00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:53,690
being used against underrepresented

00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,490
minorities so institutions

00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:57,500
need to be transparent about data

00:14:55,490 --> 00:15:03,860
collection how its analyzed and how its

00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:06,460
interpreted so an example here is HS you

00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:09,560
recently distributed a Climate Survey

00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:12,950
around racism on campus which is really

00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:15,410
great but it mainly involved listing the

00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:17,750
number of racist incidences describing

00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:20,360
each describing actions and outcomes

00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:22,490
from each and someone who experiences

00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:24,830
microaggressions every single day isn't

00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:27,170
going to bother filling all this out and

00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:29,210
it's all it was also very focused on

00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:31,040
reporting which is problematic because

00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:34,310
most people don't bother reporting

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:39,110
things because reporting is not often

00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:41,210
done with action so it's so this the

00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:43,400
survey was very skewed and the data that

00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:45,590
it was collecting and I think it would

00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:48,020
have been more useful to just focus on

00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:52,730
evaluating health people generally feel

00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:54,800
about the state of inclusivity and I

00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:58,520
personally chose not to participate in

00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:02,930
that survey because of all the glaring

00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:04,640
issues that I saw so for example one of

00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:06,200
the issues that I personally saw was

00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,060
that the demographic that's most likely

00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,980
to experience the racial insult is the

00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:11,060
minority than if you pull the data you

00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:14,870
might think that there's not a problem

00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:16,340
which is not true and also if I

00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:18,230
personally so there not a lot of

00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:21,470
underrepresented minorities within my

00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:24,410
program right and if I represent 10% and

00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:26,210
I don't participate in the survey the

00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:29,180
near surface is not representative so

00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:30,770
it's really important to know it's

00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:32,960
really important to have a plan a

00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:34,880
transparent plan and make that plan

00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,410
accessible with how you are collecting

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,420
the data and what you plan to do with it

00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:39,740
and that also leads to the idea of

00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:42,380
community-based participatory research

00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:44,540
and initiatives this is imperative

00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:47,270
because there is information that only

00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:49,790
your community knows that helps inform

00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:51,230
solutions so for example consulting with

00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:53,120
avens or other professional

00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:54,290
organizations with the creationists of

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,030
that survey could have helped us

00:16:54,290 --> 00:17:00,350
understand the caveat before we even

00:16:56,030 --> 00:17:02,210
sent it out okay so you may have noticed

00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:04,600
that we are essentially describing the

00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:06,699
scientific method right collect data

00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:09,640
Herman metrics in action execute

00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:11,410
evaluate address repeat yeah this is

00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,850
painfully obvious everyone in this

00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:14,439
audience is not surprised that we're

00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:16,750
saying these things but what's shocking

00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:18,339
is that it's overwhelmingly under unit

00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,870
underutilized within academic

00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:21,309
institutions and businesses when it

00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:27,309
comes to diversity equity and inclusion

00:17:21,309 --> 00:17:30,789
efforts so what can you do this is the

00:17:27,309 --> 00:17:34,480
most frequently asked question after

00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:37,510
doing this work for a long time and now

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:40,690
you know why data is important and Dei

00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:43,570
what can you personally do to create

00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:47,140
data-driven diverse equitable and

00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:49,289
inclusive environments data collection

00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:51,610
around these issues is ultimately up to

00:17:49,289 --> 00:17:53,650
those who are getting paid at your

00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:56,500
institution to do this work it should

00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:59,110
not be a volunteer activity but we can

00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:04,659
all still play a role in ensuring that

00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:06,039
it's happening how do we do that the

00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:08,530
first thing that we would like to

00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:10,179
suggest is to be critical about any deep

00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:11,919
are about any diversity equity and

00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:14,289
inclusion effort that's taking place at

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:17,830
your that's happening at your place of

00:18:14,289 --> 00:18:19,179
work so so ask who's in charge of these

00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:21,400
efforts how's the data being collected

00:18:19,179 --> 00:18:22,900
was the impacted community involved

00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,549
don't be afraid to ask the tough

00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:26,820
questions because they're not tough

00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:29,440
questions if it's being done right

00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:32,200
educate yourself on this issue on these

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:35,020
issues resources are everywhere so read

00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:37,659
up on the topic I personally think that

00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:39,460
this is one of the so I think this is

00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:41,890
one of the most personally accessible

00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:44,260
and most underutilized strategies I

00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:45,850
encountered you are better equipped to

00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,740
be critical when you have a starting

00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:49,090
base of knowledge and I think that this

00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:51,039
is something that people can feel more

00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:52,450
comfortable with to talk about if you

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,870
have some idea of what you're talking

00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:54,640
about

00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:56,320
so I can't underscore the importance of

00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,710
educating yourself on the topic and

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:01,809
lastly do not rely on those who are

00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:03,190
getting paid to collect this data or

00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:06,880
working on diversity equity and

00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:08,770
inclusion to solve the issue we all know

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,059
the culture center or the inclusion team

00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:13,539
in our workplace but ask

00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:16,730
so how can a small fraction of people

00:19:13,539 --> 00:19:19,700
change the entire culture of a workplace

00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:21,590
that does not make any sense in order to

00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,389
find solutions we all have to be on

00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:25,249
board and we all have to be actively

00:19:23,389 --> 00:19:32,210
engaged in order to create diverse

00:19:25,249 --> 00:19:34,399
equitable and inclusive environments so

00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:36,230
we hope we've shed some light on the

00:19:34,399 --> 00:19:38,240
fact that diversity initiatives within

00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:40,820
academia require more rigorous of

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,190
purchase and also giving you some ideas

00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:45,110
about how you can personally contribute

00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:47,990
to a better environment in your space

00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:49,700
