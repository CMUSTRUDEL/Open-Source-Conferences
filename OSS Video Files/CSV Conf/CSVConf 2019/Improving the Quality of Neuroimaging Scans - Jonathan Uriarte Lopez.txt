Title: Improving the Quality of Neuroimaging Scans - Jonathan Uriarte Lopez
Publication date: 2019-05-19
Playlist: CSVConf 2019
Description: 
	My presentation will be on how adjustments to the human connectome project (HCP) pipeline, with the use of the advanced normalization tools (ANTS), improved the data quality of neuroimaging scans provided by the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE). Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder consisting of altered social and communication difficulties along with repetitive and restrictive behaviors. It is difficult to study a living brain safely which is why we use neuroimaging techniques such as MRI. Data quality can be affected by subjects moving in the scanner, or due to computing pipeline issues. Adjustments to the HCP pipeline lead to an increase in data quality, and a decrease in the amount of data lost. This will save researchers time, money, and data to study the neurophysiological aspects of ASD.
