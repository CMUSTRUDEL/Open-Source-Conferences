Title: Improving the Quality of Neuroimaging Scans - Jonathan Uriarte Lopez
Publication date: 2019-05-19
Playlist: CSVConf 2019
Description: 
	My presentation will be on how adjustments to the human connectome project (HCP) pipeline, with the use of the advanced normalization tools (ANTS), improved the data quality of neuroimaging scans provided by the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE). Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder consisting of altered social and communication difficulties along with repetitive and restrictive behaviors. It is difficult to study a living brain safely which is why we use neuroimaging techniques such as MRI. Data quality can be affected by subjects moving in the scanner, or due to computing pipeline issues. Adjustments to the HCP pipeline lead to an increase in data quality, and a decrease in the amount of data lost. This will save researchers time, money, and data to study the neurophysiological aspects of ASD.

pleasure meet everyone my name is

00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:05,930
Jonathan we got the Lopez but feel free

00:00:03,979 --> 00:00:07,130
to call me John is what I go by I'm an

00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:08,929
undergraduate researcher at the

00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:10,849
developmental cognition you're imaging

00:00:08,929 --> 00:00:13,089
lab also known as a beacon lab over here

00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:15,679
at Oregon Health and Sciences University

00:00:13,089 --> 00:00:17,930
just up the hip up the hill here in

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,490
Portland I'm an undergraduate researcher

00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:21,080
up there and my approach is gonna be

00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,820
about improving the quality of neuro

00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,880
imaging scan so without further ado let

00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:28,250
us begin so here's a little bit of

00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,570
overview of my my project the main our

00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,670
main project is to study the brain

00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:33,890
specifically subjects who have been

00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:36,469
diagnosed with autism now the problem

00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:38,120
with autism neurodevelopmental disorder

00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:40,399
so we need to we need to study the brain

00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,600
but we're humans were not cars we can't

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,829
just like pop the hood and see what's

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,319
going on with the engine and pop it back

00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:47,839
up so that's why we use this this

00:00:45,319 --> 00:00:49,489
technique called MRI imaging which

00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:51,289
stands for magnetic resonance imaging

00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:54,469
and this is done so we could are able to

00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:59,449
take images of the brain safely and in

00:00:54,469 --> 00:01:01,190
subjects so ASD also known as autism

00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:03,559
spectrum disorders as I mentioned is a

00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:07,070
neurodevelopmental disorder it's

00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:09,110
something that the that the patient has

00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:11,180
and it's stuck with them for the rest of

00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,710
their lives and it's common commonly

00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,149
characterised by these following

00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:17,180
symptoms they have a hyper sensitivity

00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:18,380
to stimuli whether it be light sound a

00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,880
lot of people around

00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:22,100
they're just able to feel them a little

00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,299
bit a little bit more as well and they

00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,159
also have a restricted repetitive

00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:27,229
repetitive behavior so they tend to

00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:29,930
follow the same routine over and over

00:01:27,229 --> 00:01:32,049
again and some some and in some cases

00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:34,159
they also suffer from social and/or a

00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:35,359
language skill deficit which makes them

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,770
hard to be able to communicate with

00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:39,530
their peers and engage in the

00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:43,280
environment and there are many reports

00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:45,560
about the approximate diagnosis rate and

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,509
in the United States but I was able to

00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,340
find that affects approximately 1 in 59

00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:52,340
children in the United States so it's a

00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:55,130
fairly common neurodevelopmental

00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:56,630
disorder within the community so because

00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:58,070
like I mentioned it's a brain disorder

00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,929
so we want to try to study it which is

00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:02,719
why we use MRI imaging because we're

00:01:59,929 --> 00:02:05,270
able to do it safely and by able to use

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,300
MRI energy we were able to get subjects

00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,070
who have been diagnosed with a

00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,720
Steve compared them to brains who are

00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:11,220
typical developing also known as TD

00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,680
subjects and try to see what are the

00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,780
difference between the two unfortunately

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,850
MRI scans are expensive a technical

00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,310
they're very big clunky machines the

00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:22,080
latest 3 Tesla machine is about three

00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,670
million dollars and in case you guys

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,210
didn't know it's about five hundred

00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:29,400
dollars per scan per hour so it's really

00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,840
really really expensive so because

00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,150
there's a lot of neuroimaging papers

00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,370
have difficulties getting with data

00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:40,560
acquisition and low sample size is a

00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:43,380
common issue so in order to solve this

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,420
load data acquisition issue we return to

00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:48,570
this an international neural imaging

00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:51,000
data set known as Abidin a byte stands

00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:53,460
for autism brain imaging data exchange

00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,980
it's an international data exchange

00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:58,530
program created by dr. dr. adriana

00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:01,110
DiMartino and dr. stuart Macduff's key

00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:04,860
to try to solve this a small data issue

00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:06,360
acquisition it's a it has 25 an

00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,970
international institution and there's

00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,470
more than two thousand MRIs subjects

00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:12,750
subjects who have been diagnosed with

00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:14,310
autism spectrum disorder as well as

00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,260
subjects who are just typical developing

00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:18,239
normal kids and these neural imaging

00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,920
scans contain structural scans which

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,110
allows to be able to see the 3d volume

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,459
of the brain and functional scans which

00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,750
allow us to be able to measure brain

00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:26,880
activity within the brain so it's like

00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:28,260
if you tap your fingers your but you get

00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,750
brain signals pop up and we're able to

00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:32,610
detect that this is a great data sharing

00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,750
initiative because some scientists tend

00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:36,239
to be a little bit stingy with the data

00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:38,450
they don't like to share but because of

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,500
there's a lot of because of this large

00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:41,730
reservoir of data they are neuro

00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,959
scientists around the world are able to

00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:44,370
use this data to be able to conduct

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,900
their own research and this is great

00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:47,880
because by having a lot of researchers

00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,890
look into this data we're able to see

00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:52,680
distinct differences between autistic

00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:54,180
and typically developing subjects but

00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,250
before we can use those data for

00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,959
analysis we under we had to go through a

00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:01,200
quality assessment protocol developed by

00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:02,940
the lab this quality assessment protocol

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,010
is called a standard operating procedure

00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,600
for quality assessment it was created by

00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,850
Emma chips key and the rest of the

00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,590
community team at the deccan lab and the

00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:13,350
purpose is to quality control also known

00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:15,069
as QC managing data this is used to

00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:17,109
analyze the abaya data says because

00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:18,820
we want to make sure that the data set

00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:20,470
is usable for analysis and but before

00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,810
you can become research reliable you

00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:25,180
must undergo our trainings you must take

00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:27,130
a training training set past it you got

00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:30,070
it you're given a list of subjects you

00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:31,360
got to have an 80% success success rate

00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,729
before you can be considered certified

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,979
so why do we want to call the control

00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:37,210
this data set together like cooking you

00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:38,530
want you're trying to make it you're

00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,699
trying to make a meal but before you can

00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,050
make a meal you want to make sure your

00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:42,789
ingredients are good you got good

00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:45,039
vegetables good knee and all that

00:04:42,789 --> 00:04:46,449
otherwise if you try to use like nasty

00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:48,430
Rami when trying to make a hamburger

00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:48,820
you're gonna get sick so we don't want

00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:53,970
none of that

00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:56,139
so the QC I outlined three three main I

00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:58,479
guess you can say subject

00:04:56,139 --> 00:05:00,910
there's the Atlas registration or

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,710
basically get the raw t1 metadata and we

00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:05,229
match it to a template known as the

00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:06,759
Montreal Neurological Institute also

00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:08,380
know Emma I'm an AI template we try to

00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:10,000
see if they can match up sky making sure

00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,470
your left hand matches up with your

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,270
right hand make sure your right hand

00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:16,599
matches up the left hand make sure that

00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:18,370
the maps are all on the same page the

00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:20,349
second part the second part of this QC

00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:22,210
outline is the structure data but we

00:05:20,349 --> 00:05:24,550
look at the the 3d volume of the brain

00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,479
and we check out the delineation of the

00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:28,270
gray white matter

00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:30,220
those are the two matter the types of

00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:31,479
brain matter that's within the brain and

00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,310
we want to make sure that they're

00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:35,370
delineated or mapped and bordered or

00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:37,419
correctly that way we can try to see

00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:39,760
structural brain differences between the

00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:41,440
two so two types of subjects the last

00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,550
one is functional data which I mentioned

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,300
previously is to measure brain activity

00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:48,280
so what's going on with brain activity

00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,330
and ASD and TD subjects that's what

00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,610
we're trying to measure try to see if

00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:53,620
there's any other reasons that might be

00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:55,750
able to explain their symptoms and this

00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,159
QC scoring outline is guideline is

00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,139
really really simple you got three

00:05:57,159 --> 00:06:00,970
numbers you got one usable it's like

00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:02,260
getting an A in your class got two which

00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:04,030
is probable it's like barely passing

00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:05,560
with a c-minus may or may not may or may

00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:08,560
not have happened to me and then you

00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,900
have a 3 which is unusable is completely

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,220
completely not not able to be usable or

00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:14,440
analysis it's kind of like getting an F

00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:17,500
in the class so I'm gonna give you guys

00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:20,409
exactly three examples of a usable

00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,330
probable and unusable scan so I know

00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:23,340
this is a

00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:25,889
a lot of information but right now I

00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:28,560
want you guys to focus on the unusable

00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:31,650
scam which is the scan on your right my

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,789
left so if you look at the frontal lobe

00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:35,340
which is like the front part of your

00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:37,349
brain right by the right by the eyes on

00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:41,280
the left left this portion of the brain

00:06:37,349 --> 00:06:42,659
you can see that the red lines it does

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,699
not really capture a lot of the gray

00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:45,990
matter and that's that it's like trying

00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:48,810
to catch a bunch of fish but you missed

00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:50,789
most of them and because and because of

00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:52,139
that that scan is unusable for analysis

00:06:50,789 --> 00:06:53,669
and then if you look in the back portion

00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:56,789
of the brain you can see it's kind of

00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:58,919
it's not straight but like a like a

00:06:56,789 --> 00:07:00,210
brain supposed to look up look like the

00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:02,520
skull supposed to look like and this is

00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:03,900
it could be due to because of warping so

00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,250
when your side of the scanner you're not

00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,289
supposed to move you're only allowed to

00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,879
move like 200 microns which is like this

00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:10,680
and the reason why you don't want to

00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,840
move in the scanners because the MRI

00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,490
machine will pick up a signal here but

00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,900
if you move them I think it's right here

00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:18,150
so that would cause warping where it's

00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,560
just gonna stretch out and you don't and

00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:21,270
you don't want that in a scan and that's

00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,400
why this scan was rated as unusable

00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:25,229
because I'll be the possible moving

00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:28,349
within the scanner or maybe processing

00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:29,879
pipeline issues and then the the image

00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:32,430
right underneath it is an example of a

00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:34,289
functional scan this is really really

00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:36,659
bad because you're missing about half of

00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:38,279
the brain and if you don't believe that

00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:40,139
that's a bad scan you try to do this

00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:42,930
presentation with only half your brain

00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:44,610
power so then the second skin second

00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:47,009
scan you see the probable which is like

00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:48,990
dead straight in the middle if you look

00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:51,180
at the green circle on that image you

00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:52,830
can see that that the frontal lobe the

00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,569
delineation between the great wife

00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:56,639
matter is good but the reason why this

00:07:54,569 --> 00:07:58,139
is a probable scan is because if you

00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,839
look at that yellow circle in the middle

00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:03,449
the delineation goes into the dura and

00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:04,529
that's also a possible sign of maybe

00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:06,930
moving within the scanner which

00:08:04,529 --> 00:08:08,610
disqualifies this from being a usable

00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:10,740
scan and then if you look at this

00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:12,300
functional scan on the bottom you can

00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,219
see that there's some there are some

00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,050
areas where the red lines does not does

00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:17,550
not fully encompass the brain whether it

00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:20,310
be the superior parry arrow or the

00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:22,379
frontal lobe and because of that it's

00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:25,020
not quite usable for analysis then the

00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:25,789
usable scan it's clear cut simple

00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,599
easygoing

00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:28,949
everything is what it's supposed to do

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,710
it was supposed to look like so that

00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:31,940
gives it it gives it a long

00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:34,250
the folks will scan on the bottom

00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,750
there's a slight issue with the left

00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:38,630
temporal lobe but that's perfect for

00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:40,670
analysis so next thing I'm going to talk

00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:42,350
about is that as our key ket is our

00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:43,370
deacon computing pipeline which is which

00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:47,090
we're going to be using to try to

00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:48,550
improve the prove the MRI scans so

00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:52,070
they're going to be two main approaches

00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:53,990
approach one uses the original human

00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:56,450
connectome project which is the acp

00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:58,340
minimal processing pipeline this

00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:01,850
pipeline was cleared created by Glasser

00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:03,650
and his colleagues to try to process MRI

00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:06,200
imaging scans this is the latest

00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:10,480
state-of-the-art pipeline and because of

00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,480
this a lot of individuals are able to

00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:15,890
use this pipeline to create high quality

00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:18,290
imaging scans but the issue with this a

00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:20,570
bi data set is that the scans used for

00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:23,660
the scans when they were acquired

00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:25,430
weren't originally made to be put

00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:27,800
through this pipeline and because of

00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:30,140
this you might get some issues that I

00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,510
will explain later and it's kind of

00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:34,670
these scans were obtained in the 90s and

00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:36,620
they were used with older MRI MRI

00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:38,870
scanners and this pipeline was designed

00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:40,640
to be able to process data from newer

00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:43,250
up-to-date scanners so because of that

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,660
you may you may have some issues which

00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,160
is why it's kind of like trying to put a

00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:50,810
snapshot on your old flip phone it's not

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:52,190
gonna work so by subway so our approach

00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:53,990
to is going to be using our modified

00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:56,360
pipelines where we grab the same HCP

00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:57,620
pipeline but we're gonna tweak it a

00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,230
little bit it's like grabbing a recipe

00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:01,490
for for a dish or just gonna adjust the

00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:03,110
recipe and try to see if we can make it

00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:05,180
taste better so we're gonna use that

00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:07,070
same HCV pipeline but we're gonna add

00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:09,020
this algorithm known as advanced

00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:12,160
normalization tools also known as ants

00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:14,840
this is an algorithm created by a vet

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,650
advanced and his and his colleagues and

00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:20,180
we're gonna use that algorithm to try to

00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:22,490
see if the if there's any changes within

00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:24,830
MRI quality imaging and try to see if

00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:26,000
there's any way to see any notable

00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:29,300
differences and this is going to be our

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,460
decamped pipeline so this is gonna be

00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,960
our pipeline overview right here so I'm

00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,980
just gonna go over this briefly and if

00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,880
anyone who wants to discuss this

00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:37,730
pipeline further

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,890
feel free to let me know during our

00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:41,570
question seminar so we have the pre

00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:43,840
freesurfer pipelines basically where we

00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:45,250
got the are raw

00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,880
some files that we get from the MRI

00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:50,350
scans and we got we generate the 3d

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,890
volume of the brain and we match it to a

00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,360
template

00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:54,490
I like the Atlas registration I

00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,350
mentioned previously and then you have

00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:58,660
free stuff free server pipeline which is

00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:01,420
right here in the middle this is where

00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:03,730
you grab the the brain volume and you

00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:04,900
delete the predefined structure this is

00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,610
where we get the gray and white matter

00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,920
going on in the brain as I mentioned in

00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:11,050
the structural scans and the last

00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,940
portion is the post freesurfer pipeline

00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:14,260
and that's where we grab all the mm ride

00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:16,060
data and we provide them to the safety

00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:18,340
files which is B which is used to store

00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,990
the data and the second part of the

00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:22,150
pipeline is the HCP functionals

00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:23,530
functional pipeline and this is where

00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:25,840
we're gonna be getting be able to get

00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:28,810
all of our functional data so we got the

00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,190
fMRI volume data where we grab the this

00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:32,650
is where the part of the pipeline where

00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,910
you grab all the fMRI data and you and

00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,440
you normalize it across the for

00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:37,300
destruction of the fan now what do I

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,460
mean 540 you grab the 3d structure of

00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,450
the brain with respect to time and we

00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,790
try to use that to measure brain

00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:45,970
activity during tasks while the subjects

00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:47,500
at rest and in response to stimuli to

00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:48,580
try to see if there's what's going on

00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,380
with the brain activity and how the

00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:53,470
brain is working when they're engaged

00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:55,300
and possible environmental stimuli so

00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:57,670
this pipeline they see right here is

00:11:55,300 --> 00:12:00,790
approach 1 it's the original HCP

00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:02,500
pipeline and that's what a glass Turner

00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:05,020
and his colleagues were able to defend

00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:07,030
and I'm gonna mention the two ants

00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:10,480
Corrections that we did to try to

00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:11,500
improve this pipeline so as Corrections

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,930
worn it's going to occur right before

00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:17,290
the pre freesurfer the purpose of this

00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:20,320
algorithm is to denoise denoise the data

00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:22,750
basically try to get so denoising is

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,430
where we grab is where we try to

00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:26,530
increase the signal-to-noise ratio so we

00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:29,410
try to make those scans clearer more

00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:31,030
easy to see and make it not so ringy so

00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:33,010
you could able to properly delineate the

00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:34,540
gray gray white matters throughout the

00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:39,460
brain and then the biased field

00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:41,290
correction it's why we try to that's why

00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,490
we try to grab grab grab the in if the

00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:43,660
brains supposed to be like right here

00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:44,890
and it's a little bit out it's kind of

00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,540
like going to the chiropractor getting

00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:48,880
your spine realigned and just pump it

00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:51,490
back into place that way we can make

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,900
sure that portions of brains are

00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:54,900
supposed to be there we'll be there

00:12:55,209 --> 00:13:00,040
and the second portion of the scan is to

00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:01,569
use aspiration to the purpose of this

00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,999
this portion of the algorithm is to

00:13:01,569 --> 00:13:05,709
adjust the scan better to the Atlas make

00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:07,420
sure again make sure that Alliance

00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:08,470
better because it of Alliance better we

00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,939
make sure that all the parts of the

00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:11,559
brain that are supposed to be there are

00:13:09,939 --> 00:13:14,050
going to be there which kind of end

00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:16,660
result can give us more accurate higher

00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:17,980
quality scans now I know I mentioned I

00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,269
want to know I went through this and

00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,879
mentioned through a complicated papaya

00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:23,800
so what does this mean for the audience

00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:25,269
so we basically grab this raw daikon

00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,199
file that you would get from the MRI

00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:30,369
imaging we run through this pipeline

00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:31,749
you're able to get the structural scans

00:13:30,369 --> 00:13:36,790
from the first portion of the pipeline

00:13:31,749 --> 00:13:39,670
on the top and also generates the

00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:42,790
functional scans shuttling from the HTTP

00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:45,399
functional pipelines on the bottom so my

00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:48,670
next so after implementing this this

00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:49,959
pipeline reprocessing the scans my my

00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:52,149
next step was to try to figure out all

00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:54,129
right how did it compare how does this

00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:55,720
do these ants production do they make

00:13:54,129 --> 00:13:57,279
the MRI quality scans better

00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:00,879
did they make them worse do they make

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:02,379
the same and from what I find about the

00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:04,449
couple subjects that it actually makes a

00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:06,699
little bit better the brain image on the

00:14:04,449 --> 00:14:08,619
very left is an example of a scan that

00:14:06,699 --> 00:14:11,049
was a process with the original HTTP

00:14:08,619 --> 00:14:12,730
pipe processing now this scan is now

00:14:11,049 --> 00:14:15,579
horrible but as you can see it's not

00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:17,049
quite clear it's pretty ringy amidst the

00:14:15,579 --> 00:14:20,439
red lines missed some of the gray matter

00:14:17,049 --> 00:14:23,649
and it's not quite as clear and if you

00:14:20,439 --> 00:14:26,049
can see the the circle on the red circle

00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:27,910
you can see that the skull shape is not

00:14:26,049 --> 00:14:30,309
very straight it's not very curvy it's

00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:31,720
kind of kind of wavy so that can either

00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:35,049
be again either through moving with a

00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:37,149
scanner or because of processing

00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:39,069
pipeline issues so that in the brain

00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:40,929
image on the right that's an example of

00:14:39,069 --> 00:14:42,459
the of a brain scan from the same

00:14:40,929 --> 00:14:43,660
subject but instead it was very

00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:45,759
processed through the new decamp

00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:48,069
pipeline the HTTP pipeline with the ants

00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:50,499
correction what this you can see that

00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:52,449
the gray matter the brain scan overall

00:14:50,499 --> 00:14:54,189
looks a lot clearer and if you look at

00:14:52,449 --> 00:14:57,160
the great at the green circle instead of

00:14:54,189 --> 00:14:58,660
having that wavy fortunate portion of

00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,429
the skull going like this it's nice and

00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,929
curved like it's supposed to be and then

00:15:00,429 --> 00:15:03,339
if you look in the blue circle you can

00:15:01,929 --> 00:15:03,920
see that a lot more gray and white

00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:06,500
matter is

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:09,139
absurd and the scan looks a lot clearer

00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:11,120
so so after after noticing this with the

00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:13,250
with a bunch of with a bunch of subjects

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,839
I did a quality control analysis uses it

00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:19,399
is using the same protocol I mentioned

00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:20,930
previously of an abaya data set that was

00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:23,899
processed originally with the HTTP

00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:25,459
pipeline and compared it to the new

00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:27,709
pipeline that we use right here so I did

00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:30,920
a quality control of about a hundred

00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:33,050
eighty subjects well and I did that

00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,579
twice oh I looked at roughly three

00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:37,459
hundred and sixty scans to try to see

00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:39,170
like alright how does it improve and

00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:42,410
what was really really interesting is

00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:43,970
that this improved it greatly so if you

00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:46,040
look at the pink color or salmon-colored

00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:48,980
portion of the graphs those are the part

00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:51,920
that's the the numbers you used to

00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:54,079
represent the the modified pipelined a

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,910
new HCP pipeline with the aunt with the

00:15:54,079 --> 00:16:01,100
aunts Corrections and the blue cyan

00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:03,440
colored are the ACP the original HTTP

00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:05,269
minimal pre pre processing pipeline and

00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,959
I'm not sure if you can see it very well

00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:10,940
but the there there were Derrick rated

00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,800
with usable problem unusable their label

00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:15,440
on the bottom if you were to see up that

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:18,410
unusable rate for for both pipelines you

00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,269
can see the unusable rate is 36% for the

00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:22,370
original HCP pipeline that's more than a

00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:25,010
third of the data set but the unusable

00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:26,899
rate for the for the new DCAM pipeline

00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:28,730
is only seven percent and then if you

00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:32,990
look at the usable road it increased

00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:35,690
from 36 percent to 53 percent so it was

00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:39,199
really really an it was a drastic

00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:40,640
improvement and to everyone in my lab

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,839
everyone was happy about it because we

00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,519
showed hey you did good science

00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,350
everything went well and then I know

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,579
there's gonna be status statisticians

00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,899
over there and this is science we need

00:16:46,579 --> 00:16:49,760
use tests for everything so I run the

00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:51,410
chi-square analysis and we were able to

00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:54,199
get a p-value at three point five times

00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:55,310
ten to the negative eight so a rip so in

00:16:54,199 --> 00:16:57,800
other words it's a really really

00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:58,310
statistically significant so this is

00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,779
great

00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:02,660
that means we we proved that this

00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:04,970
pipeline improved we showed that there

00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:06,439
are data issues with the abide data set

00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:08,480
but that doesn't mean that this data

00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:10,459
state all that all the MRI images there

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,500
is unusable for analysis we're able to

00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:14,059
grab that data set refine a little bit

00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,380
and then we could try to improve the

00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:19,280
data quality and then

00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:22,339
possibly release it back to the public

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:24,020
but instead of having these these iffy

00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:26,539
scans you're gonna have a more reliable

00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:29,660
and more accurate scans to be able to

00:17:26,539 --> 00:17:32,510
give to the community so just to give a

00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:34,610
little recap your imaging is a very very

00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,900
important technique it's great MRI scans

00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:38,299
we're able to see the brain without

00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:40,760
having to cut it cut it open but as I

00:17:38,299 --> 00:17:42,410
mentioned previously MRI scans are very

00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,919
very expensive they're very very

00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,960
technical

00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:47,570
they're hard to run and then also trying

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,340
to kind of process of scans take a lot

00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:52,400
of energy a lot of math a lot of

00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:54,260
manpower and it's very very tricky it's

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,490
very very sensitive very very delicate

00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,850
so you need to be careful with it as

00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,650
well

00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:59,659
so the abaya data set is a great

00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:01,880
publicly available initiative because as

00:17:59,659 --> 00:18:04,730
I mentioned that's about 2,000 subjects

00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:07,340
so if you do the math every scan is

00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:13,880
about let's say 30 minutes so that's

00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:15,110
about 250 times let's just say 2,000 I

00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,179
should I take the bag and I can do the

00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:19,130
math it we said we save a lot of money

00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:20,539
and a lot of time I would I would use a

00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:22,460
calculator by don't got my phone on me

00:18:20,539 --> 00:18:24,110
but yeah it's a lot of skin it's all

00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:26,000
scanned data that we're able to do and

00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:28,390
then also it's really already gets

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,830
really hard to get subjects that who are

00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:32,059
diagnosed with autism and also typically

00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:34,010
develop it because you got to go through

00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:35,840
this whole process to host this whole

00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:38,600
protocol to get it into the university

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,130
to get into the into the scanner and not

00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,620
only that you need to make sure that the

00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:44,390
that the children are not moving in the

00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:47,090
scanner otherwise it's gonna affect data

00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:48,440
quality and so and that's one of the

00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:50,240
reasons why I wanted to make this new

00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,710
pop line because I'm not sure if you

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,510
guys remember when you were kids it's

00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:54,890
very very hard for us to stitch so very

00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:56,360
very hard us to do what many of you guys

00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:58,220
are doing very greatly just sitting

00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,600
still listening paying attention because

00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,309
I remember when I was little care like

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,690
to move around a lot are you distracted

00:19:01,309 --> 00:19:04,460
by little thing and just go left and

00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:07,100
right but because of that movement we're

00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:10,669
gonna kind of a data data issues when we

00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:13,909
collect these scans so the previous of

00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:16,610
this pipeline is still ongoing because

00:19:13,909 --> 00:19:18,039
because I just shown right here we

00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:20,210
didn't we had very very good

00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:21,559
improvements but that doesn't bubble

00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:23,179
we're not gonna stop there we want to

00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:24,919
get better we want to try to see what

00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:26,070
can we do to improve that because these

00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:28,590
issues are

00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:30,270
go away anytime soon for MRI scans so

00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:31,830
forever to figure out like little tricks

00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:33,630
little kinks little things that we can

00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:35,190
do to improve data quality we're gonna

00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,690
do them we're gonna do them and not only

00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:38,130
that also she'll share them with the

00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:40,200
community so they're like hey this is

00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:41,340
what we noticed with our scans maybe if

00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,440
you do this for your scans they might

00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:45,120
improve as well and that way we are able

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,640
to go back to the main question of like

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,610
what's the difference between brain

00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,240
development or a brain structure of

00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:53,310
subjects who have been diagnosed with

00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,480
autism spectrum disorder and such as who

00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,890
are typically developing so what's

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,560
causing their symptoms what's going on

00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:59,940
right there and a lot of saying

00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,290
scientists will like this new pipeline

00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:03,870
because that one it will state untie

00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:07,020
money resources and most important only

00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:10,590
data because that's the big deal out of

00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:12,210
all this so this is the end of my talk

00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:14,400
but before I take questions I want to

00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:15,870
give a special thanks to Oregon Health

00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,060
and Science University provided me a

00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:20,070
great workplace and also the deccan lab

00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:22,560
I had way too many individuals who have

00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:25,020
been patient with my many many questions

00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:27,540
I'm a biochemistry major by practice

00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:30,000
going into this world of computer

00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:31,260
science MRI scans and I'ma be honest I'm

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,150
not that I wasn't that great at physics

00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:35,760
at school so I don't had many great

00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:37,770
people in the community helping out I

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:41,070
had my mentor dr. Eric pesco help me out

00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:42,630
Eric Earl Derrick sturgeon and my shifts

00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:44,400
key and his perón and many many many

00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:46,770
other people I can mention and they're

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,570
all shown in this and this picture that

00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:49,830
they've been able to help me out and as

00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:51,810
I mentioned I must I'm still a student

00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:54,480
and I'm not sure if you guys remember

00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:56,100
causes expensive so I want to give a

00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,720
special thanks to the Robert E McNair

00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,740
Scholars Program and also the building's

00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,020
EDA program for offering a scholarship

00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:02,880
money and a research opportunity to do

00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:05,910
my incredible research that I'm doing up

00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,200
there I wish you well that further adieu

00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:09,800
I'm now open to percussions

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,800
