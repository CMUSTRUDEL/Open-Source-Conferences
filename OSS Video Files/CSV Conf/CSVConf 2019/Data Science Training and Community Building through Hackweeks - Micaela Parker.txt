Title: Data Science Training and Community Building through Hackweeks - Micaela Parker
Publication date: 2019-05-19
Playlist: CSVConf 2019
Description: 
	Informal training activities enable researchers at all levels to rapidly learn data science tools and best practices that fit their research questions and make significant advances in their work. In this talk, I will describe a highly successful informal training that has emerged in recent years called Hackweeks. These hackathon-style events place a strong focus on cultivating data science literacy, building a community of practice, and developing resources within an existing domain-specific community. By bringing together researchers from many different universities to address methods challenges within a research domain, Hackweeks take advantage of a shared language and shared scientific objectives. The Hackweek structure is designed to foster collaboration and learning among people from various stages of their career and technical abilities, and catalyze a community through a shared interest in solving computational challenges within a field (Huppenkothen et al, 2018). Hackweeks originally came out of the Astronomy community (Astro Hack Week, entering its 6th year in 2019) and the model has been successfully propagated to: neuroscience (Neurohackweek, now a 2-week NIH-funded program called Neurohackademy), geospatial sciences (Geohackweek), oceanography (Oceanhackweek), and more.

I'm really excited to talk to you today

00:00:03,189 --> 00:00:07,060
about hack weeks but I know we've all

00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:08,980
been sitting for a while so if you feel

00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:11,410
like standing for a moment I'm gonna

00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:13,480
take a page out of Alex's playbook and

00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:16,119
say we're I've been sitting on those

00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,159
hard chairs for a couple hours now so I

00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:21,159
also have this photo up here to kind of

00:00:18,159 --> 00:00:23,829
mentally cool you given the heat of the

00:00:21,159 --> 00:00:25,480
day okay and you can stay standing while

00:00:23,829 --> 00:00:27,699
I do my little intro here I'm Makayla

00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,069
Parker I'm the program coordinator for

00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:32,140
the MSD SES at the Morse loan data

00:00:30,069 --> 00:00:35,620
science environments but I'm also first

00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:36,399
timer to CSV conf so I want to say thank

00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,289
you

00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:41,050
to Danielle and the other organizers

00:00:38,289 --> 00:00:42,940
this is a really fun meeting and I have

00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:44,620
learned a ton I've met some amazing

00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:48,399
people and I'm just really grateful for

00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:49,989
being part of this group so if you are

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,640
not familiar with the Morse on data

00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:55,089
science environments we are a

00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:57,129
partnership that started in 2013 between

00:00:55,089 --> 00:00:59,050
two funding agencies the Gordon and

00:00:57,129 --> 00:01:01,239
Betty Moore Foundation represented by

00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:03,399
Chris pencil and the Alfred P sloan

00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:05,620
Foundation represented by Josh Greenberg

00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:08,230
and those two foundations funded data

00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:10,150
science initiatives on three campuses at

00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:12,760
UC Berkeley the Institute for data

00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:14,380
science commonly known as bids at the

00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,900
University of Washington the e Science

00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:21,070
Institute and at NYU the Center for data

00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:23,290
science and this partnership the

00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:27,400
motivation was really in recognition

00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:30,040
that as data is increasing in all fields

00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:32,110
and in all forms that even some of the

00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,670
very best researchers especially on

00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:35,890
university campuses were really

00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:37,720
struggling to generate knowledge and

00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:39,850
insight from these data so there's

00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,610
essentially this gap between university

00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:45,070
domain research and data science best

00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:47,590
practice and it was this gap that the

00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:49,720
partnership sought to address so the

00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:52,660
mission was really to build bridges that

00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:54,490
would enable researchers to learn use

00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:58,180
and teach data intensive research

00:01:54,490 --> 00:02:00,820
practices and the idea was really to

00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:02,590
create a feedback loop so as we bring

00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,630
these data science practices to the

00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:06,640
University researchers this would enable

00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:08,640
them to make new discoveries but that

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,830
would also spur new questions

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,600
and really push for new methods

00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,640
developments to occur and these would

00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,950
feedback and then any enable even

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,350
greater discovery so the goal here was

00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,510
kind of this feedback loop those of you

00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:23,490
that are familiar with the MSD SES are

00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:25,560
also very familiar with this figure and

00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,990
some of you may be sick of it by now but

00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,900
I think it still illustrates really

00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:32,400
nicely the the bridges that this

00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,040
initiative was trying to push through

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,739
and they were loosely grouped into six

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,709
themes career paths and alternative

00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:42,930
metrics education and training software

00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:44,550
tools and environments reproducibility

00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,370
and open science which is something I

00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,900
know is important to many of you here

00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:50,700
working spaces and culture and

00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,920
ethnography and evaluation and this last

00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,840
one is renamed data science studies and

00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,519
today I'm going to talk about a program

00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,920
that really is at the heart of these

00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:00,720
three so education and training software

00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:04,110
tools and reproducibility and open

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,060
science but the real authors and the

00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:07,470
real work force is behind hack wakes are

00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,769
in this slide I'm just kind of

00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:13,530
presenting their work today and a lot of

00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:15,180
the take-home messages can be found in

00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:17,970
the paper that I've cited at the bottom

00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:21,000
here that's hoopin quotin at all 2018

00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:23,280
and PNAS the authors are there photos

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,160
are up here dan yellow is the lead

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,230
author and there were representatives on

00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,420
this paper from all three of the MSD

00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:32,610
institutions and daniela herself is

00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:35,400
actually a cross pollinator she started

00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:36,989
as a postdoc at NYU and then is now at

00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,090
the University of Washington with an

00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:39,600
affiliate position at the Science

00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,959
Institute

00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:45,299
I'm also highlighting on the right-hand

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,400
side Kristina and Nicoletta these are

00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:49,380
the leads of the latest hack week to

00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,549
join the group the water hack week and

00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,829
I'm going to be talking a little bit

00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:54,810
about how they've kind of evolved and

00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:58,799
taken some interesting approaches to

00:03:54,810 --> 00:04:01,079
change the hack week structure so back

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,870
weeks this is essentially community

00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:05,579
building within domains so many of you

00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:08,220
are familiar with hackathons or

00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:10,709
hackathons style events pack quakes

00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:13,260
borrow from this concept but they add a

00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:13,840
really strong component about around

00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,859
learn

00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,840
and peer teaching and learning so and

00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:22,270
pedagogy sorry around learning and

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,370
pedagogy so in this respect they lie

00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:27,550
somewhere between a summer school and a

00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:30,250
traditional hackathon the components of

00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:32,410
hack weeks include as I said because of

00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,820
the learning lots of tutorials both on

00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:35,980
introductory and state-of-the-art

00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:37,720
methodologies but also like more

00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:40,330
traditional hackathons there is a

00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,190
component on participant driven project

00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:45,220
work in a collaborative environment and

00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:46,660
finally as I alluded to this emphasis on

00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,370
peer teaching and peer learning and I

00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:50,680
think this is really what Foster's the

00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:53,710
community in hack weeks because it

00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:56,620
enables conversations across technical

00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:58,660
abilities across career stages and it

00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:01,570
really catalyzes the group in this

00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:03,220
learning environment and also similarly

00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:05,020
with hackathons techniques take

00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:08,530
advantage of shared language and shared

00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:10,360
scientific objectives some of the goals

00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:12,460
of hack weeks are to foster data

00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:15,220
analysis literacy within research

00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:17,139
domains cultivate best practices for

00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:19,300
example around reproducibility and open

00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:21,280
science and of course develop resources

00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,140
for an existing domain specific

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,729
community and the end result is that

00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,830
these folks that go through these hack

00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:29,380
weeks end up building a network that

00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:31,060
lasts far beyond that week and it very

00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:34,600
often established longer-term

00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:37,060
collaborations so the hack week as a

00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,880
model for teaching and learning really

00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:42,010
came out of the Astronomy field in 2014

00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,139
it was then picked up a couple years

00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:46,389
later by the neuroscience community in

00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:48,669
the form of neuro hack week and then the

00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:51,190
geospatial sciences also created a hack

00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:52,870
week and geo hack week but since then

00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:55,750
these hack weeks have really grown and

00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:57,520
evolved so Astro hack Astro data hack

00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,800
week it used to be called now Astro hack

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,930
week last year when international they

00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,950
were hosted in the Netherlands this year

00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:06,610
they're gonna be at Cambridge University

00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:09,580
in the UK neuro hack week secured

00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:13,350
funding from NIH to become a two-week

00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:16,030
summer school called neuro hackademy and

00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:18,550
just last year the oceanography

00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:21,050
community joined the fold with the first

00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:23,389
ocean hack week they're hosting another

00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:26,810
this year and this year as I mentioned

00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:28,759
earlier the latest domain to join hack

00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:33,259
weeks is water hack week so they focus

00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:35,780
on fresh water resources globally and

00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:37,879
the important thing here is that the

00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:40,280
hack week structure is really flexible

00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:42,349
and can be adapted to the needs of the

00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,539
different communities so here I'm

00:06:42,349 --> 00:06:47,449
highlighting I hope you can see this the

00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:49,729
schedule for day one from geo hack week

00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:51,319
and in this particular domain they were

00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:53,449
really interested in getting right into

00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:55,639
the project work so the very first day

00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:57,919
they spend some time on tutorials in

00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:59,479
github Jupiter notebooks working in the

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,639
cloud environment but they're already

00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:04,159
pitching projects and doing project work

00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:06,289
that afternoon in contrast neural

00:07:04,159 --> 00:07:08,990
hackademy which admittedly is two weeks

00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:10,669
long but for the entire first week it is

00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,469
nothing but tutorials they don't even

00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:14,719
start project work until the middle of

00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:18,129
the second week and unfortunately for

00:07:14,719 --> 00:07:20,389
the the format here they listed

00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:22,490
vertically instead of horizontally so I

00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:23,690
hope you can read some of those but you

00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:25,610
can see that there's definitely

00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:27,620
introductory material on the first day

00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:29,449
again github but also introduction to

00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:31,520
Python and are a lot of these are

00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:33,520
borrowed from the carpentry z' but then

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,800
they quickly jump into more advanced

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,930
topics and as I mentioned water hack

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,060
week started taking a slightly different

00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:45,020
approach approach they recognized that

00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:49,039
their community had really diverse and

00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:50,810
also very specific and technical types

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,490
of tools that they wanted their

00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:54,949
participants to have a grounding in

00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:57,050
before they began so what they offered

00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:58,909
were a series of training seminars as

00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:00,800
pre work and you can see kind of the

00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:03,440
dates at the end of those lines that

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,719
water hack week was held at the end of

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,849
March so this is almost two months of

00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:10,370
opportunities to kind of learn and get a

00:08:07,849 --> 00:08:12,409
grounding in some basic tools before the

00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:15,529
community met and worked through the

00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:16,849
projects during the hack week so now we

00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:18,560
want to spend just a moment on

00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:20,509
participant diversity because this is

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,650
something that's come up a lot in this

00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:24,650
conference and I think it's something

00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:28,849
that we all are share a really passion

00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:31,490
for as these hack weeks grow there are

00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:33,199
often more applicants to the hack week

00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:34,080
than there are spots it's really

00:08:33,199 --> 00:08:36,960
important for hack

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:40,290
to kind of maintain a small community 42

00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:42,810
60s about that the ideal size but some

00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:44,700
of these hack week organizers are

00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:47,610
receiving applications on the order of

00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:51,630
100 to 200 and so to start thinking

00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:53,790
about how do you choose participants

00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:55,680
when you want to maximize diversity in a

00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:58,920
hack week becomes kind of a hard

00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,450
cognitive load so Daniella hoop encoding

00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,550
the one who's also the first author on

00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:04,500
the pn s paper wrote this tool and it's

00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:07,430
available on github really well

00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:09,120
documented called entropy and

00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:11,340
unfortunately when I told her I was

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,290
gonna talk about this today she said oh

00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:15,570
I got to get the paper written this is

00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:16,980
great this is great incentive and I felt

00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:18,750
terrible cuz I was pushing her now that

00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,550
like throw a paper out as fast as

00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,800
possible she even asked me what time my

00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:24,720
talk was today and I checked I don't

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,130
have the archive link yet but she did

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,940
submit it and it should be under

00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:32,460
computers in society section so the idea

00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:34,230
with enter Phi is to take participant

00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:36,120
selection and treat it as a discrete

00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:38,190
optimization problem again really

00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,050
relieving the organizers of that

00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:42,090
cognitive load of trying to juggle all

00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:43,770
the different attributes and factors of

00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:46,560
the people you might want to invite to

00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:48,960
your hack week Daniela also wanted me to

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,900
make sure to say that enter fide doesn't

00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:54,210
make participant selection fair it just

00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:57,240
lowers the cognitive load it's still on

00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:59,520
the user to define the attributes of the

00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,890
community that you want to include for

00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:04,650
example junior versus senior researchers

00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:07,860
experts from various disciplines race

00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:09,870
ethnicity gender and then also set the

00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:12,030
proportion of the targets that you want

00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:14,430
to include so I'm gonna give you just a

00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:17,220
real quick example and I don't I don't

00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:20,190
know how well you can see that this is a

00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:22,410
plot showing the output from entry Phi

00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:24,270
when it was used in a conference called

00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:26,070
Python and astronomy and again there's a

00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:28,050
github link there and it's all very well

00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:29,430
documented including all of the amines

00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:32,430
completely transparent all of the

00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:35,250
participant selection in this case the

00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:37,020
plot is just showing geography so where

00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,910
did the applicants apply from and they

00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:41,280
the organizers decided to group

00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:43,380
geography into three loose bins North

00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:45,190
America Western Europe and all others

00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:47,980
and the blue

00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:49,629
ours are the proportions I realize you

00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,829
can't see the y-axis but it's fraction

00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:55,389
the blue the blue bars are all of the

00:10:52,829 --> 00:10:58,810
applications they received and the green

00:10:55,389 --> 00:11:02,889
bars are the recommended population that

00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:06,180
entropy returned the black line is what

00:11:02,889 --> 00:11:09,220
the along the top there is what the

00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:10,689
organizers set as their target and I

00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:13,420
know Kenya I know you can't see that but

00:11:10,689 --> 00:11:15,220
they arbitrarily set it at 33% so they

00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:16,629
wanted 1/3 from North America third from

00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:19,449
Western Europe and 1/3 from all other

00:11:16,629 --> 00:11:22,930
countries you can see enter fide is a

00:11:19,449 --> 00:11:25,209
pretty decent job very often though it

00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:26,769
won't be it won't hit those targets

00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:28,480
exactly because of course it's also

00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:31,569
trying to optimize on a lot of other

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:34,120
attributes and so the user can also say

00:11:31,569 --> 00:11:37,060
to me it is more important that we have

00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:40,180
equal gender diversity versus some other

00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:41,980
attributes so the user not only selects

00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:43,870
the proportions they want in the final

00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:46,779
population but also the weight of

00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:48,750
importance of those attributes so that

00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:51,040
brings me to choosing the right targets

00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:52,990
third third third from North America

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,000
Western Europe and others may seem kind

00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:56,860
of arbitrary which is why I really like

00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,860
what water hack Lake has chosen to do

00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:02,050
and they say here that accelerating

00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:04,930
scientific research and innovation on

00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:07,420
complex global water challenges requires

00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:09,250
a workforce with the diversity of the

00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:11,290
global population I thought that was

00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:14,800
really cool so they essentially set all

00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:18,519
of their attribute fractions proportions

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,949
based on the global population so I

00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:23,439
encourage you to check out

00:12:19,949 --> 00:12:26,230
Daniella's github repo and try that tool

00:12:23,439 --> 00:12:29,470
it yourself ok so now I want to move on

00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:32,680
to how successful are these hack weeks

00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:35,259
at their goals and so those original

00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,600
three hack weeks Astro hack week neuro

00:12:35,259 --> 00:12:39,790
hacking geo hack week ran a series of

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,699
identical exit surveys I'm going to show

00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:45,670
you some of the results this first set

00:12:42,699 --> 00:12:48,220
of results focuses on how how much do

00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:49,930
these hack weeks in the participants

00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:53,390
viewpoint how much did the hack weeks

00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:55,430
help them in their science so

00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:57,110
here are good are gonna I'm gonna ground

00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:59,390
you to these plots first so the

00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:01,370
questions were phrased as I'm gonna be

00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:03,770
there's a statement along the top and

00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:05,870
then the participant would either agree

00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:07,670
or disagree and I can see you squinting

00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:10,760
so I'm going to explain on the far left

00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:12,710
or folks that can strongly agree with

00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:15,200
the statement far right is strongly

00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:17,020
disagree and then there is one box at

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,240
the very far right that's I don't know

00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:21,380
the y-axis is the fraction of responses

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,480
and I'll go ahead and read them across

00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:26,600
but I wanted to ground you in these

00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:29,540
plots first because I'm actually going

00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,950
to show you the data as each separate

00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:32,570
hack week but I think what I'd rather

00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:35,390
for this talk is that you just kind of

00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:37,460
get a sense of the general trend so for

00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:39,470
example in the first box I hacked on

00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:40,220
topics tools or methods that were very

00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:43,220
new to me

00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:44,750
in general most of the participants kind

00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:48,110
of agreed with this there are a few that

00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:50,570
disagreed and the center plot I believe

00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:53,510
the hack week helped me be a better

00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:55,970
scientist there's strong positive signal

00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:57,710
there and then I feel like I learned

00:13:55,970 --> 00:14:00,260
things which improve my day-to-day

00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:01,820
research so again strong positive signal

00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:04,910
they're suggesting these hack weeks are

00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:07,730
helping the researchers in their actual

00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:09,200
science doing their work but in addition

00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:11,780
one of the goals of the hack weeks was

00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:15,170
best practices and in particular we're

00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:17,720
curious about working open so in this

00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:19,940
case the plot on the Left says I am

00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,520
embarrassed to put my code and data in

00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:25,250
online and there's a fairly even

00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:27,860
distribution here so as you can see

00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:30,650
there's still a sentiment that people

00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:32,510
are genuinely embarrassed to as many of

00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:35,480
us may be to put our code and data

00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:37,460
online similarly in the middle plot I am

00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:40,580
afraid that if I put my code and data

00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:43,940
public I will be scooped again there's

00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:45,200
some a lot of the responses disagreed

00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:47,420
with the statement but there are still

00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:50,060
some that agreed with it but now what's

00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,990
interesting is if you contrast that to

00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:54,110
this question

00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:57,110
I feel scientists have an obligation to

00:14:54,110 --> 00:15:00,110
make their code and data public there's

00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:02,390
strong agreement with this sentiment so

00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:03,769
the researchers in these hack weeks

00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:05,449
genuinely

00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:07,220
like it is their obligation to make

00:15:05,449 --> 00:15:09,769
their code and data public but they're

00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:11,449
still hesitant about perhaps how to do

00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:13,160
it or they're embarrassed and so I think

00:15:11,449 --> 00:15:15,709
there's an opportunity here to kind of

00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:20,110
help Shepherd this community into those

00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:22,670
reproducible and open science tools and

00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:25,279
during the hack week they definitely got

00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:28,429
some of that best practices and help so

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:31,040
in this far in the left panel here I put

00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:33,829
code and/or data I created at hack wake

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,839
up on github or another public repo so

00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:38,540
definitely many of them did this

00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,850
I feel like X hack week made me more

00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:43,959
comfortable with doing open source open

00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:46,939
science strong agreement there too so

00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:49,220
not only are hack wakes helping

00:15:46,939 --> 00:15:51,619
researchers with their actual research

00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:53,929
doing better science but we are also

00:15:51,619 --> 00:15:56,209
slowly incentivizing them and convincing

00:15:53,929 --> 00:15:59,149
them to work openly and to adopt some

00:15:56,209 --> 00:16:01,339
reproducible best practices so as I

00:15:59,149 --> 00:16:04,220
mentioned earlier all of these data and

00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:08,779
more are available on this paper from in

00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:12,110
PNAS and I before I wrap up I want to

00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:14,749
also talk about an afflicted us which is

00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:16,549
community learning across domains so

00:16:14,749 --> 00:16:18,290
hack wakes as you as I mentioned is

00:16:16,549 --> 00:16:21,139
really about bringing community together

00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:22,549
and learning within a domain with shared

00:16:21,139 --> 00:16:26,420
language and shared scientific

00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:29,959
objectives XD communities XD for a cross

00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:32,059
domain are opportunities for researchers

00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:34,929
from all different domains to come

00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:38,029
together and work on similar problems

00:16:34,929 --> 00:16:40,610
together identifying common principles

00:16:38,029 --> 00:16:43,519
algorithms and tools so it's a much more

00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:46,009
methods focused community building XD

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,740
communities largely exist at Berkeley

00:16:46,009 --> 00:16:51,110
but they have been hosted elsewhere XD

00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:53,089
communities and the groups host seminars

00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:54,799
they write blogs but importantly they

00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:56,809
also run these workshops and those are

00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:59,240
based heavily on the pedagogy from the

00:16:56,809 --> 00:17:01,129
hack weeks their shorter two to three

00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,769
days but they also include just like

00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:06,799
hack weeks tutorials make sessions and

00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:09,589
in this case also talks by experts so in

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:11,940
the inaugural hack we write ideas I used

00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:14,280
to sing hack week and the inaugural in

00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:17,940
xD this is the image-processing across

00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:20,070
domains which was in 2016 50 researchers

00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:21,870
from 11 different different institutions

00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:24,360
came together to work specifically on

00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:25,950
image processing problems and I just

00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:28,020
listed a number of the different fields

00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:30,150
that they came from and you can see

00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:32,700
there's everything from computer vision

00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:35,790
to earth science neuroscience astronomy

00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:38,360
so they're coming together around the

00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:41,280
tool rather than around the domain and

00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:43,830
this concept is also expanding so

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,680
there's now text XD for text analysis

00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:48,990
and graphics d and both of these were

00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:50,820
held more recently some of the example

00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:52,680
outcomes from these workshops include

00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:55,260
blueprints for open source image

00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:57,720
processing in the case of the image XD

00:17:55,260 --> 00:18:01,260
training sets for ml applications and of

00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:03,840
course analysis projects so the takeaway

00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:06,540
here is that informal intensive

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:09,990
community driven learning it's a lot of

00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:12,540
words informal intensive community

00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:14,850
driven learning like hack weeks and XD

00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:17,070
workshops quickly and effectively bring

00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:19,800
data science to campus researchers and

00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:23,640
importantly emphasize that data science

00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:25,710
is for and by everyone it is not owned

00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,620
by computer science or computer science

00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:30,510
plus statistics anyone from any field

00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:35,100
can contribute to the advancement of

00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:38,100
data science so my last slide is a plug

00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:40,320
as the coordinator for the more Sun data

00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,910
science environments that partnership is

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,410
starting to wind down and so I'm

00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:46,710
starting to think what is the next thing

00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:48,510
and I'm really focused and continue to

00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:50,760
be heavily invested in academic data

00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:54,000
science and I think community building

00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:57,270
for academic data science still serves a

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,250
great need and shamelessly

00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:01,350
I actually just want an excuse to

00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:03,720
continue seeing all these wonderful

00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:05,580
smiling faces behind me which are the

00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:10,510
folks who attended the last MSDS C

00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:13,419
annual summit so so my next and

00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:15,309
which is currently tentatively called

00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:19,000
the academic data science alliance or

00:19:15,309 --> 00:19:22,090
Adso i'm hiring a community coordinator

00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,919
and a program assistant you can ask me

00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:27,549
about that by going to add sub fly at

00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:29,799
MSDS e org I also left job descriptions

00:19:27,549 --> 00:19:32,350
on the table outside it's not posted

00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:34,600
online yet but it will be soon so

00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:36,450
shameless plug I am hiring come talk to

00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:40,799
me if you want to work in the space and

00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:40,799
