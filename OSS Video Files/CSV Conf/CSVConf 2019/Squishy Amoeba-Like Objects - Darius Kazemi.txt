On June 19th, 1970, a group of computer scientists who were inventing the internet referred to key pieces of its proposed design as "squishy amoeba-like objects". Amoebas are porous yet have well-defined boundaries. Thinking about these creatures gives us new ways to think about networks and communities and technology. This talk makes a case for the squishy amoeba-like object as an organizing principle for what is broadly being called "the decentralized web", a web outside of monolithic, monopolistic actors.

hi everybody can you hear me yeah all

00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,979
right fantastic my name is Darius I'm a

00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,140
mozilla fellow and I'm working with code

00:00:07,979 --> 00:00:13,230
for science and society on issues of the

00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:15,210
decentralized web and I'm here to talk

00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,670
to you about a vision that I have for

00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:20,190
the future of social network sites and

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,680
Internet services as they might exist

00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:26,670
outside of the context of corporate

00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:30,180
monopolies so first off just to define

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:32,129
some terms the decentralized web I'm

00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,629
going to talk about it a lot here and

00:00:32,129 --> 00:00:40,229
this is kind of a classic diagram that I

00:00:33,629 --> 00:00:43,260
have added red circles to and just very

00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:45,239
briefly a centralized network is where

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,239
there's one source of truth at the

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:51,179
middle everybody connects to it and it

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,399
handles all of the messaging and making

00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:55,440
sure that people you know if I'm on the

00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,969
bottom of that blob and I want to talk

00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,799
to someone on the top of that blob I

00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:02,129
have to go straight through that big red

00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:04,019
circle and everybody has to do that and

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:06,000
I made that circle big in red because

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,150
that circle is more powerful than the

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,280
other circles if if that circle is like

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,450
a Facebook server Facebook can say no

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,400
you're not able to talk to this person

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,910
because I have decided that you are not

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:21,450
able to talk to that person a

00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:24,360
decentralized Network has many different

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,670
nodes of roughly equal power and then a

00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:30,600
whole bunch more nodes that are just

00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:33,210
regular users so this is what networks

00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:36,540
like mastodons are like or if you look

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:39,030
at the Internet in general you know one

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,520
of those red things might be github comm

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,420
and one of those red things might be

00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,820
amazon.com and that sort of thing so in

00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,590
the context of the whole internet these

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:50,070
things are decentralized but in the

00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:52,230
context of like Facebook Facebook as a

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:55,290
network is centralized you have to go

00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:57,270
through that central control point and

00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,640
then a truly distributed system is one

00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:02,220
where every node is kind of its own

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:05,490
server and client and they can all talk

00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:07,260
to each other as equals but I'm actually

00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,539
talking about the middle case here not

00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:12,900
distributed networks and not centralized

00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:13,730
networks I'm interested in decentralized

00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,849
and that

00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:20,760
specifically the Internet's been

00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:22,110
decentralized since the very start it

00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,420
was initially proposed during the Cold

00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,769
War by defense think tanks as a

00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,750
resilient network that could pass

00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:29,370
information around the country even in

00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,319
the case of a nuclear conflict so it's

00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,299
grim but the idea is that if one city is

00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:35,069
wiped off the map communication traffic

00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:37,890
could reroute around the big smoking

00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:41,269
hole in the ground it was like a cold

00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,269
war fever dream type thing

00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:45,750
decentralization might be also be

00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:47,190
explained by what it is not Facebook is

00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,739
sometimes referred to as a walled garden

00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:51,720
it's a place that has cool stuff that

00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:52,920
people might want but in order to get in

00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,989
there you have to go through this

00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,750
through a checkpoint usually a gate

00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:59,370
there's probably a lock on it there's

00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:01,230
usually some form of surveillance like

00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,900
ground keep groundskeepers and that sort

00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:06,450
of thing and you know once you're inside

00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,700
there it seems like a public space but

00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,260
it's actually a private space there's at

00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,660
this difference between the inside and

00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:15,420
out and that's an example of

00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:19,620
centralization you could as a rule of

00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:21,060
thumb if one company can decide to you

00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:24,540
know shut everything down

00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,340
that's centralized the problem

00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:29,370
especially in the context of social

00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:31,109
network sites is that the world itself

00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:33,900
and our social structures are not

00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:36,060
especially centralized different

00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,579
communities have all sorts of different

00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,590
kinds of norms for example we can take

00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:44,700
the example of on Facebook there was a

00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:46,620
time when they decided to install a real

00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,970
name policy they wanted everybody the

00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,880
real name they wanted people to use

00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:53,609
their government ID names on their

00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,349
profiles and there was a subset of

00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:57,120
people who thought this was a like in

00:03:55,349 --> 00:03:58,769
the Facebook community you like users

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,480
who thought this was a great idea for

00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:03,510
safety and there are a bunch of people

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,519
who saw this as extremely harmful to

00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:09,450
them for a number of different reasons

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:12,630
and I think part of the problem here is

00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:15,450
that we have a big centralized social

00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:18,269
network and you can't have I don't think

00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:21,959
you can have norms that were

00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:25,379
for a billion people I think communities

00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:27,030
need to be partitioned out and they can

00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:28,710
kind of come up with their own norms and

00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:31,259
there's nothing to say that a Facebook

00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:33,599
couldn't do that they like maybe they

00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:36,270
could give every you know Facebook group

00:04:33,599 --> 00:04:36,599
you know admin more power or that sort

00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:39,270
of thing

00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:43,650
but it seems highly unlikely for a

00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:50,009
number of basically organizational

00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:54,270
reasons so my vision for a decentralized

00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:55,860
web is where it's almost kind of like

00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:58,560
everybody gets their own little walled

00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:01,050
gardens kind of but not really and I was

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,840
having trouble articulating this until I

00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:06,139
read a fifty year old computer science

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:10,590
document from the birth of the internet

00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:12,780
in the late 1960s ARPA the the research

00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:15,210
branch of the u.s. military now known as

00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:17,849
DARPA funded a project called the

00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:20,039
ARPANET it was meant to be a realization

00:05:17,849 --> 00:05:21,629
of those cold war dreams and it was a

00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:23,699
joint project between university

00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:26,250
researchers and defense contractors and

00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:29,610
also some more general contractors in

00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:32,400
the sort of civilian technology space on

00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:34,199
June 19th 1970 a group of computer

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,759
scientists at UCLA and Harvard

00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:39,029
University published a document called

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,949
request for comments 55 a prototypical

00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:43,169
implementation of the networked control

00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:44,430
program the document describes a program

00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:45,930
that can live on the computer that lets

00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:47,130
it talk to the ARPANET on a modern

00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:49,199
computer you might have called it

00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:50,520
Network drivers or something like that

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,199
if the code that lets your machine

00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,060
interpret signals going in and out of it

00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:55,620
from the from the internet or the

00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,810
ARPANET in this case there was no

00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:00,599
internet there also was no ARPANET at

00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:02,550
this time either basically it's pretty

00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:06,599
dry until you get to this diagram which

00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:09,779
I love the authors of this paper

00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:11,789
actually refer to these blobs literally

00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:15,060
I quote squish squishy amoeba like

00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:16,800
objects and I thought it was really fun

00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,770
because if you read the whole paper you

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,569
realize that there's not actually a hard

00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:24,000
distinction between what the input

00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:26,250
interpreter is and the input handler

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,770
and the output the scheduler and whoever

00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:30,930
drew up this diagram wanted to make sure

00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:32,580
that while like things like these cues

00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:36,270
in the middle that look like cylinders

00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:39,570
are discrete components these other

00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:42,000
things are much more nebulous if you've

00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:43,680
ever been to like an Amazon presentation

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,780
or something they'll always have the

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,430
cloud and it's like a cloud and that's

00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,200
that's also kind of trying to get the

00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:51,390
same point across but I like squishy and

00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:55,050
me but like objects way better because

00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:59,850
there's still objects so this got me

00:06:55,050 --> 00:07:03,150
thinking about amoebas as a metaphor the

00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:05,400
amoeba or perhaps amoeboid is a useful

00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:08,940
construct for me because it's amorphous

00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:11,280
and yet it has clearly defined inside

00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:12,870
and outside you know what is inside the

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,580
amoeba and what's outside that's

00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:19,950
basically its defining characteristic as

00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:21,780
as a creature or an object they let

00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:24,330
things in and out of this kind of

00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:27,780
filtering system in the in this membrane

00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:31,320
and an amoeba can change shape as needed

00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:33,240
as is needed to be convenient things can

00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:36,240
be allowed into the amoeba and also

00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38,910
kicked out and I think about this now

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,000
when I think about decentralized and

00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:44,070
what I would call what people call

00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,729
federated networks which I will explain

00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:49,470
in a couple of slides so I want to just

00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:52,350
start with what something that I'm

00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:53,640
familiar with here which is this social

00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:56,160
network called Mastodon that you might

00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:58,830
be familiar with it is kind of a Twitter

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,630
clone it's open source you can run your

00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:02,340
own server I run my own server it's

00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:04,169
called friend camp it's for me and like

00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,700
50 people that I know there's a few

00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:09,630
friend campers sitting in this audience

00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:12,090
right now it's it looks like this from

00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:13,650
the user level I just I just for

00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:16,890
people's privacy I replaced all the text

00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:18,900
with dashes but but I want to talk about

00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:20,520
what this service looks like on a

00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,169
network level so from a user it's like a

00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,479
website you log in to it or you have an

00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:28,050
app and you you know you post stuff it's

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:30,930
like Twitter so this is a server a

00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:32,789
server is a piece of metal with that's

00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:34,840
very complicated and it has electricity

00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:39,520
going through it

00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:41,860
aka a computer these are people and

00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:45,310
these people have their own computers or

00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:47,740
tablets or phones or whatever and these

00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:49,960
tablets and phones talk to the server

00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:51,160
let's say this server is friend camp and

00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,140
so there's people in the audience right

00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:56,110
now maybe they're posting to friend camp

00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:58,090
from their phone or whatever the and

00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:00,660
this is not this is centralize this in

00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:03,400
and of itself is a centralized system

00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:05,440
the difference is that for something

00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:08,200
like friend camp it's me and 50 of my

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,930
friends which is way different than Mark

00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,370
Zuckerberg and a billion like people who

00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:16,540
he's never met right it's like a

00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:19,570
different social contract so okay we

00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:22,540
have this little node here and it's

00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:24,490
called federated because these signals

00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:28,030
get sent out to other servers as well

00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:31,210
with their own people inside of them and

00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:33,550
there might be more than that and they

00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:35,470
all talk to each other and not everyone

00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:37,200
talks to everyone but if you look at the

00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:39,400
top you'll see that those three nodes

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,950
you know two of them don't talk to each

00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,840
other right it might be because they

00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:45,520
don't know each other exist or it might

00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:49,210
be because one node hates the other node

00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:50,590
and you know like one of them was was a

00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:54,760
bad actor and so they decided to block

00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:56,620
them or whatever so this this is like an

00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:59,710
example network here

00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:01,000
what makes friend camp different and has

00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:04,690
started making me think about these

00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
different models is right now on basic

00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:08,800
Macedon if I'm on one of these nodes as

00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,540
long as I have a link there all my

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,670
messages are viewable by basically

00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:15,310
everybody else it's all kind of public

00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:17,170
to the locally known network on friend

00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:19,900
camp we have this concept of local only

00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:22,840
posts these are posts that never leave

00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:25,740
this piece of metal here so they're

00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:29,380
inherently more secure if you trust me

00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:33,850
which because you're fifty of my friends

00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:36,340
who are using this you do trust me at

00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:39,070
least you know I hope so you know it's

00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:40,420
it's a different that the trust that a

00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:42,430
friend of mine has in me is very

00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:45,010
different than the trust that I have

00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:46,480
even in a company that I think is really

00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:50,470
great you know it's like a different

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:52,660
level of trust so back to here so this

00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:54,000
is where the ameba part comes in so this

00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:56,980
is something that already exists

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,890
technically and what I would like to do

00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:02,380
is start introducing concepts you'll

00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:04,420
notice that in the middle there's kind

00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:06,430
of a kite shape going from the upper

00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:10,360
left to the upper right to the lower

00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:12,670
left and and and this is a bunch of

00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,870
nodes that all mutually follow each

00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:17,440
other are aware of each other's

00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:19,210
existence and maybe we decide that we

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,430
are friends with a bunch of people on

00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:24,580
this other server so in addition to like

00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:26,650
I can friend someone on the other side

00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:29,470
of the network individually as long as

00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:31,660
my server can route it maybe we have

00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:35,470
servers that become friends with other

00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:38,740
servers and so that may introduce a new

00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:41,200
concept you know that's not a fully

00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:43,300
public post but maybe a posts to your

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,370
neighborhood of trusted servers it's not

00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:47,980
all your known servers because there are

00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:50,170
servers inside that blog that know about

00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:52,720
servers outside of the blob we just

00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:54,910
don't fully trust them yet but we could

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,740
you know maybe in the future we decide

00:11:54,910 --> 00:12:00,460
that we really like them and bring them

00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:05,130
in too now the thing about this sort of

00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:07,780
amoeba like grabbing things process is

00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:11,590
there has to be social contracts

00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:13,960
involved here so the reason that you

00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:17,350
might bring someone into your amoeba

00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:20,320
blob neighborhood thing is because you

00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:24,040
have sat down and talked with them with

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,900
like community to community and you both

00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,880
realize that you share the same values

00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,170
you don't want the same kinds of you

00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,850
know you dislike the same kinds of

00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:32,950
speech on your network and there's not

00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:36,520
it's you're going to be a good fit for

00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:40,030
each other essentially and so I want to

00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:44,500
see ways to bring out these kind of

00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:47,770
medium spaces there because like local

00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:50,140
only is is cool it's really useful it's

00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:51,820
really helpful it's great to have 50

00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:54,760
people able to like talk to each other

00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:56,110
in like a more intimate space but

00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,600
there's got to be something between that

00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,550
and

00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,829
talking to the entire world and having

00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:04,009
your messages sent out to like 5,000

00:13:00,829 --> 00:13:07,730
servers you know 4990 you have never

00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:11,240
heard of in your life so what I'm hoping

00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:13,970
for is something like this in the future

00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:17,630
this is not a mastodon only or even a

00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:21,050
Federer's only type concept but what I

00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:25,130
do think is that we need to limit the

00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:27,829
sizes of these individual nodes because

00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:29,959
otherwise it's not going to be you know

00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:31,190
at that point if we have like five nodes

00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:33,769
in the whole network and they each have

00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:35,000
a billion people on them each then it's

00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:36,980
that's just what we have right now

00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,500
basically it's just like you know okay a

00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:42,470
billion people on friend face cake base

00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:45,589
camp friend cam Facebook a billion

00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:48,620
people on Facebook you know a billion

00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:51,500
people on another network and you know

00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:53,810
that's that's kind of just resent

00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,220
realizing so I'm working on some

00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:56,889
documents I'm hoping in a couple of

00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:59,660
months I'll sort of publish something

00:13:56,889 --> 00:14:01,009
like a best practices guide for

00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,839
maintaining one of these nodes and how

00:14:01,009 --> 00:14:03,980
we might Feder eight nodes with each

00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:07,399
other to get this notion of a

00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:09,170
neighborhood anyway that's you know

00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:12,380
that's about 15 minutes of stuff that

00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:13,880
I've wanted to talk about and so but I

00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:16,339
really wanted to do was like open up to

00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:20,019
questions for people so thanks for

00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:20,019
listening to this kinda intro

00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:24,710
