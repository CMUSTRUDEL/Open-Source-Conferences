On June 19th, 1970, a group of computer scientists who were inventing the internet referred to key pieces of its proposed design as "squishy amoeba-like objects". Amoebas are porous yet have well-defined boundaries. Thinking about these creatures gives us new ways to think about networks and communities and technology. This talk makes a case for the squishy amoeba-like object as an organizing principle for what is broadly being called "the decentralized web", a web outside of monolithic, monopolistic actors.
