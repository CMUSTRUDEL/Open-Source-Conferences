Title: Frictionless Data Processing in the Wild - Amber D. York
Publication date: 2019-06-20
Playlist: CSVConf 2019
Description: 
	Frictionless Data (FD) initiatives out of Open Knowledge International provide attractive informatics and processing capabilities. The BCO-DMO data repository used FD tools on real-world datasets, and we have some lessons learned to share. By building upon existing FD tools, we found ways to reduce the amount of time data managers spend generating metadata, and writing custom scripts. We are also developing ways for data managers with varying levels of scripting ability to make use of Frictionless Data tools.
