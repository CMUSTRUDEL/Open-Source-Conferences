so good afternoon everyone I bring you

00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:09,150
greetings from sunny Florida again my

00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,340
name is Kerri Jordan and I'm the senior

00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:14,490
director of equity and assessment for

00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:17,280
the carpentry and I'm so happy to be

00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,170
here to address you this afternoon the

00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:22,250
title of my keynote is building

00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:25,369
confidence achieving equity a call to

00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:28,380
action for open source communities I

00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:30,750
want to start by saying thank you to the

00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,870
CSP conference organizing and in

00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:36,179
particular to John shitake and daya

00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:39,239
Robinson for making sure that I got here

00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:41,639
long time and safely and I also want to

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:42,059
recognize my carpentry colleagues in the

00:00:41,639 --> 00:00:45,449
world

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:46,799
cereno and Traci teal I'm truly blessed

00:00:45,449 --> 00:00:48,989
to be able to work with these women

00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:50,699
every day and just seeing them in the

00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:53,190
audience makes this a little less

00:00:50,699 --> 00:00:58,229
terrifying so thank you so much for

00:00:53,190 --> 00:01:00,839
being here so our journey today begins

00:00:58,229 --> 00:01:02,819
with thoughts on data analytics coming

00:01:00,839 --> 00:01:06,030
from someone who frequently feels like

00:01:02,819 --> 00:01:07,950
an imposter in this space and I'll talk

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,830
a little bit about impostor syndrome as

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:13,080
well I'll then share some thoughts on

00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,240
averting the data skills crisis and

00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,330
explain a little bit about the carpentry

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,730
is who we are and what we do then I'll

00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,770
share some personal stories about the

00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:24,960
role that data has played in my own life

00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:28,110
and what I've learned about building

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,360
confidence to work with data we'll talk

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,820
about mentoring and meaningful equity

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:36,600
and finally we will end with a call to

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:40,010
action at some point I may burst into

00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:42,980
song so just be prepared for that

00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:47,170
and hopefully we'll have a lot of fun

00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:49,670
throughout the talk so here we're done I

00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:51,830
remember the first time a colleague

00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:53,750
introduced me to someone who was looking

00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:57,020
to learn about assessment and data

00:01:53,750 --> 00:02:00,380
science and in their introduction they

00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:02,930
use the word experts I was totally

00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:04,670
thrown off because I had only been

00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:07,400
working in this space for about six

00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:11,090
months and I could barely afford us the

00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:13,490
idiots are barely my research practices

00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:16,640
were horrible in my opinion I had no

00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:19,340
idea where the work flow was I had never

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,930
heard of the term reproducibility and I

00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:24,710
had been storing my data in multiple

00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:27,530
formats all over the place if you don't

00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:29,870
believe me I'll prove it to you so

00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:32,210
here's the screenshot of an email that I

00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:34,640
received from a graduate student who

00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:36,130
wanted to replicate the study that I did

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,540
for my dissertation

00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:40,400
my background is mechanical engineering

00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:43,280
a fair mention and my PhD is in

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,620
engineering education so my dissertation

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,580
research was an intervention to increase

00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:52,400
engineering self-efficacy for first-year

00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:55,400
students of color in engineering so this

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,200
email the graduate student wanted to

00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,970
understand how many students were in my

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,130
treatment group and how many students

00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:03,140
were in my control group and we have

00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:06,050
been emailing each other back and forth

00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:08,810
back and forth to recover my notes my

00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:12,440
spreadsheet it was very embarrassing

00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:15,140
they were nowhere to be found this was

00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:18,350
more than two years after I defended and

00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:21,110
had since completed a postdoc and I was

00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:22,760
working for a data carpentry a project

00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:26,190
that stresses the importance of

00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:30,130
reproducibility in research

00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:32,890
all right so needless to say working in

00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:35,620
business baby and being introduced as an

00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:37,570
expert's while at the same time being

00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:40,090
ashamed that I couldn't help another

00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:44,590
student replicate my own work made me

00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:47,440
feel like a total imposter so my own

00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:50,710
words imposter syndrome is the belief

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:54,370
that your success is illegitimate and at

00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:56,800
some point you'll be found out I was

00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:59,050
working for a project that develops and

00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:02,260
teaches lessons on the fundamental data

00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:04,840
skills needed to conduct research but my

00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:07,930
own research practices were horrible in

00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:13,120
my opinion and any moment now they were

00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:16,709
going to find me out the day I realized

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:19,359
that I wasn't an impostor in this space

00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:20,220
was the day that I received this note

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,400
from a colleague

00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:27,490
it reads thank you for letting me help

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:31,120
with the assessment process and driving

00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:33,790
our community forward with data you see

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:37,480
what makes an expert isn't that the

00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:39,790
individual knows everything having

00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:42,610
comprehensive or authoritative knowledge

00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:44,380
is nothing if you aren't contributing or

00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:46,570
creating an environment where others

00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:50,590
feel comfortable contributing to the

00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:53,169
work so for this individual I had done

00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:55,990
just that I presented an environment

00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:58,810
where she could contribute as well I no

00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:00,850
longer feel like an impostor plus I

00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:04,830
learned how to keep my raw data raw and

00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:04,830
all my stuff is on github so

00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:11,450
I'm proud to be in front of a roomful of

00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:13,910
enthusiasts who are passionate about

00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:16,930
theta and its application to society

00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:19,280
because even as we sit in this room

00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:23,270
decisions are being made on our behalf

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:25,970
with all sorts of data data analytics

00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:28,550
helps identify new opportunities that in

00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:33,460
turn solve problems and help us develop

00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:36,860
products services to support the public

00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:40,760
what I've learned is that data analytics

00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:44,390
is not about one person's expertise it's

00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:46,430
about collaboration and community from

00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:48,410
life sciences of banking to

00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:51,050
manufacturing and healthcare and

00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:54,620
government data analytics is solving

00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:57,160
problems and saving lives but it's also

00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:00,440
causing distress and it's causing harm

00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:02,570
because not all of the experts or those

00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:05,750
with the comprehensive knowledge and

00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:09,830
skills in this space have a diversity of

00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:11,600
thoughts and experiences let's take the

00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:13,910
United States Transportation Security

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:17,270
Administration just for an example

00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:19,700
so I fly a lot as I'm sure a lot of us

00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:21,590
do in this room and I can't tell you how

00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:26,390
many times I've been pulled aside to

00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:28,850
have my hair patted on thick LOX braids

00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:31,640
wigs and even turbans are often trigger

00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:35,000
alarms for airport security full-body

00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:37,640
scanners now don't get me wrong I

00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,220
appreciate the work that our TSA does to

00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:42,650
keep us safe but being pulled out of

00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:44,900
line in the airport and having someone

00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:46,570
run their fingers through your hair is

00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:50,870
extremely frustrating

00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:53,900
it makes me think it makes me wonder are

00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:56,500
there experts in the room designing the

00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:59,270
technology that looks anything like me

00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:04,340
who would ever consider me an expert

00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:06,440
when so many see me as a threat so I

00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:08,000
want to draw your attention to this text

00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,860
message thread from me and my father

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,960
we're going to take a moment to do some

00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:16,140
jargon but

00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:17,820
so he said shout out to the acronym

00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:21,030
though what are you doing

00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:23,550
okay I'm learning high-fives

00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:27,530
you need me to help let me know I said

00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:35,000
daddy you know hi yep it's a big snail

00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:38,280
no no it's a computer program so

00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,170
throughout this talk I'll refer to

00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:43,230
several concepts and I want to take the

00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:45,810
opportunity to define them here the

00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:47,630
definitions for these terms were adapted

00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:49,680
from California State East Bay's

00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:53,700
diversity leadership and employee

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:56,970
wellness website when I talk about

00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:59,310
accessibility I'm referring to program

00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:02,550
and process design and implementation

00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:05,720
that offers multiple avenues for access

00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:07,980
and participation in other words

00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:11,490
accessibility is the usability of a

00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:15,410
product service environment or facility

00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:18,530
by the widest range of capabilities for

00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:21,030
example you may be familiar with

00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:23,160
accessibility accommodations like closed

00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:26,510
captioning or displaying the audio

00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:30,000
portion of a program as text on a screen

00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:31,980
others include identifying unusual words

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,430
or jargon bus things like we're doing

00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:38,460
right now certain conditions make it

00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:42,090
difficult to understand non literal word

00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:44,130
usage or figurative language I'll tell

00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,730
you a story about how I learned this the

00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:49,140
hard way

00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:51,180
a group of carpentry instructors were

00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:53,790
putting together a series of community

00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:55,890
calls with various themes ranging from

00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:57,540
teaching your first workshop to

00:08:55,890 --> 00:09:00,330
navigating unpredictable learning

00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:04,230
environments well I had the bright idea

00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:06,480
of a call about running workshops with

00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:09,319
little to no money and I propose that we

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:12,779
call it ballin on a budget

00:09:09,319 --> 00:09:14,850
now this title would have brought over

00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:18,420
fantastically in the black community

00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:21,149
because all and means to have wealth or

00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:25,519
affluence however in other areas across

00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:29,459
the globe ballin is extremely offensive

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:31,889
so in our work what can we do to make

00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:34,709
our code our content knowledge our

00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:37,949
documentation accessible and the

00:09:34,709 --> 00:09:42,120
language understandable to all that's

00:09:37,949 --> 00:09:45,589
what accessibility is about so now let's

00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:48,329
take a look at diversity diversity

00:09:45,589 --> 00:09:50,879
refers to individual differences and

00:09:48,329 --> 00:09:53,990
group social differences that can be

00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:55,889
engaged in the service of learning our

00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:58,319
individual differences can be

00:09:55,889 --> 00:10:01,980
personality language language

00:09:58,319 --> 00:10:04,490
preferences and life experiences our

00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:08,040
group social differences can be raped

00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:11,129
ethnicity class gender gender identity

00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:14,329
sexual orientation country of origin

00:10:11,129 --> 00:10:17,809
ability status cultural political

00:10:14,329 --> 00:10:20,970
religious and any other affiliations

00:10:17,809 --> 00:10:24,420
rather than labeling one another and

00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:27,269
seeing our differences as a threat we

00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:29,519
can use our differences to engage in the

00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:34,170
service of learning and we can see each

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:36,959
other as human when I talk about equity

00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:40,170
it's really creating opportunities for

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:42,779
equal access and participation in

00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:47,009
programs that are capable of closing

00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:50,519
participation gaps in our community this

00:10:47,009 --> 00:10:56,459
is me teaching my engineer like a girl

00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:58,980
after school program so for example and

00:10:56,459 --> 00:11:00,209
use Maguire adapted this image to

00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:04,559
illustrate the difference between

00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:07,709
equality and equity equality is about

00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:12,389
saying this it promotes justice by

00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:14,550
giving everyone the same thing but it it

00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:17,540
can only work if everyone starts from

00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:19,440
the same place right so in this example

00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:23,790
equality only work

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:27,209
if everyone is the same height equity by

00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:29,339
contrast is about fairness it's about

00:11:27,209 --> 00:11:33,029
making sure people have the access to

00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:35,670
the same opportunities sometimes our

00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:38,220
differences or our history can create

00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:41,730
barriers to participation so we must

00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:44,180
first achieve equity before we can enjoy

00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:47,629
equality

00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:50,910
lastly inclusion is the active

00:11:47,629 --> 00:11:53,939
intentional and ongoing engagement of

00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:56,310
diverse people and communities this

00:11:53,939 --> 00:11:58,949
increases awareness content knowledge

00:11:56,310 --> 00:12:01,379
and empathetic understanding of the ways

00:11:58,949 --> 00:12:04,980
in which we interact with it and change

00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:07,050
our community I want to draw your

00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:10,589
attention to one of my favorite quotes

00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:12,500
by Verna Myers diversity is being

00:12:10,589 --> 00:12:16,220
invited to the party

00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:20,100
inclusion is being asked to dance

00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:24,480
alright come on people how would you

00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:26,699
feel you put your best foot forward you

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,519
work so hard so that there's no way you

00:12:26,699 --> 00:12:31,560
don't get invited to the party and then

00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,000
when you get there you're standing in

00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:36,269
the corner the whole night because

00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,509
nobody asks you to dance you know the

00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:38,509
song

00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:43,909
[Music]

00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:54,259
[Applause]

00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:05,899
inclusion is more than inviting people

00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:07,899
to the conversation or the workshop or

00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:10,339
the conference who don't look like you

00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:13,370
it's ensuring that they're able to

00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:16,850
interact and contribute in ways that are

00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:18,820
meaningful to them so now that we're all

00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:21,410
hopefully familiar with the terminology

00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:23,990
let's talk about approaches to building

00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:28,459
confidence to work with data with these

00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:32,019
concepts in mind I'm going to take a

00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:32,019
drink water fill our words

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:42,589
train for data skills is more critical

00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:44,570
now than ever in the past decade we've

00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:46,850
seen the creation of certification

00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:48,980
programs and graduate programs for data

00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:52,510
science as well as interactive

00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:55,490
self-paced online learning opportunities

00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:58,070
today's learners are often learning on

00:13:55,490 --> 00:14:01,510
the job and need the flexibility of

00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:04,070
shorts self-paced learning experiences

00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:06,620
though much of training and learning is

00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:08,810
happening online the importance of

00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:12,220
guided instruction and learner

00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:15,320
instructor interaction is still apparent

00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:17,440
data heavy research fields require the

00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:21,050
use of sophisticated tools and

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,839
computational resources unfortunately

00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:25,610
many researchers or individuals who have

00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,040
data but don't know what to do with it

00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:30,500
are prone to using tools that introduce

00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:34,699
errors such as automatic date formatting

00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:36,829
and unexpected sorting results there's a

00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:38,870
better way and there are better tools

00:14:36,829 --> 00:14:41,269
available today for researchers

00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:45,139
including statistical programs such as

00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:47,180
our entire and cloud resources the

00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:50,569
problem with these solutions though is

00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:53,649
in the training training the attendant

00:14:50,569 --> 00:14:56,240
user base and how to leverage them

00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:58,960
there's just not enough time and your

00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,930
day in my day for formal training

00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:04,420
programs and even if there were there

00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:07,210
are many institutions that don't access

00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:10,560
the technology or have the bandwidth to

00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:13,810
participate in formal training programs

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,670
low-hanging fruit in my opinion is to

00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:19,690
reach diverse populations through

00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:22,360
training exposing diverse communities to

00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:26,850
coding and data will expand the number

00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:29,140
type and caliber of these projects so

00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:32,350
how do we bring people with diverse

00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:35,410
perspectives to data how do we empower

00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:37,510
more people to work with data when the

00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:41,530
keepers of the conversation don't look

00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:43,420
like or identify with them we know that

00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:45,940
empowering more people to work with data

00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:48,040
allows us to answer more questions in

00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:50,970
science and society but what does it

00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:54,100
take to attract and retain them

00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:55,660
something the carpentry is doing to

00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:58,390
address this issue is aiming for

00:15:55,660 --> 00:16:00,400
inclusive pedagogy in our training and

00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:04,270
resources so I'll tell you a little bit

00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:07,210
about what we do the carpentry were

00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:09,970
formed to teach computation and data

00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:12,910
science skills through short impactful

00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:15,220
workshops the model that we follow is to

00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:16,960
train the trainer where we certify

00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:18,870
volunteer instructors within the

00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:22,180
community that they're trying to reach

00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:24,700
of course material are open-source and

00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:30,970
in the public domain and free to use and

00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:32,350
contribute to hint-hint in this way we

00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:34,230
are able to scale beyond our

00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:36,250
organization and build regional

00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:40,030
self-sustaining learning and support

00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:41,380
communities for advancing research the

00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:44,110
carpentry is a fiscally sponsored

00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:47,110
project of community initiatives a

00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:49,990
registered 501 C 3 nonprofit based in

00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:52,600
California in the United States the

00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:55,270
carpentry project includes software

00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:57,640
carpentry data carpentry and library

00:16:55,270 --> 00:17:00,080
carpentry and all of our community of

00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:03,590
instructors maintainer x' hell

00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:05,930
bird supporters who share a mission to

00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:07,850
teach foundational computation and data

00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:11,630
science skills to researchers

00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:14,150
technologists and librarians the

00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:16,580
carpentry build global capacity and

00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:19,550
essential data and computation skills

00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:22,700
for conducting efficient open and

00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:25,400
reproducible research we train and

00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:27,040
foster and active inclusive diverse

00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,810
community of learners and instructors

00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:33,320
that promotes and models the importance

00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:35,210
of software and data in research we

00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:38,630
collaboratively develop openly available

00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:41,660
lessons and deliver these lessons using

00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:43,730
evidence-based teaching approaches all

00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:47,330
carpentry workshops are community driven

00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:48,860
and talk globally so before I tell you

00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:50,870
about each of the lesson programs are

00:17:48,860 --> 00:18:00,710
there any carpentry instructors in the

00:17:50,870 --> 00:18:03,740
room right so software carpentry was

00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:06,830
founded in 1998 to develop materials and

00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:08,690
trained instructors to teach computer

00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:10,460
skills to researchers in science

00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:13,340
medicine engineering and other

00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:16,160
disciplines since 2012

00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:18,530
vast volunteer instructors have run

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:22,670
workshops globally and impacted more

00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:24,770
than 34,000 researchers software

00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:27,710
carpentry lessons include three core

00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:29,600
topics which are the UNIX shell version

00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:33,860
control of gear and then a programming

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:35,870
language either R or Python we have

00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:41,330
lessons in English and a few of our

00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:44,360
lessons are also in Spanish yes data

00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:45,920
carpentry was founded in 2015 its

00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,570
curriculum centers around the

00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:50,750
fundamental data skills needed to

00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:52,970
conduct reproducible research data

00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:55,160
carpentry left lessons covers several

00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:57,820
domains including Social Sciences

00:18:55,160 --> 00:19:01,030
ecology a geospatial genomics and

00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:03,260
lessons are developed collaboratively

00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:05,450
lesson content includes data

00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:08,760
organization and spreadsheets data

00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:11,930
cleaning with open refine SQL and then

00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:14,940
are in Python programming languages and

00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:18,450
then lastly on board as the lesson

00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:20,400
program in 2018 library carpentry

00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:22,620
develops lessons and teaches workshops

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,890
for people who work in library or

00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:28,680
information related roles library

00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:30,990
carpentry goal is to create an on-ramp

00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:33,230
to empower this community to use

00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:36,060
software and data

00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:38,190
additionally library carpentry seeks to

00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:41,130
train individuals on efficient and

00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:44,220
effective reproducible data and software

00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:45,870
practices library carpentry core

00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:48,270
curriculum includes and ensure the data

00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:52,380
the UNIX shell and then data cleaning

00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:55,530
with open refine so this is the exciting

00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:57,900
part this is the meat of my keynote for

00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:59,910
the next few minutes I like to focus on

00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:02,760
the pedagogy that has made our approach

00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:05,190
sustainable for the communities that we

00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,810
reach and what we the people in this

00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:12,360
room and those who are watching online

00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:15,540
thanks mom and dad can do to democratize

00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:18,060
data build confidence in ourselves and

00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:19,560
others and support our mission and

00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:22,980
vision to solve problems in a

00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:25,640
collaborative way so I'll do this by

00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,900
discussing how the carpentry teaches

00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,970
practise how the carpentry teaching

00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,650
practices align with what I've learned

00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:34,530
in my personal and my professional

00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:36,420
journey and then we'll wrap up with a

00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:37,860
call to action and I'm going to collect

00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:42,330
some data on you because I am a

00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:44,760
researcher this is what we do so I took

00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:47,900
some time to reflect on my own life and

00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:50,970
where data played a significant role I

00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:54,690
was born in Detroit Michigan in the

00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:57,750
United States in the 1980s during the

00:20:54,690 --> 00:21:00,780
time when my city was at or near the top

00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:02,190
of unemployment poverty per capita and

00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:05,100
infant mortality

00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:09,580
my parents were Wed and brought me into

00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:12,560
this unpredictable world my parentals

00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:14,690
during this period my city had gone

00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:18,230
through horrific disappointment with the

00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:20,140
reversal of Milliken V Bradley a federal

00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:22,340
court decision that would have actively

00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:24,890
desegregated Detroit and suburban

00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:28,340
communities it would have fixed many of

00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:30,830
my city's problems in the eighties my

00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:33,800
city became notorious for crime and was

00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:36,440
repeatedly dubbed the arson capital of

00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:39,640
America the murder capital of America

00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:43,250
and the most dangerous city in America

00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:46,130
it wasn't all doom and gloom for my city

00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:48,530
though in the eighties the Detroit

00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:52,100
Tigers won the World Series during that

00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:56,510
time and both Nelson Mandela and Pope

00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:58,490
John Paul the second visited Detroit but

00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,820
you know what I don't remember any of

00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:02,410
that

00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:05,840
I remember growing up in this house I

00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:08,120
remember backyard barbecues I remember

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:11,150
slumber parties with my cousin shiny who

00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:13,250
look exactly like me I remember all of

00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:16,490
my uncles living in our basement at one

00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:20,240
point or another I remember making snow

00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:22,810
angels in the winter I remember jumping

00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:25,040
into the fire hydrant in the summer I

00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:26,890
remember when I found out it was illegal

00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:31,870
to open fire hydrant

00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:34,660
I remember Christmas lights and

00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:36,760
Thanksgiving dinners and the first time

00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:40,200
my mom had a baby carrots are spaghetti

00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:43,030
that was really interesting today I

00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:47,080
remember loving my house and loving my

00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:48,790
family and loving my city you may have

00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:52,570
noticed that our repeatedly referred to

00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:54,010
Detroit as my city it wasn't in and even

00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:56,799
though I don't still live there

00:22:54,010 --> 00:23:00,130
it still is my city because though the

00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:01,510
plight of Detroit was gruesome living

00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:03,610
there taught me persistence and

00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:07,600
resilience and I need that to work in

00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:10,540
data I remember some other things about

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,760
growing up in Detroit I remember

00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:15,190
dropping to the floor as gunshots rang

00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:19,090
in the New Year or on a random Tuesday

00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:21,429
I remember having our home broken into

00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:29,280
and all our Christmas gifts being stolen

00:23:21,429 --> 00:23:32,049
I remember my brother being arrested

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,799
because he fit the description of an

00:23:32,049 --> 00:23:40,480
armed robber

00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:42,940
I remember how difficult it was to plan

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,660
celebrations with my parents since

00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:48,549
they've been divorced since I was three

00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:52,240
all of these anecdotes are data points

00:23:48,549 --> 00:23:54,970
and if we were to turn this data a

00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:57,220
Detroiter like me born in the 80s will

00:23:54,970 --> 00:24:00,820
presently live below the poverty line

00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:05,429
and working either accommodation or food

00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:08,290
services if we trusted the data a

00:24:05,429 --> 00:24:10,630
Detroiter like me born in the 80s will

00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:13,960
presently rely on federally funded

00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:15,910
programs to support herself but there

00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:18,309
was another plan for me and that plan

00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:22,210
begins with these two my lenient

00:24:18,309 --> 00:24:25,299
albert's my parents taught me to work my

00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:27,270
tail off so I can get good grades I

00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:30,820
played sports I sang in the choir

00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:33,900
obviously I did everything that I needed

00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:36,929
to do to get it to engineer

00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:39,220
about a 10 hour drive north of Detroit

00:24:36,929 --> 00:24:42,159
there's a small town in Upper Peninsula

00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:44,620
of Michigan named hope anybody heard of

00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:48,820
it thank you

00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:51,360
nobody nobody no sorry that's why I went

00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:54,190
to school for my undergrad and masters

00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:56,140
Michigan Technological University was a

00:24:54,190 --> 00:25:00,370
place that I'd never thought I would end

00:24:56,140 --> 00:25:02,350
up I was one of the only women and one

00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:04,750
of the only people of color in most of

00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:06,880
my classes but I was determined to do

00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:10,179
well because I got accepted into

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:13,450
engineering school I was invited to the

00:25:10,179 --> 00:25:14,980
party after earning a bachelor's and

00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:17,590
master's in mechanical engineering I

00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:19,870
decided to pursue my PhD but I wanted to

00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:21,880
address the fact that there were not

00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:24,070
enough people who looked like me

00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:26,260
studying in the field and so I switched

00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:28,659
my focus from mechanical engineering to

00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:30,880
engineering education and that's how I

00:25:28,659 --> 00:25:33,610
learned many of the techniques that the

00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:36,130
carpentry uses to teach workshops and

00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:44,230
build community so let's explore them

00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:47,159
together now building confidence to work

00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:49,330
with data requires multiple approaches

00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:51,549
combining the power of guided

00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:54,280
instruction with the flexibility of

00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:56,620
shorts focus the learning experiences

00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:58,929
has the potential to achieve equity

00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:02,260
among practitioners who want to work

00:25:58,929 --> 00:26:04,500
with data by acknowledging and building

00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:07,179
upon the four pillars of self-efficacy

00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:09,820
the concrete Ruiz has been able to

00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:12,840
develop and train communities of

00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:15,820
practice by sharing good data practices

00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:18,850
so here's what I mean by self-efficacy a

00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:20,890
little more jargon busting one of my

00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:23,770
favorite quotes is from Mahatma Gandhi

00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:27,039
and it reads if I have the belief that I

00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:29,890
can do it I shall surely acquire the

00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:31,500
capacity to do it even if I may not have

00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:34,419
it at the beginning

00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:39,280
Gandhi's quote describes how I think

00:26:34,419 --> 00:26:41,799
about self-efficacy self-efficacy refers

00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:43,610
to an individual's belief that she is

00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:46,070
capable of solving

00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:48,920
we're taking action in a certain goal

00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:52,240
such as writing a computer program to

00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:56,150
solve a problem that she's interested in

00:26:52,240 --> 00:27:00,020
self-efficacy is formed by performance

00:26:56,150 --> 00:27:03,790
outcomes by Kary experiences verbal

00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:06,559
persuasions and physiological feedback

00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:09,230
increasing self-efficacy can ultimately

00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:10,940
improve access and equity for

00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:13,429
individuals who are historically

00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:16,340
underrepresented and underserved in the

00:27:13,429 --> 00:27:18,410
data science space so I didn't come away

00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:20,540
near that that was all Albert bandura

00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:23,630
just in case you were wondering that was

00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:25,220
not me so I give this question a lot

00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:29,270
what's the difference between self

00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:31,730
confidence and self advocacy self

00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:34,299
confidence is trusting in your abilities

00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:37,460
your qualities and your judgments

00:27:34,299 --> 00:27:41,320
however self confidence refers to a more

00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:44,540
generalized personality characteristic

00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:47,450
self-efficacy points to your ability to

00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:52,549
succeed in a very specific task or

00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:53,870
accomplish a specific situation so we'll

00:27:52,549 --> 00:27:56,000
go over the four pillars of

00:27:53,870 --> 00:28:00,490
self-efficacy I want to start with

00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,490
performance outcomes with a short video

00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:08,559
there we go

00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:28,050
well return one five cents

00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:35,100
and I realize I was looking back

00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,730
so for your balls

00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:53,159
to save enough money

00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:59,840
worried about

00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:02,309
yes

00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:04,550
how much money last night

00:29:02,309 --> 00:29:18,110
I am seven billion

00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:21,720
I said to go was so make sure to see

00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:25,379
online easily be established

00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:28,370
on their matrix in that goal

00:29:25,379 --> 00:29:28,370
accomplished

00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:31,579
[Music]

00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:39,230
and one more for the record for a bitter

00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:47,510
the maintain their house

00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:04,970
here

00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:11,059
yes I did come on

00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:14,110
[Music]

00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:14,110
several times rain

00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:21,370
[Music]

00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:27,579
oh well well what was your image

00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:27,579
[Music]

00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:31,220
between Zumba

00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:39,510
somebody was with Motown music

00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:06,300
[Applause]

00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:11,220
I've seen that video at least 30 times

00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:12,900
but every time I laugh so hard okay so

00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:14,670
we're talking about when we talk about

00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:17,310
performance outcomes

00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:19,350
it means previous success that leads you

00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:22,490
to believe you are capable of completing

00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:25,170
a similar task in the future

00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:28,170
comparing the carpentry pre and post

00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:31,290
workshop scores we see full point

00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:33,930
confidence games in learners ability to

00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:35,370
write a program to solve a problem their

00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:37,830
work and even in their overall

00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:40,170
confidence in programming so this is

00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:44,330
what we talk about performance outcomes

00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:44,330
and this is after a two-day workshop

00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:49,970
when you see someone else completing the

00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:52,680
task you believe you can do the same

00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:55,500
this is one of the reasons why I love

00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:57,800
the carpentry teaching practices rather

00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:00,270
than displaying a slide that of cold

00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:04,640
instructors deliver content by live

00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:07,110
coding leaves our vicarious experiences

00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:09,360
this method provides learners the

00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:12,990
opportunity to practice and receive

00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:15,150
continuous feedback about their code it

00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:18,360
is important to keep in mind however

00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:21,480
that feedback is not helpful if you

00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:23,490
cannot understand it live coding

00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:26,220
facilitates tests acknowledged or

00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:30,420
learning by watching how others do

00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:33,300
things and the best way I can describe

00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:47,000
verbal persuasion is by showing you

00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:50,880
another short video hi Kari senior hello

00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:53,250
recording for me I was about to

00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:56,410
surrender still shot I thought well not

00:32:53,250 --> 00:33:00,520
just video take me stand help

00:32:56,410 --> 00:33:07,630
my darling Kari I'm about to read anyway

00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:11,320
love you bye supportive people in your

00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:14,920
life such as teachers family or mentors

00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:17,320
help you build self-efficacy the

00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:21,040
carpentry engages in verbal persuasion

00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:23,230
by way of our mentoring groups mentoring

00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:25,660
groups are small groups of instructors

00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:28,020
led by a mentor usually four to five

00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:30,580
participants and they focus on

00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:32,890
contributing to lessons developing

00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:34,720
confidence and skill and teaching the

00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:36,940
logistics of running a workshop and

00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:41,500
tried-and-true events that foster

00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:45,000
community building lastly we'll talk

00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:45,000
about physiological feedback

00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:50,710
experiencing sensations and emotions can

00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:53,830
affect your ability to see yourself

00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:57,240
completing a task let's check out this

00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:57,240
video to see what I mean

00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:19,339
[Music]

00:34:15,579 --> 00:34:22,040
we tend to think of emotional arousal in

00:34:19,339 --> 00:34:25,480
terms of excitement and joy like you saw

00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:28,490
from my father dancing on his birthday

00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:31,250
but at times learning environments can

00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:33,740
create a sense of anxiety if they aren't

00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:42,500
designed and facilitated with equity

00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:47,030
inclusion and accessibility in mind Walt

00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:49,339
I'm dad the carpentry czar committed to

00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:51,619
making participation in our workshops a

00:34:49,339 --> 00:34:54,980
harassment free experience for everyone

00:34:51,619 --> 00:34:57,500
regardless of level of experience gender

00:34:54,980 --> 00:35:00,049
gender identity and expression sexual

00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:04,010
orientation your personal parents body

00:35:00,049 --> 00:35:06,380
size race ethnicity age religion we

00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:09,770
establish norms for interaction by

00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:12,170
having discussing and enforcing a code

00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:14,480
of conduct such that our workshops

00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:18,829
provide open and inclusive learning

00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:22,339
environments so to recap I said a lot

00:35:18,829 --> 00:35:25,130
just now considering any or all of the

00:35:22,339 --> 00:35:26,960
factors determining self-efficacy can

00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:29,780
help us not only build our own

00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:32,180
self-efficacy and general confidence to

00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:34,970
work with data but it can ultimately

00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:37,809
achieve equity and help each of us feel

00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:40,809
as if our contributions are welcome and

00:35:37,809 --> 00:35:40,809
acknowledged

00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:46,819
I've asked us to consider many things

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,660
this afternoon and now it's time to

00:35:46,819 --> 00:35:54,079
bring it home with this thought science

00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:56,480
scholarship and society is better by

00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:59,329
having diverse people with the skills

00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:02,599
and the abilities to address questions

00:35:59,329 --> 00:36:05,000
that are important to them I encourage

00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:07,609
us to work together to provide easily

00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,650
accessible resources for people who are

00:36:07,609 --> 00:36:12,830
unfamiliar with the tools and the

00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:15,920
technology that we've grown to love and

00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:18,210
sometimes I hate it sometimes I love it

00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,910
what if there were a greater diversity

00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:24,900
in the spoken languages that we teach

00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:27,270
and incorrect how can we recognize and

00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:30,000
appreciate the different cultural norms

00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:32,730
that exist around data programming

00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:36,570
teaching and volunteering in different

00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:39,210
regions how can we recognize and value

00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:42,300
the various types of contributions that

00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:44,640
we see in this space how can we work

00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:47,220
with existing organizations to reach

00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:51,660
broader communities rather than building

00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:54,990
or reinventing our own networks how can

00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:57,450
we authenticate broader communities

00:36:54,990 --> 00:37:01,920
rather than approach our work with thee

00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:03,540
we're doing it for them mentality we

00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,640
won't be able to answer all these

00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:08,280
questions or solve these issues over the

00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:10,770
next two days but what I do want us to

00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:13,680
realize is that our story and our

00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:16,350
contributions matter and if we're going

00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:19,050
to build confidence in ourselves and the

00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:22,830
way we interact with one another we can

00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:24,600
only go further when we go together now

00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:27,570
I wouldn't be a researcher if I didn't

00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:30,060
collect data so if you're able to please

00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:33,300
follow the URL that I put on my closet

00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:35,400
action slide it leads to the link for my

00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:37,560
slide bag and also a prompt that I'd

00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:40,980
like us to take about five yes we have

00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:45,420
five minutes the prompt I would like us

00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:47,310
to take five minutes to share please

00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:49,950
share an experience that may have

00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:52,380
created a barrier to you participating

00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:55,020
in data or open source communities and

00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:58,740
how that barrier could have been removed

00:37:55,020 --> 00:38:00,180
so we'll take five minutes to and if you

00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:01,920
have any issues with the prompt I was

00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:04,440
going to say put up a red sticky but I

00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:07,720
didn't pass out anything

00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:09,340
so you can say him that will take 5

00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:12,000
minutes to answer the prompt and then

00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:12,000
