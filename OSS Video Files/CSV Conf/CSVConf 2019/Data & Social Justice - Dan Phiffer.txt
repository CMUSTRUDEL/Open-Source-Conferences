Description: 
	This talk will provide an overview of the course I'm currently teaching at Bennington College called Data & Social Justice. I'll outline some of the issues my students have been organizing around, as well as techniques they've developed for doing outreach, using data visualization to support their causes, and describing how I've supported their efforts through my own faculty activism.
