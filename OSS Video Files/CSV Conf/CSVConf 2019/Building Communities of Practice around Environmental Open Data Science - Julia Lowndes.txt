Title: Building Communities of Practice around Environmental Open Data Science - Julia Lowndes
Publication date: 2019-05-19
Playlist: CSVConf 2019
Description: 
	Environmental scientists are a diverse community that ranges from climatologists to geneticists, but we are united by an enormous need to work efficiently with data â€“ and by the fact that we seldom have formal computing or data analysis training of any kind. There is great opportunity to borrow from the work of software engineers and use collaborative open tools that facilitate better science in less time. However, a fundamental shift is needed in the environmental science community that prioritizes data science and provides emerging scientific leaders training in open science tools and practices to strengthen and accelerate their work. I will discuss my work to catalyze this shift through two programs I have developed and lead at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) at the University of California at Santa Barbara. The first is the Ocean Health Index training program, which teaches international government and academic scientists how to channel the best available scientific information into marine policy using our scientific method and tools. And the second I have recently launched in January 2019 as a Mozilla Fellow: Openscapes, a mentorship program that empowers environmental scientists with open data science tools and grows the community of practice.

hi it's so great to be here thanks so

00:00:04,149 --> 00:00:07,660
much I've been listening to such amazing

00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:09,610
talks all day I feel like there's so

00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:11,500
much more so many more questions and

00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:14,049
things I want to talk about then I have

00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:17,860
time to today but I'm excited for the

00:00:14,049 --> 00:00:21,430
discussion afterwards as well so hi I'm

00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:23,830
a marine ecologist but open data science

00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:25,120
and the communities and tools in this

00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:27,640
room and Beyond have been so

00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:30,250
game-changing for my science and for my

00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,560
life and that is not an overstatement

00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:34,750
I have gone I've been so empowered by

00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:37,690
these tools that I've sort of been

00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:39,489
moving away from conducting my my own

00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:42,970
research towards enabling other people

00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:46,239
to do their research better so as a

00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:49,570
marine ecologist I am I am in a my I am

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:51,370
an environmental scientist so we're the

00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:54,010
geneticists the biologists the

00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,239
physiologist the climate scientists all

00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,680
of these different people who are

00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:58,989
studying in the national environment and

00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:01,989
how people interact with it like the

00:00:58,989 --> 00:01:03,640
food systems that we have sustainability

00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:04,959
all these different things that United

00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,969
Nations report that came out this week

00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:09,939
about the million species that are going

00:01:06,969 --> 00:01:13,359
to be extinct that is scientists like me

00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:14,409
that are doing those that work so we

00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:16,990
have different backgrounds different

00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:18,880
study systems but we are united by the

00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:21,909
fact that we are never trained to work

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:25,810
with data we are never taught how to use

00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:30,039
a computer and it yeah it's it's like

00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:31,450
that awkward terrified laugh because

00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:35,560
we're working with really important

00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:37,990
global systems and the the practices

00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:40,359
that go on in our labs like there's kind

00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:42,490
of this sense of like eyes down elbows

00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:44,829
out a little bit when it comes to

00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:46,509
working with data and with practices

00:01:44,829 --> 00:01:50,590
because we don't have a culture of

00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:52,959
sharing we don't have we just don't have

00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:56,229
like the the mind sets that we can do

00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:58,359
better some of these times so groups

00:01:56,229 --> 00:02:00,909
like our open side the carpentry our

00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:03,069
studio all these groups have enabled me

00:02:00,909 --> 00:02:04,630
to see that there's better ways to do

00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:06,669
things and to learn from these

00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:09,340
communities and I really want to bring

00:02:06,669 --> 00:02:10,950
these to these practices to in Barnaul

00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:16,210
science

00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:17,470
so to put this a little bit more to go

00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:22,000
through this a little bit more I like to

00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:25,060
use Star Wars analogies so this is Luke

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,830
Skywalker sitting on the edge of the

00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:29,230
Dagobah swamp after he's crashed his

00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:30,970
plane he is sitting there super

00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:33,180
demoralized looking at a problem he

00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:36,370
cannot solve what the skill sets he has

00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,780
that that's that was me that is so many

00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:39,970
environmental scientists sitting there

00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:42,760
looking at their data not knowing how to

00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:45,510
tackle it and and what will happen is

00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:48,190
some pretty messy pretty irreproducible

00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:51,730
approaches to tackling this problem with

00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:53,790
the skill sets we have but there is a

00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:56,530
different way to solve that problem

00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:57,970
here's Yoda coming along and solving

00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:00,310
this problem in a way that Luke never

00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:04,180
dreamed was possible and Luke is going

00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:05,320
to be able to learn from Yoda and he

00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:09,760
will be able to solve this problem

00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:11,080
himself and he will go on to tackle

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,600
problems that are much bigger and

00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,520
broader in scope because it's it's gonna

00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,070
broaden his imagination of the things he

00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:20,530
can take on so this is what open data

00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:22,810
science does for scientists like me it

00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:25,030
is just game-changing it is so

00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:28,690
empowering and it's yeah we'll take you

00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:29,770
places you never dreamed but something

00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,960
that's also really important is that

00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:35,710
it's not just the tools and it's not

00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:38,800
just the Jedi's it is this whole

00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:41,920
community of people towards this bigger

00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:44,890
movement and there are such different

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,540
backgrounds and skill sets and we can

00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:48,970
all come together to work on something

00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:51,670
bigger so this is the way I feel in the

00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:54,130
open data science universe and I want

00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:56,830
ecologists and climate scientists and

00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:59,980
all these other amazing scientists to

00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:02,590
feel part of this bigger movement so I

00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:04,900
love Star Wars analogies and I'll come

00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:07,750
back to them don't worry but we've also

00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:11,530
we've also published scientific research

00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:13,900
about this story about how these tools

00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,340
and these communities have made us do

00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,680
better science and less time and have

00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:21,220
much bigger impact so I want to talk

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:23,290
about two examples of environmental open

00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,800
data science communities that I have

00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:26,039
been

00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,300
part of and been leading for the past

00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:30,669
the ocean health index has been for the

00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,560
past six years and open escapes is a

00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:39,009
program I started in January as a

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:41,620
Mozilla fellow so the ocean health index

00:04:39,009 --> 00:04:45,069
is this big project to help bring more

00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:47,440
data and science into policy ocean

00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:49,110
policy on the ground around the world so

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,990
we developed a scientific framework

00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:55,479
published in 2012 and and then also

00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:56,819
assessed how healthy oceans are for

00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:59,949
every country that has a coastline

00:04:56,819 --> 00:05:01,419
globally and we've now been repeating

00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:03,129
this every single year and this

00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:05,550
data-driven assessment with a hundred

00:05:03,129 --> 00:05:08,020
different public datasets modeled with

00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:10,960
with management targets and a bunch of

00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:14,050
different a lot of more backstory than

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,659
than that is now being used by the

00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:20,169
United Nations because it is this

00:05:16,659 --> 00:05:22,300
transparent reproducible way of using

00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:25,000
data to assess oceans so it's been

00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:27,460
really it's a really awesome project and

00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,229
we've also been able to enable other

00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:32,440
countries around the world to use our

00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:35,020
methods as well but what I want to talk

00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:37,930
about in the context of the ocean health

00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:40,240
index is how open data science has

00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:43,150
helped us work as a team and kind of

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,039
kick that feeling that many scientists

00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:46,990
have even within a lab of not having

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,690
community and not being able to talk

00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:52,120
about data and struggle solely with

00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:55,180
their data challenges and have basically

00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:58,240
everybody just feeling stranded the way

00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:00,340
Luke did but we all feel we work like a

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,319
team we have overlapping skill sets and

00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:05,979
what it's done is that we've been able

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:07,750
to each year take less time to do these

00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:11,529
repeated assessments that we have to do

00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:14,110
every year and it's and it has so yeah

00:06:11,529 --> 00:06:16,719
the circles show the amount of time

00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:18,849
relatively but it's also let us focus

00:06:16,719 --> 00:06:20,349
more on training other people and

00:06:18,849 --> 00:06:24,969
enabling other people and building

00:06:20,349 --> 00:06:26,889
community around these tools so we we

00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:30,610
lead these global assessments like I

00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:33,399
said but we also enable teams around the

00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:34,960
world to do this as well so I over the

00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:37,689
last six years have led this program

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,269
where we've helped governments

00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:43,599
the world this is Colombia and Indonesia

00:06:40,269 --> 00:06:46,629
we also have groups and the Baltic Sea

00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:49,509
and then Norway and in Canada and Samoa

00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:52,719
who are using not only our science but

00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:54,939
our our open-source tools in order to

00:06:52,719 --> 00:07:00,459
get better data and decision-making into

00:06:54,939 --> 00:07:01,779
the oceans so this is a busy slide and

00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:04,379
I'll walk us through it we're gonna

00:07:01,779 --> 00:07:07,989
start up in the top left and come around

00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:09,909
counterclockwise because I'm sure I just

00:07:07,989 --> 00:07:12,489
want you to know how much open data

00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:14,079
science has contributed to this effort

00:07:12,489 --> 00:07:17,889
and made this possible like made it

00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:21,969
possible so that small team of us right

00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:22,929
here has been able to help 20 countries

00:07:21,969 --> 00:07:25,539
around the world and do these

00:07:22,929 --> 00:07:28,689
assessments every year so I was hired in

00:07:25,539 --> 00:07:30,129
2013 to teach our science to governments

00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:32,139
and groups that were interested in using

00:07:30,129 --> 00:07:34,629
our our science and so I was able to

00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:36,879
work with my team to contribute to their

00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:39,519
global assessments and start a program

00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:42,279
that will enable other governments I

00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:47,050
pretty quickly in 2014 needed to learn

00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:49,389
our and I was thankfully able to join

00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:52,689
our studio in our open SCI communities

00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:54,219
rather than struggling with as I had as

00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:59,909
a graduate student when I was trying to

00:07:54,219 --> 00:08:02,469
learn MATLAB by myself so learning are

00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:05,949
with these communities enabled me to

00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:07,929
help us develop our software toolbox

00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:10,749
like as we call it our our packages and

00:08:07,929 --> 00:08:14,619
github workflows that then I would teach

00:08:10,749 --> 00:08:16,329
the these scientists around the world so

00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:18,219
that was great so I'd started off trying

00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,869
to teach the science and then now I was

00:08:18,219 --> 00:08:21,819
teaching a science and our coding

00:08:19,869 --> 00:08:23,379
packages which are awesome but then I

00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:25,199
realized I needed to actually teach

00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:28,449
people how to use R and github

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:31,119
beforehand so that's when I became a

00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:33,490
carpentry instructor and started

00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:38,050
teaching software carpentry workshops

00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:40,240
and I started Co started a study group

00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:42,899
locally at UC Santa Barbara where we

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,829
skill share and teach each other

00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:46,269
different things we started off teaching

00:08:44,829 --> 00:08:48,339
each other github and then spatial data

00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:50,800
analysis with our and all these kind of

00:08:48,339 --> 00:08:51,420
things so that really equipped me to be

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,540
a better teacher

00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:56,000
to my ocean health index community so

00:08:54,540 --> 00:09:00,570
that I could teach them our and github

00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:03,060
but then I really realized that the

00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:05,490
problem that I faced with in these

00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,990
communities wasn't that they didn't know

00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,970
how to use our and github it said that

00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:11,040
they didn't even have the mindset to

00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:14,339
want to learn them they didn't even have

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,050
this like team mindset or or team

00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:19,310
culture or individual mindset that would

00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:22,079
enable that so that's when we led our

00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:24,029
nature paper in nature ecology and

00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:27,959
evolution paper and started an Our

00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:29,310
Lady's chapter locally in order to to

00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:32,600
sort of welcome more people into this

00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:35,010
world and and broaden beyond just ocean

00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,120
oriented groups so trying to reach the

00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:38,279
broader environmental data science

00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,110
communities and then this has also led

00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:43,170
to this mozilla fellowship that i'm

00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:46,740
super lucky to to have and be a part of

00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:48,360
and i've been able to lead open scapes

00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:50,240
which is this effort that i'm going to

00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,139
spend the rest of the time talking about

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,779
which I'm super excited to tell you

00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:58,800
about as well so the questions that kind

00:09:54,779 --> 00:10:00,990
of spawned open scapes are how do we

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,730
welcome more people into this world and

00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:04,670
empower them with the existing

00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:07,079
communities and tools that already exist

00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:09,089
and how do we focus for me on

00:10:07,079 --> 00:10:11,279
environmental scientists but actually do

00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:12,870
this more much more broadly and then how

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,250
do we also in order to do this I think

00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:19,140
we really need to think about helping

00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:22,519
science labs work more like teams okay

00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:25,260
so this is open scapes

00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:27,720
so the what I'm trying to do with open

00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:29,490
scapes is to compliment existing efforts

00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,130
and welcome more people to this world

00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:33,750
and in doing so I want to increase the

00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:35,220
visibility and value of open data

00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:37,589
science within the environmental

00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:40,440
communities and I want to do excuse me

00:10:37,589 --> 00:10:44,730
do that by amplifying awesome scientists

00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:48,690
that are now using these practices so I

00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:50,639
want everybody to feel like this well if

00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:53,899
that's not well it's a team effort but I

00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:53,899
just love this graphic

00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:01,240
so with open escapes I have started this

00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:03,580
champions program which is a mentorship

00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:06,010
program to make more champions for open

00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:08,050
data science in our communities and I'm

00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:10,510
focusing on early career scientists and

00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:14,440
their labs so scientists like me who are

00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:16,839
now tenured faculty and are doomed to to

00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,760
have a closed mindset in a closed lab if

00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:20,260
unless they're welcomed into this world

00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,330
because they've never been exposed to it

00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:24,850
otherwise so I really want to normalize

00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:30,100
open data science in the lab and then

00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:32,529
help seat it far beyond so it's this is

00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:34,870
a 5-month remote program I'm developing

00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:38,170
or have developed in the vein and

00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:39,580
modeled after Mozilla open leaders so

00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:41,560
that means that it's all done remotely

00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:43,209
through zoom which also means we can

00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,370
have smaller breakout groups and have

00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:48,070
people discuss things as smaller groups

00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:52,240
as well as the whole community and

00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:55,149
there's kind of two halves of the of the

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:58,420
curriculum the first being about lab

00:11:55,149 --> 00:12:00,339
culture and lab mindset and the second

00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:03,430
half really being about skill building

00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:05,709
with the broader community on campus and

00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:07,959
so it's all about kind of welcoming

00:12:05,709 --> 00:12:10,510
people to these tools and practices and

00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:13,839
communities that exist and I'm

00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:17,830
developing it to be discipline agnostic

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:22,810
I should say - I have plans for beyond

00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:25,209
this pilot cohort that I've created but

00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:27,100
I am I have been testing this with it's

00:12:25,209 --> 00:12:30,220
either the inaugural cohort or the pilot

00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:34,060
cohort but I do plan to continue this

00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:35,920
effort beyond this first cohort so

00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,990
developing all of this with these seven

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,089
champions in their labs I've got 24

00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:43,209
people that join me twice a month to

00:12:40,089 --> 00:12:46,089
talk about open data science and what's

00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:51,970
how they can get this into their lab

00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:54,339
culture so these are my seven champions

00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:57,100
they are all incredibly awesome

00:12:54,339 --> 00:13:00,700
environmental scientists who I've chosen

00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:03,190
for three reasons the first is that they

00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:05,010
are already rising star early career

00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:06,370
faculty and lecturers they have

00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:08,259
incredible

00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:12,100
momentum and they're doing really

00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:13,600
important science and I can help them do

00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:16,480
better and help them be an ambassador

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,790
for open data science as they continue

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,350
to rise which I am which is really

00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,939
exciting

00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:24,430
the second reason I chose them is

00:13:21,939 --> 00:13:27,180
because they are not involved in open

00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:31,569
data science yet they are either unaware

00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:36,819
hesitant or or not not bought in to open

00:13:31,569 --> 00:13:38,050
science so it's a tough crowd but the

00:13:36,819 --> 00:13:41,290
reason I picked them the third reason

00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:43,120
was trust these are all very close

00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:46,029
friends of mine from graduate school or

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:49,329
currently at UCSB and they were willing

00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:50,529
to to participate in my program that

00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:53,170
they didn't know what it was because

00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:54,879
they saw that it was important to me and

00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:57,759
they knew that this would be something

00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:59,439
bigger so that Trust is something that

00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:02,769
we can talk about with scaling as well

00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:04,029
but what I think was cool and two of

00:14:02,769 --> 00:14:05,410
them actually said you know I don't know

00:14:04,029 --> 00:14:07,180
if this is gonna be useful for me at all

00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:09,910
but I'll join cuz you're asking me to

00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:12,220
and then they are like some of the

00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:16,720
biggest advocates which is amazing and

00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:19,689
that's what exactly what I want so and

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,329
then this is our this is most of us on

00:14:19,689 --> 00:14:24,790
one of the cohort calls so these are all

00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:27,490
of the seven champions plus they're labs

00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:29,019
together and I teach them together and

00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:32,980
it's it's hard and there's challenges

00:14:29,019 --> 00:14:35,649
but I do it for again three reasons the

00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:38,319
first is so that everybody pies and lab

00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:40,149
members together can value this can see

00:14:38,319 --> 00:14:43,779
this can know it's important and value

00:14:40,149 --> 00:14:47,319
it and then the P is the principle

00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:48,550
investigators can they can be an

00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:50,499
ambassador for it and they're bigger

00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:53,470
channels on campus and beyond and they

00:14:50,499 --> 00:14:55,990
can enable their lab to do it and then

00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:58,899
their lab has agency to do it and they

00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:00,819
have support from their PI but it kind

00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:03,759
of removes this feeling that the PI

00:15:00,819 --> 00:15:06,040
needs to be an expert in it first in

00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:12,009
order to enable their lab which is a big

00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:14,709
hurdle okay so there's been some really

00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:18,370
awesome outcomes in the four months

00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:20,110
already and I am excited to talk to more

00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,440
people about how to quantify this and

00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:23,290
how to

00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:26,399
this either now and also beyond but I'll

00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:26,399
show you what I've come up with so far

00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:31,899
everybody has every lab has a github

00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:35,920
organization for the lab and that's a

00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:36,879
big deal to have everybody having an

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,470
accounts and being able to participate

00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:41,560
somewhere and then that there's this

00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:43,689
idea of longevity of the lab they have

00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:46,180
codes of conduct they have protocol

00:15:43,689 --> 00:15:49,420
protocols for digital onboarding into

00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:51,639
the lab they have data man some of them

00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:53,500
have data management protocols so it's

00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:55,269
been really awesome to see that they are

00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,490
really putting this forward and saying

00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:58,839
like we do this this is important this

00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:02,579
is the type of lab we are this type of

00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:02,579
culture we are which is really exciting

00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:08,050
another their homework each week is to

00:16:05,769 --> 00:16:10,149
normalize talking about data science in

00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:12,730
the lab so instead of this kind of eyes

00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:14,949
down I'm working on my own science and I

00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:17,040
am unique to everyone else in the lab I

00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:19,389
want them to see those horizontal

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,699
cross-cutting similarities across the

00:16:19,389 --> 00:16:24,250
lab everybody has to send data or

00:16:21,699 --> 00:16:26,110
figures to the to your group your PI how

00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:27,819
do you do it do you email your Dropbox

00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:30,250
your Google Drive like let's have it

00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:31,839
let's have a system and it will make

00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:33,790
everybody's life easier and then we can

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,529
figure out how to onboard new people

00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:37,959
into the system we have undergrads every

00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:39,970
every summer how do we onboard them like

00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:42,250
that kind of stuff so they not only are

00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:44,019
having these chats every week but they

00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:47,500
are now starting to amplify that they're

00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:50,019
doing it so these are examples of places

00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:53,769
online you can see that they're also

00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:57,689
joining and leaving communities outside

00:16:53,769 --> 00:17:00,610
of the lab so they're participating in

00:16:57,689 --> 00:17:02,649
well they're creating coding clubs on

00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:05,289
campus and they're joining existing ones

00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:07,179
and they're also starting new our ladies

00:17:05,289 --> 00:17:11,159
chapters and and really trying to figure

00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:13,839
out how to move forward in the community

00:17:11,159 --> 00:17:15,730
and they're also being ambassadors more

00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:18,039
broadly they're tweeting to their

00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:21,250
environmental science communities about

00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:23,199
our and about code packages they didn't

00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:25,900
know exists and about the feeling of how

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,179
awesome this is and and just you know

00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:29,980
trying to you know they're they're

00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:33,870
they're saying for themselves what I

00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:36,190
want them to feel which is amazing

00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:40,180
not in such a heavy-handed way that that

00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:42,670
just sounded and something that's also

00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:45,580
been great is there's there's some real

00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:47,110
tangible scientific collaborations that

00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:48,730
have come out of this already people are

00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:51,310
writing a grant together about

00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:53,290
aquaculture both from a bunch of

00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:55,420
different angles and it's just really

00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:58,030
exciting that they're within the realms

00:17:55,420 --> 00:18:01,990
of what is what they are measured upon

00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:04,410
within their scientific structure they

00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:08,680
are still having really support good

00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:10,660
wins that way as well there are so many

00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:12,460
other things I would love to say there's

00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:15,520
so many little wins of little

00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:18,280
efficiencies time mindset all these

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:22,630
awesome things that I am also trying to

00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:25,210
track I'll just wrap up with a couple

00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:27,760
challenges from this this first one is

00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:30,820
you know I didn't really expect that

00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:34,630
labs didn't by default think like a team

00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:38,200
and even though I had experienced that

00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:39,970
in my own PhD lab I had kind of you know

00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,880
with rose-tinted glasses forgotten so I

00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:44,920
really had to reframe my curriculum to

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,940
really on the first half focus on just

00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:50,260
the idea that we're a team

00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:53,590
imposter syndrome and hierarchy are real

00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:55,660
things early career faculty have so many

00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:59,380
pressures on them and they are trying to

00:18:55,660 --> 00:19:01,240
be leaders but both in with their peers

00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:04,210
and with their students and it is a big

00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:06,460
deal for them to say I don't know how to

00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:07,960
use github to their students you know

00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:09,970
and they shouldn't and they feel this

00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,560
like burden that they need to learn it

00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:13,210
in order to have their lab do it so this

00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:15,100
is something that I'm trying to do is I

00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:18,280
kind of break this hierarchy and then

00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:21,310
name that impostor syndrome and then

00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:24,550
limited-time prioritizing and know an

00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:28,360
academic incentives across the board is

00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:30,130
really hard as well but I think some

00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:33,250
ideas that come up with this or that I

00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:35,500
think a lot about how open software and

00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:37,960
open communities really create a kinder

00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:40,330
culture in real life as well and like we

00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:42,820
see that here at this conference like

00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:44,710
how do we channel this back to the labs

00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:45,730
and to science more broadly so I think

00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,870
about that a lot I love to talk about

00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:49,780
that

00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:51,070
and I also think we need to invest in

00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:53,350
people that are making this culture

00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:56,020
change and and have and value them and

00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:57,760
the way you value people is by giving

00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:00,160
them job security in academia that would

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,780
be amazing if not if there are more

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,480
people that wanted to support this with

00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:08,070
teaching and doing more setting more

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:10,960
stability to labs were able to do that

00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:12,580
so this brings just me back to the whole

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,070
idea that this is a part of a bigger

00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:16,690
movement and it's really exciting to

00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:19,420
have more scientists feel a part of this

00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:20,620
movement and I'm really excited to be

00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:22,430
here and be a part of it with you so

00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:28,619
thanks everybody

00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:28,619
