Title: Bash â‹–3's CSVs: Data Analysis on the cmdline - Nicholas Canzoneri
Publication date: 2019-06-21
Playlist: CSVConf 2019
Description: 
	Your bash shell has a _lot_ utilities that can be used to help you analyze your data, often easier and faster than trying to import your data to an external tool. But these utilities can be hard to find and even harder to figure out the right options. I'll walkthrough a data set and show examples of the best utility to use in different situations. I'll go over common commands like `grep` and `cut`, more exotic commands like `comm` and `tr`, and dig up very useful options to a command you might have overlooked, like `sort -k`.
