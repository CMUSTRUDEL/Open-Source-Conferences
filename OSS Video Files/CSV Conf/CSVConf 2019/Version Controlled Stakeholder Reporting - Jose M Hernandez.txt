	Talk title: Version Controlled Stakeholder Reporting: Building an End-to-End Data Reporting Infrastructure

King County, Washington is currently undergoing complex social and economic changes that have both positive and negative impacts on local residents. With rising rents displacing low-income households to outlying areas or into homelessness, there is a critical need to understand the prevalence and mechanisms of housing insecurity for government organizations tasked to address these issues. Currently, our team of Data and social scientists at the University of Washington, eScience Institute are collaborating with stakeholders across the King County Housing and Homelessness prevention agencies to derive meaningful insights from their data. While their aim is not to produce academic research, our findings may have significant and immediate impact for their organizational practices and the communities they are tasked to serve. In this context and where there is an iterative and constant feedback loop present, reproducibility of the results we present to them, from figures, tables, and even written language is critical. To ensure a successful collaboration, our team has built an end to end data reporting infrastructure to produce reports for our stakeholders that are reproducible and version controlled from raw data to final product. We employ some common open source tools to accomplish this, including R/Rstudio, Python, Rmarkdown, and git.
