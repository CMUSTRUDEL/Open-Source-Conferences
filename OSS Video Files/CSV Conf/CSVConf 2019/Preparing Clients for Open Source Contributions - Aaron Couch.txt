Title: Preparing Clients for Open Source Contributions - Aaron Couch
Publication date: 2019-05-19
Playlist: CSVConf 2019
Description: 
	At CivicActions we've developed a number of methodologies to help enable our clients to be a part of the open source community.This talk will focus on a number of those strategies including capture management, project roles and tools, and reporting measures. This talk will be slightly shorter to allow for time for a more collaborative discussion.

yeah this talk is preparing clients I

00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:11,279
threw in and ourselves because in some

00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:16,180
ways that's what it's about for

00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:18,420
open-source contribution so hi a little

00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:20,680
background about me America which I

00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:24,840
helped create DK and I've been working

00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:31,390
on open data for five or six years I

00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:34,150
love cheap pizza if you want me if you

00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:36,510
really want to like it to go from zero

00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:40,149
to ten for me is someone from New York

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:43,390
telling me that the pizza from New York

00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:46,450
is better than Philadelphia it hurts

00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,989
because it's kind of true but just don't

00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,989
go there

00:00:46,989 --> 00:00:52,960
so I'm freely I've got the white dude

00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:57,040
privileges it's a mixed bag to be honest

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:59,710
in some ways but I just turned 40 so

00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:02,890
like my life is a really bad time and

00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:03,460
dad jokes and I'm currently talking to

00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:06,130
you right now

00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:08,560
we're all stuck in the present moment in

00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:11,020
this really interesting way so if you

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,049
want to talk to me about that after the

00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:14,759
talk I'd be happy to but that's not what

00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:18,670
this is about

00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:20,590
so what is at stake why do i why do I

00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:25,450
care about Foss free to open source

00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:28,719
software distributed power someone asked

00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:30,490
a couple me like a year ago like what am

00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:33,249
I really like what's my good

00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:37,599
professional goal and it was to prepare

00:01:33,249 --> 00:01:42,749
ourselves for the singularity and I

00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:45,969
think Foss plays role in that in that

00:01:42,749 --> 00:01:50,770
it's it distributes power in a way that

00:01:45,969 --> 00:01:52,749
is really structurally important the

00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:54,009
freedom part of it is like a visceral

00:01:52,749 --> 00:01:58,149
thing for me

00:01:54,009 --> 00:02:00,360
I recently fixed my dryer hold the

00:01:58,149 --> 00:02:03,900
applause but it was pretty awesome

00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:07,530
but the belt broke and I went online and

00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:09,240
I saw tutorial if it wasn't not actually

00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,130
that hard but like imagine if you

00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,740
couldn't you weren't allowed to open

00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:18,810
your dryer like that's kind of what

00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:21,750
closed source code is like and so it's

00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:24,240
kind of like a visceral thing for me the

00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,820
con of the commons like we're all kind

00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,130
of working together as humans is

00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:33,000
something that open-source code speaks

00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:35,900
to and it's awesome how empowers

00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:41,400
contributors and empowers people

00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:45,030
empowers leaders to help us envision an

00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:48,990
open society why should government care

00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:52,350
about Foss yeah it's crazy to spend

00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:58,050
public funds on private code it's my

00:02:52,350 --> 00:03:01,890
favorite saying around that transparent

00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:04,310
seeing accountability and yeah I mean

00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:08,519
it's our it's that's it's our code and

00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:13,470
it is something that we should have

00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:15,870
access to a lot of the private companies

00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:18,300
create closed ecosystems around their

00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:21,260
data and their tooling that is pretty

00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:27,360
antithetical to the public good and

00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:32,040
that's problematic as well so I work in

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:37,040
open data primarily and wise Foss useful

00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:40,230
for open data that if the tools to

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:48,150
unlock the data are closed then the data

00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:49,620
isn't truly open we have created a

00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:52,440
resource called the open data open

00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:56,489
source of a data manifesto that is we're

00:03:52,440 --> 00:04:00,630
in a soft launch right now but kind of

00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:02,260
distills those beliefs and go check it

00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:04,450
out

00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:07,300
so what is not at stake there's been a

00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:13,180
lot of hanging I think in the Civic tech

00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:17,670
community around like are we not having

00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:20,410
the impact that we want to because like

00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:22,300
Civic tech and Foss aren't are not

00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:24,250
organizing I think it's useful to be

00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:28,030
honest about what it is and what it

00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:29,500
isn't so like I think this is what we're

00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:32,350
doing and I think it's super important

00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:34,140
when I told my mom about this talk she

00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:38,530
said that doesn't sound very sexy and

00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:42,550
it's not but I mean indoor plot like

00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:45,280
plumbing lake it's super important and I

00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:50,770
will scowl verse officially at anyone

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:52,840
that disagrees with that so it is but

00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:55,270
it's not or it's not social justice it's

00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:59,590
it's a different beast but it is super

00:04:55,270 --> 00:05:02,320
important so there was really

00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:05,860
interesting talk that Joe gave yesterday

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:10,270
about connecting people connecting with

00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:12,070
people that are using software and like

00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:14,880
it does it would open source matter to

00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:17,800
them so open source has to have

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,520
ultimately we want the tools to be

00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:24,670
better and I think that's part of the

00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:27,100
where the the goal for us needs to be I

00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:31,780
shared this because I'm trying to quit

00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:35,380
Facebook like everyone probably but so

00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:39,550
my dad died recently and someone shared

00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:42,340
something really personally powerful

00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:46,720
about my dad that I wouldn't have had if

00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:49,270
I wasn't on Facebook and so I want to

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,760
live in a world where I woke up I you

00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:53,670
know I wake up having an open source

00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:56,740
phone that doesn't have data that is

00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:58,630
controlled by Google and I want to

00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:04,150
interact with my lived environment with

00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:06,430
all these tools but as we build an

00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:10,919
envision ultimately people are using

00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:14,050
these and so the theory verse practices

00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:15,430
is important so who pays for all these

00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:19,060
open source

00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:26,040
tools that we think are important MVC's

00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:26,040
clients foundations governments etc and

00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:32,560
so weird how do we like how do we

00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:34,180
actually bring these things forward this

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,460
is kind of often what happens with

00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:41,230
open-source so we have you know client a

00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:43,630
client B they have their feature set

00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:48,910
some of it overlaps with maybe something

00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:51,280
that's a little bigger so similarly here

00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:54,760
these features you know maybe aren't

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:59,980
useful for for this kind of core open

00:06:54,760 --> 00:07:03,190
source thing so what if like when is the

00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:05,890
right time to actually contribute back

00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:09,970
like is that is that a bad thing right

00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:11,830
there if you're mostly using just

00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:16,990
extensions and configuration and you're

00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:18,660
not contributing back it has to be about

00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:23,980
values so that's something that really

00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:25,570
just depends on the project so I what is

00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:28,570
the value proposition of clients for

00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:33,400
free and open source software I left

00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:36,370
this I left this blank on purpose so I'm

00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:38,830
gonna ask the crowd does anyone why

00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:41,530
should i vet why should a client want to

00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:43,890
use free and open source software does

00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,890
anyone

00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:49,660
these are the companies they love a lot

00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:51,250
of business you can't tell anyone so

00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,140
just to repeat for the recording

00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:55,990
proprietary software vendor lock and

00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:59,040
prepare tape software can God business

00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:01,300
and then you're screwed any any other

00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:09,580
reasons why for you know from source

00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:11,410
software is important for clients yeah

00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:14,710
better support actually uh

00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:17,770
arrow is on the Pacific actions team who

00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:24,400
does support and I think he does better

00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:27,250
support than anyone else I know so so

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,500
there's a lot of value in a free and

00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:32,050
open source software why do we want why

00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,340
why would clients actually want to

00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:40,719
contribute to free and open source

00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:43,479
software does anyone to ensure

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,120
continuity great any other reasons it's

00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:47,530
broken it makes me angry

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,030
the visceral one it's broken it makes me

00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:53,010
angry

00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:56,020
anything else build in-house skills oh

00:08:53,010 --> 00:09:02,260
yeah that one of the my favorite stories

00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:05,470
about deacon is that we created a portal

00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:10,930
for jamaica and hosted it and did all

00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:14,250
the work and last fall they basically

00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:18,370
took it over and are now hiring people

00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:21,130
now have people in jamaica running the

00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:23,620
servers running like doing it fully so

00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:25,210
that's another you know potential value

00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:27,580
is that for governments especially is

00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:32,020
that instead of having those jobs out in

00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:37,510
Silicon Valley having them in like VC

00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:41,980
funded kind of structurally hierarchical

00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:44,650
places there's people in Jamaica that

00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:50,700
have got the training have and have

00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:54,250
taken over the tool so one one big value

00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:55,480
proposition for clients to contribute to

00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:59,400
Foss and I think this is maybe the

00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,400
biggest one that I would argue or

00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:05,260
propose when talking to clients is that

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:11,350
owning features is expensive you don't

00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:14,200
want to their you you don't want to yeah

00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:15,820
own a certain feature because there's no

00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:20,280
public documentation for it there's no

00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:24,250
public upgrade path you're forking and

00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:25,900
that's that's really expensive you know

00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:29,560
it keeps the Nerds happy I mean is that

00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:36,130
is that kind of what we're saying as

00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:39,370
well so in terms of talking to and

00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:44,290
convincing clients to adopt open-source

00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:45,790
there's a whole there's the whole the

00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:52,300
whole team the whole team needs to be

00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:56,470
involved in it it can't just be it can't

00:10:52,300 --> 00:11:00,160
just be these folks so let's let's look

00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:02,110
at that kind of cycle in some ways the

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,560
community is kind of like the first

00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:09,730
place that those kind of that those

00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:12,340
discussions are had and then sales and

00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:13,750
marketing is a bigger channel then once

00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:15,640
you've got a client that you're gonna

00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:18,010
onboard them then you have the advil

00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:21,040
kind of process hopefully you're making

00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:27,130
big feet awesome features and hopefully

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:32,260
you're having a much bigger impact so

00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:34,540
community here we are we can all you

00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:36,790
know pat ourselves on the back but are

00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:38,290
we in the right communities or do we

00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:40,860
know what the client communities are do

00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:43,810
we know what the user communities are

00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:48,040
and the idea of community itself like

00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:50,470
all the much of the engines that the

00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:54,340
features and and software that we are

00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:56,250
interested in requires a community and a

00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:58,900
community is something that is not

00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:02,960
there's not like a direct funding model

00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:09,080
for so that's a tension that

00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:11,089
is hard to resolve so in terms of sales

00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,560
and marketing it's important to talk

00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:17,660
about free and open source software

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:21,830
right so this is civic actions calm but

00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:23,839
before the talk I was gonna kind of show

00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:25,220
like okay you know here's how we're

00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:32,870
talking about free and open source

00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:35,990
software and um that's the are you even

00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:42,020
talking about open source so I was like

00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:47,320
oh man so that's the control F we're not

00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:50,930
even mentioning up a source coupe uh

00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:52,820
and additionally so the next step I

00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:54,440
didn't capture that but I clicked we

00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,300
have a D can and open data page that we

00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,070
haven't updated in probably a year and a

00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,930
half

00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:04,339
similar probably marketing story we are

00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:06,470
working on updating this I promise but I

00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:11,029
was like okay I could certainly Deek an

00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:12,950
hour open source catalog says open

00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:13,670
source it was the same thing we didn't

00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:19,339
even mention it

00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:23,870
ouch our our so source code is for the

00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:25,730
site it's in Gatsby markdown so at least

00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:27,830
we've mentioned open source in 35 places

00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:30,470
but most of them are either interviews

00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:33,230
or if you scroll down like everyone's

00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:36,529
bio says open source so it's interesting

00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:43,310
like and it's that's something that we

00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:45,290
value and try and make sure that we

00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:50,779
trick we do communicate that to clients

00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:52,370
but oops so the first step of once you

00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:55,160
want once we're past the sales and

00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:58,180
marketing so this is my reaction to to

00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,180
lawyer stuff

00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:04,250
but like it's super critical are you

00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:08,690
allowed to actually are even allowed to

00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:12,110
contribute like you need that bare

00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:15,440
minimum this this is our lawyer he's

00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:18,290
he's amazing his name is Mark Jones he

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:21,500
was super stressed about me having only

00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:23,810
one slide about this he he gives he

00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:27,170
gives like two week in depth primers

00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:28,880
about or trainings about open source

00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:30,440
license licensing but if you're

00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,890
interested in exploring a little bit

00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:36,530
more this is maybe the best place to

00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:39,140
start I'm not sure who this is but he's

00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:41,090
talking to our security or our chopped

00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:47,690
security person so that's even more

00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:51,140
scary lawyers and security people so

00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:54,550
okay we've got the we've we've passed

00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:57,470
that gate we've got the right license

00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:59,540
now we're actually starting the work you

00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:03,010
know you we have that that that first

00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:05,930
that first client meeting where you're

00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:07,340
where if it's a great relationship you

00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:11,180
think back looks like your first date

00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:13,370
you know everyone is happy and but are

00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:15,350
you actually talking about open source

00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:19,040
contribution from the beginning of the

00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:23,990
project so surely you're talking about

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:25,760
Foss at that point right but how do you

00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:28,610
even talk about that like what what are

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:32,600
the the what are your goals and your

00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:34,310
KPIs key performance indicators can you

00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,860
measure what your open source

00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:40,430
contribution can be like can we have

00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:45,530
like a linter that says okay you know of

00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:49,790
the amount of code that we created we

00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:52,070
are publishing 10% or 20% like with that

00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:55,220
would that even be useful I mean I think

00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:56,840
the biggest thing is is is features like

00:15:55,220 --> 00:16:01,910
what features are you building and are

00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:07,120
you contributing those back to where you

00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:07,120
started so typically

00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:18,290
there's this difference between like a

00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:20,240
configuration and and and actually

00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,930
feature building so if you're working on

00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,820
WordPress

00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:24,440
I like a wordpress site and you actually

00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:26,240
contribute something back like WordPress

00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:28,040
core or like a new theme or something

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,470
like that's amazing

00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:33,890
because it's such a big project like if

00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:38,030
you're using something that's newer that

00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:41,930
contribution maybe should be bigger or

00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:44,150
if you're trying something if it's kind

00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:46,160
of a greenfield project like maybe the

00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:48,350
whole thing should be an open-source I

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,570
have the frictionless data stuff here

00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:53,000
because I'm super excited about that and

00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:59,050
I'm hoping that people are going to

00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:01,760
contribute that more so like how do we

00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:04,040
oK we've we've gotten past that first

00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:06,380
meeting we've gotten the client

00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:08,690
convinced that ok X feature we're gonna

00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:10,700
work output source we can either like as

00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:13,310
a new project or we're gonna contribute

00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:17,630
it back how do we actually get that into

00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:20,480
the the project so this is my this is my

00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:23,630
new kind of big thing like or this is my

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:28,610
thesis maybe is that personas are way of

00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:35,600
injecting the open source user stories

00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:37,700
into the project so here's to kind of

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,230
open source personas for us and adopter

00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:41,540
like what do they want in terms of

00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:43,040
features like what's their experience

00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:47,630
and how can you actually build that

00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:51,320
create user stories in the agile in the

00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:54,140
agile atom so that agile is Adam is like

00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:57,320
the the place where all this work

00:17:54,140 --> 00:18:00,140
happens and we have the technology we

00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:04,610
can inject user stories directly into

00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:08,510
backlogs around this so as an open data

00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:12,050
adopter I want a new XYZ that's one

00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:15,950
strategy that I've started working on

00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:17,510
another is to like within agile the day

00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:19,400
after the sprint is over

00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:20,830
maybe those are like a day or two of

00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:24,690
clean up

00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:33,120
so yeah these are some strategies around

00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:33,120
that kind of that kind of contribution

00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:47,800
so yeah that's a good stopping point I

00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:52,240
think does anyone have any questions or

00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:55,090
discussion topics okay also just the mic

00:18:52,240 --> 00:19:02,770
is working but it's recording that's not

00:18:55,090 --> 00:19:05,080
things like so like when you're like

00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:08,680
creating like open source software like

00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:10,720
some users are great but like you might

00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:12,400
get like a small minority of users who

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,080
like why didn't you answer my email

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,150
within the hour so I was wondering if

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,370
you had any like tips or guidelines

00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:24,070
about like setting expectations about

00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:25,870
the project yeah I mean that there's a

00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:28,510
like it could be you could give a whole

00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:31,690
there's a whole kind of area of right

00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:34,480
community building that you need to try

00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:38,350
and figure out how to to allocate for

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,550
and manage and like hopefully it's like

00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,630
a little bit of a chicken and egg thing

00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:42,700
like hopefully you can have enough

00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:48,730
clients where you can devote the time to

00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:53,130
that and yeah within the within kind of

00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:57,130
like the the program of your your work

00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:58,540
allocating for that is is important but

00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:00,340
it's hard because those are the that's

00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:02,950
another reason that like the personas

00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:04,990
idea is important to me because like

00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:08,040
those aren't your paying clients and so

00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:10,840
they just like it like it's hard to

00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:14,670
address that through a lot of the kind

00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:14,670
of agile processes that we have

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:29,410
I can I can describe an experience that

00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:32,290
I've had on open data projects designed

00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:35,650
to outlive a company and then get a

00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:38,710
company to pay the development of the

00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:40,000
data and then if the data goes or if the

00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:43,120
company goes away you can keep working

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,800
on it in future projects this is what

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:48,040
Maps is done minutes you see new things

00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:49,720
to do with other companies not so much a

00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:54,010
question ya know it's I mean it's

00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:56,110
exciting because yeah the project is

00:20:54,010 --> 00:21:00,610
bigger than the company that's actually

00:20:56,110 --> 00:21:02,920
what happened with with D can and so you

00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:06,220
can't exists outside of the specific

00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:08,530
company and it's awesome because you can

00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:10,870
keep working on things that are

00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:13,450
interesting to you outside of like

00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:17,200
whoever you're going to quote whatever

00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:19,860
the structure is that engenders

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,860
paychecks

00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:30,960
do you find that in your experience

00:21:28,649 --> 00:21:33,210
anyone actually buys like the moral

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,590
imperatives for companies to contribute

00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:36,690
to open source so I'm thinking

00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:39,330
specifically of folks who like our

00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:41,130
companies that are really into using

00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:44,039
open source but basically don't

00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:46,080
contribute back money or labor to it so

00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:47,850
in your experience has anyone actually

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,220
been like yeah it's the right thing to

00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:52,880
do and not have to make all of these

00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:55,320
sort of marketing value propositions

00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,360
yeah I mean I think I think what a hard

00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:59,490
things is that a lot of people think it

00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:03,570
is the right thing to do but then if

00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:08,610
it's not articulated why and how then it

00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:11,250
it it just creates like like who's

00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:13,919
actually going to do it is a problem

00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:15,210
like we have a yeah there's a I've had

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,039
experience with a bunch of clients that

00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:19,559
are like yeah open source we're totally

00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,490
into it but then like you're like okay

00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:21,840
well this feature is going to take

00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:24,240
longer because we're going to contribute

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:27,779
it back and they're like well but we

00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:32,010
need that fee like like but we're

00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:35,250
launching soon so I do you know like the

00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:39,019
moral argument ever work I think it does

00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:43,440
I mean I think it does but ultimately

00:22:39,019 --> 00:22:45,779
it's like it it shouldn't we shouldn't

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,500
rely on the moral argument like because

00:22:45,779 --> 00:22:56,510
it does produce better value for people

00:22:48,500 --> 00:23:00,799
if it's done right okay thanks

00:22:56,510 --> 00:23:00,799
