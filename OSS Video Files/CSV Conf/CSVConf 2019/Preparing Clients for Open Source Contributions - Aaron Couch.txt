Description: 
	At CivicActions we've developed a number of methodologies to help enable our clients to be a part of the open source community.This talk will focus on a number of those strategies including capture management, project roles and tools, and reporting measures. This talk will be slightly shorter to allow for time for a more collaborative discussion.
