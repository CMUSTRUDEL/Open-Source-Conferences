Publication date: 2019-05-19
Playlist: CSVConf 2019
Description: 
	I will discuss ADR's project aimed at creating a database mapping out, literally, where each and every significant item in a country's military is. Tanks, planes, barracks and the like are being categorised and placed in our custom-made "Athena" database. Aimed at pulling open the lid on arms flows into Africa, Athena is suited for journalists and those in the humanitarian or academic field alike working in anti-corruption and transparency as it pertains to defence and military affairs.
