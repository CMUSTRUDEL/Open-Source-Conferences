Title: Project Athena: Mapping African Militaries for Good - John Stupart
Publication date: 2019-05-19
Playlist: CSVConf 2019
Description: 
	I will discuss ADR's project aimed at creating a database mapping out, literally, where each and every significant item in a country's military is. Tanks, planes, barracks and the like are being categorised and placed in our custom-made "Athena" database. Aimed at pulling open the lid on arms flows into Africa, Athena is suited for journalists and those in the humanitarian or academic field alike working in anti-corruption and transparency as it pertains to defence and military affairs.

	00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,979
thank you everyone for attending my talk

00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,660
I thought I was gonna have to fly 34

00:00:04,979 --> 00:00:08,520
hours and have nobody sort of sit here

00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,380
and that would have been you know sort

00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:13,530
of mostly tragic for me and maybe a

00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:16,800
little bit sad so my name is John I'm

00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:18,330
gonna be talking about our latest

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,420
project project Athena where we're

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:23,580
looking to sort of blow up in the lid on

00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:25,170
defense sort of information defense and

00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,940
military information particularly with

00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,859
the focus in Africa because you know

00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,600
we're all African defence review all

00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:32,969
four of us or sort of all five of us

00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,499
involved with it are Africans and it's

00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:38,370
our sort of wheelhouse and our sort of

00:00:34,499 --> 00:00:40,769
sort of area of expertise we do sort of

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,420
leverage a other team of researchers but

00:00:40,769 --> 00:00:45,389
for all intents and purposes it's the

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,219
five of us I should say having seen and

00:00:45,389 --> 00:00:50,069
attended some of these talks now I am a

00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:51,479
journalist first and foremost so then

00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:53,579
you know I'm not a developer they

00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:55,159
actually two of my my colleagues are my

00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,629
brother and the other director actually

00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:59,489
the the developers who have developed

00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:01,049
the platform and dashboard that we were

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:02,010
working on hopefully I can answer some

00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:05,489
of your questions if you have questions

00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:07,140
about the software itself but if I sound

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:09,090
like an idiot about that when I do give

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,540
the answers just know that's coming from

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:15,660
a place of complete and utter ignorance

00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:18,450
so what am I doing with all this we're

00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:20,580
attempting to create a dashboard that's

00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:23,430
going to create a layer of transparency

00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:26,250
in African defense sector there's very

00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,990
little transparency in the sector at the

00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,610
best of times I mean those of you who

00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,860
work we even sort of you know

00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,840
tangentially sort of relates it all sort

00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,130
of interested in defence affairs even in

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,810
the United States there's a lot of

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,570
secrecy over this and it's even more so

00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,400
and compounded so in Africa the defense

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,590
sectors the least open worldwide and

00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,200
Africa is the least open of that least

00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:49,620
open sector you know there and that

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:52,890
creates a massive massive sort of fog of

00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:54,720
war if you will on terms of in sort of a

00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,770
lack of information a creation of

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,580
secrecy and that's a sort of

00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:00,990
vulnerability to corruption to arms

00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:04,080
proliferation and sort of illegal

00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:06,210
trafficking so we're essentially trying

00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,800
to break open that lid on defence there

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:11,280
and make it open make an open source

00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:13,530
platform we can sort of look at who is

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,380
selling what to whom and where are these

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,120
arms go

00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:20,410
those are two the sort of fundamental

00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:22,240
questions the consequences of this of

00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:24,430
not doing this I should say are pretty

00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,890
obvious I mean the the inability to

00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:29,980
accurately measure or catalog or or sort

00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:32,020
of find this information can essentially

00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:33,580
be measured in human lives which I'll

00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,250
sort of beginning touching a little bit

00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:37,780
as I go just a little brief content

00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,310
warning in case you hadn't noticed we're

00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:42,210
doing defense stuff here it's gonna be

00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:44,440
images of war zones of conflict hardship

00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:46,000
you know there will be some military

00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,650
equipment guns and tanks and things like

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,450
that

00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,700
nothing graphic we had in terms of sort

00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:54,460
of graphical Gertrude's as violence but

00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:58,120
just just a sort of heads up as we go so

00:02:54,460 --> 00:03:00,880
I'll just start right here this right

00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,380
here is a tank but it's a specific tank

00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,380
as you can see in the top left it's a

00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:07,000
Vickers mark one main battle tank and it

00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,580
was produced in the United Kingdom by

00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:15,100
BAE Land Systems way back when in the

00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:17,380
1980s Nigeria for 36 of these in 1981 at

00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:19,630
a price in sort of today's dollars of

00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:22,930
nine million per per tank not a bad

00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:26,590
price but a 36 of these were bought back

00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:28,360
then and this has a major significance

00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:30,610
I'm gonna use the tank as a vehicle

00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,630
excuse the pun of transporting you

00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,090
through how we're going to develop

00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:36,310
project Athena because this tank

00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:39,460
actually is essentially the the sort of

00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:41,770
the main way that we can have explained

00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:44,500
what we had ADR are going to do or are

00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:45,910
doing I should say so how am I going to

00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,440
do this we've got this tanker we're

00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:49,930
going to sort of talk about it in two

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,300
major silos okay the first we're going

00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:53,980
to talk about the sort of minesweeper

00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:56,740
approach those of you played minesweeper

00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:58,180
back in the day will still do will know

00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:00,459
what I'm talking about those of you who

00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,560
don't we'll get there don't worry and

00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:04,150
that will relate to the sort of state

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,880
centric side of the defense research

00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:09,459
we're doing and then we have the scratch

00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,690
patch side of things which I'm very

00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:12,220
curious to see if any of you know what a

00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:15,250
scratch patch actually is but again

00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:17,140
we'll get there as we go and then

00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,880
finally I'll look at the actual tech of

00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:20,440
what we're doing and how all this

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,840
information is going to be sort of

00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,760
placed into something that can slice and

00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,630
dice this information into a useful and

00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,550
coherent fashion

00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:30,650
for for pretty much anybody who's

00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:32,090
interested mostly we're aiming this at

00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:35,030
journalists at humanitarian

00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:37,520
organizations who would or should or

00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:39,140
need to know about these kinds of risks

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,570
in terms of the areas of where they're

00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:44,960
going in terms of corruption risks and

00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:47,210
so on so that's what we're gonna do so

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,010
with this Vickers Mach one main battle

00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:51,350
tank on the left hand side here we've

00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:53,830
got the the nice sort of shiny version

00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:55,970
of it in the Nigerian Army's warehouse

00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:58,850
those are obviously just what have we

00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:01,070
got there we've got four of the 36

00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:03,760
sitting in their warehouse what we have

00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:07,190
on the right is exactly the same tank

00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:09,890
but it's this is a photo captured sort

00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:11,900
of who's been recaptured from Boko Haram

00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:14,750
insurgents or terrorists depending on

00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:17,870
your politics in northeastern Nigeria

00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:19,940
this tank was purchased legally from BAE

00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:21,740
Land Systems in the United Kingdom and

00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:24,830
you know for all intents and purposes

00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:27,080
was purchased with a completely open and

00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:29,450
transparent defense deal and then wound

00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:32,030
up in the hands of what is now the most

00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:34,430
violent terrorist organization worldwide

00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:35,840
they have forget about Isis Boko Haram

00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:37,310
has killed more people in the world

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,860
there's a terrorist group than anybody

00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:41,570
else and that's kind of an alarming

00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:43,820
thing when you think about the fact that

00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:46,040
nobody at least on Twitter when we found

00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:48,680
this picture actually knew what on earth

00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:51,050
this thing was in terms of what the tank

00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,640
was or where it comes from so

00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:55,100
immediately you start to see that there

00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,690
is this lack of sort of real specific

00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,460
information about this and obviously

00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:00,260
I've seen this in the journalistic

00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:02,150
sphere as well people will see a tank

00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:05,030
and they don't actually understand what

00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:06,740
specific tank that is and it's not just

00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:08,690
a question of noting out on the sort of

00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,370
technical details especially if you know

00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:13,520
if you're an engineer you love that kind

00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:16,070
of stuff I suppose it's important it's

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:19,810
important to know what the details is oh

00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:22,940
our in terms of that that sort of tank

00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:25,100
so that tank even an old tank even a

00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,750
tank that was purchased 30 years ago by

00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,010
the Nigerian Army and completely

00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,260
aboveboard

00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:32,360
can still become a problem in the modern

00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:34,669
sort of security environment say

00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:37,640
Northeast Nigeria northeastern Nigeria

00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:39,110
if it falls into enemy hands it has 105

00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,180
millimeter cannon

00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:43,490
it has been used in propaganda videos by

00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:46,370
Boko Haram as sort of firing said cannon

00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:47,540
you know and that's that's an alarming

00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:50,150
thing when you have a terrorist

00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:52,430
organization or a militant group using a

00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:55,190
tank anytime you have a non-state actor

00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:56,780
using a tank that's quite alarming so to

00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:59,570
take this back to the two silo approach

00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:02,180
what I'm going to talk about is how this

00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:03,440
relates firstly to the stateside on the

00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:06,200
on the left-hand side and in the

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,930
non-state side in the Boko Haram example

00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:11,740
that there on the on the left so

00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:14,419
minesweeper project Athena and

00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:16,910
minesweeper is how we're going to make

00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:19,400
African military or African Department

00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:21,440
of Defense organizations

00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,180
somewhat accountable or at least

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,130
somewhat transparent whether or not they

00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:26,630
like it it doesn't matter and the same

00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:28,880
for sort of some of those global arms

00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:31,640
importers or exporters providing those

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,710
sort of systems okay

00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,960
the minesweeper approach is kind of what

00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:38,930
we're basing this on because a lot of

00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:41,360
this information is if it's not easily

00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:42,590
available it's just really really tricky

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,690
to find that's not to say it's

00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:47,990
impossible but it is just really really

00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:51,020
difficult to find accurate data on what

00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:53,150
sort of what tanks or what rifles or

00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:55,700
what bombs are being purchased by what

00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:59,780
states and when and more importantly for

00:07:55,700 --> 00:08:02,090
how much okay so what we trying to do is

00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:05,419
gather that research and gather that

00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:08,750
data you know just by sort of you know

00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:10,729
steady diligent patient research we all

00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:13,160
have at ADR we have an expertise in

00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:15,830
actually doing this for us since back in

00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:18,490
the day for the sort of dark side of you

00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:20,810
know sort of for for-profit

00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:23,450
consultancies so we have an idea of how

00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:26,240
to find these procurement sort of lists

00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:28,280
tender documents you know sort of open

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,110
source news coverage and things like

00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,970
that there is another database the Supre

00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,680
database which is a useful sort of

00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:36,169
bottom waterboard sort of lower

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:39,169
watermark that we can use which provides

00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:41,060
some export data for defense things but

00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:42,740
not all of it that tank that I mentioned

00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:44,810
for example is listed in the sip read a

00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:47,780
debase but it's not listed as a mock one

00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:49,459
Vickers mark one Eagle main battle tank

00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:52,400
it's just listed as a main battle tank

00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:53,779
exports of to Nigeria in 1981

00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,730
so now we have to sort of make that

00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:57,400
research link between okay it's a main

00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:59,540
battle tank but is it the one we want

00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:01,730
that's just an idea of how we're trying

00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:03,529
to do that so we're you know to take it

00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:06,770
back to minesweeper we're never quite

00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:08,779
going to get exactly the mine that we

00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:10,940
want but we're hoping through project

00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:13,300
Athena on the state side of things to

00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:15,650
eliminate as many of these gray boxes of

00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:18,279
sort of confusion or of lack of

00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:21,380
transparency on their procurement side

00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:24,050
in order to give you as the researcher

00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:27,680
or citizen journalist or humanitarian

00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:29,660
organization a better idea of what's

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,790
going on in terms of their sort of

00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:34,460
defense procurement space okay

00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:35,870
so what are the flags how do we know

00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,339
that there's a flag there you know

00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:39,080
what's a corruption risk because

00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:41,330
obviously all militaries buy equipment

00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:43,760
you know we're at ADR we're not we're

00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:45,710
not pacifists we we do understand that

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,779
states are going to buy tanks they're

00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:50,420
going to buy aircraft these things are

00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:52,760
going to happen so what is what what's

00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:54,320
the big deal so how to raise those flags

00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,820
is when you start to look at the sort of

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,279
things such as for example under

00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:00,800
spending or over spending you know did

00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:04,790
that tank cost too much did it cost too

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,470
little did it arrive way way later then

00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:08,510
it actually was sort of supposed to

00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:11,779
arrive all of these things are markers

00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:14,089
that we use to indicate possible risks

00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:15,920
in terms of malfeasance in terms of

00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:18,800
misconduct and in terms of potential

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,470
corruption where the project Athena sort

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,930
of purpose is not to say this is a

00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:26,150
corrupt deal but it's to create those

00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:27,860
sort of things around which you can sort

00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:29,900
of start to raise the flag as a research

00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,640
and say this might be corrupt and let's

00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,140
look into it further and we're providing

00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:37,070
that sort of springboard that you can

00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:39,529
actually look for okay so that's an

00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:40,790
essential that the Mine Sweeper sort of

00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:42,709
things I'm really blitzing through this

00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:45,040
but we're going to get there here's the

00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:47,779
fun part who knows what the hell this is

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,040
this is a scratch patch does anyone know

00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:51,010
what it raises a show of hands does

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,360
anybody know what a scratch patch is oh

00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:55,850
thank you there's one thank goodness I

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,740
used to think everybody knew what a

00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:59,540
scratch patch was but it turns out this

00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:02,450
is just a sort of artifact of my own

00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:05,190
childhood memory a scratch patch is

00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:07,620
basically a giant

00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:10,110
a playground if you will for people to

00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:12,630
go into a sort of bed of semi-precious

00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:14,130
stones and you get a bucket you pay sort

00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:16,140
of how to forget about what the price

00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:17,520
was and you get to sort of literally

00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,530
scratch around and pick the stones you

00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,150
want and sort of put them in your

00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:23,160
buckets and now you've got your sort of

00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:24,660
what you eglise think are precious

00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,190
stones they're not precious they're

00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:28,260
basically worthless but you're picking

00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:30,630
you're picking what you think is sort of

00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:32,340
precious to you you then take it home

00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:33,540
and then annoy your parents forever by

00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:36,270
sort of leaving these things under the

00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:38,040
sides of couches and that when we were

00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:41,070
discussing how do we start looking at

00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:43,050
the sort of Boko Haram tank tank side of

00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:45,240
things how do we look at weapons that

00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:47,400
are not catalogued or not announced

00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,500
through an arm sort of an arms deal or a

00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,630
procurement deal how do we start to sort

00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,160
of look at that and this is how we

00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:54,510
started to visualize things in terms of

00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,860
a scratch patch and then sort of ran

00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:57,810
into difficulties explaining that to

00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:59,460
anyone who wasn't sort of a sort of

00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:01,890
child in sort of apartheid South Africa

00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:03,780
is a white South African with access to

00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:05,610
the scratch patch nobody else knew what

00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:07,140
the hell we were talking about but now

00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:09,900
that you know you're part of it so

00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:13,110
welcome you'll never be able to unsee

00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:15,240
this what the scratch patch essentially

00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:19,200
is is we're going to be cataloguing and

00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:22,050
gathering as much possible data that can

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,000
be found social media sort of you know

00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:25,740
by sort of we do sometimes get supports

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,720
and submissions of what you can see

00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:31,140
how's weapons and and arms and

00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:33,080
explosives from captured stockpiles you

00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:35,730
know often on social media you'll see

00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:38,040
militant groups and rebel organizations

00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:40,050
themselves post almost as a sort of form

00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,790
of propaganda the the various weapons

00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:45,600
they're using and those are very very

00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:46,830
good telltale signs for what what

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,750
weapons are being used and more

00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:50,310
importantly where they came from but

00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:52,290
this is just the tip of the spear what

00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:54,120
we're trying to do with ADR is we're

00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:55,770
actually sort of planning almost as a

00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,589
bit of a prototype or it is a prototype

00:12:55,770 --> 00:13:00,930
is to go to the DRC ourselves we're

00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:02,670
sending to researchers in country with

00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:05,760
the blessing and sort of embed of the

00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:06,960
the UN peacekeeping forces there within

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,510
a bed with the South African military

00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,650
and we're going to be stuck or not

00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:13,589
stockpiling but we're going to be

00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:15,330
cataloguing armed sort of arms that have

00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:17,670
been captured or sort of recovered from

00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:18,420
armed groups and sort of started

00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:20,220
cataloging

00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:22,139
terms of what are these weapon types

00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,750
what are the serial numbers in the

00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:26,070
barrels and the receivers and so to

00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,720
start looking the ammunition types

00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:29,579
looking the little stamped sort of

00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,800
serial numbers and that the reason being

00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:33,779
is if you have a serial number you have

00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:36,269
an idea of where this thing was produced

00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:39,300
and you can start to actually track and

00:13:36,269 --> 00:13:41,310
trace just where these weapons sort of

00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:43,949
came from and more importantly now how

00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:47,040
they've wound up in sort of a sort of

00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:48,540
non-state actors hands providing you

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,980
know I talked to initially about sort of

00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,959
peeling the lid open on defense

00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:53,610
transparency we do that on the state

00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:55,769
side but defense perfect procurement

00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:58,440
data this is how we peel it back from

00:13:55,769 --> 00:14:00,570
the other side by cataloguing this data

00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,190
so we're making this open source we're

00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:04,769
going to sort of open it up in terms of

00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:07,170
crowd sourcing trying to figure out you

00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:08,610
know if the Internet can help us those

00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:12,240
of you have aware of bailing cats a

00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:14,430
major sort of oesn't research group have

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,190
done this to great success in sort of

00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:18,540
Syria and the Ukraine as well so we're

00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:21,930
kind of hoping to do something similar

00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:23,640
for sub-saharan Africa and North Africa

00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:25,290
if we can get enough information on it

00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:27,779
so now very briefly in the space of

00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:29,250
about a minute the tick which is

00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:31,560
probably what a lot of you are mostly

00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:33,589
interested in this is just a screenshot

00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,970
from the scratch patch side of things

00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:38,910
where we're looking at sort of trying to

00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:40,980
map and catalog weapon instances and

00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:43,350
sort of objects as and when and how we

00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,579
gave sort of gained them obviously when

00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,860
we go to the DRC we're going to have a

00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:48,089
big sort of even deeper red color there

00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,640
once we've got a whole bunch of

00:14:48,089 --> 00:14:53,910
information there but we're trying to

00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:56,190
essentially create this searchable index

00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:58,529
for researchers to basically say I want

00:14:56,190 --> 00:15:00,839
to know how many Chinese a que pattern

00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:04,199
assault rifles for example have been

00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:06,329
sighted in central Africa that

00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:08,220
information doesn't exist it just does

00:15:06,329 --> 00:15:10,019
not exist not in any coherent sort of

00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:12,260
way so we're trying to actually create

00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:14,670
that coherent sort of pattern about it

00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,959
the these sort of details about it the

00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:18,440
sort of stack obviously our database

00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:20,880
will be built we're using a thing called

00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:23,040
elasticsearch I think which uses

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,500
archival and logging information which

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,910
is kind of its speciality so that's

00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,199
going to be a sort of a big help with

00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:29,790
the stuff especially with the

00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:31,590
procurement data because that's

00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:34,050
literally just logging and

00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:37,440
archiving documents and then using

00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:40,050
cabanas the the visualization tool from

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,900
that so yeah that's pretty much in a

00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:45,540
very very quick sort of nutshell what

00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:48,270
we're doing with project Athena you know

00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:50,490
and again hopefully you guys have got

00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:52,080
some questions about all of that stuff

00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,410
because I'd love to talk about it some

00:15:52,080 --> 00:16:01,880
more

00:15:52,410 --> 00:16:01,880
thank you I saw

00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:14,269
thank you I was wondering if you have

00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:21,300
any pushback from the government for

00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:25,170
everything better yes the yes is the

00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:27,510
answer to where's it going here we go

00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:28,649
this little thing this isn't just

00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:30,510
something we found in the Internet this

00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:32,519
is from a previous project we did where

00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:35,389
we sent journalists to South Sudan to

00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:38,579
uncover reports of human engineer or

00:16:35,389 --> 00:16:41,880
repopulation or human engineering by the

00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:43,920
South Sudanese government it's if you

00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,720
sort of just google South Sudan African

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,579
Defence so it's on our website pretty

00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,260
good story I think you should all read

00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:51,089
it it's great but anyway the point being

00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:53,639
is we had hundreds of gigs of footage

00:16:51,089 --> 00:16:55,380
and data and research in a country where

00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:59,430
it's illegal to photograph military

00:16:55,380 --> 00:17:01,680
personnel it's risky but at the same

00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:04,740
time we encrypted the data we kept sort

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,959
of USB sticks in our socks and you just

00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:09,030
sort of you you take that risk with

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,500
something like the DRC there's less of a

00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:12,390
risk because we're kind of doing it at

00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,839
the sort of invitation of the United

00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:17,280
Nations so that that does help a lot

00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:18,929
we're not expecting the Nigerian

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,689
military for example to be friends with

00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:22,949
us you know if we uncover Nigerian sort

00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:25,470
of procurement know you know talking

00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:27,059
about that tank for example weirdly

00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:29,640
we're doing this you know we're also

00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:31,260
focusing on South Africa as a case study

00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,240
as well for this because Africa is not

00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:34,860
you know despite oh you know South

00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,510
Africans consider themselves the Texans

00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:38,580
of Africa we think we're the biggest

00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:40,260
thing there and everything everything

00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:42,179
else kind of pales in significance we're

00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:45,510
kind of like the narcissists of of the

00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:46,830
world but we're taking a look at South

00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:49,710
Africa because we're not immune to

00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:51,030
defense corruption either and we were

00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:52,679
sort of looking at that and weirdly we

00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:54,419
have got a bit of cooperation actually

00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:56,490
with the South African military nothing

00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:59,790
official but but certainly there's

00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:02,220
there's no pushback we do expect that to

00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:06,020
kind of change as we go into other other

00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:06,020
areas here sorry

00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:11,290
you just mentioned that you project

00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:12,880
eclis no reasons flags would not be

00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:15,820
since and corruption they didn't mention

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:18,430
that you know you check to see what say

00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:20,020
the price was so what you know how the

00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:22,120
arms are sold in like them so just

00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:25,900
curious if you're like how do you how

00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:30,970
does the project know that so you will

00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:33,520
often find that I'm just trying to think

00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:35,920
of a good example but something like a

00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,570
an aircraft for example I'm thinking of

00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:40,840
a recent thing we worked on in Angola

00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:45,220
where Angola purchased I think it was

00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:46,930
seven su-30 two flankers something like

00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,420
that for the princely sum of a billion

00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:51,010
dollars which is way too much for that

00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:54,430
thing the Jets were obsolete and all

00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:56,200
that a gola boasted about that they

00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:57,910
literally sort of were quite happy to

00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,740
say hey we're spending a billion dollars

00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:01,600
on arms because for them it was a way of

00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:02,980
projecting military power

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,540
hey we're spending all this money and

00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:06,490
military means we're serious about it

00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:09,100
otherwise as often defense companies

00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:11,890
themselves will advertise it in the case

00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:14,530
of that tank for example and BAE Land

00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:17,170
Systems the producer is obliged by their

00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:19,270
country's export law to announce their

00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:21,820
their export destination and how much

00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:24,940
they're paying for it that's not always

00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:26,800
the case particularly in sort of Russian

00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:29,200
exporters and Chinese exports as you

00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:32,290
often find that data is just way more

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,580
difficult to find and in that case that

00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:35,920
we kind of have to go a little bit

00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:37,570
further there's often local blogs where

00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,340
we have to go and use Google Translate

00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:41,380
to figure out what Russian or Chinese is

00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:43,900
for this amount of money for this thing

00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:46,060
and it's not perfect it's not accurate

00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:48,570
but it's it's it's better than nothing

00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:51,490
and then we need to sort of extrapolate

00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:53,830
to the market cost for that class of

00:19:51,490 --> 00:20:02,260
weapon which is generally quite well

00:19:53,830 --> 00:20:04,030
known within the defense industry there

00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:06,280
are people there is the the five of us

00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:07,660
and we have a network of researchers

00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:10,810
that we're using because it's it's

00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:12,490
incredibly niche research to be able to

00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:15,250
sort of know you're Marco and Vickers

00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:17,830
from an you know sort of t-72 em from a

00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:20,559
t-72 K from you know it's it's

00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:21,970
difficult research and we I mean if if

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,590
anybody has any ideas about how to

00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:25,720
automate so it's please come talk to me

00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:31,600
you will save me so many gray hairs in

00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:36,190
the future yeah yeah you are developing

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:39,760
using a data center for modeling all

00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:42,279
that that you have because I can see

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:45,610
that would be very useful I mean beyond

00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:47,440
the scope of the geographical scope that

00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:49,570
you you are working on but yeah an

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,850
America with all the world rock for

00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:54,490
instance here all the trafficking and so

00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:57,880
on even though that information that

00:20:54,490 --> 00:21:00,700
Martin might not be often now he's kept

00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,620
on the wrong standard so it leaves is

00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:06,309
something and that people can just look

00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:08,380
into that and kind of evolved from from

00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:10,240
that and if it's available yeah that's a

00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:12,309
good question actually so we're we're

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,960
not project complete just yet we're

00:21:12,309 --> 00:21:15,340
hoping to sort of get this ready and

00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:18,730
rolled up by that before the end of the

00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:20,289
year but actually as we've been working

00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:22,299
on this it's actually South Africa's

00:21:20,289 --> 00:21:24,549
elections today I'm South African in

00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:25,899
case your note and we're having our

00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:27,100
national elections and when we were

00:21:25,899 --> 00:21:30,010
working now so we're thinking this would

00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:32,620
actually be a great tool to visualize

00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:33,850
elections because essentially instead of

00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:35,769
sorry I'm just trying to flick to it

00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:37,990
there we go you know instead of tanks

00:21:35,769 --> 00:21:39,370
and weapons has been the objects your

00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:40,840
objects could be voters that could be

00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:44,019
constituents it could be drug dealers in

00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:47,740
in South America there could be any kind

00:21:44,019 --> 00:21:48,700
of sort of object database and I think

00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,049
to answer your question is yes we

00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,600
certainly intend to make this available

00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:54,909
we are in partnership with code for

00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,830
Africa who generally prefer us to have a

00:21:54,909 --> 00:21:58,029
github for everything so that you know

00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:59,830
everyone can sort of take a look see I

00:21:58,029 --> 00:22:01,960
hope I'm answering that sort of tech

00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:03,970
side again I'm not quite the developer

00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:06,370
but the idea is to develop this

00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:09,039
methodology as we go so that people can

00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:10,510
use us for other things we're kind of

00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:13,179
thought quite narrowly in terms of using

00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:14,440
it for defense outside of Africa but

00:22:13,179 --> 00:22:15,909
there's no reason if you think about

00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,919
outside the box why this couldn't be

00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:20,380
integrated into any number of other

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,519
similar kinds of sort of projects where

00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,080
you've got procurement and you've got

00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:24,940
things that are related to procurement

00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:27,760
but have perhaps sort of a bit off the

00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:29,220
books as it were yeah I hope that

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:35,130
answers your question I don't know

00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:38,309
a little bit yeah I see questions one is

00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:40,020
why the name project Athena it seems

00:22:38,309 --> 00:22:42,720
like to be like quite over a little bit

00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:45,450
and it doesn't seem super relevant to it

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,179
regard to the applicant homeland or

00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:50,130
whatever oh and to a lot of this data

00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:52,260
you're talking about as a statistical

00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:53,700
like variance to it it's not a hundred

00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:56,100
percent right so your point and they

00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,720
would jump Twitter that that maybe is

00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:02,190
posted by somebody who might be related

00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:03,809
to some entity that might be the thing

00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:05,370
they're looking at and I wonder if

00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:08,039
people thought about how to relate that

00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:10,890
in your visualizations and and how you

00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:12,690
explain this to the public so I mean

00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:14,490
having worked in defense day in the past

00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:16,860
I've always been very careful to say

00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:19,799
like this is a weapon from this group at

00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:21,570
this point and let's see a lot of

00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:25,350
assertions like that in your talk you

00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:27,809
how you talk about that certainly so I'm

00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:30,539
glad you asked about the Athena name our

00:23:27,809 --> 00:23:32,789
initial preference was actually for oil

00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:35,250
which is an African goddess of war in

00:23:32,789 --> 00:23:37,620
conflict and things like that but the

00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:39,780
idea is for this tool to be used sort of

00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:41,909
internationally and the sad thing is

00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:44,159
it's just Athena is a far more relatable

00:23:41,909 --> 00:23:47,880
you know sort of understandable term

00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:49,320
then oh yeah unfortunately we've used

00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:52,740
now for another mapping tool that we've

00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:54,780
got I I would love to change it and it's

00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:56,610
not set in stone so we might depending

00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:58,530
depending how we feel as we go further

00:23:56,610 --> 00:24:00,150
on actually sort of because we actually

00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:01,679
wanted to I should say that but we're

00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:04,830
also trying to get this tool is widely

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,419
used as possible so it's it's kind of a

00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:08,400
catch to it what's going to catch string

00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:11,220
- it's just a sort of cost-benefit that

00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:13,919
we've sort of sort of decided to do on

00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:16,140
the data absolutely agreed it's you know

00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,090
especially you know when I you know I am

00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:19,890
a journalist by day as well for with

00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:21,090
normal political stuff and we when we're

00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:22,950
not been hacked by the Russians and

00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:26,100
cancer sort of fake imagery and stuff

00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:29,940
like that as well and I would save as

00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:32,010
much as social medias related it's sort

00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:33,870
of human faltered as it were you know we

00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:35,429
have the five of us we're hoping I did

00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:38,250
mention crowdsourcing but perhaps only

00:24:35,429 --> 00:24:40,049
to briefly to adopt a sort of baling cat

00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:42,299
kind of model here where we sort of open

00:24:40,049 --> 00:24:43,020
this up to citizen researchers and say

00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:45,330
can you

00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:47,520
locates or sort of reference or sort of

00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:50,250
verify that this is actually this

00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:52,470
assault rifle from this area in the case

00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:56,160
of the DRC that will be our own primary

00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:58,470
research so that's at least we can use

00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,670
as a kind of like control study for them

00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:02,490
because obviously we want to have as

00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:04,170
clean the start as possible in running

00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:06,690
this sort of project so we would like to

00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:09,030
have as sort of pure kind of research

00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:11,880
and material as possible so our catalog

00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:13,620
image of an assault rifle could for all

00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:16,050
intents and purposes be a tweet because

00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:17,910
it's hey from this location this picture

00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:19,559
with this description we're just doing

00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:21,450
that ourselves instead of putting it on

00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:23,190
social media but the fields and objects

00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:24,390
that we would put in to Athena in terms

00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:27,510
of the database would be more or less

00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:29,880
similar but then obviously as we go out

00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:31,500
information gets looks perfect and then

00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:47,760
scrutiny needs to be a little bit more

00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:52,220
sort of rigorous I think as we go just

00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:52,220
abandoned kind of worries about like

00:25:56,179 --> 00:26:02,340
what would be like the dream pathway to

00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:04,170
impact like if you if I ask you to just

00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:06,270
be like like just imagine like the

00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:09,179
best-case scenario for this image right

00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:11,010
well who would pay attention of what

00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:12,660
would they do as a result i mean

00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:14,160
honestly in a perfect world it would be

00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:17,309
if we could changes from project Athena

00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:19,590
to I thought it was me with that Micra

00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:22,350
change it from project Athena to wiki

00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:24,540
weapons you know and turn it into a sort

00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:26,460
of Wikipedia level kind of thing where

00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:28,800
you have active sort of citizen

00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:31,350
engagement and contribution to this

00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,760
knowledge because it's it's it's our

00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:34,710
firm belief the whole reason we're doing

00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,970
this aside from well not aside it's not

00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:38,010
the primary thing is not to nerd out on

00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:39,840
weapons the primary reason we're doing

00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:41,760
this is because we we genuinely believe

00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,970
this information needs to be made

00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:47,160
open-source it needs to be sort of open

00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:50,250
up and made public domain whereas at the

00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:51,929
moment it absolutely is not and that's

00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:53,790
that's the sort of mission we're trying

00:26:51,929 --> 00:26:55,410
to do this you know you mentioned

00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:56,100
funding in effort this is what we can do

00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:58,530
right now

00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:00,270
again in a perfect world if we had more

00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:01,260
more sort of hands on deck and a little

00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:03,929
bit more funding and things like that

00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:06,080
yeah wicked weapons would be great also

00:27:03,929 --> 00:27:11,840
a cool name as well I suppose yeah I

00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:15,619
think thank you

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,619
