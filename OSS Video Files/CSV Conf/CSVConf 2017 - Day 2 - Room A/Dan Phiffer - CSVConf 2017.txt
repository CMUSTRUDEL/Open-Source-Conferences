hi I'm Dan Pfeiffer and I work at the on

00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:10,599
the data team at maps in so we make

00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,190
open-source tools that help you roll

00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:13,629
your own map that's basically our thing

00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:17,650
and that means a lot of stuff like

00:00:13,629 --> 00:00:19,570
search tiles the whole thing and I work

00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:22,600
on a project called who's on first who's

00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:24,130
on first we tend to call it loss so if

00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,870
you hear me saying waffle at that's what

00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:28,330
I'm talking about

00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:30,370
WOF so I'm going to talk about that

00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,630
first and then demo some recent work

00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:34,719
that I've been doing on a tool called

00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:36,699
boundary issues and it may get a little

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,989
bit technical but there is a cat video

00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:45,100
and some dancing

00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:48,249
so also shout out with a Mac hi

00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:54,069
I could try this is mesquita shout out

00:00:48,249 --> 00:01:00,879
to my parents who are here by the way it

00:00:54,069 --> 00:01:04,600
drove down from Washington so this is a

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:06,610
tool called this spelunker which lets us

00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:09,370
explore what kind of data we have in our

00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:10,750
data set so here we have something like

00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:13,510
a phone number for a place it's called

00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:16,810
the WAP ID it's just a stable numeric ID

00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:19,030
and if we plug this into this directory

00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:23,650
structure the first three digits second

00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:26,260
three digits third three digits we get

00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:27,910
to this one plat file basically our data

00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:30,640
sets just a bunch of flat files on

00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:33,070
github you can clone them you can

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,130
download them it's in a format called

00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:37,270
geo JSON which is JSON with geo it's

00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:40,930
just like what it sounds like

00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:43,330
oh and lets us do stuff like encode lots

00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:45,190
of properties in this case we have like

00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,720
all of the names that people might refer

00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:52,240
to Portland for example including one

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:54,610
that's in Chinese so one time Peter

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:58,330
Johnson from the maps and search team

00:01:54,610 --> 00:02:00,040
filed a bug against our data repo he

00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:02,350
found that there were these places that

00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:06,190
looked wrong some records that had the

00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:08,080
name Street just plain vanilla Street as

00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:11,519
it turns out there are actually places

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,519
in the world called Street

00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:19,170
this place has very bad SEO that the

00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:23,819
name would be so generic is surprising

00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:29,970
but it is also true and that is the

00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:32,760
story of how my pot got its name so

00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:37,319
who's on first started in 2013 by Aaron

00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:40,080
Aaron strapped coke and this is a slide

00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:42,269
I stole from his slide deck it's written

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,340
up in a blog post called mapping with

00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:46,349
bias which I recommend as a starting

00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:49,319
point if you want to read more

00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:51,989
so we encode records as plain text files

00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:53,459
because of stability and also because

00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:55,950
that lets you decide what kind of

00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:59,069
database you want to use you like

00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:01,799
Postgres sign elasticsearch we use that

00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:05,400
too sequel light doesn't matter any of

00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:06,720
it will work so we offer an api but you

00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,519
can also just download all the records

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:13,099
and index them in the way that makes

00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:15,329
sense for you this is not a mass n map

00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:18,260
but it does illustrate some problems

00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:18,260
we're also trying to solve

00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:24,580
so this is not meant to be a critique of

00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:28,540
Google by the way this is a very

00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:34,060
creative use of the tools at hand and

00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:35,950
sure enough there is a river here so

00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:38,349
like this is the type of thing I think

00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:41,920
about what should happen next when you

00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:43,480
click that link and as of this morning I

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:48,670
should say the river has been added to

00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:49,930
Google good for though so who's on first

00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:53,019
is what's called a gazetteer

00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:56,650
and that's map jargon for a big list of

00:03:53,019 --> 00:04:00,549
places some interesting properties with

00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:02,470
our gazetteer we have dates for when a

00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:06,489
place came into being when it ceased to

00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:09,220
exist the hierarchy of a place so like

00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:13,599
this venue exists within a locality of

00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:15,970
Portland etc if there's a more relevant

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,620
record that supersedes like a historic

00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:23,050
record so maybe a business move

00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:24,490
locations etc whether we see this place

00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:27,760
through the eyes of an official

00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:29,590
Instagram account so this is the oculus

00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,919
in New York City it's a brand new

00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:35,080
construction and on the right is the

00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:37,570
photos that people have tagged with the

00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:40,840
location for that spot now the people

00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:43,330
who who are in charge of this place have

00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,889
no effect on the pictures of batboys but

00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:47,229
they're the same place the building

00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:49,300
exists so regardless of the data we can

00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:51,400
all agree this is the consensual

00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,289
hallucination of the place regardless if

00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:57,039
you're taking photos from the you know

00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:59,370
outside or the inside so Hewlett who's

00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:02,740
on first represents human perspectives

00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:05,530
it also reflects our biases as the

00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:08,680
creators of the data set in particular

00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:10,599
like Aaron's long engagement with open

00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,780
Geo so there's a lot of Aaron in this

00:05:10,599 --> 00:05:12,780
project

00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:18,440
so we're getting into the more technical

00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:21,319
bits now so since each place has a

00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:23,780
stable wofe ID we can start to build a

00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:27,830
network of place relationships so like

00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:31,009
this is the Occulus transit hub aka the

00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:32,780
carcass which has a certain set of

00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:34,639
relationships to other places like the

00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:39,409
city of the state it's in it's in the

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:41,629
United States etc as some of you may

00:05:39,409 --> 00:05:43,819
know the quality of open data can be

00:05:41,629 --> 00:05:47,210
mixed I mean the same is true with

00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:48,620
proprietary data to our our motto is

00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:50,840
better than yesterday so we're just

00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:54,680
trying to keep improvements rolling

00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:59,930
along so when I started prepping my talk

00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:02,900
I noticed that the the Elliot Center

00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:04,159
doesn't exist in our data set you can

00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:07,250
tell from the map there's there's no

00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:09,469
there's no dot in Oregon so I went ahead

00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,210
and decided to add it this is boundary

00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:14,419
issues this is the web-based editor I

00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:16,930
was mentioning do I need to press that

00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:19,250
here we go so this is the process that

00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,349
if you wanted to add a place that

00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,750
doesn't exist already

00:06:20,349 --> 00:06:28,699
it's our bespoke CMS for editing off

00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:30,919
records so basically I'm finding the

00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:33,620
spot on the map there's a button that's

00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:39,050
telling us the open geo coder from NASA

00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:40,669
I can pitch their team so on the right

00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:43,460
this is like the place hierarchy based

00:06:40,669 --> 00:06:45,139
on the place on the map there's a bunch

00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,370
of other stuff going on and I want to

00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:48,500
pause the video here and acknowledge

00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:50,539
that there's a lot going on here and if

00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,009
you're not up on like how we think about

00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:54,050
this stuff this is going to seem pretty

00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:56,300
overwhelming and it's kind of the basis

00:06:54,050 --> 00:07:01,819
for the thing that I built kind of as a

00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:03,740
response to this so let's see but the

00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:06,949
upshot is basically all you need for a

00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:09,139
venue is a name and a lat/long

00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:11,300
coordinate like basically everything

00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:14,870
else gets filled in like automatically

00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:17,389
behind the scenes so basically what

00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:20,409
happens is you hit the Save button it's

00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:24,110
going to you know ping the backend and

00:07:20,409 --> 00:07:25,990
make a record of this pending save and

00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,520
then behind the scenes we have this

00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:29,590
process that's just constantly waiting

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,840
for stuff to happen and it notices that

00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:35,890
you save something and basically goes in

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:39,190
like does stuff hand-waving

00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:42,700
happens here this is a part that I spent

00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:44,830
time on so now this place exists in the

00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:47,500
data set could take a few minutes to to

00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:48,970
finally make its way on the github but

00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,370
so basically boundary issues is about

00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:54,400
translating your web interactions in to

00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:55,420
get speak so yeah you don't have to know

00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:01,500
get you don't have to use the command

00:07:55,420 --> 00:08:04,270
line yeah so here's a recap open data

00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:06,400
stable identifiers concordance is Arabic

00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:08,800
things so basically we know about other

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,730
data sets restore their IDs so you can

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,020
make inferences about the two data sets

00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:15,760
most are going to be focusing on this

00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:19,900
last bullet point for the rest of the

00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:21,940
talk the the fact that you can extend

00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:25,650
the properties that are available to you

00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:27,610
in the in the the record itself so

00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:29,490
separately from who's on first is

00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:33,640
boundary issues that's our CMS

00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:37,300
translates edit syndicate commits a lot

00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:40,570
of our internal team uses QGIS as their

00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:43,690
primary tool which is an open source GIS

00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:45,910
program another important factor

00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,440
boundary issues is not available to the

00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:49,870
public yet although that will change

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:53,890
it's just we're rolling it out slowly to

00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:57,580
like friends and family until it's

00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:59,950
really stable but this last bullet point

00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:02,110
is also mostly what I want to focus on

00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:06,420
next so I should ideally be about

00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:08,770
halfway here Justin right now okay great

00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:13,210
so this is actually the spot where I was

00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:15,160
going to show this thing let's see oh no

00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:19,060
I don't have my nevermind I lost my

00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:21,760
Wi-Fi so I had a foot as the slide would

00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:23,350
have gone right here so I'm going to

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,440
talk about weird maps and I think it's

00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:28,120
easy to enjoy weird maps because the

00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,850
territory that they're mapping is itself

00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:33,100
weird like many New Yorkers who grew up

00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:35,530
on the west coast the subway system is

00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,660
endlessly fascinating to me

00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:40,210
our sprawling 24-hour transit

00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:44,850
is the source of pride the subject of

00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:47,140
gripes and strongly held opinions and

00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:50,200
it's also maybe the most interesting

00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:52,740
venue for contemporary dance in a city

00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:55,060
that's well known for performing arts

00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,200
these guys are known as Showtime like

00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:59,260
this is like the way they announce

00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:01,330
themselves on the train and these I have

00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:04,240
to say these are like a better crew than

00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:10,120
a lot of them it's based on my own

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:11,560
observations so a subway map means

00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,660
different things to different people

00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,650
and that's because the subway itself

00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,930
means different things to different

00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:19,780
people so you know depending on whether

00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:22,240
you're able-bodied or not or if you take

00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:24,460
the bus so this is the map that someone

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,230
created that its whole purpose is to

00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:27,790
overlay the subway system with the bus

00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:31,090
network which isn't something that the

00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:34,360
ordinary like MTA official bus our

00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:37,930
subway map does this is one that I use a

00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:41,520
ton it's it's really it's probably

00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:41,520
sounds ridiculous to non New Yorkers but

00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:46,720
so you're waiting on the platform and

00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:49,270
you like oh I do I look at my photo I

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:53,080
walk to where I'm about to exit and I

00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:54,790
don't know it's very helpful so let's

00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,710
isolate ourselves with just one station

00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:58,360
this is the 36th Street Station in the

00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:02,530
historically working-class neighborhood

00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:04,360
of Sunset Park and you're inside the

00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:06,370
station there's good metadata to collect

00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:09,010
it's right there on the plaque we have a

00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:12,880
opening date closing date or no opens

00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:14,770
and retail but rehabilitated but let's

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,440
stand at back a little bit the hold

00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:19,780
there are restrooms here which also is

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,070
unusual like most New York City subway

00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,570
stations don't have restrooms and

00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:24,340
there's also a good metadata like has

00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:28,420
open hours here we could encode that

00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:30,790
into the wah fractures but there's also

00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:33,730
all these murals around us like a lot of

00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:36,570
New York City's subway stations have

00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:39,820
tile work or other kinds of public art

00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:43,590
this example depicts the designers the

00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:47,440
workers and the writers of the subway

00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:50,270
and this also has good metadata so we

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:53,270
have you know an artist named the the

00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:56,240
title of the tilework the date that it

00:11:53,270 --> 00:12:05,720
was created and did any of you guys

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:08,210
catch this part so this mural which was

00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:11,030
commissioned in 1998 references earlier

00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:14,000
tilework that probably was put in when

00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:18,140
the station opened in 1915 so I like

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:21,190
that little self-referential did so I

00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:24,560
don't know this why am I not able to go

00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:26,660
there we go so I don't know this all

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,060
points to this what counts as data

00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:31,460
question so like the Wikipedia article

00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:33,140
has a ton of information about the 36th

00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,840
Street Station but there's no mention of

00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:37,550
restrooms or public art so there's a lot

00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,920
of nuance that captures why we would

00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:41,480
even care about a place and a lot of

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,800
that's missing from data sets that we

00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:48,710
otherwise would consider comprehensive

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:51,530
so here is a record for a subway stop I

00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:54,410
think this is the City Hall station and

00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:57,950
notice down here we have a list of tags

00:12:54,410 --> 00:13:01,640
and the tags are it's a little bit hard

00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:04,250
to see I guess SG tags so the SG prefix

00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:06,140
is because this particular data

00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:09,380
originated from an earlier data set

00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:14,290
called simplegeo and simplegeo we have a

00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:14,290
simple G open in the crash oh wow

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:23,900
so we have this we have this other repos

00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:26,440
it kind of talks about which properties

00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:29,450
came from where so in this case we have

00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,890
the prefix s G and if you wanted to

00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:33,650
thought well this one doesn't have a URL

00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:35,270
but there's usually a URL it's it's on

00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:40,460
internet archives from what I understand

00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:42,470
if you did one so there's other ones

00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:44,510
like some sources which are

00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:51,770
authoritative some that are more

00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:54,410
vernacular this is John Orem aka burrito

00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:56,600
justice and he helped to find some key

00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:59,840
micro hoods in San Francisco in the in

00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,700
the Mission District he also made this

00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:05,510
map which was recently featured in The

00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:10,010
New York Times Magazine unrelated to my

00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:11,780
talk but I figured I'd flash up there so

00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:12,820
territory means different things to

00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:16,850
different people

00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:19,000
the territory the territory also means

00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:21,110
different things to different species

00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,940
depending on your perspective the kinds

00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:25,640
of data that are captured about places

00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:32,630
may be missing insufficient or downright

00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:39,080
hostile so I think this has a happy

00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:40,970
ending I mean this is the cavity so yeah

00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:43,250
keys on first is opinionated like like

00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:46,250
all data sets and no collection is truly

00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:47,600
unbiased but we hope to be aware of when

00:14:46,250 --> 00:15:01,870
we're suiting our own opinions about

00:14:47,600 --> 00:15:05,750
places so this this one this is a

00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:11,060
project called outgoing and it's made by

00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:14,840
a person who worked at Cardo just a what

00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:17,090
is for SoCo never saved last night and

00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,350
during the development of this feature

00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:20,510
that I'm about to show you in the next

00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:22,940
five minutes I had the privilege of

00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:25,550
working with Jeff's data set and he's

00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:28,040
been tracking all of the gay nightlife

00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:29,690
in New York City like since as far back

00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,710
as we can find this like records that

00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:36,650
you found from the 89

00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:38,300
words so using Jeff's dataset I uploaded

00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:42,740
it to the tool this is where a devil a

00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:44,360
software and we get a few like

00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:46,970
high-level things that we can assert

00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:49,640
about this file that we have so we can

00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:51,140
say does it have column headers what's

00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:53,420
the source that it's coming from and

00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:55,490
that automatically adds like a sort of

00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:57,890
like that prefix that you were seeing

00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:59,210
earlier so now we know that this that

00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:01,520
like these properties were about to

00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:03,500
merge into who's on first are associated

00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:07,880
with that known source that we already

00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:10,070
created a record for and next you know

00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:13,160
we'll go through and kind of obsessively

00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:14,660
decide how to treat each CSV column and

00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:22,190
decide how we're going to map it to

00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:23,600
which who's on first property and that

00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:25,790
results in this sort of step through

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,620
process or like for each row in that CSV

00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:29,210
file we get one of these pages and we

00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:33,260
get to decide like does it look right

00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:34,550
should we change the location and you

00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:36,320
know in some cases we don't have an

00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:39,770
address but further research will

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:42,950
lettuce like geocoded or you know decide

00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:46,220
which 540 West 21st Street we actually

00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:49,130
mean we also want to avoid duplicating

00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:50,660
existing records because instead we want

00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:55,550
to like merge the properties into the

00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:57,530
existing one and then at the very end we

00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:59,920
get a modified version of the same CSV

00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:01,880
file it has this important first column

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,990
you'll see it on the right or on the

00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:07,339
left this is the loss ID that now

00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:10,190
anything you might edit in this

00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:13,730
spreadsheet using you know standard

00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:15,320
issue Excel or numbers we can now Ram

00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:17,420
trip this back in these on first and

00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:19,040
because that first call or the first

00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:21,800
yeah the first column has all the loss

00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:25,730
IDs we'll know exactly how to merge it

00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:26,780
in properly and that's it thank you very

00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:28,840
much

00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,840
you
