my name is Lily and I am a scientist up

00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:09,870
at OHSU and I am also a member of the

00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:11,670
monarch initiative and I will be telling

00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:14,790
you a little bit more about what monarch

00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:16,740
is and how we are doing the data open

00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:20,010
source tooling for data integration and

00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:22,680
at monarch we are integrating data from

00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,930
diverse species and sources with the

00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,789
main goal of disease discovery and

00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:30,960
diagnosis to try to improve patient

00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:33,780
health so ms Starr's little outline I'll

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,520
tell you who we are monarch what we're

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,470
doing and why and then I'm going to

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,180
define some terms that we might be

00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,910
unfamiliar with such as phenotype and

00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:44,940
ontology and then I'll get into our

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:47,190
extractions from load workflow and then

00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,960
I'll end on some data tool examples to

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:52,200
show you guys how we're using this data

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,690
that we've integrated so monarch is a

00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,310
large international consortium this is

00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,590
just an overview of some of our

00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:00,360
collaborators and stakeholders we're

00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,910
really involved in open data and open

00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,860
science and passionate about making our

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,990
tools available for others to look at

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,600
and I encourage you to go to our website

00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:14,550
and also our github page if you want to

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:16,650
learn more and see our code so this is

00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:18,990
just an overview again and monarch is

00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,960
trying to be fully translational which

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:24,630
means that we are taking basic data

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,760
produced by researchers and trying to

00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:30,210
translate it into the clinical spectrum

00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:32,460
to affect human health the big problem

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,350
that monarch is trying to solve is that

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:37,460
there's a lot of data that's being

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:40,080
produced that isn't being shared and

00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:42,690
it's being underutilized by both

00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,310
researchers and clinicians so a monarch

00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:46,229
we're trying to make all the data count

00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,930
and really integrate it so that we can

00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:52,350
use it and one of our big goals is to

00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:53,880
integrate data form a database and use

00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,920
this database to support disease

00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,190
diagnosis especially for rare diseases

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,080
and I say rare diseases and you think it

00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:03,210
might be a small problem but rare

00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:06,420
diseases actually affects a lot of

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:08,879
people and on average one in ten

00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,770
Americans has a rare disease which comes

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,620
out to about 30 million people in

00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:14,020
America alone and about 7,000 different

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,350
disease

00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:19,720
says and importantly only about 5% of

00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:22,150
these diseases have a known treatment

00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,250
and they're also really hard to diagnose

00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:26,590
and one of the reasons but they're hard

00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:28,690
to diagnose is because they're rare you

00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:30,370
know a patient comes to a doctor and

00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,860
they have a set of symptoms that that

00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:34,630
doctor may have never seen before and so

00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:36,100
the doctor doesn't know how to diagnose

00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:38,680
that patient because they don't have any

00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:40,690
comparison point so at monarch we're

00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,210
trying to integrate data that we can

00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:47,500
give to clinicians for example to add

00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:51,120
those comparison points back in all

00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,960
right so one of the problems that we

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,360
encounter when we're trying to integrate

00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,550
the data is that data sources are

00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,340
diverse they're distributed and they're

00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:03,520
differently modeled I used to do

00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:05,200
neuroscience research with flies and so

00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:09,880
our data is very different from that

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:11,740
data that clinicians produce and you can

00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,440
imagine a scenario where a clinician has

00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:16,660
a Parkinson's patient and they have data

00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:19,240
related to that human and then there

00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:21,940
could be researchers doing and mice or

00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:24,100
fly data or even chicken research and

00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,690
Parkinson's disease and they might have

00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,760
some breakthrough that isn't being

00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:30,450
translated into human research because

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:34,900
it's really hard to integrate that data

00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:37,240
so besides these problems we also have

00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:42,520
data that is in physical and semantic

00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:44,200
silos as you can imagine and you like I

00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,580
mentioned you have different research

00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,620
groups that are all producing this

00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,160
different data and they don't share very

00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,470
well

00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,720
frequently data is only shared when it's

00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:55,150
published and then only the positive

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,490
results are shared and this can take a

00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:59,440
really long time and so you write a

00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:02,080
paper and get it published for anyone

00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:06,100
that's been through that cycle and but

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:08,500
there are databases that have published

00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,620
data and sometimes unpublished data that

00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:13,060
researchers and clinicians can access

00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:16,600
but even then the data is still

00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:19,870
semantically siloed and an example of

00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:22,120
what this would be is say like a lot of

00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,530
anatomy terms like in humans we have

00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,120
data about the hands

00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,700
and in mice you have data about a PHA

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,620
and we know that those two things are

00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:32,980
synonymous but a computer doesn't

00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:34,840
innately know that so we can't integrate

00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:38,110
over that without telling the computers

00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,639
those two things are the same here's

00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:42,669
another example of what a semantic

00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:45,040
bridging challenge looks like so say we

00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:49,090
have a model organism researcher who is

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:52,900
studying frogs and he has a frog that

00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:55,930
has a short jaw of bulging eyes trouble

00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:58,180
breathing and spider fingers and say

00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:01,150
this researcher knows the genetic cause

00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:02,770
of all of these symptoms and then we

00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:05,650
also have a patient that goes to the

00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:10,090
doctor and has the exact same symptoms

00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:12,220
they match each other but the doctor or

00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:14,530
the geneticist does not know what is

00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:17,169
causing these symptoms in the patient if

00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:18,880
we're able to integrate this data then

00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:21,520
we might be able to figure out you know

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,380
look and see if that genetic cause and

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,720
the Frog is similar to what's causing it

00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:28,330
in the human so this is just a very very

00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:32,080
simple example of what we're trying to

00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:35,290
do and so each of these terms here that

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:38,760
are in the speech bubbles I've been

00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:41,110
calling them symptoms but in the biology

00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:44,500
medical world we call them phenotypes

00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:47,289
and phenotypes are the outward

00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:49,960
presentation of our genetic background

00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:51,820
combining with our environments and so

00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,560
to help you guys understand more when

00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:57,970
I'm talking about when I say phenotypes

00:05:53,560 --> 00:06:00,550
I have a picture so this is showing us

00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:04,210
different phenotypes and here you have

00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:10,419
blue skin or really big ears and your

00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:11,950
balls or striking facial features so all

00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:14,919
of us you look at each other we all have

00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:17,590
different phenotypes and when someone

00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:20,020
has a disease they present at the doctor

00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:23,260
with a collection of different phenotype

00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:25,060
phenotypic features or symptoms so I'm

00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:26,770
going to talk about phenotypes and I

00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:30,460
just want you guys to remember what that

00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:33,640
term means and for one other example I'm

00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:36,820
using the unofficial theme of CA CSV

00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:40,080
which is caps this is

00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:44,560
and Morrow is a famous internet cat

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:47,380
Mario loves to jump in foxes and so we

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,720
could describe that behavior as a

00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:53,890
phenotype of abnormal sheltering

00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:55,090
behavior so if Mario was a patient this

00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:57,940
is the kind of data that we would

00:06:55,090 --> 00:07:00,220
collect on Maru we have his biography

00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:02,620
he's four years old he's a male cat of

00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:04,180
the Scottish Fold bream we also have

00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:06,550
some measurement information about him

00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:08,440
to weigh six kilograms and then our

00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:10,990
phenotype and qualifiers is that

00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:13,450
abnormal sheltering behavior so onset of

00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:15,190
birth and then of course very

00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:17,950
importantly we have our source in this

00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:21,580
case is from a YouTube video which isn't

00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:23,920
normally what we have so this gives you

00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:25,780
an example of what's the kind of data

00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:28,390
that is collected from patients would

00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,800
look like and some of the type of data

00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:32,590
that we are trying to integrate at

00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:35,140
monarch another reason why I'm showing

00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:36,580
you Maru besides that it's a cute cat

00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:39,370
and that's you know kind of the

00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:41,770
conference theme is that it's really

00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:45,190
important to integrate data from all

00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:47,350
species because adding other species of

00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:51,790
data helps us fill in knowledge gaps in

00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:53,980
the human genome so for example I was in

00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:56,200
there a scientist and a lot of basic

00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:59,290
neuroscience research was first done in

00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:01,000
the squid so it's really important we

00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:04,300
can learn a lot from integrating data

00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,950
from other species and another reason

00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:08,320
why it's really important to integrate

00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:10,360
data from other species is because other

00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:14,560
animals can have the same rare diseases

00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:17,080
that humans have here's an example of a

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:20,380
little boy with vitiligo which is a rare

00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:24,340
skin disorder and also a dog that has

00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:25,840
the exact same rare disorder and these

00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,430
two found each other because the little

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,220
boy's mom was searching for his

00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:32,860
phenotypes or his symptoms online she's

00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:35,099
googling and ran across the same

00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:37,810
phenotypes and symptoms and the dog and

00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:39,460
so this is just an example showing you

00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:42,219
how we can find different data sources

00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:45,940
from very diverse areas that you

00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:47,240
wouldn't normally think of but as you

00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:49,160
can imagine I

00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,839
and the phenotypes that are used to

00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,240
describe the dog are different from

00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:54,800
those used to describe humans so this is

00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,649
part of the semantic challenge of

00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:00,470
integrating this data so to integrate

00:08:57,649 --> 00:09:03,980
terms that are semantically different we

00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:05,810
use ontology z' and there's a really

00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,760
great talk yesterday that involved the

00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:10,880
Swan ecology I don't know if you guys

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:13,279
heard about that but I my colleagues

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,190
made another slide to show you guys what

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:18,470
an ontology is an ontology can be

00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:20,630
described as a knowledge classification

00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:23,390
comprised of terms that are formally

00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:24,649
defined and logically related there can

00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:26,770
be thought of as a dictionary of terms

00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:29,060
and how they're related to each other

00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:33,020
ontology czar used for a variety of

00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:37,970
things such as Amazon uses 'ln and the

00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:39,589
actual Amazon uses them too but today

00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:41,980
I'm going to tell you about a beer

00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:44,990
ontology because we're in Portland and

00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:48,020
so we have different terms here like

00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:51,380
light beer is a type of beer so that is

00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:54,260
a showing us the relationship then we

00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:57,079
have Pilsner is a light beer lager is a

00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:59,870
light beer Porter is a dark beer stout

00:09:57,079 --> 00:10:01,670
is a dark beer so this is a simple

00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:04,250
example that it's showing you that

00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:06,490
ontology is semantically map out the

00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:08,839
relationship between different terms and

00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:10,520
they're used to take really complex

00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:13,880
structures and break them out into

00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:17,930
different patterns we use ontology x' to

00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:20,510
integrate our data and at Monarch

00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:22,940
semantics serve as a bridge with

00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:27,140
ontology z' acting as our universal

00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:29,300
converter box so we're able to use this

00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:32,120
Universal converter box of ontology

00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:35,000
to integrate data and map relationships

00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:39,110
between genes phenotypes and diseases

00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,610
from all species including humans so how

00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:43,310
do we integrate all of this disparate

00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:49,339
data well we use our extract transform

00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:51,350
load workflow and our workflow is called

00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:53,540
dipper and this was developed by my

00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:56,350
colleagues and you can read more about

00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:59,120
it at our github site if you'd like to

00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:02,560
differ stands for data ingest pipe

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:05,660
it is an open-source Python package and

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,850
zipper extracts various types of

00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:10,279
biological data like genotype

00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:13,430
information phenotypes and even evidence

00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:16,150
information such as new a paper that was

00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:19,190
published that we got the data from

00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:21,680
dipper then transforms that data into

00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:24,800
RDF triples which stands for resource

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:27,440
description framework at the core of RDF

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,930
is a set of triples or subject predicate

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,120
object which is kind of like Val

00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:35,330
IntelliJ or the predicate is a

00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:37,670
relationship between different terms and

00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:40,880
the subject predicate object in an RDF

00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:44,720
triple makes up an RDF graph so once

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:47,990
dipper transforms the data we get data

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:50,900
that is graph based queryable sparkle

00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:53,180
and it's also human readable and then

00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:55,670
finally we load this data into our bio

00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:59,690
link API and then use the data for

00:11:55,670 --> 00:12:02,690
various tools I'll tell you a little bit

00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:06,020
more about this now so first we extract

00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:08,839
data from multiple sources we have very

00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:11,930
diverse data and information about genes

00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:15,050
mechanism and context and phenotypes and

00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:18,170
diseases and then we take this data from

00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:21,320
very disparate sources such as genomic

00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:23,900
resources model organism databases which

00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:26,600
are where researchers can store some of

00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:29,870
their data and also from clinical data

00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,130
and then from published papers so as I

00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:33,680
said I used to be a neuroscience

00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:35,360
researcher and I studied the Flies so

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,550
I'm going to show you an example of what

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,500
this data looks like from the fly model

00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:42,830
organism database and also the mouse

00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:44,570
model organism database and I'm going to

00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:48,980
show you guys the gene that I used to

00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:53,060
study which is called falafels so in the

00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:55,040
Flies here you can see at the top

00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:57,230
there's the symbol and then the name and

00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,660
this information is also found on the

00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:01,790
mouse resource and this is just a

00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:03,080
screenshot showing you a small amount of

00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:04,730
the information that this contains

00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,040
there's a lot of information here and

00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:08,930
I've tried to highlight these the

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,270
commonalities between these two sources

00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:12,150
with red arrows so you can see that

00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,800
there is

00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:16,500
similarity but there's also a lot of

00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:18,450
difference and especially if you look at

00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:21,300
the symbols you'll notice that they're

00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:23,490
different between the two species so

00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,800
like it flies the gene I say is called

00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:29,220
falafel but in mice it's called PP for

00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:31,350
our 3a and I know that they're the same

00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,790
gene because I studied them but once

00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:36,510
again the computer doesn't know that

00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:39,330
these are the two things but we use our

00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:41,220
differ code to tell the computer that

00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:43,760
they are actually the same and we use

00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:47,070
ontology z' to bridge that semantic gap

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:52,590
as a really big arrow that i've drawn

00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:55,200
over here is showing us the common NCBI

00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:57,210
gene number and this gene number is the

00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,350
same no matter what species you're in

00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:00,960
and that's what we were able to

00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:03,510
integrate this data on so for each type

00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:09,030
of data we find one commonality and

00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:11,010
integrate across it alright so once we

00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:14,040
have found the data that we want to

00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:16,080
extract the next step in our pipeline is

00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:19,380
that we semantic lean map out this data

00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:22,970
and this is what this looks like it's an

00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:25,830
example of looking at genetic data and

00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:27,750
this is the RDF triple again with the

00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:30,030
subject predicate object where the

00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:32,730
subject here at the top is the gene and

00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:35,940
then the predicate is the relationship

00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:39,480
so I wish I was a little taller if we

00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:40,920
look at that one and the relationship

00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,710
there is subsequent sub and then

00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:45,210
chromosome is the object so we're saying

00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:47,460
that a gene is a subsequent of a

00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:50,760
chromosome and a chromosome for instance

00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:52,860
is a member of a reference genome so

00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:56,370
this is how we're semantically mapping

00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:58,050
out the data in this pipeline and I want

00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:00,960
to mention that these terms here come

00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:03,510
from various ontology for instance you

00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:08,370
see the RO with the colon that's the

00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:10,590
relationship ontology alright so we use

00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:14,010
various ontology x' to transform the

00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:17,100
data we down here in the colored area we

00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:21,000
use Gino for genetics and Oberon for

00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:24,150
anatomy terms such as hand and paw we

00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,390
use go for gene functions ubertino for

00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:28,960
phenotypes

00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:31,930
and mondo for Disease terms and we use a

00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:36,100
few other ontology s as well but these

00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:39,160
are the main ones and I want to bring us

00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,480
back to that NCBI gene number that I was

00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,210
talking about a minute ago that we're

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:46,600
comparing upon so say we could use go

00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:48,340
and that gene number to figure out the

00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,150
relationship between the gene that I

00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:54,010
studied in any cellular processes

00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:57,160
alright so once we have extracted and

00:15:54,010 --> 00:16:00,820
transformed our data we load it into our

00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:04,300
bio link API and you can check out our

00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:08,470
API at both of these links here and then

00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:11,080
here is our github for the API and this

00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:13,540
is just a screenshot of what part of our

00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:15,400
API website looks like and there are

00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:19,480
several types of queries that we can do

00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:23,680
with on this page here for instance say

00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:27,040
you want to figure out you want to query

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:30,820
for a human and mice data that have AI

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:34,570
normal AHA I normal abnormal eyelid

00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:37,000
phenotypes or if you are a worm

00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:40,150
researcher you could look for all worm

00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,280
models of Parkinson's disease so those

00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:43,570
are just two examples of the types of

00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:47,920
queries we can do with this information

00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:49,780
and also if you're interested in a

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,820
particular disease you can go to our

00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:53,320
website and type in that disease and

00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:56,770
find all of the data that we have

00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:58,360
integrated about that disease this is an

00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:01,240
example of the data that we have on

00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:03,490
Marfan disorder and you can get to this

00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:05,020
by going to our website or you go to

00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:06,970
this link or you can go to our website

00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:09,100
and just search for Marfan disorder or

00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:12,220
search for say different disease or a

00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:15,550
phenotype and this is an overview page

00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:17,470
showing us again these RDF triples we

00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:20,020
have the subject relationship objects

00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:22,480
and then we also have information like

00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:25,150
what cc's that came from any evidence

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,520
related to that data the reference and

00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:29,530
then the database source and then we can

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:34,060
click on each of these gray tabs at the

00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:35,770
top to see that for our data we have 375

00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:37,480
phenotypes that are associated with

00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:39,669
Marfan disease

00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:43,150
also have genetic information genotypes

00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:45,490
other model organisms variants like

00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:48,520
genetic mutations that are all

00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:50,470
associated with Marfan disorder finally

00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:52,960
we can click on that compare tab there

00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:55,049
on the end and that brings up our Fino

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,270
grid tool that allows us to compare

00:17:55,049 --> 00:18:01,120
phenotypes between mark and disorder and

00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:06,850
other disorders from humans and other

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:08,860
model organisms data all right so our my

00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:12,130
final example of one of the tools that

00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:16,150
we use with our data is called eczemas

00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:18,429
or an exome Iser is a tool that has been

00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:21,280
collaborative collaboratively developed

00:18:18,429 --> 00:18:24,010
developed by us the Sanger Institute and

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:26,410
Shara tails and Sankar uses genetic

00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:30,280
information to try to find causes of

00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:31,960
disease in humans importantly it doesn't

00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,760
only use genetic information it

00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:36,280
integrates the genetic information with

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:39,730
phenotypes from humans and model

00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:42,340
organisms and previously exome Iser has

00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:44,740
been used to diagnose two patients that

00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:46,570
were undiagnosed by traditional methods

00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:49,990
like they went to the doctor and the

00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:53,770
doctor couldn't diagnose them and

00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:55,870
currently and the ones have 100,000

00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:58,840
genomes project and england is using

00:18:55,870 --> 00:19:01,330
exome Iser to try to diagnose lots of

00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:03,429
rare disease patients and so the

00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:05,440
takeaway from this is that when we

00:19:03,429 --> 00:19:07,690
integrate genetic information with

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,540
phenotype or symptom information from

00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:13,870
humans and model organisms we're able to

00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:16,090
have a real impact on human health so

00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:18,910
with that I want to thank all of my

00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:20,530
colleagues as I said we're international

00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:23,230
so we have colleagues from around the

00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:26,049
world and we're always looking for

00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:28,240
feedback part of my job is to collect

00:19:26,049 --> 00:19:31,120
feedback and help users with our tools

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,370
so and please go play around on our

00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,700
website and if you have any feedback you

00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:38,860
can email me I'm Winfrey at OHSU edu you

00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:40,360
can also find me on Twitter and I'm

00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:45,730
running the monarch initiative Twitter

00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:47,600
account - ah yeah um also I'm going to

00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:49,549
put in a little plug that we

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,860
are always looking for new people to

00:19:49,549 --> 00:19:55,730
join our team so if you're interested in

00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:57,530
developing tools like this just contact

00:19:55,730 --> 00:20:00,890
us you can contact me or you can email

00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:03,380
our info address and let us know and

00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:19,450
we're always looking for new talent all

00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:19,450
right I'll take any questions go back

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:35,330
and there are several challenges yeah

00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:37,730
and like we were start so as you can

00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:39,679
imagine that good data is very diverse

00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:43,159
and there are so many different sources

00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:47,510
that were pulling us um and so like I

00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:50,480
mentioned explain this so every time

00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:53,840
that we find that we pull in a source my

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:58,370
colleague Matt maps out this data and

00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:59,929
this can be time-consuming and so that's

00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:03,700
definitely our like next step of

00:20:59,929 --> 00:21:03,700
improvement is figuring out a way to

00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:10,370
take out the step kind of and integrate

00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:13,010
it better with our our main coding

00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:15,230
people so that's part of it and they

00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:17,630
were also always trying to improve our

00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:19,490
quality control and quality checks after

00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:22,150
we've integrated the data to make sure

00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:24,860
that we aren't making you know we are

00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:30,020
adding in a relationship that isn't true

00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:33,169
and and then yeah we're working on new

00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:35,780
tools we have a tool where we're you can

00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:38,510
put in a PDF of a paper and then it will

00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:42,289
pull out phenotypes by using natural

00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:44,330
language processing yeah and so it can

00:21:42,289 --> 00:21:46,039
pull out positive phenotypes really well

00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:49,580
right now and we're working on making it

00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:53,059
understand like and decreases or

00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:56,299
negatives you know like they do not have

00:21:53,059 --> 00:21:58,780
the phenotype so that's being developed

00:21:56,299 --> 00:21:58,780
right now too

00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:09,429
yeah we are working with slaughter with

00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:24,399
worm based on I don't actually know the

00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:25,570
second one yeah I yeah literally yeah I

00:22:24,399 --> 00:22:32,399
mean I bet we are

00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:35,950
but mmm look like that just get us a

00:22:32,399 --> 00:22:36,480
development death is like amazing there

00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:39,519
we go

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:42,909
yeah yeah so monarchs been around for

00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:44,919
about five years and are one of our P is

00:22:42,909 --> 00:22:46,090
is Melissa handle I thought oh a chassis

00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:50,980
you and she's been working with

00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:53,139
zebrafish database for a long time I was

00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:56,139
like Robin probably knows better but as

00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:59,070
yet it's at least five years under the

00:22:56,139 --> 00:22:59,070
the monarch name

00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:26,810
so this is meant for heavier that's a

00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:29,300
really good question I would like it I

00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:33,050
would like that answer to be yes that I

00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:34,940
don't know that it necessarily does have

00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:38,300
that much of an impact at the data

00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:40,070
creation level and a lot of what we're

00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:43,010
like a lot of the data that we're

00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:44,930
importing is like from model organism

00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:46,400
databases so they've already taken the

00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:49,280
data and kind of you know converted it

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,880
into their style but hopefully it would

00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:55,850
affect that yeah

00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:58,310
one more question or should we go okay

00:23:55,850 --> 00:24:03,400
thanks you guys

00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:03,400
