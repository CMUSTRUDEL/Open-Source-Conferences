hello everybody so it's a pleasure to

00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:07,550
have met some of you already at this

00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:09,769
conference and we're coming to an end

00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:13,249
now but I can see some places I haven't

00:00:09,769 --> 00:00:15,019
yet talked to so as Danielle said I have

00:00:13,249 --> 00:00:17,180
a biology background and I'm interested

00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:19,789
to know in the room today how many other

00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:22,580
biologists do we have cool

00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:23,539
how many academic research people do we

00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,710
have like even with the distant

00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:27,560
background that should be more than

00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:29,390
those hands okay good excellent everyone

00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,580
who didn't put the hands up

00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:36,920
are you they serve people are you open

00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:39,170
government data shout out out librarians

00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,730
are librarians okay so Danielle's

00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:46,520
introduced me to the love for librarians

00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:49,100
as well so okay brilliant I so what I'd

00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,170
like to do today is to convince you that

00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,269
I don't think I need to convince you but

00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,769
to convince you that it's worthwhile

00:00:52,269 --> 00:00:56,300
sharing data and biology and that

00:00:54,769 --> 00:00:58,250
there's some really cool things going on

00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,840
that might help us to share data better

00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:02,690
in biology and to bring research to life

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,670
by doing this and I'd like to persuade

00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:06,049
you because you may not know Hui life is

00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:08,270
and what we do and I might persuade you

00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:10,850
actually you know we are someone you can

00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:15,650
work with to help to get there via me

00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:17,329
hopefully I'm okay so everything here

00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:19,909
the slides are on github they're also in

00:01:17,329 --> 00:01:21,079
fix share there's this is not the most

00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:22,909
up-to-date version now and github

00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:23,840
because there's some insight exciting

00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:25,490
stuff has happened on Twitter though

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,060
I've just added into my talk so I will I

00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:32,060
will update but that's the link and

00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:33,590
everything CC by so a little about Elife

00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:39,740
before I really dig into the main topic

00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:41,930
and so we are we are a collaboration

00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:44,270
between research funders these three in

00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:48,380
particular our founding research funders

00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:51,259
forty life and working scientists and

00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:53,360
basically what happened is that the e

00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:55,640
life of an organization was founded five

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,070
years ago to address the fact that

00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:00,289
working scientists were frustrated with

00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:01,990
the delays in publishing their research

00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:04,130
in communicating their research and also

00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:06,079
funders and scientists wanted to be able

00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:07,549
to work more openly and collaboratively

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,259
an assistant just wasn't allowing them

00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:10,730
to do that so we're a mission-based

00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:11,390
organization trying to do that and this

00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,400
is our mission

00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:15,080
so to accelerate discovery are you let's

00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,120
make peer review quicker

00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:20,150
by operating the platform so we run

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,790
Elife the online open access journal and

00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:24,230
we're a not-for-profit that encourages

00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,730
and recognizes the most responsible

00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:28,070
behaviour in science and by that we mean

00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:30,620
openness transparency being cooperative

00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:33,920
and collaborative and there's a lot to

00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:36,860
work on there and so using the leverage

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,570
as a journal we've recently embarked on

00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:40,340
this innovation initiative which is what

00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:43,520
gave me my job fantastic

00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:46,070
what we do is we actively champion open

00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:49,190
source tools technologies and processes

00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:52,210
that help researchers to discover share

00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:55,460
consume and evaluate the latest research

00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:56,660
um I think it's really important that

00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,550
we're committed to open source

00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,720
development both with the technologies

00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,580
that we're developing ourselves in how

00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,500
city life so we've recently not recently

00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:05,120
last year we released a continuous

00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,920
publishing platform called continuum so

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,450
other journals can have daily

00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,270
publication platform if they want and

00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:14,720
not use tools out there by the other

00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:16,160
boxers and but also we are connected

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,140
open sourcing the tools that we support

00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,360
and showcase from the external

00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:22,150
environment and this is because we're

00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,490
looking to affect a wide reaching change

00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:27,110
with so that whatever we do it's not

00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:28,730
just to make a life great of course it

00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:30,410
is we want to deliver the best to our

00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:32,450
readers and our authors and our users

00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,920
but it's so that everyone can benefit in

00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:35,209
the whole community can take it on and

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,350
people can make their own journals or

00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:38,360
other journals can take on these new

00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:40,670
tools is we really are looking to affect

00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:43,310
that broad change I'm to give you a

00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:45,380
flavor some of the tools that interests

00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:47,959
us we showcase on this blog a life lab

00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:49,400
so the URLs in bottom left corner this

00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:50,810
is now my job as well so if you feel

00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,370
there aren't enough blog coming out I

00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:54,290
mean that's the valid complaint simply

00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:56,420
tell me and I'll get on it

00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:57,680
oh but also if you have an idea or

00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,120
something to talk about let me know

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,240
because we could showcase you in our

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:05,480
blog um we also support the development

00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,380
of tools so science there yeah you're

00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,420
right excellent

00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:10,370
so phones in the room know what sites

00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:12,650
are is already the science fair is a

00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:15,110
desktop application for discovering and

00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:16,910
reading research articles offline in an

00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:18,940
alternative formats of PDF so this is

00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:22,760
the e life lens format the side by side

00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:24,890
much nicer experience and this is the

00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,110
update so Richard today Richard is the

00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:28,300
one who's developing science

00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:30,460
he loves the betta today so he's looking

00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,710
for tested so please do if you know what

00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,000
you're doing when you come to like

00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:36,219
applications get in touch with Richard

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,479
please but it's really exciting to be

00:04:36,219 --> 00:04:40,780
open support that's we found that out by

00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:41,710
an informal communication and we thought

00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,969
that's a great idea

00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:44,530
and we support the development of a

00:04:42,969 --> 00:04:46,330
prototype of that so that's what we're

00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:49,599
capable puts capable of doing through

00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:51,250
life I'm so quick plug if you do have

00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:53,500
any ideas or tools that you want support

00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,539
for development of a specific thing come

00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:58,930
talk to me I've got business cards I've

00:04:55,539 --> 00:05:00,819
got cool jazzy postcards that don't have

00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:02,020
specific light on them they go so these

00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:05,319
are recent a recent addition to our

00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:07,180
marketing classes so this is okay so

00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:09,219
wonderful effort by Nick and marina a

00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,240
back at Lee like office and but yeah

00:05:09,219 --> 00:05:12,370
that's pretty cool if you want to put

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,430
them up at your local institution or

00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:17,590
wherever anyway okay so onto the main

00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:20,229
meat of the proctor presentation so why

00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:21,879
share data in biology and a written data

00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:23,560
plot in appreciation of fact that

00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:25,000
there's no point sharing data if you're

00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,650
not going to share the underlying code

00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,909
that transforms and visualizes and

00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:29,919
analyzes that data makes that you

00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:33,270
thought people I'm so I'm kind of

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:36,190
merging those terms a little bit here so

00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:38,680
let's go back a few hundred years to

00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:40,089
Isaac Newton if I have seen further it's

00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,440
by standing on the shoulders of giants

00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:43,089
and this really encapsulates that

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,919
founding principle of science which is

00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:47,020
that we make advances by building on

00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:48,460
each other's work we can only do that if

00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,889
people have described and shared their

00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:52,360
work clearly and completely which is

00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:55,330
what data sharing is all about let's get

00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,800
everything out there I'm showing me the

00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:58,089
evidence we need people to be able to

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,430
back up what it is that they're saying

00:05:58,089 --> 00:06:01,689
in their research articles and sharing

00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,860
the data behind it and the code behind

00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:06,849
it is one way to do that

00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:07,270
I'm and a little more recently max

00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:09,219
Perutz

00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:11,680
true science drives best in glass houses

00:06:09,219 --> 00:06:13,270
where everyone can look in and I feel

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,150
that actually even more recently it was

00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:17,919
another addition Rufus Pollock tweeted

00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:20,650
something he said before which is that

00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,539
all tomate do everything with your own

00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:24,069
data no matter whether you think you own

00:06:22,539 --> 00:06:25,330
that data or not like but you can't do

00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:27,520
it all and other people have different

00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,810
ideas and different skills and so

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,819
putting your data out there is the best

00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:33,669
way to really get value out of that work

00:06:30,819 --> 00:06:34,779
you've already done so specifically to

00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:36,339
biology so there were quite a lot

00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:38,289
biologists in the room but for those of

00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:39,760
you that aren't in biology you might

00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:42,580
think why why

00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:44,050
focus on biology here so there's some

00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:46,000
really good reasons to do that we've

00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:47,170
heard some talks already like lilies

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,110
earlier today about how you can help

00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:52,120
people diagnose rare diseases but just

00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,800
run through a couple of examples so neck

00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,630
strain is the tool that's just one the

00:06:53,800 --> 00:07:00,700
open science prize and what they do is

00:06:55,630 --> 00:07:03,430
they use open genetic data to form this

00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:05,400
display which tracks the strain the

00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:10,330
current strain of a virus so like a

00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:12,190
bowler and beaker so that health health

00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:13,990
organizations and policymakers can

00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:15,820
understand what the current state of an

00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:18,190
epidemic is and what the very virus is

00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:19,630
that and even which countries it's in

00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:21,550
which is seems a little bit scary but

00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:23,470
it'll see what's really useful to do I

00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:24,700
so sharing data like that and the

00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:27,100
genomics community is pretty good at

00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,840
doing that they've got President but it

00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:31,360
can have real utility for global health

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,670
it also allows community to spot

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,760
problems so it was reiterated last year

00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:39,160
in this paper that genomics data genetic

00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:41,860
data in Excel is vulnerable to the

00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:44,580
autocorrect function so gene names like

00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:47,050
set two gets corrected to a date and

00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:48,910
gene identifiers like this one here get

00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,410
auto corrected to floating point numbers

00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:51,430
and unless you're aware that that's

00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,780
happening it's going to affect your

00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,160
interpretation of your results but

00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:55,540
because the genetic data sets are out

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,820
there someone's been able to look at all

00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:00,520
of them and spot that this vulnerability

00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:03,730
affects one in five research articles in

00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:06,580
genetics and actually the value of open

00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:10,600
data might become more obvious when the

00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:12,190
data isn't open so there's also a bug

00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:17,050
spotted in software that's used to

00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:19,180
analyze fMRI data last year and that bug

00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:21,700
called into question the analysis of a

00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:23,950
lot of them are of neuroimaging data but

00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,270
typically that community doesn't archive

00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:27,010
that data well it doesn't share it share

00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:28,870
it much so we don't really know the

00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:30,130
impact of what that blog could have been

00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:31,510
and there's no way to go back and

00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:33,820
reanalyze so I'm just going to move

00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:35,380
forward as a community from that point

00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:37,270
and understand it from now but we can't

00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:39,550
the can't make use of going back with

00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:43,000
you can't really say if it was a problem

00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:44,740
or not because it's not shared okay so I

00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,790
hope I've convinced you that it's really

00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,560
worthwhile tackling the problem in

00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:49,330
biology because it's direct implications

00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:52,640
to the value of research and also to

00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:53,870
global health and where we might get to

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,070
they're actually making biomedical

00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:58,459
research worthwhile which is what

00:08:55,070 --> 00:09:00,290
everyone wants to do it for so now do we

00:08:58,459 --> 00:09:03,589
share data in biology so what is the

00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:06,829
state of open data and by open data here

00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:08,120
is important to know that open oh yes so

00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:10,430
we're gonna get to the oh my gosh listen

00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,990
y'all talk to you so often and I might

00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:16,430
skip over this I gotta leave this Robin

00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:17,899
okay open data should be useful and if

00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,610
it's useful it's because it's findable

00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:22,700
that's for interoperable and reusable

00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:24,170
I'm not just accessible and shared you

00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,510
don't like it has to be reasonable but

00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:29,180
Robin Hood took my bad I've seen too

00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:31,089
recent survey published by the Wellcome

00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:34,970
Trust which is a funder and figshare

00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:36,800
about attitudes to opening opening

00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:38,870
research and data in the life sciences

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,370
and basically what these surveys have

00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:43,220
said is that about three-quarters of

00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:44,570
biologists are aware of open data half

00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,579
of them make their data available in

00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:49,209
some form but it's not all open access

00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:50,990
and it may not be in the best way and

00:09:49,209 --> 00:09:53,930
accorded them do you make the full

00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:55,220
dataset available and and so obviously

00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:57,019
we've got a lot of way to go to make

00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,130
that everybody but it's worth noting

00:09:57,019 --> 00:09:59,810
here it doesn't necessarily need to be

00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,760
everybody because we're really working

00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:04,519
towards something that Heather said

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,440
yesterday is that making data as openly

00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:07,940
available as possible but as close as

00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,910
appropriate because some data you just

00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:12,769
can't share okay so we've got a

00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:14,540
worthwhile problem and we've got a

00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:18,110
problem like we know that we're not

00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:19,310
doing badly maybe Robin descries but you

00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,839
know we've got room for improvement so

00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:22,880
there's work to be done here so what

00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:26,060
work is being done and what can we do

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,980
more so I hope now I'm going to expect

00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:30,800
you a little bit about the tools and

00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,550
technologies out there um what excites

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,610
me anyway

00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:36,529
so that's good um so what can we do to

00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:37,730
improve Jake sharing I'm just going to

00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:39,980
run through it in this kind of format

00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:41,240
this work from my brain which is that

00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:43,760
we've got this kind of workflow of

00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,230
growing from publishing to actually

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,699
recognizing and get credit so I'm just

00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:51,860
going to answer in that order so

00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:53,990
reputable journals and funders do have

00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,760
data sharing policies and they say that

00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:57,949
when you publish your work you should be

00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,380
sharing that data behind that and you

00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:02,720
like definitely enforces that um and

00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:04,520
what we do next to the figures is a

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,590
figure from any life paper and the data

00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,540
the figures got its own DOI SATs GREs

00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:09,770
and the source data set is linked to

00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:12,710
that figure so it really connects the

00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:13,700
dots for the reader I'm but of course

00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:15,410
that doesn't necessarily mean the data

00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,850
that people are sharing is high-quality

00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:20,330
we've heard that discussed already in

00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:21,890
the conference I'm and also there have

00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:23,420
been efforts to create new journals to

00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:26,450
really give data the pride of place in

00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:28,040
the publishing system and so you can

00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:29,570
publish a description of your data and

00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,550
that gives credit to the people who've

00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:34,850
done all the hard work in like analyzing

00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:37,040
bring together that data and it like

00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:38,360
points to the incentives that already

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,160
exist for researchers by having a

00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,380
publication so that's also great in

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,700
these open access um

00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:45,500
but both of these efforts they still

00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,860
keep the data separate from the research

00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:50,420
narrative and I think that we can do

00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:52,460
better that I think we can integrate

00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:53,690
that data and that code that are into

00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,100
the research narrative so that people

00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:56,990
who really want to dig into that

00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:01,040
narrative when they're at the face of

00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:03,560
the research article can do um so can we

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,270
bring the data closer so I'm going to

00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:08,060
show a couple of examples from or thoria

00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:10,670
which is an online authoring platform um

00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:12,560
so what they've done is this is an

00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:14,600
interactive figure so it's also driven

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,940
they also defined what it is that they

00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,680
want to show the reader using d3 yes

00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:20,060
we've heard about that fair as well but

00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,130
here is the reader I can interact with

00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:24,290
these plots and I can see the value is I

00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:26,270
can see what relation these four plots

00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:28,850
have to each other so if that's quite

00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:30,320
cool as a reader to really enhance my

00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:32,270
experience and to dive in and to

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,820
understand that data beyond a static

00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:38,330
plot there's also the acceptable figure

00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:40,700
so it's worth noting here like an apple

00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:42,590
ad this actually takes a lot longer time

00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,670
than what I'm going to show you and

00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:46,700
that's one of the problems we face at

00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:48,320
the moment but what or thoria did is

00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:51,440
they embedded an eye Python notebook

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,600
into their their blog effectively um and

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,130
when you run this ipython notebook I'm

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,540
sure some of you are aware already but

00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:59,720
you have these code blocks that you can

00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:02,480
execute as you go through it is ordered

00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,440
unlike the d3 one but what I can do once

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,260
I've gone through an ex feature of the

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,790
code box I can change the graph the axes

00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:09,380
so that I can change because the plot to

00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:11,540
what I want to see that's a really

00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:13,520
simple modification but you can imagine

00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:15,410
how that might spin out to something

00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,880
where you as a researcher I'm inspired

00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:18,410
by something they've done and maybe had

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,910
your own sort and tested your own theory

00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:26,100
out on one someone's research data

00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:27,750
from the article I'm binder is a service

00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,520
that makes it easier for authors to

00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:33,420
deploy these kind of expectable projects

00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:36,750
by launching by basically using a docker

00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:39,540
container to package up the data and the

00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:41,910
code in a github repository I'm and it's

00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:43,470
also an application for readers so you

00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:45,900
can launch a binder from wherever the

00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:47,580
authors put it and then it spins up in

00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:49,470
their browser and they can play around

00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,940
like that notebook so they do it reduced

00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,600
to notebooks I in their browser

00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,460
environment

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,140
I'm binder is something that was

00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,910
developed by researchers at the janilla

00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:59,970
Research campus last year and it's still

00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:01,980
being developed and we've got a blog

00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:05,160
about it so polish and do again the labs

00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:06,060
post it explains it in their words what

00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,270
it is they're trying to achieve with

00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:12,060
bind on Hanks very interesting story and

00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:14,130
it's not just about generating plots but

00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:16,080
also you can if you start to use more

00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:18,450
the computational packages available to

00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:21,150
describe your research like languages

00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:23,550
like our markdown you can also include

00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:24,810
the statistical analysis in in your work

00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:26,910
and you can hard code in that

00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:28,260
statistical computation so what that

00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:30,330
means is you avoid the human area of

00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:34,380
copy and pasting data from proprietary

00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:35,700
stats packages software's but also it

00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,440
means that if you come across new data

00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,660
all you have to do is add in loading the

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,670
new data and just run your R markdown

00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,600
and it's already updated for you and you

00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,370
don't have to go through a massive

00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,230
hassle of trying to redo all your

00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:47,730
research again because you've just had a

00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:50,940
new data suddenly before you wanted to

00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:52,200
submit a massive benefit this is not

00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,250
just about the author's communicating

00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,230
their research but it's about the whole

00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:57,030
community benefiting from being able to

00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:58,500
dig back into this research so while

00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,970
speaking to Steven Eglin who's the

00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,490
nearest scientist in Cambridge recently

00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:03,930
and back you know years ago in 2014 he

00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:05,640
published something in Giga sighs he

00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:07,440
published a data description in Giga

00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,610
science but he had the r markdown file

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,410
available and he gave it to the

00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:12,570
reviewers and both reviewers were able

00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:14,160
to reproduce what he'd done and one of

00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:16,590
them even said actually I disagree on

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,090
how you under the failure views on your

00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:19,770
plot and I'm going to reduce myself and

00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:21,150
I'm going to modify it and show you what

00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:22,440
I want you to put in your paper and he

00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:24,990
agreed and so he basically did is

00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:28,260
recision for him

00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:30,300
um so none of this really gets us very

00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:32,310
far unless we can intensifies

00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:34,620
researchers to follow these practices

00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:37,350
because you know there is a there is a

00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:39,420
learning curve here I'm and at the

00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:40,709
moment for sure the publishing workflow

00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,420
does not support this you can do loads

00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:43,200
of things on the authoring side which is

00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,940
fantastic

00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,200
and you can do things on the other side

00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:48,240
like you can have your own website and

00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,410
put up a visualization but if you want

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,410
to submit to a journal you're still

00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:53,610
going to submit a PDF or a word document

00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:57,089
and that's what's got to go through and

00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:58,470
it loses all of that enhancement um so

00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:01,200
there's something that I really want to

00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:02,190
work on with Elife but I've gone off on

00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,529
a little bit of a tangent note but

00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:06,690
basically there's not much incentive to

00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:09,149
do this at the moment so people in order

00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:11,700
to share more of their data they are - a

00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:13,529
movement swimming upstream one way that

00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:15,149
people are trying to incentivize

00:16:13,529 --> 00:16:18,540
researchers to tap into the reputation

00:16:15,149 --> 00:16:20,270
economy and put badges next to articles

00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:23,610
that do have data available with them

00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:26,160
and hopefully there that's good datasets

00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:27,360
that's good good shared data identify

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,740
from science has been doing this and

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,070
have a series of badges one of them is

00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:33,480
open data I'm and it has been questioned

00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:35,820
as to whether this is effective but they

00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:37,860
have published an article was it last

00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,329
year I think was lost yes I'm about a

00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:41,010
pilot they did with psychological

00:16:39,329 --> 00:16:42,390
science which is psychology journal and

00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:45,089
the red line indicates where they

00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:47,240
introduced these badges and you can see

00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:49,860
that there's a massive uptake in

00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:52,020
articles that report to be sharing data

00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:54,930
or have data available I'm after the

00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:56,160
badges were introduced and this is a bit

00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,779
more of a complex graph but what it

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,060
shows that blue line at the top is that

00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:01,560
is the journal after the badges and as

00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,870
we go from left to right you go from

00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,459
data is available to data is complete

00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:07,079
and reusable and good and that's what we

00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:09,270
want to see and you can see this there's

00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:10,949
a higher rate of nice complete shared

00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,730
data from the blue line where they've

00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:13,260
got the badges

00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:14,699
compared to journals that don't have the

00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,350
values or the journal before the badges

00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:17,850
introduced so you know there's evidence

00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:19,740
that it does drive up the quality of the

00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:23,760
eggs sharing as well and there are also

00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:26,699
community efforts to understand how

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,559
better and to understand the impact of

00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:30,809
sharing their data and also ask the

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,610
community how good am I at it you know

00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:35,070
what is the quality of my shared data so

00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:37,020
professor Martin Vesely at EPFL in

00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:38,500
Lausanne has this website where whenever

00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:41,350
he publishes he puts the

00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:43,300
at all on the abstract online and he has

00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:44,800
linked to his code and github and links

00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:48,030
to the data and it's the PDF for the

00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:50,680
article and he even asks you can see

00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:54,100
here he asked the community to rate his

00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:56,140
food so you go there okay how easy was

00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:58,600
it to reproduce the figures was the code

00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:00,850
well commented was the code easy to

00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:02,230
apply to new scenarios your comments are

00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:04,200
really appreciated but not many

00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:07,150
researchers though it's open

00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:10,900
so you can tell him like how good was my

00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:12,400
my sharing and also he then tracks how

00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:14,230
the papers how the research going down

00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,730
how many downloads have there been of

00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:19,510
the PDF the code the data and citations

00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:21,880
so I think it's really interesting that

00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:24,130
community there's clearly appetite to

00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:27,510
drive forward quality here and we should

00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:33,850
do what we can to leverage that that I

00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:36,520
what I Camaros and yeah okay so finally

00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:38,680
if we're connecting up data like it's

00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:41,680
all very well to have data associated

00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:42,730
with the single publication but there's

00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,230
a real value I think we can appreciate

00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:45,640
the real value in datasets when they

00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:47,290
come together as a group and that's been

00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,270
shown to us already today but various

00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:50,770
other projects and there are efforts to

00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:53,110
do this in a machine-readable way with

00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:54,820
linked open data I'm but I'd like to

00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,900
quickly talk about a human way so

00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:58,120
there's another project that we're

00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:00,180
supporting the development of guerito

00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:02,590
Goyle and James Aiken last year a

00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:05,680
conference presented this idea what if

00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:07,000
you could link up figures that you see

00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:09,070
that relate to the same experimental

00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,540
hypothesis and maybe you're seeing the

00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:11,650
same result over and over done by

00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,300
different labs and you want to collect

00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:15,640
those figures together like you're doing

00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,960
a literature review and so that it kind

00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,150
of gives you an essence of how

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,950
reproducible that finding for that

00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:22,360
hypothesis was and they're so developing

00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:24,550
this that's called refigure it's going

00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,600
to be a Chrome extension so you can link

00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:28,060
up these figures and create collections

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,470
I'm really really excited to be seeing

00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:31,360
this developed right now and it's not a

00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:34,960
beach available yet they are further

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:36,190
behind in science fair I'm okay so I

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,420
hope I've convinced you I'm coming soon

00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:38,860
to my time I hope I've convinced you

00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:41,170
that it's worthwhile sharing data and

00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:43,090
biology that we could do better and

00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:45,250
there's lots of opportunity to do better

00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:47,050
and now I quite like to quickly run

00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:50,080
through why we should do this fire

00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:51,940
you'll I provide the journal and because

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,620
actually a lot of the blockers now or

00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:55,149
what some the main challenges are that

00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:57,340
there's constraints of the publisher

00:19:55,149 --> 00:19:58,779
that we need to address so we have to

00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:00,549
just to make this clear we have to

00:19:58,779 --> 00:20:02,289
present a static version of the

00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:04,059
peer-reviewed article to the reader when

00:20:02,289 --> 00:20:07,659
they hit the page and any anything you

00:20:04,059 --> 00:20:09,279
do beyond that like is an extension and

00:20:07,659 --> 00:20:10,899
we're responsible for persistence and

00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:13,120
for accuracy in research that's reported

00:20:10,899 --> 00:20:14,259
that's the point of peer-review analyst

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,509
these open questions of who's going to

00:20:14,259 --> 00:20:18,639
store this data who's going to host this

00:20:16,509 --> 00:20:19,720
process who's going to compute who's

00:20:18,639 --> 00:20:22,210
going to pay for that compute

00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:24,100
open questions and we've also got to

00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:25,419
address the habits of the user to the

00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,590
researchers and this has been talked

00:20:25,419 --> 00:20:28,350
about as well in this conference already

00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:31,269
what a great conference topic to look at

00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:33,490
so using the 101 innovations data from

00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:35,769
Bianca Cremona are important if you look

00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:37,470
at life scientists who are analyzing

00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:40,720
their data using data analysis tools

00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:42,759
Excel is the clear winner I'm nice to

00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,350
see an open sore computational language

00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:47,440
comes second but it's closely followed

00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:49,269
by proprietary software solutions and

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,679
we've heard a bit about since LOL nicko

00:20:49,269 --> 00:20:53,230
amazing i don't think it's in the room

00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:54,340
but he's no he's there excellent so he's

00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:55,539
trying to address this he trying to make

00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:57,970
something it looks a bit more like Excel

00:20:55,539 --> 00:20:59,049
but it's a computational or notebook so

00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:02,139
that's great we'll see where that goes

00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:04,269
um and we've got a couple of outstanding

00:21:02,139 --> 00:21:10,149
issues but I think almost up in the room

00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:13,179
will appreciate them so just to end on

00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:14,500
this slide what I'd like to convince you

00:21:13,179 --> 00:21:16,840
that there's a massive opportunity here

00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:19,090
and if we facilitate data sharing by the

00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,110
journal what we can do is we can use the

00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:21,879
fact that we're responsible for

00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:23,139
persistence and we have to think about

00:21:21,879 --> 00:21:24,820
that we can use the fact that we're

00:21:23,139 --> 00:21:26,649
leveraging an incentive system that

00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:28,899
makes sense to researchers already and

00:21:26,649 --> 00:21:31,360
that what the blocker is at the moment

00:21:28,899 --> 00:21:33,129
is trying to streamline the process from

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,539
initial discovery where authors already

00:21:33,129 --> 00:21:36,120
doing some really innovative things to

00:21:34,539 --> 00:21:38,139
help themselves at that stage to

00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:40,029
replication where people also want to be

00:21:38,139 --> 00:21:41,529
able to you know use publish research

00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:42,669
better and we know that's try to

00:21:41,529 --> 00:21:43,600
streamline that process and make it

00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:45,610
easier for everybody

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,629
and we engage a community around the

00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:48,220
journal there's a whole community of

00:21:46,629 --> 00:21:49,539
senior researchers early career

00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:51,460
researchers and they care about their

00:21:49,539 --> 00:21:53,259
research and we can access those people

00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:55,059
I'm doing an open source I don't need to

00:21:53,259 --> 00:21:57,279
convince you but obviously it means that

00:21:55,059 --> 00:21:59,049
we can share it beyond our single

00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:00,730
organization and we can stimulate others

00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:04,450
to do better and go beyond what we've

00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:05,860
done I'm okay I'm going to finish there

00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:07,750
very quickly because I really want to

00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:09,010
here what your thoughts are about this I

00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:11,530
might miss something really obvious

00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:14,260
maybe I've inspired you to think that

00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:16,240
it's a problem you want to work on maybe

00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:17,549
you think it's terrible no I'm you know

00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,960
this is not going to go anywhere

00:22:17,549 --> 00:22:23,400
basically do you have any thoughts ideas

00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,400
feedback questions

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,409
