hi everyone how are you doing well I

00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:16,590
hope I'm doing alright thanks so much

00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,630
for coming out to the room wandering

00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:21,240
down many twisty passages all alike and

00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,070
finding yourself in this back room I'm

00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,230
here to talk about a better edit button

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,920
for you get hub posted data

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:31,380
hi I'm posh I'm a developer advocate at

00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:35,250
Mozilla and I've been at Mozilla with uh

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:39,350
just last week for seven years which in

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:42,060
developer years is a thousand years

00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:44,370
obviously I have something I like

00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:47,700
something there I am a developer

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:49,140
advocate which means my job is to learn

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,350
about awesome stuff that's coming in

00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,700
Firefox and come do audiences like you

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,130
and get you all super-excited about it

00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:58,110
and then hear everything that you hate

00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:00,450
and come back and advocate to get it

00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:02,610
fixed both sides of those jobs are

00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:04,769
really important today I am NOT going to

00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:08,030
be pitching you about Firefox at all I

00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:10,830
am at CSP cough because I want to be and

00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:13,410
Mozilla said if I spoke they would pay

00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,640
for me to travel so here I am I didn't

00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:16,050
really want to come to this event for a

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,800
while now and I'm really excited to be

00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:20,760
here just a quick recap I wouldn't be

00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,220
doing my job I didn't

00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,990
Mozilla not-for-profit you probably know

00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,130
it because we make Firefox we do all

00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,930
kinds of other stuff it's actually a

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,150
frame there of people in this room who

00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:33,510
might know that we also sponsor things

00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:36,540
like the Mozilla science lab and a bunch

00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:39,030
of other open data open journalism and

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,800
just web focus things they're trying to

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,350
unless the web and to open this up the

00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,760
web improve all walks of life I'm happy

00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:47,040
to talk your ear off about any of those

00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,540
things afterward and even though I'm not

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,290
here to talk about Firefox if you've got

00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,680
complaints I am here find the logo let

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,090
me have it

00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:58,650
okay so you know CSV comp you know it's

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:02,040
a great little joke and you look at the

00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:05,430
badges and we've got this grid on our

00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,979
badge right and even though you know

00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:10,950
it's the CSV comp is this CSV no it's

00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:13,680
not CSV it's a table and why is it a

00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:15,460
table because most of us when we think

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,050
of messing the CSV data we

00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:24,930
this or Google Spreadsheets or numbers

00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:28,270
or you know these are calc right

00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:32,080
hopefully not bad for your sake but you

00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:33,580
don't think of this big file full of

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,580
text and comments you think of this

00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:41,770
interface and why is that because

00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:43,510
editing raw daily is non-ideal you know

00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:45,370
I'm sure we've all gone in and had to

00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:47,110
manually clean up one of these files and

00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:51,520
it's not pleasant it sucks

00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:52,840
so why do we have these interfaces

00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,910
because they're easier it's so much

00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:58,510
easier even Excel for all its warts is

00:02:54,910 --> 00:03:00,460
an easier interface so we've got all

00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:02,650
this data and we're finally coming

00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:04,240
around to the idea of open data and we

00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,620
want to share this data all over the

00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,630
internet we don't make it easier for

00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,670
other people to discover our data to

00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:11,500
help us polish it help us clean it to

00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:13,300
add their own data to contribute to

00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,940
collaborate to combine and make

00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:17,860
something better and right now the

00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:21,490
number one place we tend to put things

00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:24,370
is github right CSV files on github JSON

00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:28,300
files on github tabular files on github

00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:31,870
all those things shape files and that's

00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:34,360
awesome except for one little thing the

00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:37,180
flow to edit that data used to be go

00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:39,850
find your CSV file open it up in here

00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:41,140
and then email it back help them make

00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:43,090
some changes or maybe you have a shared

00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,800
folder you know all those things you

00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,990
know github is better for collaboration

00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,870
but when it comes time to edit you

00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:51,190
create a github account you open the

00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:53,200
command line you get clone or you can

00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,280
click the button there apps you check

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,500
out and make a new branch if you're

00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,090
being polite then you do all the amazing

00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,300
data work that you're really good at

00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:03,280
this is the fun part right and then you

00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,810
add that file back to the repo and you

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,150
commit you can craft the Pitti commit

00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:09,130
message and then you push it probably to

00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:11,740
your fork of the project not the primary

00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:13,480
project and then you open a pull request

00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:15,970
and you explain what your changes were

00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:18,520
and you submit your commits that you've

00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:20,470
made and then a discussion in cease and

00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,640
you respond to feedback and sometimes

00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,590
they have a really great constructive

00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,780
feedback oh can you make me we're trying

00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:27,190
to keep this particular style or Oh

00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,370
things like there's a typo here can you

00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:33,430
go back and then you go back to

00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:35,650
and this and this and your beat and this

00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:37,479
is a great flow for people who are super

00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:41,740
comfortable to command-line that is not

00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:43,360
all people and that's okay I think one

00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:47,740
of the things we give up and we put our

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:49,659
data in github is we give up access to

00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:53,349
this huge community of people who are

00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:55,150
Excel absolute wizards or spreadsheet

00:04:53,349 --> 00:04:56,650
ninjas and they can go in and massage

00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,939
your data and they've seen every

00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:00,069
terrible thing that's ever happened to a

00:04:57,939 --> 00:05:01,629
CSV file and they know how to fix it

00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:05,919
and all those people might not know

00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:08,379
github or get it is dark wizardry let's

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,819
face it you you can become a Time Lord

00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:15,099
and rewrite history but at a

00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:16,810
tremendously steep learning curve there

00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:18,460
are happy your paths and the path I just

00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:20,529
subscribe there are many desktop clients

00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,089
to let you grab something and edit it

00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:23,650
and send it back but you still have to

00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:27,550
kind of they're all really leaky

00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:29,050
abstractions you have to kind of really

00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,819
know what's going on they don't really

00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:32,439
cover up all that nasty complexity and

00:05:30,819 --> 00:05:35,469
those good reasons get is very complex

00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:38,289
github does a tremendous job for there

00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:39,370
for you know what they do at covering up

00:05:38,289 --> 00:05:42,699
some of that stuff but you really can't

00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:45,069
avoid it finally a couple years ago get

00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:47,610
I've added the edit button which is a

00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:52,539
Mike one of the best things to happen to

00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:56,169
like non you know non coder contribution

00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:57,399
to github hosted projects ever what does

00:05:56,169 --> 00:06:00,219
that look like right we've got the

00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:03,129
beautiful CSP conference website in

00:06:00,219 --> 00:06:04,689
github because they're mensches and take

00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:07,330
a look we've got this CSV file that's

00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:09,039
the schedule for this week and get up is

00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:11,589
already they've done all this great work

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,330
around visualizing existing data right

00:06:11,589 --> 00:06:14,319
so we're not showing us a CSV file they

00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:16,930
already know that that's not a great

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,460
idea they actually show a table here and

00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:19,599
you can view the raw version but by

00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:22,149
default they show you this nice table

00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:23,710
and they added this edit button which is

00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:25,060
even if you don't have access this

00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:27,159
repository what it's going to do it's

00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:29,229
going to make a fork send you over to

00:06:27,159 --> 00:06:30,999
your fork let you make changes describe

00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:33,159
what you did and make it really easy to

00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:37,190
create a pull request so what happens if

00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:40,220
you click the edit button look familiar

00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:42,170
we're dumped back into textmode what you

00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,550
could do is copy this save it to your

00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:45,410
computer or paste it into your

00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:47,420
spreadsheet editor of choice make a

00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:49,460
bunch of changes re-exported the CSV

00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:51,320
file probably changing the formatting of

00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:53,270
every single line in here accidentally

00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,100
pasting it back into this box

00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:57,890
scrolling down describing your changing

00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:59,990
changes and then submitting it and then

00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:02,810
the rest of the flow happens oh you make

00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:05,390
Merritt week repeat that's kind of

00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:06,560
cumbersome but it is a pass and I'm sure

00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:08,990
there are people who do that exact thing

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,390
right when presented with editing raw

00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:13,280
data like this they're going to just use

00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:16,760
their clipboard make changes and come

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,110
back even if you are a hardcore Emacs

00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,310
user you're going to copy this into

00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:21,080
Emacs to make your changes because you

00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:22,880
want to be able to sling lines to

00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,890
eternity this interface is great for

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,990
quick typo fixes this interface is great

00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:29,390
for all kinds of things but and it's

00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:31,040
amazing that github offers it praise

00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:33,050
ticket home for even offering this stuff

00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:36,920
and making this easier but it is still

00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:37,910
ultimately editing raw data how can we

00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,890
do better

00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:41,690
because in my mind not everyone needs to

00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:43,940
learn to code I actually think that's

00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:45,940
really important I love this push to

00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:48,890
help people learn to code who want to

00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:50,150
you know as a college dropout learning

00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:51,230
to code is the reason I'm standing here

00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:53,270
right

00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:55,130
like 32 code opens all kinds of awesome

00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:56,780
opportunities it helps you think about

00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:58,550
problems and new ways and how you take

00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:01,940
apart problems it's a really really

00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:03,260
great tool and your tool set but I don't

00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,870
think everyone should ultimately be a

00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:08,600
coder there's this big this is subtle

00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:10,160
trend that's going along with data

00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,770
moving into github and to learn to code

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,560
culture which is oh you found a typo on

00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:17,740
our website go ahead at this react

00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,900
javascript file that's where the text is

00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:22,700
or you want to localize it right and

00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:26,720
also you need to have your entire build

00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:28,040
tool chain right I'm we we on one hand

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,190
we're making it so much easier and so

00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:32,870
much more quick to build all this stuff

00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:35,030
but we're really really sacrificing the

00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:37,370
ability of people who are incredible

00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:40,580
data Wranglers incredible copywriters

00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:41,930
amazing data editors people who are

00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,520
willing to put in the time are

00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:44,620
enthusiastic and want to contribute to

00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,080
your project and your

00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:48,310
putting up huge technical barriers

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,930
everyone should have the ability and

00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:54,339
opportunity to learn to code if they

00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:57,000
want to it is awful and fun you will

00:08:54,339 --> 00:08:59,830
hate and love the skills you are gaining

00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,529
but I don't think everyone should need

00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:05,050
to learn to code to be part of the

00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:07,750
online participatory culture I really

00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:13,029
strongly believe that so what if we had

00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:15,730
a github for data well so there are some

00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:18,250
tools out there but a lot of data does

00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:19,630
live in github and especially very small

00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,040
one-off data sets and may even make

00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:25,510
sense for the data to live in github

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:29,200
alongside the code that's great

00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:31,750
but how do we create a github for data

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:35,980
or better yet retrofit github it's

00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:39,430
better at data I have a really really

00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:41,080
really small super demo where prototype

00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:44,920
demo I want to show you of what that

00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:50,800
could look like if the demo gods smile

00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:55,390
upon me let's see I've been working on a

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:58,870
project called wizzy which is short for

00:09:55,390 --> 00:10:01,779
which is jargon to get out I apologize

00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:03,790
short for WYSIWYG which is short for

00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:06,040
what you see is what you get and I'm

00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:08,260
gonna walk you through the gothis

00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:11,650
working yesterday flow of what it feels

00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:18,130
like to edit and by yesterday I mean

00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:20,050
11:30 last night so I already authorized

00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:21,220
this project which is why you don't get

00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:21,760
to github flow but really when you click

00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,050
login

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,490
I still require you to have a github

00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:27,130
account it just makes life way easier

00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:29,740
but I was gonna say hey I need access to

00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:31,510
do some stuff on your behalf like for

00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:33,700
core repository make changes and you

00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:34,839
grab that and you come back here github

00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,130
is amazing because you don't even I

00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:37,540
don't even have to know your email

00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:40,300
address to make this work in fact it

00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:41,589
won't tell me your email address so it's

00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,810
really really neat to get up that's you

00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:45,730
authorize specific access they're very

00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,459
granular in that way and we've got this

00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:49,390
we've got this gorgeous interface

00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:51,760
listing recent projects I've touched

00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:54,730
which consisted of me doing a code

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,560
search for spouse a CSV in them and then

00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:58,220
also the CSV conflict site we're going

00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,570
to go into that project

00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,950
it's actually making a bunch of github

00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:03,320
requests in the background zoom out a

00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:06,530
little bit and you can see here's every

00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,760
csv file in the csv columns repository

00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:09,440
on the master branch

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,810
lots of limitations here still but you

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,630
can see a list of files in no particular

00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:18,380
order and we are going to take a look at

00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:21,500
the schedule and here we are

00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:24,560
hey look this is that CSV file I found a

00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:27,410
fantastic little widget that lets you

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,030
actually create a little Excel 95

00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:31,610
looking interface including the ability

00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:32,690
to insert rows and remove columns and

00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:35,600
change the alignment actually really

00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:38,030
fantastic stuff and now we have a lil

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,500
interface and let's say you know I think

00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,970
this tree was full of great people so

00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:44,240
actually we're going to upgrade this

00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:49,070
room to room a plus and we are going to

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:53,270
because we are grading on a curve all

00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:56,750
right so when I hit submit when I hit

00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:58,490
submit what's going to happen is while I

00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:00,380
was looking at this file I actually 4/2

00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:03,110
the project from CSD comp to my own

00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:04,070
account takes a couple seconds to do so

00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:06,380
it's you just kind of do it in the

00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:09,080
background when I hit this button it is

00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:11,930
going to create a new branch it is going

00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:15,320
to find this file drop in those changes

00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:18,290
make it commit with this message push

00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:20,360
that commit back into my repo and then

00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:21,620
be ready for me to make a pull request

00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,940
ideally eventually I measure going to

00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,860
open up the pour quest so let's see what

00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:28,580
happens there's a solid chance this

00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:32,320
doesn't work such a solid chance hey

00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:32,320
that actually means it worked I promise

00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:43,560
so now I'm going to go to hey look at

00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:46,139
that now I if I go over here there's in

00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:49,589
fact a fork and look at that less than a

00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:52,860
minute ago wizzy made a patch and I can

00:12:49,589 --> 00:12:56,910
compare and as opposed to you copying

00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:58,649
all of your code into a editor and

00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:00,180
making changes and breaking all the

00:12:58,649 --> 00:13:02,130
formatting what I've done is I've gone

00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:05,279
ahead and automatically broken all the

00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:08,550
formatting in that file for you a real

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:10,470
service you can see for something I

00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:13,769
haven't figured out it's the slider that

00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:16,560
I've removed every line and then we

00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:20,339
added them because dissing algorithms

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:22,290
are hard and code formatting is hard so

00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:24,389
obviously when ivory serialized this

00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:25,829
table back into CSV it's not perfect but

00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:27,360
imagine if everyone was using this it

00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:28,920
would probably finally sort out the

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:33,630
formatting the important thing to note

00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:35,750
is hey look room a plus and you know the

00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:38,760
commit message is grading on a curve

00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:40,290
so the flow works obviously not

00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,240
everything perfect yet but I can create

00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:43,500
a pull request right now I think that

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:49,399
would not be helpful but I'm gonna do it

00:13:43,500 --> 00:14:04,100
anyway just to prove that you can sorry

00:13:49,399 --> 00:14:06,930
please do not merge cool okay wonderful

00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:09,149
so yeah that's a really really short

00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:12,060
demo of wizzy and really what i'm trying

00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:15,470
to show what is possible with the tools

00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:18,720
that are already out there really simple

00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:19,980
but doing a lot for you and hopefully

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,319
doing more for you over time

00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:24,420
so what's next for this project and just

00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:25,589
this experimentation in general first

00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:28,410
it's going to improve literally

00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:31,260
everything about what you just saw every

00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:31,920
error message every interface everything

00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,079
i do for you

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,839
every status bar that doesn't exist that

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:39,240
shows you progress of what's going on

00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,410
and hopefully support other formats

00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,779
why don't you see us be working pretty

00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:44,760
well first in my CSV I mean CSV and CSV

00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:48,570
and all the wonderful

00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:50,370
versions of delimited files my code path

00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:52,230
supports all those already so suppose

00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:53,640
ensign limiting them additionally I want

00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:55,740
to support other things like JSON and

00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:57,900
markdown a lot of people keep their pros

00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,940
and markdown and more structured data

00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:02,580
that isn't tabular in JSON and you can

00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:04,770
come see like a record-based view with

00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:07,680
little micro forms for each individual

00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:09,930
JSON file or or even just a helpful tree

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,820
editor I lots of things are possible

00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:14,340
here and of course your favorite data

00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:16,230
format should also be in here the good

00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:19,170
news is that this project is of course

00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:20,910
open source it exists on right now on an

00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:24,690
incredible website that launched

00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:27,180
recently called glitch glitch is imagine

00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:29,130
sort of GU cities meets the

00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:31,680
collaborative code editor it's all in

00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:34,020
the browser this is actually all the

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:37,530
code of the entire project it's really

00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:38,960
not a ton of code but it actually which

00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:42,000
is really cool is my pitch for glitch

00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:43,920
they automatically maintain all of your

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,110
like node modules if you're trying to

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,790
write a little server everything runs in

00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:48,930
the browser every time I make a change

00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:51,780
it's redeploying the website

00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:52,950
automatically good or bad and it's

00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,660
really great for just really quickly

00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:56,730
building something out sharing as other

00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:59,190
people letting them remix it add things

00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:00,420
to it which is great I'm also going to

00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:02,820
make this code available as a plain

00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:04,140
github repository but clich is a really

00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:06,330
great way just to quick try something

00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:09,570
out it was invaluable and being able to

00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:11,700
make edits reevaluate they get it free

00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:16,260
evaluate well as I raced the deadline

00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:18,030
but um what else is next I'm hopefully

00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,290
by the end of the talk so what will

00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:20,970
point out to me an existing tool is

00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:22,440
actively maintained and it's similar or

00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:24,420
better to what I have built and I get to

00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,720
throw all this away and share someone

00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:29,640
else's often work and go into the real

00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,610
for treating to the Sun set on my knees

00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:34,410
need that's the best outcome my goal is

00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:36,540
not to step on any existing works toes

00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:38,370
in fact if I find it I'm going to black

00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:41,460
it to the world because stuff that makes

00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:43,740
this easier is critical to moving

00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:45,510
forward open data I also want a bug

00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:47,070
github about the concept of an edit hook

00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:49,080
github actually lets you hook into their

00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:50,970
process all over the place and sort of

00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:53,220
inject your own functionality who'd be

00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:55,800
amazing of your repository you could say

00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:57,520
hey I have a visual editor for this

00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,529
maybe this format of code

00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:01,300
or something this directory of code and

00:16:59,529 --> 00:17:02,410
when the user predicts the edit button I

00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:05,860
actually want you to jump over to my

00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:07,300
interface I think that's not outside of

00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:09,309
their mission it would save them from

00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:11,260
having to build visual editor for every

00:17:09,309 --> 00:17:13,120
single format out there I know they have

00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:15,309
some for markdown which are awesome but

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,220
obviously the longtail is huge and be a

00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:18,939
great spot to get the community involved

00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:21,459
obviously something like what I've just

00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:22,929
built would be a possibility what they

00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:25,270
could be but I think edit hooks and the

00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:27,160
notion of being able to sort of

00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:29,290
associate an editor with the data in

00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,929
your repository would be a big step

00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:33,520
forward and even if nothing else came of

00:17:31,929 --> 00:17:35,470
everything I did here if this existed

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,600
and other people built tools on it that

00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:38,740
would be a huge success and if I start

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,280
bugging them maybe y'all can start

00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:44,800
booking them with me so everything I

00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:46,570
showed here today is obviously super

00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,100
prototypical kind of thinking out loud

00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:50,590
but something I'm really passionate

00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:52,030
about I want to be really clear everyone

00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:53,470
who's doing open data right now is

00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:55,179
amazing and I love them

00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:56,740
everyone at github is doing incredible

00:17:55,179 --> 00:17:58,179
work and I love them and everyone is

00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:00,100
learning to code is amazing and I love

00:17:58,179 --> 00:18:02,320
them and I wish them all the best but I

00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:04,300
want all of these things to just be

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,590
better I don't think they're bad but I

00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,330
think there's a lot of ways we could

00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:09,910
work together work forward and make

00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:11,920
beautiful things together so I'm punch

00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:13,570
there's gonna be links under the post

00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:16,960
links to be slides and also going to be

00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:19,090
posting links to the prototype I'm gonna

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,679
post links to the code and actually if

00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:22,000
you've never used the edit button before

00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:25,450
when you saw that pencil you were like

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,510
woah is linked to actually how to use

00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:30,250
the built-in github edit flow so if you

00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:31,690
found that interface daunting hopefully

00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:33,309
you can at least learn what's there

00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:35,140
right now and make better progress I

00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:36,970
want to have some questions time for

00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:38,090
questions and answers right now thank

00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:40,909
you so much for your attention

00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:41,600
[Applause]

00:18:40,909 --> 00:18:45,710
you

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,710
