so we're going to talk about open data

00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:13,250
and the question of quality the spoiler

00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:15,320
is that open data sucks we focus on

00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:19,400
publication and not on quality but we'll

00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,940
get to that first of all what's my

00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,310
interest

00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:25,310
I'm the chief product officer of an open

00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:27,020
knowledge international we build we

00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:29,150
basically build technical products for

00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:34,399
open data we do a bunch of other stuff

00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:37,069
but that's core of what we do our goal

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,050
is to open up all essential Public

00:00:37,069 --> 00:00:42,019
Interest information and see it used to

00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:44,269
create insight and drive change now

00:00:42,019 --> 00:00:46,100
that's really critical we don't want

00:00:44,269 --> 00:00:48,859
open data just for the sake of open data

00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:50,389
we want to see insight derived from open

00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:55,190
data and we want to see change in the

00:00:50,389 --> 00:01:03,319
world and that's key to the arguments of

00:00:55,190 --> 00:01:04,909
quality open data okay so this talk what

00:01:03,319 --> 00:01:07,310
I'm going to cover is that the open data

00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:11,810
ecosystem is pretty much exclusively

00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:15,350
about publication and data access the

00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:18,820
focus on data publication actually is by

00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:21,439
now say ten years into open data is

00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:23,659
minimizing the impact of open data and

00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,640
in order to meet the promise of open

00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:28,630
data what we all want to see from open

00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:31,630
data we need to focus on data quality

00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,630
oops

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,859
towards the end I'll introduce some

00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,780
ideas to think about a technical

00:01:36,859 --> 00:01:41,450
technology around what's next how we

00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:44,179
move towards shifting and focused

00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:46,820
quality of open data and some concrete

00:01:44,179 --> 00:01:48,439
actions that we can all take as activist

00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:51,439
those people working in the open data

00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:54,499
ecosystem to get governments to publish

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:59,319
better data first of all we should

00:01:54,499 --> 00:02:02,899
define open data the open data charter

00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:04,340
has a definition open data charter for

00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:07,750
anyone who doesn't know is a set of

00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:09,679
principles for open data that it's

00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:12,080
gaining traction in the open data

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,450
ecosystem and governments are starting

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,489
to adopt the Charter as kind of a

00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:19,760
defining principles so they're open data

00:02:16,489 --> 00:02:21,709
publication and transparency efforts so

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,800
open data's digital data that is made

00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:26,599
available with technical and legal

00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:30,739
characteristics for it to be freely used

00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:32,420
and reused and distributed this earlier

00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:33,739
opened definitions when the open

00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:36,319
knowledge and others worked on called

00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:41,060
the open definitions to the working

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:47,450
definition for our talk first we want to

00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:48,950
ask is open data really important it may

00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:51,670
be obvious to people at this conference

00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:54,319
that it is but list will go over why

00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:57,140
it's important because it's our data as

00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,940
citizens and it's a type of

00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:00,140
accountability of our governments it's a

00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,910
way that we can hold government's

00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:04,250
accountable for what for their actions

00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:08,480
and fiscal data and procurement data is

00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:11,540
there a classic example of that maybe

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,519
more importantly is that open data if

00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:15,200
there's good and quality open data

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,880
published it can lead to a new types of

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,569
account and new types of participatory

00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:25,489
cultures new things emerge on top of

00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:26,930
open data this can be ad hoc groups who

00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:30,019
are studying to build insights around

00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:31,609
data and so forth and most importantly

00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:33,380
we do want to see that we want to see

00:03:31,609 --> 00:03:35,660
insight that leads to changes in the

00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:40,670
world so that's what open data is

00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:45,620
important where are we now with open

00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:48,019
data the field of open data some of you

00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:52,100
may have heard from earlier talks it's

00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:54,760
based around a few sort of key aspects

00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:57,079
of the field so freedom of information

00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,780
is still quite an important tool for

00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:01,430
open data that's how we get access to

00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:04,579
data that it's not being voluntarily

00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:09,250
published obviously the open data portal

00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:13,099
and dead gov what's left of it and

00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:15,889
data.gov at UK were some leaders in this

00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:17,720
space and based on top of open source

00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:24,229
software seeking that came from -

00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:28,570
knowledge open data at present has

00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:31,070
become quite tied to transparency

00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:32,750
transparency efforts of governments are

00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:36,229
often like data is often used as a

00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:37,639
signifier of transparency it's not

00:04:36,229 --> 00:04:40,070
necessarily the same thing but that's

00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:42,520
how how how you know the tell it's

00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:45,380
developed and then there are

00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:48,590
partnerships and alliances say the open

00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:50,600
Open Government Partnership where

00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:53,360
governments are now study to kind of

00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,160
establish in industry as well as at

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,410
nonprofit organizations like ours with

00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:01,940
this kind of an industry developing of

00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:04,460
an what open data should look like as I

00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:07,400
say the main actors are NGOs civic tech

00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:09,530
government and of course mostly through

00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,690
that's an at refers to fund all of this

00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:18,650
stuff or the work that we in the

00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:22,880
nonprofit sector do with open data the

00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:25,250
way that open data looks now is strongly

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:29,289
influenced by the metrics and incentives

00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:31,520
that we as civil society society

00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:38,180
identify for governments to publish data

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:39,860
against so that's we all want data we

00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,330
want access to data at the beginning of

00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:44,060
the out of open data movement it was

00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:47,419
important that we just have raw access

00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:49,700
to data and that as much data as publish

00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:51,530
as possible but the way that the field

00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,180
currently looks is still highly

00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:55,550
influenced by that and as you see that

00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:59,090
in initiatives like here the open data

00:05:55,550 --> 00:06:01,460
index it's a crowd sourced projects by

00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:03,320
open knowledge and the open data

00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:06,979
community actually it was just released

00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:11,660
today the latest results the open data

00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:13,639
index ranks government's ranks the level

00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:15,520
of openness of governments based on what

00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:18,169
they publish and how they publish data

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,490
Australia and Taiwan according to the

00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:22,400
results published today are the most

00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:25,070
open governments in the world the u.s.

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,990
is currently at eight and who knows

00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:28,760
where it'll be next year but currently

00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:32,349
the eight to my story government in the

00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:34,940
world according to the open data index

00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:36,320
importantly what we find at open

00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:38,240
knowledge by running the index is

00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,009
government's really really really

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,830
interested in what we're measuring then

00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:44,930
it directly influences policy we have

00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:47,659
people contacting this all the time

00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:49,639
like the yearly cycle of building the

00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:51,110
index people from governments are

00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:53,509
contacting us all the time

00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:55,879
very closely looking at the methodology

00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:58,550
that we use very closely looking at the

00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:00,919
data sets that we identify that should

00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:02,899
be open or the most valuable if they're

00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:06,289
open and they're actually designing

00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:08,439
their transparency efforts in their open

00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:12,979
data publication the policies around

00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:15,770
type of things we measure we don't

00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:20,319
measure quality but that's part of the

00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:23,419
reason why a platform like this is so

00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:26,689
influential because of the attention

00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:29,240
given by governments to it similar

00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:32,029
efforts like the open data barometer and

00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:34,279
it's another type of index what's

00:07:32,029 --> 00:07:37,879
different about the barometer whereas

00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:40,099
the open data index is crowd-sourced all

00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:43,490
the information is actually contributed

00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:45,680
by the open data community the open data

00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:49,039
Brahman has a significant aspect of

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,240
government self-assessment so they all

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:55,370
think that they publish great data

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:56,659
obviously and then your newer incentives

00:07:55,370 --> 00:08:01,279
like are the open government partnership

00:07:56,659 --> 00:08:03,529
and in terms of producing good data the

00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:06,379
eligibility criteria to be part of the

00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:08,749
open government partnership is very low

00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:10,819
it doesn't require that much in terms of

00:08:08,749 --> 00:08:15,800
producing good data but however it's

00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:17,479
quite it's a badge of transparency so if

00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:21,979
it's like this if it's like the

00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:24,919
barometer and the index really shaped

00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:31,479
the way that publication works the way

00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:35,860
the publication work and data looks ok

00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:38,529
so most of the incentives in the field

00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:42,699
at the moment field of open data are

00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:43,810
really around publication and that means

00:08:42,699 --> 00:08:47,649
that we miss certain things those things

00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:51,940
that we don't see there's a very little

00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:55,420
emphasis by NGOs or any actor within the

00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:58,449
open data space on usability of open

00:08:55,420 --> 00:09:03,370
data we don't really measure or attempt

00:08:58,449 --> 00:09:06,130
to measure reuse of data we don't really

00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:09,190
for people in civic tech or open data

00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:11,560
NGOs we don't really expect data to be

00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:13,180
of high quality a huge amount of the

00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,010
work that Open Knowledge does is

00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:18,670
actually just wrangling data to make it

00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:20,800
usable like I haven't put a monetary

00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:24,910
value on it but we spend a huge amount

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:29,260
of our funding just on making nice CSV

00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:31,420
files and we can talk about that a bit

00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:33,220
would be a bit further when I look at

00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:36,670
the studies that I've got here we'll see

00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:39,339
like sort of the real cost of that but

00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:42,850
the emphasis that we have in the system

00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:45,490
is that we don't even expect ovens to

00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:47,290
produce high-quality data and obviously

00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:49,720
we don't incentivize them to strive for

00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:51,550
impact and we incentivize them to

00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,199
government to publish data we don't

00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:58,949
incentivize governments to publish

00:09:53,199 --> 00:10:01,480
quality they'd and so I've got a few

00:09:58,949 --> 00:10:03,550
studies from work that I've done and

00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,560
other people in our team have done over

00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:08,889
the last years and working with zone

00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:12,069
government open data and just to sort of

00:10:08,889 --> 00:10:16,120
demonstrate how deep this goes how bad

00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:18,250
the quality of open data is how bad the

00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,680
quality of open data is what governments

00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:23,829
who are apparently leading transparency

00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:30,279
and open data data in the world so first

00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:33,040
of all UK spend data this is a project I

00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:35,980
worked on from the end of 2014 and then

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:41,500
into 2015 and we've recently updated

00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:43,569
it's all recent data - we were working

00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,160
with the UK government who at that time

00:10:43,569 --> 00:10:47,759
were the number one considered

00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:49,959
the leading open data publisher

00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:51,550
government the most open government in

00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:55,930
the world in terms of transparency and

00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:57,310
open data publication we decided to we

00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:58,779
the Cabinet Office from the UK

00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:00,519
government to build a project where we

00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:02,889
actually assess what they're actually

00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:06,129
publishing like what the quality is so

00:11:02,889 --> 00:11:10,660
we chose an a particular set of data

00:11:06,129 --> 00:11:12,759
it's called 25k spending data an

00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:15,310
interesting set of data tool chosen

00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:18,610
because the there's actually an edit

00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:20,980
from the Prime Minister from 2010 saying

00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:23,829
exactly how this data needs to be

00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:25,629
published there's a schema for the data

00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:27,970
written in plain text so it's really

00:11:25,629 --> 00:11:31,060
clearly it clearly understandable how

00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:33,009
the data needs to be published the types

00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:34,750
like what the what the date field needs

00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:37,660
to be called what the amount field needs

00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:38,920
to have and so on it's very very clear

00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:42,129
the regulations are very straightforward

00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:45,250
and all publishing bodies need to adhere

00:11:42,129 --> 00:11:50,680
to that so all the municipalities and so

00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:54,579
forth as you see there none of the data

00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:56,519
is valid that's what there's there's

00:11:54,579 --> 00:11:59,230
room for error here

00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:02,069
something like 0.5 percent of the data

00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:05,319
or 0.3 percent of the data that we

00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:07,420
checked was actually valid according to

00:12:05,319 --> 00:12:09,040
the government's own specifications and

00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:14,050
standards and the rest had some type of

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:17,139
error or another we got this off

00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:18,819
data.gov Duke UK all the data we even

00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:22,829
discovering the data was difficult

00:12:18,819 --> 00:12:25,269
enough but yeah the quality is very low

00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:28,809
there has a pretty serious impact on the

00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:30,399
ability to use the data even though we

00:12:28,809 --> 00:12:33,250
at Open Knowledge international worked

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,559
with the UK government quite a lot this

00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:38,800
was extremely surprising just to see how

00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:42,189
bad really really fundamentally bad the

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:45,370
data they publishes and this is one of

00:12:42,189 --> 00:12:49,449
the most yes like I say specify data

00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:51,959
sets of they publish so here we have a

00:12:49,449 --> 00:12:54,910
global leader in open data publication

00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:56,740
we have a set of data with very clear

00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:57,580
ethics on the requirements of publishing

00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,830
it

00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:01,360
including a very explicit and very

00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:06,670
simple standard that they need to

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:10,510
publish to and hardly anything's valid

00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:13,180
there's dire problems in simple file

00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:15,400
structure as well as adherence to the

00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:18,490
standard or the schema and there's also

00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:20,380
die of problems in the timeliness of the

00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:21,790
publication there's some some

00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:24,640
departments still too haven't published

00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:28,480
any files since 2013 something like that

00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:30,940
so and I'll post a link to this

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,770
presentation on Twitter a bit later but

00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:35,620
you can have a look at all the data

00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:38,920
scripts that we used on the dashboard to

00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:41,740
display that information and so forth

00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:45,490
more recently the fiscal thing modafinil

00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:49,630
Inge worked on a project called subsidy

00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:53,260
stories a year in many ways a similar

00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:56,890
case we took a structural and structural

00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:58,630
funds from the EU we wanted to get build

00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:00,820
a single database out of all structural

00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:02,700
funds data and we wanted to be able to

00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:09,120
build stories on top of that Dana

00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:13,060
sounds easy we had to acquire data from

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:15,880
120 different websites just to build

00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:20,070
this single database the data is

00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:24,880
published in various ways and CSV PDF

00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:27,400
Excel and so forth we over several

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:31,090
months we literally think several months

00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:33,700
ETL in data that once again has the

00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:36,430
published data standard has regulations

00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:41,740
on how to release the data in a timely

00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:44,380
fashion we spent months doing ETL to

00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:48,430
build a single database out of this data

00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:50,800
and to make it usable the end result is

00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:54,700
a very simple website subsidies stories

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:56,590
to AU which in reality is just the very

00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:58,540
beginning of being able to make insight

00:14:56,590 --> 00:15:01,780
out of data there's no insight there all

00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:04,420
we've done a significant effort is

00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:07,230
create a clean database so that other

00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:09,220
people can maybe now start to

00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:11,020
investigate the data which would not

00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:13,300
have been possible before

00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:15,430
and find insights phone stories within

00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:20,140
there we won't because we ran out of

00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:21,700
money building it that's part of the

00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:24,910
problem there's a huge time and effort

00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:31,200
time and huge amount of time and money

00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:33,060
goes into just wrangling this data okay

00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:36,790
again there's some links here to

00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:38,710
information there the data processing

00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:42,820
code in the app and the data quality

00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:45,730
report on that project it's not just

00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:47,680
open knowledge obviously anyone here

00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:52,570
who's been wrangling us data I'm sure

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:54,400
has similar experiences transparency

00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:57,490
international recently released support

00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:59,080
report on the promise of open data but

00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:03,160
the complete lack of progress and

00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:04,660
complete lack of usability there's an

00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,170
open letter to the open data community

00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:10,000
recently by data smart city solutions

00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:11,470
which address many issues one of them

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,030
the poor quality of the data that's

00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:18,550
actually published as open data digi

00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:20,680
with the really interesting project in

00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:22,570
the EU at the moment even go as far to

00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,490
say because of the serious quality

00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:26,350
problems that they found that they think

00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:28,900
there should be penalties for

00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:31,330
non-compliance to most basic quality

00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:33,550
standards that's how hard it is to work

00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:37,800
with the date of it unless we penalize

00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:39,550
governments for lack of quality and

00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:46,810
we're not going to get anywhere

00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:49,810
according to them okay so they're two to

00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:53,410
small studies and well what can we learn

00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:55,570
and government to a leading in open data

00:16:53,410 --> 00:17:01,290
can't publish consistent CSV files

00:16:55,570 --> 00:17:04,060
that's wanting maybe more surprising

00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:06,910
even for me because I work on data

00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:09,400
standards as well but standards and

00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:13,290
regulations don't actually lead to

00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:16,450
higher quality or reusable data

00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:18,070
standards at least in the case studies

00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:19,630
that I've or the projects I've been

00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:22,690
involved in don't really lead to better

00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:24,220
data at all and huge amounts of time the

00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:24,819
money are required to actually gain

00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:33,190
inside

00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:38,470
out of open data sir quality what do we

00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:40,419
actually want in 2007 refers to the

00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:43,330
founder of our knowledge said we want

00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:45,490
raw data and we want it now this is a

00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:48,190
pretty famous quote in the open data

00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:52,330
space 10 years ago this was a great

00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:54,070
thing to say we're still seeing the same

00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:56,799
thing we're not really asking anymore

00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:58,330
from our governments and they're

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:01,779
providing this not only raw data but

00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:03,159
really shitty raw data so we need to

00:18:01,779 --> 00:18:04,480
sort of get a bit beyond that and we

00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:07,210
need to sort of push the ball back to

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,980
government and ask ask for that we need

00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:12,269
them to address the quality problems

00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:17,950
were they having the data they publish

00:18:12,269 --> 00:18:22,330
the goals what are the goals so again as

00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:23,919
a programmer plaintext data in one level

00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:26,259
as a programmer plaintext data seems

00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:29,500
boring as a programmer who likes CSE I

00:18:26,259 --> 00:18:33,730
understand why we need it we would think

00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:35,200
that it's an on goal almost but it still

00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:37,659
doesn't happen and we've seen from other

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,809
from Kate did a presentation this

00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:42,909
morning showing how much of the data on

00:18:39,809 --> 00:18:46,659
data.gov that UK is actually see DSR

00:18:42,909 --> 00:18:49,990
data garbages PDF we want structural

00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:53,259
integrity really really really really

00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:56,919
simple got we want CSE don't have mess

00:18:53,259 --> 00:18:59,679
and notes and non tabular information we

00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:04,960
want rows to not to be empty and so

00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:06,940
forth we want schematic consistency this

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,250
does not mean we want data standards

00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:11,049
actually it just means that if

00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:13,509
something's add a column it should be a

00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:14,679
date for the whole way if something's a

00:19:13,509 --> 00:19:17,049
number column it should should have

00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:19,179
numbers the whole way we don't need more

00:19:17,049 --> 00:19:21,490
than that like we do we'd love more than

00:19:19,179 --> 00:19:23,470
that it'd be really good that but that

00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:25,120
can come after we just basically have

00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:28,870
numbers in the numbers and dates that a

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:34,330
dates and amounts that you know and of

00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:39,740
course timely release-- non goals

00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:41,630
there's some of these non girls are a

00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:44,690
bit kind of controversial even to myself

00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:47,350
I work on data standards like I said and

00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:49,880
open knowledge does just mess it here

00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:51,860
but what what I'm seeing right now

00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:55,580
especially in Europe and I guess in the

00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:57,410
u.s. mostly around link data but it's

00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:59,420
not necessarily about link data but

00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:02,600
there's a lot of emphasis on like

00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:05,300
technology izing technical solutions to

00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,590
these type of problems and build a data

00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:09,590
standard and then the data will get

00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:11,240
better have beautiful abstract command

00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:13,490
code lists and then we'll be able to

00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,830
just do amazing stuff across all of the

00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:18,200
data but as I've just showing the data

00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:20,180
is just not even there yet so these are

00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:23,030
really great things to have data

00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:26,120
standards cordless comparison and

00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:28,250
linkage across data sets but unless we

00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:30,500
address more fundamental quality issues

00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:33,050
it's just no point it's just it's a

00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,580
waste and the other thing about these is

00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:38,390
that they're all they all require a

00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:41,480
highly technological solution so the

00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:44,150
what we would gain by what we gain by

00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:48,670
focusing on this we lose in terms of

00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:51,110
like human computer interrupt sir I

00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:55,280
really think these are non goals at

00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:57,550
present until we can get make numbers of

00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,550
numbers

00:20:58,179 --> 00:21:03,440
so what can we actually do to change the

00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:05,360
situation what can we do to make sure

00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:12,169
the government start to publish a higher

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:13,490
quality data in non technical zones we

00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:17,620
can engage in direct dialogue with

00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:17,620
governments on the usability of data I

00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:23,929
take over knowledge as an example we do

00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:26,090
a huge amounts of data wrangling but we

00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:27,649
very rarely kind of feed back to the

00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:31,519
governments and say hey your data is

00:21:27,649 --> 00:21:34,850
crappy I mean it we just need to let

00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:36,559
government not understand the impact

00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:40,429
that the quality of what they're

00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:42,169
producing and call our results in we

00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:44,720
need to build quality metrics into the

00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:47,539
tools and processes that incentivize our

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:50,240
government so for example the open data

00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:52,789
barometer the open data charter the

00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,159
index actually need to include quality

00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:56,960
as a metric that's measured otherwise

00:21:55,159 --> 00:21:59,470
we'll just keep focusing on access and

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:02,409
publication at the expense of quality

00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:05,690
and possibly in some situations

00:22:02,409 --> 00:22:07,220
activists or it depends on the context

00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:10,220
should actually just reject data that

00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:11,990
doesn't meet basic quality assurances

00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:16,360
let's just say no this is not this is

00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:22,970
not data and we need something else

00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:25,909
technically we we should start to focus

00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:29,240
on data validation and build tools for

00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:32,330
data validation open knowledge has got

00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:36,590
some again there's links towards in the

00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:39,289
floor we can build dashboards that

00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:41,419
engage with internal stakeholders at

00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:42,710
government so that they can actually so

00:22:41,419 --> 00:22:45,919
people who are working at the policy

00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:47,750
level need to be able to see that the

00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:50,809
the data that results from their

00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:52,610
policies is not usable so in order to do

00:22:50,809 --> 00:22:54,679
that we need to actually start to build

00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:58,700
ways that they can see that ways that

00:22:54,679 --> 00:23:02,320
they can understand that data portals

00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:05,360
see can and other commercial solutions

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:08,510
need to shift a bit more emphasis on to

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,230
publication workflows I think there's a

00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:12,270
huge amount to be done here who

00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:15,030
and shower opportunity actually to focus

00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:18,120
on the people who sit in an office and

00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:19,950
put data on a portal so to make it

00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:22,380
easier for them to seeks data to make it

00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:26,730
easier for them to version and validate

00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:28,850
data and so forth that's it you five

00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:35,910
minutes is left

00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:35,910
