welcome to my talk on how to mislead the

00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:10,100
public and thank you all for showing up

00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:11,780
so my name is Philip Burkett and I'm a

00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:14,180
PhD student at Carnegie Mellon

00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:16,250
University in the statistics and public

00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,510
policy program and I have worked with

00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,640
data and now for a couple of years

00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:22,600
studying questions in a variety of

00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:25,070
domains so medication to healthcare and

00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,160
I've also become interested in recent

00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:30,520
years in statistical computing

00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:33,410
particularly how to turn the web into a

00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,760
good computing desktop and to that end

00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:37,129
together with ethylenes

00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:40,519
I'm building an a JavaScript standard

00:00:37,129 --> 00:00:42,050
library called standard net whose goal

00:00:40,519 --> 00:00:44,539
is to bring American computing and

00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:46,190
statistics to the web browser so if by

00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:48,019
any chance you're working with data and

00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:50,449
you use javascript in your work I

00:00:48,019 --> 00:00:53,299
wholeheartedly recommend to attend

00:00:50,449 --> 00:00:55,010
Athens talk tomorrow at 4:30 about the

00:00:53,299 --> 00:00:58,579
JavaScript America computing landscape

00:00:55,010 --> 00:01:00,920
I'm sure you will enjoy that based on

00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:03,499
top of this library at Carnegie Mellon

00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,630
I'm currently working on devising and a

00:01:03,499 --> 00:01:08,149
learning framework for teaching data

00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:10,670
science as part of my doctoral

00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:14,180
dissertation and the goal that we have

00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:16,070
here is to really bring data science to

00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,930
fall from a very wide range of

00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:20,390
backgrounds all right so today as we

00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:23,060
people in many different domains need to

00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:25,520
work with data in their daily work and

00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,890
it influences their decisions drives

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,609
policy it drives our understanding of

00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:33,140
the world and so how can we ensure that

00:01:30,609 --> 00:01:35,780
we equip those people with the right

00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:38,409
tools and the right understanding to

00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,299
work with data without getting as less

00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:43,520
so as data today is everywhere and so

00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:46,490
how do we make sense of it it's becoming

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,619
more and more essential and I won't

00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:51,679
don't have the time now to really delve

00:01:48,619 --> 00:01:54,439
deep right into how to teach statistics

00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:57,710
ok but instead what I want to do is just

00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:59,149
give you a few case studies where the

00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:01,399
analysis of data actually led to

00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:03,829
erroneous conclusions and why that is

00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:06,319
and so maybe you're hopefully you can

00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:08,259
get something out of that even if you

00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:11,300
might have heard about some of these

00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:13,160
examples before so for the first one

00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,110
let's go back in time into the 20th

00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,210
century

00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:17,760
where

00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:20,400
we have seen like the shift from in the

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,620
beginning like more small schools like

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,410
small rural schools where you may had

00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,910
often classes same as a school so it's

00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:29,430
like the big high schools where you have

00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:30,900
a thousand students or more and this

00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,610
shift was accompanied by a public

00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,590
discussion about like whether it

00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,300
actually helps students to learn like in

00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,160
a big school oh it's more harmful on the

00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,720
other hand and so proponents of the

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,200
small schools movement have argued that

00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,910
actually students would agree we would

00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:47,940
have better achievement in smaller

00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:49,590
schools and so this was actually led the

00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:54,620
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to

00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:57,840
support this small schools movement by

00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:59,580
setting funds aside to support spinning

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,520
out bigger schools into smaller schools

00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:05,670
and said and divided and giving grants

00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:07,440
to some small schools and this was all

00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:10,320
based on data because what people have

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:14,040
done is they looked at standardized

00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:15,900
scores of tests and found that among the

00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,320
top performing schools there were

00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,550
actually many more small schools

00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,050
represented there but they were also

00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:25,530
represented by the factor of four so

00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:28,560
pretty significant so it makes sense

00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:31,410
right but the case is that here we kind

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,270
of are misled by a statistical issue

00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:36,060
here and so let's look at this more

00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:37,590
closely so basically the claim that the

00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,260
proponents of a small school movement

00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:42,440
make is that the or one of the claims at

00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:45,240
least is that the average achievement

00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:48,060
among pupils in the small schools is

00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:50,790
larger than the average achievement in

00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,500
the in a big school but what they

00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:56,670
actually only observed is the following

00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:58,770
we observed that the proportion of small

00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:00,990
schools among the high achieving schools

00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:02,820
was larger than the proportion of the

00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:05,580
large schools among the high achieving

00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:07,890
schools and so these two equations do

00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:09,150
not imply each other and there's

00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:12,390
something else or there could be

00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:14,340
something else at work which leads us to

00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:16,500
the second observation there and that's

00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,600
indeed the case and to see what's going

00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,609
on let's quickly step aside and consider

00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,760
a different setting let's think about

00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:25,020
Heights okay so you can imagine like in

00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,790
a school right you have pupils of

00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:29,050
different heights so maybe your thumbs

00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:30,849
some some pupils who are very

00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:33,879
like this little guide on the right and

00:04:30,849 --> 00:04:37,000
some pupils who are very tall like the

00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:38,440
big woman on the left and so in a large

00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,810
school right you have many different

00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,300
students some of them will be very small

00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:45,069
some of them will be really tall and the

00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,629
rest will be in between and you can

00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:48,069
imagine that the extremes will

00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:50,740
counterbalance each other they will come

00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:52,539
to each other and so the average of all

00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,639
the heights will be probably close to

00:04:52,539 --> 00:04:57,669
the overall average of our students

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,470
which let's say is just 64 inches okay

00:04:57,669 --> 00:05:01,419
but if we go on the other hand to a

00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:03,310
small school what we will see there is

00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:05,620
that maybe in some of the small schools

00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:09,039
we just by accident we happen to have a

00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:11,229
lot of targets and so the average and in

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:15,280
those schools will be much larger than

00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:17,409
the overall average if that's the case

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,379
what we would expect is that both among

00:05:17,409 --> 00:05:21,879
the schools with a taller students we

00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:24,789
would see the small schools being

00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:27,400
over-represented but also in the and

00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:29,919
excludes with the smallest students and

00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,960
that's indeed the case and the same

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,550
applies to the situation with the test

00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,169
scores so if you look at the top

00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:37,240
performing schools you will find many

00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:38,800
smaller schools but on the flipside if

00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,050
you look at the worst performing schools

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,969
again you will find many small schools

00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:45,550
so what's actually going on that there's

00:05:42,969 --> 00:05:49,360
just more variability in the small

00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:52,150
schools now the equation which explains

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,370
this is the this formula for the

00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,659
standard deviation of the mean so if

00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:58,060
you're ever taking a statistics class

00:05:55,659 --> 00:06:00,610
that's million if not let's quickly

00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:02,590
disentangle its meaning so the Sigma is

00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:05,110
the standard deviation that's a measure

00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:08,680
of the variability or dispersion of data

00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:10,810
so and if you have normal data you would

00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,029
expect that like two-thirds of the

00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:15,069
observations would fall between plus or

00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:17,169
minus one standard deviation around the

00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:18,729
mean okay so it's like the saturation

00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:21,849
for the heights was four inches let's

00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:25,090
say they would expect two thirds of the

00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:28,300
observations to be between 60 and and 68

00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:30,129
let's say okay but now if we take

00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,949
aggregates so if we have a school where

00:06:30,129 --> 00:06:34,900
we are 100 students let's say then these

00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:36,370
averages will be much closer to the

00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:39,039
overall mean and there will be less

00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:42,190
variability and this is the square root

00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,750
of n here so in fact a factor of 10

00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:45,040
if we look at the individual students

00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,080
that's just because this counter

00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,090
balancing effect and this effect it's

00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,250
much more prevalent like the larger the

00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:53,140
schools are so what we've seen here is

00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:55,180
that among the smallest cruelty of this

00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:57,910
high availability and that was driving

00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:00,520
or giving leading us astray here and

00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:01,990
this equation was called the most

00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,420
dangerous equation by Howard Wiener

00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:06,280
because how often in decision making it

00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:07,600
leads people astray and needs to

00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:10,600
erroneous conclusions so one should

00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:14,440
always keep this in mind when when

00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:16,870
comparing things of different sizes one

00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:19,030
solution if if you are interested say in

00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,860
looking at the top finding top

00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:22,150
performing schools would be not to look

00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:24,010
at the raw data but use the

00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:26,770
transformations often UN can transform

00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:28,870
data in a certain way to make it better

00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:30,520
interpretable and here what we could do

00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:32,110
is we could standardize the variables so

00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:35,230
we could subtract the overall scores

00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:37,000
among of our students and divide by the

00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:39,940
standard deviation for each of the other

00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,740
schools and then we would get kind of

00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:43,930
this residual and this was residual

00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:47,980
would help us would be comparable across

00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:49,480
different schools of different sizes so

00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:52,270
this is the first example I wanted to

00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:54,370
show the second one is it's called like

00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:57,730
Simpsons paradox and the canonical

00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:59,350
example for this is like alleged gender

00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:03,130
discrimination at UC Berkeley in their

00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:05,400
graduate admissions so in 1973 Berkeley

00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:08,950
was afraid of getting sued because they

00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:10,450
noticed that the proportions of females

00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:12,430
to males admitted they're quite

00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:15,010
different in the graduate programs and

00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:17,410
so what they did it they did is they

00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:19,000
asked statistics professor Peter Bickle

00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:20,890
to look at the data and check whether

00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,190
there was indeed discrimination going on

00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:27,280
and here this is the problem so we had

00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:30,190
like they were modern like 44 percent of

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,770
males admitted to the University whereas

00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:35,469
only like a way less than forty percent

00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:37,810
of females were admitted to the graduate

00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:40,539
programs at Berkeley so where's the

00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:43,479
paradox the paradox is that if you split

00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:47,140
up the data by department you see that

00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:48,250
females are actually often like they are

00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,480
at least the admission rates are

00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,740
comparable across the different

00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,350
departments see on the right and

00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:54,630
sometimes even females I'm more often

00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:58,920
admitted

00:08:54,630 --> 00:09:00,389
and so what's going on here is that see

00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,589
that their admission rates and the

00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:03,240
different departments are different so

00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:05,370
for example Department a which is the

00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,899
department at the bottom there this is

00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:09,569
was the engineering department and it

00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:13,199
admitted many students in contrast like

00:09:09,569 --> 00:09:15,269
the department averages or the two bars

00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:19,100
at the top admitted like less than ten

00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:21,930
percent of the students and so now

00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:24,449
female students just applied more often

00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:26,519
to department s then a compared to males

00:09:24,449 --> 00:09:29,490
so they chose to apply to the more

00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:31,529
competitive majors and therefore overall

00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:35,339
the proportion of admitted three minutes

00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:38,449
was very less than than those of males

00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:41,459
without any of these discrimination

00:09:38,449 --> 00:09:44,490
happening here so what this tells us is

00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:47,250
that this is one example of like what's

00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:48,959
called the ecological fallacy that the

00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,279
director success can change depending on

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,680
whether we look data at data in the

00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:54,569
aggregate or whether we look at data in

00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,370
a petitions way and so we should always

00:09:54,569 --> 00:09:58,199
strive to compare only efforts with

00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:59,670
efforts in a sense and oranges oranges

00:09:58,199 --> 00:10:01,910
and make sure that there is no other

00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:04,170
variable which is different between

00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:06,810
several groups that say we are comparing

00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:08,730
in this case like that females that

00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:13,740
chose to apply to different majors than

00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:16,500
males as a next example this is more

00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:18,120
like in line of education research we

00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,860
could ask ourselves like whether it's

00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,709
better to prey students a good

00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:25,350
performance or whether we should scold

00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:27,209
them if they do not so well for example

00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:30,029
let's imagine the following setting here

00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:32,670
where let's say we give the student that

00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:35,670
would multiple-choice test and we are

00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:37,800
going to place him or her if the student

00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:39,300
gets more than 6 answers correct on the

00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,750
other hand if the student gets less than

00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:44,490
4 answers correct we scold him ok and

00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:45,509
then after this we repeat the other

00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:47,579
thing we give this to you in another

00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:49,110
multiple-choice test and we are going to

00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:52,620
check whether his performance actually

00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:54,420
improved or decreased in response to

00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:57,240
that action so let's look at how this

00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:59,009
looks like so here you can see ah so

00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,509
it's probably a bit small now I think

00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:02,730
the thermistors car and the first

00:11:00,509 --> 00:11:04,740
multiple-choice test how many he did he

00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:07,740
or she got right and then there's the

00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,370
are reaction and then we see whether it

00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,810
is called

00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:11,490
of the decrease and you can see here

00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:13,950
it's pretty striking right like whatever

00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:15,440
we place the students day and the they

00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:18,029
tend to do worse on the next round

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,200
versus if we scold them when they do not

00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:22,260
so well they tend to do better

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,029
afterwards so this is maybe student that

00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,740
if we scold them they will straighten up

00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:28,230
but they will think okay I need to do

00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:29,940
better now versus on the other hand if

00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:31,620
we place then they slack off or

00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:34,050
something like that so this is actually

00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:36,089
not like a pathetical thing so Daniel

00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:37,830
Kahneman in this book like Thinking Fast

00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:39,240
and Slow reports that when he was at the

00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:41,550
Israeli military he had a flight

00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,290
instructor that he talked to who

00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:44,910
insisted that punishment works because

00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:46,140
whenever he scolded his flight credits

00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:49,470
when they didn't do a maneuver right

00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:53,130
they did better on the next try whereas

00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:55,860
if he is he placed them they didn't do

00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:57,330
so well afterwards the sentiments change

00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:59,120
right like if you're familiar with the

00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:02,040
circle actually psychology literature

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,140
it's pretty agreed-upon that punishment

00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:06,810
is way less effective than positive

00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:08,400
reinforcement changing behavior and so

00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:10,110
what's really going on is here that we

00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,300
just have a statistical effect if you

00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:14,459
observe regression to the mean and what

00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:16,890
that means is that if we observe an

00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:21,660
extreme measurement of a variable and

00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:23,250
then on a repeated measurement the the

00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:25,380
next measurement will be closer to the

00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:27,750
average and the average in this case is

00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:30,209
5 because what I simulated here is

00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:32,190
actually data where the actual whether

00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:34,380
we scolded the student or placed and had

00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:37,110
no influence whatsoever so I just made

00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:38,850
random guesses but I think about for a

00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:42,150
second right like if the student does

00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:44,250
really poorly then and by just a random

00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:46,560
chance but if next time I do again 10

00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:48,720
questions it's just more probable that

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,790
I'm again more to the towards the middle

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,150
because I there's just not that much air

00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:56,520
like below like if I only got four tool

00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:59,100
to correct right and it's just less

00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:01,140
likely that I'm you worse on the flip

00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:03,660
side if I do really well it's very hard

00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:08,250
for less probable to repeat that

00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:11,490
performance and so here there's one

00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:14,610
example we're really looking at the data

00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:16,110
can be misleading if you don't step back

00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:18,180
for a second and think about it and

00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:20,490
especially if you have some prior

00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,600
beliefs and I think this place often to

00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:23,850
this because people

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,110
to confirm their own biases or beliefs

00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:26,579
right so this fight and start to

00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:28,230
probably start okay I know like I

00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:31,019
believe punishment works and so in the

00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:32,910
data that's concerned that right and so

00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:36,899
I mean we can see that padding

00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:40,199
prejudices can get you very far and make

00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:42,449
you president but on the other hand that

00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:46,380
learn from the master and that's like

00:13:42,449 --> 00:13:49,259
Satoshi Kanazawa whose evolutionary

00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:51,029
psychologist at LSE and he can explain

00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:53,490
all the world's biggest questions so if

00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:56,699
you're interested in why women buy shoes

00:13:53,490 --> 00:14:00,089
or why men buy fancy cars he can explain

00:13:56,699 --> 00:14:02,910
that and it has all to do with like our

00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:04,980
ancestors right so in ancient times men

00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:07,589
had to be warriors and women had to look

00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:09,449
good basically and so that explains

00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:11,550
everything for as many papers on this

00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:13,199
like beautiful parents have more

00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:15,420
daughters or like another one is

00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:17,639
engineers have more sons nurses have

00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:19,079
more daughters or why you can get a date

00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:21,360
and a Saturday night and why most

00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:23,069
suicide bombers are Muslim so in the

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,240
explain is there is simply here so you

00:14:23,069 --> 00:14:26,660
can imagine like for the first one for

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,860
example the explanation is that

00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:33,839
evolution common evolutionary standpoint

00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:35,160
it's more beneficial for if for women to

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,720
look good because then they will find a

00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:41,310
mate and so it would make sense that

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:44,550
beautiful parents get more daughters

00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:47,339
okay so this might sound really strange

00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:49,319
right because voices for one for ones

00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:50,939
like Beauty is kind of in the eye of the

00:14:49,319 --> 00:14:52,920
beholder word is more social construct

00:14:50,939 --> 00:14:55,019
and not something objective that's that

00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,540
just an inheritable trait but i would

00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:59,970
still say there's the mess method in it

00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:01,259
here because like doctor kind of thought

00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:02,790
i've got a lot of media attention with

00:15:01,259 --> 00:15:05,819
every with all of these articles as it

00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:08,490
can imagine good like sound bites that

00:15:05,819 --> 00:15:11,399
in an article and newspaper article can

00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:14,310
give you like lots of attention and

00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:16,709
let's so how does he do it

00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:19,170
ah what does he do so well he uses

00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:22,829
science to advances prejudice right so

00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:26,370
he uses data and and rigorous statistics

00:15:22,829 --> 00:15:28,860
to prove his point so let's look at how

00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:30,959
he does it so so example in the case of

00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:34,970
the study for why beautiful women had

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:38,379
more daughters he refers to

00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:41,870
that was done where interviewers waited

00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:44,389
there were the surveyed people on a

00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:47,269
scale from 1 to 5 where there are very

00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:49,519
unattractive to very attractive and so

00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:52,550
what he found was that among the group

00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:54,500
of the parents that were in category 5

00:15:52,550 --> 00:16:00,079
which is very attractive there were only

00:15:54,500 --> 00:16:01,850
40% 44% boys versus 52% of the children

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:07,899
born to parents in the other four groups

00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:10,220
where Weber boys okay so this seems that

00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:11,779
beautiful parents have mobilized and

00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:14,870
this is a significant finding at 5

00:16:11,779 --> 00:16:17,060
percent significance level of 5% which

00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:18,860
means in statistics that we would deem

00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:21,110
this to be not a trans effect but there

00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:22,670
is some systematic difference here ok

00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:24,259
but we can always make an error so

00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:27,199
statistics not an exact science right

00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:28,879
and so this is this what's called a type

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:31,009
1 error and it's the probability of

00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:32,750
erroneously detecting an effect even if

00:16:31,009 --> 00:16:35,060
there is no effect whatsoever and that's

00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:37,279
5% and so we can live with that maybe

00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:39,559
and but we can should step back now and

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:42,230
ask ourselves ok so why did he compared

00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:43,910
like category 5 to the rest right so he

00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:46,040
could do have done many other

00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:48,110
comparisons we could have compared like

00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,910
the very attractive and attractive to

00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:54,800
the other three groups or any of these

00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:57,860
other combinations here so and the

00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,899
problem now is that so did not detect an

00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:02,980
effect even in reality if in reality is

00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:06,049
there is no effect that probability will

00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:09,260
drop significantly the more comparisons

00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:11,809
we make or we could make so in fact in

00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:16,400
this case the study had like actually

00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:17,990
multiple waves and so we should actually

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,280
change this exponent here from 4

00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:22,250
Dickstein because this study was

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:24,740
repeated four times and so then suddenly

00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:26,390
it's not so not such an extraordinary

00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:29,720
finding anymore that there is this

00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:31,850
difference because it's even like the

00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:34,039
probability is even more than 50% that

00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:35,510
you would just find find this difference

00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:37,940
even if there is no difference

00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:40,549
whatsoever in the in the attractiveness

00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:42,340
between these different in a bit rate of

00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:45,980
boys between these different categories

00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:47,490
so in statistics what's done in to

00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,690
address this is to

00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:50,400
adjust for what is called multiple

00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:51,690
comparison so whenever you have this

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,309
option of running mastered many

00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:55,470
different comparisons between different

00:17:53,309 --> 00:17:57,450
groups one should use any of those

00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:58,500
Corrections and the most famous one most

00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:00,240
straightforward one is called the

00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,640
bonferroni correction but there are

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,240
other ways like ways to practice and

00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,410
control the false discovery rate etc so

00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,910
this is just something I think which

00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:10,830
needs to be stressed especially in our

00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:12,990
age where now in terms of when we talk

00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:15,720
about big data and there's so much data

00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:18,360
that is not collected in for one

00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:20,460
specific experiment but what that data

00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:22,679
that people will mind afterwards to find

00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:24,360
different relationships and that's very

00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:25,950
easy to be led astray and just to

00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,530
concern your own prejudices innocence

00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:30,900
and find results that are significant

00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:33,059
even though in reality they might

00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:37,380
nothing being good nothing's going on

00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:40,350
maybe and so first one last may be

00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:42,450
suggesting here is that I want to refer

00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,980
to this quote by Jacques Lacan who said

00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:46,500
that when you draw a rabbit out of a hat

00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:50,280
you have to have put it in beforehand

00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:52,200
right so in that sense I think it's

00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,270
always important to be aware of one's

00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,850
prior assumptions and one's prejudices

00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:58,500
because those will lead you to analyze

00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:00,210
your data or look at the data in a

00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,460
specific way think about the small

00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:04,080
school initiative say people looked only

00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,610
at the top performing schools because

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,559
they thought okay probably the small

00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:09,150
schools will do better and so that and

00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:11,190
then the data concerned actually what

00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:12,960
they thought so it's not always that you

00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:15,330
do people are just prejudiced and they

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,980
don't look at it but the way you look at

00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:19,230
it it's also important and it's easy to

00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:21,630
just confirm what you already think is

00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:24,720
true and and with that I would like to

00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:26,370
thank you and I think hope you have used

00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,080
a bit of time to take questions thank

00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:33,350
you very much

00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:33,350
[Applause]

00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:48,400
[Applause]

00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:05,700
right I mean yes certainly I think that

00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:07,260
affluent parts to that I mean always be

00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,820
kind of suspicious about results on

00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:10,649
observational studies in the first days

00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:12,620
is one thing I would suggest things

00:20:10,649 --> 00:20:15,450
should be reproducible so for example

00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:16,980
for the school example you would want

00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:18,840
also want to establish that this happens

00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:21,510
over multiple years let's say for

00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:24,240
example because you if it's just a

00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:27,299
random noise right you would it could be

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,620
that on one year let's say these schools

00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:30,570
are doing really well but then in the

00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:32,159
next year not the this compact

00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:34,919
completely disappears and it's actually

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,750
what happened in many of these cases so

00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:39,330
you want to decipher their trends over

00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:41,399
time that you can see that is not kind

00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:44,789
of a one-shot thing where you observe

00:20:41,399 --> 00:20:46,679
one thing only once secondly I think

00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:49,020
it's always important like at least in

00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:51,390
science that people should do randomized

00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:53,370
control trial trials and experiments to

00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:55,950
actually verify these hypotheses right

00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:57,960
so one if if you get something from an

00:20:55,950 --> 00:21:00,029
observation study should always be

00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,890
confirmed later on in an experiment very

00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:05,669
edge you have a control group which also

00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:07,710
helps for example like this this fallacy

00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:09,510
that the flight instructor here had

00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:10,590
wouldn't have happened if you have two

00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:12,390
groups like if you actually have a

00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:14,190
control group and you administer like I

00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:17,460
do to dispraise and and a punishment

00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:20,700
thing there then you would can kind of

00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:23,070
control for these differences but again

00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:26,250
like it's not it's very often one can

00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:29,070
and cannot spot certain problems and

00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:30,929
it's very easy to fall prey to that and

00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:32,850
it doesn't even help you if you have if

00:21:30,929 --> 00:21:34,770
you're educated in this or sometimes

00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:37,799
which might be the best bad news because

00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:39,659
like often you might know this in one

00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:41,549
specific scenario but then like once

00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:44,880
you're in a different setting you know

00:21:41,549 --> 00:21:46,260
like you don't see see it there so you

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,659
know and then you might be completely

00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:52,470
oblivious to some of these issues so I

00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:54,270
guess yeah just be watchful for that and

00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:56,340
always also talk with the subject

00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:58,500
experts whether your hypotheses make

00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,610
sense or seem to be kind of out of the

00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:03,330
blue

00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:05,610
imagine even someone disagrees yes yes

00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:07,440
the a I think that state it's a good

00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:10,350
point to I'd like always like listen to

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,150
not only one side and also try to at

00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:26,250
least put you put you into the shoes of

00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:28,020
someone who's agree to put with you yes

00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:29,790
yes and it's kind of I guess the

00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:32,970
decisions often accused offer that they

00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:35,070
will always poke holes into into kind of

00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:36,690
reasoning and see okay you did you have

00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:39,780
to consider this business and its holds

00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:42,750
only under certain conditions in a sense

00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:44,880
yes I guess you can shoot down any

00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:48,330
argument I also against select a few

00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:51,420
using data to prove your point all right

00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:54,840
so I guess one can only appeal to trying

00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:56,490
to for us if we do research try to be as

00:22:54,840 --> 00:23:03,180
objective as possible and try to step

00:22:56,490 --> 00:23:06,540
out of our own perspectives there yes

00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:08,550
yes yes they they they moved away from

00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:10,260
that and admitted kind of that this was

00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:13,550
not not like to the betterment of

00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:13,550
students in the end yes

00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:24,130
that's another effect right that often

00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:26,290
happens like when you and you put the

00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:28,150
spotlight on something you might do some

00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:29,440
initiatives and then you pour a lot of

00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:31,210
money into it and then everybody has

00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,340
like this first confirmation the thing

00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:34,690
where where then everybody is so excited

00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,340
about it and then you actually see an

00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:40,900
effect but it might completely disappear

00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:42,310
once you cut this observe out yeah but I

00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,960
don't like in this case I think it was

00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:45,580
more like actually they didn't see some

00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,110
of those improvements which was one of

00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:54,340
the reasons then why later on they

00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:58,450
decided to backtrack okay thank you very

00:23:54,340 --> 00:24:01,749
much for the conference

00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:01,749
