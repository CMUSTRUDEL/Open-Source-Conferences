thank you oh all right so I would

00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:11,389
explain what I do but I was like so

00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:14,280
excited by Naomi's little sort of

00:00:11,389 --> 00:00:16,650
visualization of the mission of Eli

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:21,030
fineness I confess to my job that I am

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:25,800
that platform at OHSU so it's awesome so

00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:28,080
thank you sad I want to start by telling

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,890
you a sort of a little bit of an origin

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,440
story why my colleagues and I sort of

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,600
embarked on this study of journal data

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,170
sharing policies both from a specific

00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,980
instance and then sort of more generally

00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:47,340
why we care so about a couple years ago

00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:50,460
the tea on email lab approached me in

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:53,220
the OHSU library with a frantic and

00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:57,120
urgent plea to help them publish their

00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:59,460
data and they had submitted a important

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,270
paper to Nature Neuroscience & Nature

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:05,219
Neuroscience had accepted that paper and

00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:08,190
at the same time another lab had

00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:11,280
submitted a paper on the same topic with

00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:13,890
very similar data and as you know in

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,409
science for better or for worse who is

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:19,290
first really matters and the sort of

00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:23,970
like finish line is whoever to get it

00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:25,950
publicly available first wins oh so they

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:31,320
needed our help and getting it publicly

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:35,130
available move see this is when the

00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:38,610
technology failed so but this data as

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:41,430
all data is was pretty complex so the

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:45,240
data concluded hundreds of images and

00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:47,250
moving images files that and analyses

00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,689
they were aimed at trying to understand

00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:54,030
the connections between the thalamus and

00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:58,680
its targets in the cortex and do not ask

00:01:54,030 --> 00:02:02,250
me any more about that and so it was

00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:04,770
hundreds of images that ideally should

00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:08,039
be viewed within a viewer that often

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:11,819
offers sort of a three-dimensional view

00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:15,230
of these images and it was terabytes and

00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:15,230
terabytes of data

00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:23,250
but we were actually able to do it the

00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:26,310
lab brought over physically to the

00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:29,129
library multiple hard drives with these

00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:31,709
images and the analyses and we over a

00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:34,650
week or so like slowly loaded them into

00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:39,030
our institutional repository and we were

00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:41,639
able to help them get their data up it

00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:44,700
was in a public repository it was open

00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:46,889
and nature thought that was just fine

00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,739
and they want they published their paper

00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:51,689
and a genie who is in the last session

00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:54,359
it was sort of it was actually the last

00:02:51,689 --> 00:02:57,120
paper that she published her first paper

00:02:54,359 --> 00:02:59,040
I guess published and then she graduated

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:04,159
there was a huge success it was awesome

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:07,650
but the solution we provided while

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:10,799
technically open functionally it was not

00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:13,769
it really did not facilitate reuse and

00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:15,629
Max was here on Monday and we were in

00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:18,120
this open source meeting and he coined

00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:19,530
the term clopin which i think is just

00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,790
like the most amazing thing and I've

00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,849
been using it ever since

00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:26,400
where and you have this every Sunday

00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:29,579
yeah right you have this data that is

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,769
you know technically open but when you

00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:34,409
really think about the reason why we

00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:39,150
advocate for open it doesn't meet the

00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:41,400
mark so the other reason why we care

00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,840
about that mouse and we care about this

00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,379
issue and you've probably seen this side

00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:49,260
like five times now or something anyway

00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:52,889
is that I work in the ontology

00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:54,930
development group at OHSU and the sort

00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:58,829
of the bread and butter of our group why

00:03:54,930 --> 00:04:01,590
we exist is to facilitate translational

00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:05,909
research meaning that we're trying to

00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:08,579
take basic science discoveries and

00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:11,579
advances and move them over to the

00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:13,859
clinic to advance human health so in the

00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:17,639
case of genies Mouse we want to take

00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:19,650
that mouse to the bedside but the kind

00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,500
of solution that we provided for that

00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:26,130
neutral neuroscience contributes to

00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:28,419
siloed and disconnected and really hard

00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:31,930
to use data so this is

00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:33,930
Mellisa RPI and the ontology development

00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:37,509
group coined this term the chasm of

00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:42,370
semantic despair so there's this big gap

00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:45,310
between how we often share data and what

00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:51,159
that data is actually enabled to sort of

00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:54,249
do and facilitate so you know ultimately

00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:56,169
what you want to have is to write may

00:04:54,249 --> 00:04:58,599
only already talked about you want

00:04:56,169 --> 00:05:01,840
solutions that achieve and facilitate

00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:04,689
fair data so data that is findable by

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,979
both humans and machines data that is

00:05:04,689 --> 00:05:10,810
accessible by both humans and machines

00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:14,169
interoperable and reusable and there's

00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:19,020
like an array of workflows and solutions

00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:19,020
and practices that facilitate their data

00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:25,750
so this is a story the end of a story

00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:28,120
that my four-year-old recently wrote I

00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:30,789
do not know what it says about my

00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:33,159
parenting but I will say that it

00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:35,439
completely reminds me of sort of this

00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:37,300
like badge of openness that we often use

00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:39,909
so we talked about open science and we

00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:42,279
talked about data open data and it's

00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:46,089
this like sticky shield that everybody

00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:49,000
can get behind but when we don't have

00:05:46,089 --> 00:05:52,210
the practices and guidelines and

00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,270
infrastructure that facilitate fair open

00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:58,089
data you sort of like killed it data

00:05:55,270 --> 00:06:00,550
goes to die if it doesn't have an

00:05:58,089 --> 00:06:02,979
infrastructure and a wrapper of

00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:05,860
description around it that facilitates

00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:09,490
reuse and enables why we make it open in

00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:12,490
the first place so we've talked a lot

00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:14,620
and I always sort of describe this as

00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:17,560
well so we have this broad agreement

00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:20,529
about how important open data is and

00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:23,319
that's reflected in emerging policies

00:06:20,529 --> 00:06:26,129
that's reflected in what we're seeing

00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:28,509
from publishers in terms of sort of the

00:06:26,129 --> 00:06:31,569
guidelines that are starting to emerge

00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:34,020
it's reflected in what researchers

00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:36,729
report they understand and know

00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,490
unfortunately it's not yet reflected in

00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:41,479
our practice

00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:44,840
so there's this gap we're in we sort of

00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:47,509
have this sort of collective buy-in but

00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:50,569
we're not yet putting that buy-in into

00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:52,580
the best practice so my colleagues and I

00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:54,889
were very interested in this for that

00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:57,080
reasons I've already described and we

00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:59,690
were particularly interested and really

00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,190
sort of digging further into that sort

00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:04,099
of scenario that we encountered with

00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:07,190
nature it's like we're raw nature has a

00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:09,380
pretty robots data sharing policy what

00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:12,710
does that look like elsewhere and how is

00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:17,990
it that nature accepted this like crap

00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:20,300
solution good sharing our data so we

00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:23,120
started looking at that so what we did

00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:24,800
is that we are specifically given where

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,440
we are we're located at which s you

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,800
pretty much interested right now in the

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:36,169
biomedical literature so using journal

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:39,560
citation report we analyzed 318 journals

00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:41,659
that had a subject classification that

00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,630
would sort of fall under biomedical

00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:47,270
research and we limited our sample set

00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:50,050
to journals that fell into the top

00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:52,789
quartile for either publishing volume or

00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:54,289
impact factor and we did that because we

00:07:52,789 --> 00:07:57,020
were sort of wanted to get a sense of

00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:59,840
why but you know sort of and but just

00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:02,840
the sort of sheer scope of what was

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,669
being published captures sort of a lot

00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,990
of that activity but we also wanted to

00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:10,069
understand this from a sort of a

00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:12,889
prestige perspective we utilized a

00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:14,389
rubric developed by Victoria Stodden and

00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:15,800
her colleagues which they published a

00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:18,500
few years ago that was looking at

00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:21,349
computational research so we started at

00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:25,009
the top with very explicit policies that

00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:28,069
have data publication as a condition of

00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:31,250
publication burnt without any exceptions

00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:33,079
or barring exceptions like pH I for

00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:38,870
example and then down to the bottom

00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:41,000
number six no mention we also looked at

00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:43,700
some characteristics of the journals for

00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,040
example where they open access or not we

00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:49,010
also wanted to look at and sort of be

00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,120
able to tease out and structural data

00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:53,000
like proteomic

00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:55,790
and omics data versus more general data

00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,580
sets because previous work has told us

00:08:55,790 --> 00:09:00,740
that for structural data set sort of the

00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:02,900
data sharing requirements is a bit more

00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:05,330
mature and robust and we didn't want

00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:06,890
just looking at that to sort of skew the

00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:10,820
overall picture of what we're finding

00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:13,279
and sort of trying to understand we also

00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:17,060
looked at where are the guidelines

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:20,210
asking researchers to put their data so

00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:22,279
is it in a public repository or in size

00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:25,460
some guys basement in his hard drive

00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:27,140
right so like that matters and then you

00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:29,540
know this is just a sort of another

00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:33,470
dimension of that a little bit of detail

00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:35,990
there we also wanted to know what kind

00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:38,630
of licensing was being recommended or

00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:40,820
even discussed for data so was the

00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:43,640
guideline recommending or even bringing

00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:45,410
up CC 0 or cc buys an option for the

00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:49,040
data sharing or was it not addressed at

00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:53,120
all and then finally was archival and

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,770
retention policy addressed and then sort

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,320
of as an interesting dimension for

00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:59,510
ourselves we were wondering if when it's

00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:02,540
sort of articulating these policies if

00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:04,480
the journal was sort of framing them

00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:06,830
within the

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,250
under the framework of reproducibility

00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:13,130
which for better or worse as well sort

00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:14,690
of like the sky is falling is where many

00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:16,970
of these policies should really started

00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:21,190
to emerge and gain a lot of discussion

00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:24,350
and sort of like popular science on news

00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:27,020
alright so this is what's happened so

00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:29,150
here we have just a look at what we

00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:32,180
found in terms of just the prevalence of

00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:34,700
data policies and does journal have a

00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:38,650
policy along sort of our six dimensions

00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:41,330
so we found that unfortunately and the

00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:43,370
journals with a very strong data sharing

00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:44,120
policy that very explicit data sharing

00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:46,700
policy

00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,980
we're only eleven point nine percent so

00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,690
about twelve percent of our data set and

00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:54,050
if you look over to the right you'll see

00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:57,230
that the bulk over 31 percent had no

00:10:54,050 --> 00:11:00,170
mention of data sharing we also looked

00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:03,130
at this in terms of unpublishing volume

00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:05,260
because we had all that data as well so

00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:07,090
maybe it looks pretty dismal when you're

00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,770
counting the number of journals but when

00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:10,720
you're looking at sort of the overall

00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:13,330
publication volume and sort of what's

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,950
actually being communicated does it look

00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:17,230
any better it does look a little bit

00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:19,420
better so when you look at it for the

00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:21,850
publishing volume sort of the number of

00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:25,540
site able items it jumps up to

00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:28,120
thirty-two point seven percent had a

00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:31,000
strong data sharing policy that category

00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:33,880
one however most of that is plot just to

00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,250
take out class one that drops down again

00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,690
to about eleven point three percent that

00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:41,890
doesn't mean those plot papers aren't

00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:45,100
real obviously they are but it does it

00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:47,850
creates sort of you need that context to

00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:51,910
really understand what's going on there

00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:54,730
all right so we also wanted to look at

00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:57,850
impact factor as as it relates to data

00:11:54,730 --> 00:12:00,570
sharing policies so we did find that

00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:03,580
impact pack factor there was a

00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:06,670
statistically significant association

00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:09,400
between impact factor and the presence

00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:12,280
of a data sharing policy across most of

00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:14,800
our categories so for that strongest

00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:17,170
data sharing policy the average impact

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:20,140
factor for those journals was just above

00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:22,810
eight for those without a data sharing

00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:26,320
mentioned data sharing whatsoever it was

00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:28,900
just over three and that sort of trend

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,330
continued when we did the statistical

00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:34,990
type test tests across these different

00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:37,660
dimensions and I think it's important

00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:40,240
here for us to describe that we we don't

00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:42,250
view this as an indication that higher

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,280
impact factor journals are better

00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:47,620
journals but that there might be other

00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:50,140
reasons why we're seeing this

00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:55,360
association but at the same time this

00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:58,000
could be a lever for advocating for more

00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,710
journal data sharing policies and also

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,470
for putting in front of people that are

00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:04,330
skeptical you can say the journals that

00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:07,510
matter most to you whether I think they

00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:09,040
should or not require this so it's

00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:12,820
actually something we've used a lot in

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:14,680
OHSU and then sadly actually another

00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:16,210
dimension that we looked at

00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,880
because so

00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:22,600
in our discussions about how to improve

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:24,640
transparency reproducibility public

00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:27,100
engagement and trust with science we

00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:29,770
pair open access to the literature with

00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:33,100
open data there are sort of partners in

00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:36,190
that transformation but sadly we found

00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:38,920
no significant association between the

00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:41,230
access model of the journal and the

00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,690
presence of a data sharing policy so

00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:46,120
it's hoping something that we actually

00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:53,399
hypothesized would be different but it

00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:56,500
was not we looked at where data was

00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:59,709
recommended to be deposited or the

00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:02,620
method of sharing so good thing is over

00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:07,240
60% recommended through a public

00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:11,700
repository bad thing is I'm still quite

00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:15,279
a few didn't recommend any specific

00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:17,490
method and I would say also still in a

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:20,230
sort of a disappointing way is that

00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:23,170
there were a high percentage that

00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:25,480
recommended sharing through the journal

00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:28,839
itself and I will say a lot of those

00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:35,920
numbers are Elsevier I'll leave that

00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:37,540
there and then finally that other piece

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,510
and when we're thinking about sort of

00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:43,180
that fair data landscape something else

00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:46,360
that showed up is really broken is the

00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:50,080
overall lack of guidance on licensing

00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:52,540
and archival retention so even for those

00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:56,320
journals with a very strong data sharing

00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:59,950
policy there was a minority of instances

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:03,880
when they spoke to data licensing and I

00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:07,270
believe only two of the journals and our

00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:13,270
entire data set specifically addressed

00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:15,370
archival retention okay so a few things

00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:17,050
like closing comments here and I also

00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:18,820
talked about maybe at the end what we

00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:22,329
didn't look at that we should have but

00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:24,339
so like how do we improve sort of this

00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:26,920
this state of affairs and I don't mean

00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:27,710
to like present like I'm excited about

00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,350
open data

00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:32,900
love open data but there's a lot we can

00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:34,610
do to make it more impactful so a few

00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:36,650
things about like how can we get to a

00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:39,770
place that we love our data more and

00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:41,990
that we get scientists and enable

00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:44,930
scientists to view it as an asset as

00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:47,000
important as their papers so first this

00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:48,980
is our github repo where we have our

00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,730
data and we'd love for you to love our

00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:55,460
data and add to it so something that we

00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:59,270
would like to do is really build into

00:15:55,460 --> 00:16:01,520
build a community contributed repository

00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:04,790
of data sharing policies for journals

00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:06,740
that we can not only add to sort of the

00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:09,950
corpus we've already established that we

00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:12,800
can attract change over time we also

00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:15,650
need to build out our rubric you notice

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:18,020
that we didn't talk about metadata yes

00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:20,570
we could why didn't we look at that but

00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:22,430
we didn't assess policies for how

00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:24,860
they're addressing metadata for example

00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:27,110
so there's ways in our work specifically

00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:31,910
can be improved so we'd love for you to

00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:33,920
love our data um but what do we need to

00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:36,680
give researchers and we really need to

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,840
give them all the stuff because and I

00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:41,690
think sort of and I always talk and

00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:45,200
spoke to my heart in this way is because

00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:47,780
there is no magic bullet a journal data

00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,520
sharing policy isn't going to solve this

00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:52,160
problem

00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:54,350
upstream education alone isn't going to

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:57,890
solve this problem and neither are

00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:59,990
badges it's sort of this modular complex

00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:02,000
of all these different solutions that

00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:03,440
some researchers are getting needs of

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,570
these and they're going to need some of

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,900
that that are really going to get us to

00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:11,540
a place that data is not only more open

00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:13,820
but it's more reusable so some things

00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:17,270
that excite me and sort of speak to that

00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:20,830
spectrum is projects like that right so

00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:24,530
projects like that make upstream

00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:27,170
collaboration and versioning and sort of

00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:29,270
preserving and articulating and

00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:32,150
documenting the environment in which

00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:36,170
data is created easier to do it's

00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:38,390
essential there's a center for open

00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:39,620
science and the top guidelines that

00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:43,070
they've established

00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:47,390
so the top guidelines are the oh my god

00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:51,200
transparency openness promotion thank

00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:53,990
you guidelines and they are sort of

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:57,170
several levels and via pretty easily to

00:17:53,990 --> 00:18:00,920
understand schema recommend certain

00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:03,920
practices that journals and repositories

00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:07,460
and funders can take to facilitate not

00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:09,830
only open data but reusable data and I

00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:11,720
can envision taking those top guidelines

00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:14,090
and moving them into censored

00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:16,940
boilerplate language that publishers

00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:20,870
could easily adopt in the sort of the

00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:24,080
journal domain space the reusable data

00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:29,540
project is a project that Melissa Handel

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:32,270
RPI and her collaborator at LBNL Seth

00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:35,480
Carbone have started with the support of

00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:38,300
n cats and this project really aims to

00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:41,210
dig into the importance of Licensing in

00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:42,920
data sharing and data reuse which

00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:45,800
obviously already talked about the gap

00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:47,930
in the policies so as you breathe air

00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:50,420
into it engage the community around

00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:53,690
discussion but it will also include a

00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:55,970
star rating for data repose and the

00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:59,150
licensing attached to those repos and

00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:02,780
datasets that really indicate sort of

00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:05,150
with one star you can't really reuse it

00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:07,310
at all - I think five stars when you'll

00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:11,930
sort of the licensing language really

00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:16,460
facilitates both human and computational

00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:19,250
reuse and then just a little bit about

00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:21,800
context if you were at the keynote talk

00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:23,810
yesterday where and she brought up that

00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:26,600
picture of the cow that some of us could

00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:28,610
see and some of us could see and so we

00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:31,430
really do need to be able to see the cow

00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:34,760
and that's meaning that we need to be

00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:37,730
able to facilitate simple but robust

00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:41,240
description of datasets that fit in and

00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:43,820
are facilitated sort of along that sort

00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:46,160
of spectrum or cycle of data creation

00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:48,560
and projects like mantle that were

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,810
discussed yesterday in the talks where

00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,169
researchers will be able to sort of it

00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:54,539
sounded like like

00:19:52,169 --> 00:19:56,309
dreamworld like a drop-down of ontology

00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:58,259
that is inferred from the data that

00:19:56,309 --> 00:20:01,769
people can apply there there there are

00:19:58,259 --> 00:20:03,720
data set it's like magical but it's

00:20:01,769 --> 00:20:05,279
tools like that and some of what and I

00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,789
only described that I think will really

00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:10,019
sort of move the needle on think Heather
