hello everybody I'm going to attempt to

00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:07,490
speak by honest I don't use because it

00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,950
turns out this is for the recording

00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:11,030
that's for the room that's awkward

00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,709
so we're going to see if this works but

00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:13,820
definitely call me if you can't hear me

00:00:12,709 --> 00:00:17,539
in the back there and I can switch to

00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:20,600
the microphone anyways as my fabulous

00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:21,320
you know lead show head told you I'm

00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,440
Michelle

00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:26,150
I'm from 18s that's the number 18 and

00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,130
the letter F not to be confused with

00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:30,830
like 80s which is a different part of

00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:32,390
government I really do we are a part of

00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,200
government and I'm going to see if I can

00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,210
make it through this entire thing

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,600
without my like rock star things going

00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:41,269
off here turns out I'm not a rock star

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,429
we are kind of a design and development

00:00:41,269 --> 00:00:44,749
contracting group within government with

00:00:43,429 --> 00:00:46,429
federal employees we're not actual

00:00:44,749 --> 00:00:48,379
contractors but we work with other parts

00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:51,710
of government to get digital services

00:00:48,379 --> 00:00:55,190
done this is our website but I'm here

00:00:51,710 --> 00:01:00,170
today to talk to you about one of our

00:00:55,190 --> 00:01:01,729
projects and how we made it I also was

00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,589
like everybody hates powerpoints I'm

00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:06,950
going to try a new thing which has

00:01:03,589 --> 00:01:08,060
actually wrote out the process that we

00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,110
kind of employed that I want to tell you

00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,210
that space you will have it as a

00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,350
resource later you can let me know after

00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:14,570
this Marcus has a good idea or a bad

00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:15,770
idea but we're experimenting to see if

00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,660
it works so that way you all have a

00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,740
place to go later so look up all the

00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,970
stuff that we're doing I thought we

00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,410
weren't recording so like well if you

00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,730
all actually want to know these things I

00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:24,440
don't have a PowerPoint that I was like

00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:26,120
three fancy words on a picture of Steve

00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:29,060
Jobs and like that's it that doesn't

00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,020
help you later so in any case we're

00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:33,500
going to talk about today about this

00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:36,140
website so like I said we're 18f we work

00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,670
with other parts of government one of

00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,560
the the folks that I work with is the

00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:40,910
Department of the Interior and the

00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,440
Department of Interior is kind of like a

00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:45,140
shell company for other parts of

00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,730
government you may have heard of the

00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:48,200
Park Service that's a part of Department

00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:50,060
the Interior you may have heard of BLM

00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,040
Bureau of Land Management that's a part

00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:54,830
of Interior you may have heard of let's

00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,510
see he might remember a not-so-great

00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:59,300
part of history deepwater horizon off

00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:01,670
the coast and the Gulf of Mexico

00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:03,710
the folks that managed that part of our

00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:06,200
offshore resources are a part of

00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:08,149
Department of Interior a fierce back

00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,800
let's see it was three or four years

00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:11,870
back at this point

00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,920
a certain office in that group said hey

00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,750
we're going to work with this

00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:17,180
international group called extractive

00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:20,090
industries transparency initiative part

00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:22,910
of that title and figure out a way to

00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:24,260
make all of our data about extractive

00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:27,110
industries more accessible and more

00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:28,430
usable something that industry folks can

00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:31,520
get on board with something that civil

00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:32,900
society groups like nonprofits that sort

00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,790
of thing can also get on board with and

00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,260
governments happy about we eventually

00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:37,670
have this website I'm going to tell you

00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:40,400
today though about how we got to this

00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:42,110
website if you read my little pitch you

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,420
might remember that I wrote things like

00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:46,040
oh I'm sure we've all been there and you

00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,290
know we have the thing where we start

00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,730
building a thing and we're like oh it's

00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,620
pretty beautiful semi dashboard there's

00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:53,810
gonna be even things there's going to be

00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,250
like nude missing data all the stuff is

00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,690
going to display beautifully and then

00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:00,380
when we actually get the data we're like

00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:07,460
oh we forgot 50 different parts of how

00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:11,300
to make this happen so do this is the

00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:12,710
thing I wrote up I'm not going to read

00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,450
this entire thing for you I am going to

00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:15,739
show you the the link at the end so if

00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:18,620
you want to go back to this later it's

00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:25,670
there for you but I'm going to use it to

00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:30,260
chat a little bit I didn't okay so at a

00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:31,250
super high level this is what we did and

00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,750
I'll be going through some of the

00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,070
examples of how we did this thing but

00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,840
I'm going to leave time for questions at

00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:37,070
the end because I figure you will have

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,510
plenty of questions but maybe that's the

00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:41,090
best way to talk about this sort of work

00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:42,590
I'm sure you've all ran across specific

00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:45,800
like sticking points when you've tried

00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:47,510
to do this sort of work so that's how we

00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,790
got to that website is initially doing

00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:51,320
lots of user research I know how many of

00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:55,040
you are you consider yourselves more

00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:56,690
design type folks see you I mean you can

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,180
be more than one thing and how many more

00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:03,470
like data type folks you're like I user

00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:04,730
research what yeah so one of the things

00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:07,130
that was really neat about this project

00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:10,610
is that even though it was data and very

00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:11,840
data oriented we were given flexibility

00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:13,850
we were able to go in and say like well

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,260
we know it's all like ones and zeros we

00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:17,060
know that's all very like you think we

00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,320
should do this through statistics but

00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,850
actually let's go talk to our target

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,450
audiences let's talk to the people who

00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:23,430
might be using this data in the end

00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:24,750
and see what they're interested in and

00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,490
we spent quite a bit of time that was

00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,810
our first thing that we did we spent

00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,220
quite a bit of time talking to folks you

00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,540
might actually care about I don't know

00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,710
the mine that's in their neighborhood

00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,020
next door and want to know how to

00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:37,020
interact with that data and that let us

00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,730
do things like okay all these different

00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,200
agencies across and all in your cases

00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:41,520
maybe thought agencies at stakeholders

00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,250
all of these stakeholders I think you

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,080
want these 50 different things actually

00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,700
these folks that we talk to don't care

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,650
about any of that they actually just

00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:52,250
want to know basic definitions about XYZ

00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:55,320
and that's how we started this project

00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:57,750
I'm not going to go into lots of details

00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,340
on that because that's a whole different

00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,290
like you could go to a whole conference

00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,970
one just like I can't user test a user

00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:04,710
research this kind of thing but if you

00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:06,540
want to talk about if you are curious

00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,580
definitely ask me questions we'll get

00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,560
there

00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:12,300
after that the point to I want to make

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,440
to you today for big points point to you

00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:18,180
today when you're doing the sort of

00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:21,090
design work always get to your data

00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:24,540
never use mock data I don't know if

00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:26,160
that's come up for you before if you get

00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:28,050
there people say oh yes here's the data

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,700
set it will look something like this it

00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:31,260
never looks like the people think they

00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,940
mock it up like and then you try and put

00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:36,950
it into your models later and it's never

00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:39,210
right yeah so there's a very good tips

00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:40,170
written further down there but again I'm

00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:44,610
not going to read through the thing for

00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:45,840
you if someone says hey team you should

00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,460
build the finger we're not going to give

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,230
you the dataset the thing you say back

00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:53,370
is that what results in a day by day

00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:55,680
slip of Iowa State and that usually gets

00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:58,140
people's attention and is 100% true you

00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,060
cannot possibly start to design for

00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:02,760
information that you don't know what it

00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:06,900
looks like yet let's see what else I got

00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:08,370
there all right right so for part three

00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:12,750
and four this is the part that got super

00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:15,360
interesting for our team we started

00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:17,640
doing very small area cycles and playing

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,220
with the data this is to say if you've

00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,750
got a big data set you might think oh I

00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,670
should kind of look at it and then make

00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,560
a full page that looks fully done out in

00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:27,770
this kind of thing actually a great

00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:30,750
first step is to pull that information

00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:32,080
into something much simpler let me see I

00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:36,120
believe

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:38,349
I pulled up this Oh

00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,210
once for example one of the first things

00:06:38,349 --> 00:06:42,699
we did when we got a bunch of our data

00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:43,990
together for this site is have one of

00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:47,039
our talented folks actually who's

00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:48,969
sitting right here being very supportive

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,229
play with the data a little bit and pull

00:06:48,969 --> 00:06:53,830
it up into something that we as a team

00:06:50,229 --> 00:06:57,930
can talk about because the first step is

00:06:53,830 --> 00:07:01,060
you figuring I think this data means and

00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:02,349
finding out where the holes are it's not

00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,610
lost time like a lot of times you'll

00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:04,599
talk to your lead stakeholder or

00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,069
something like that and they'll be like

00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:08,409
oh but you're not actually designing the

00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:09,940
thing but you are there's a lot of

00:07:08,409 --> 00:07:17,650
throwaway work involved in this sort of

00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:20,159
thing to do and then once you've started

00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:22,810
figuring that out we found very useful

00:07:20,159 --> 00:07:29,020
actually writing out a thing let me pull

00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:30,699
that up in a bigger space for you okay

00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:33,550
so what we found out over time in our

00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:35,500
project is that people wanted to look at

00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:36,699
this complex data via location which

00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,080
makes sense probably a lot of you have

00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:41,430
run into that before - it's like folks

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,960
are interested in what's local to them

00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:45,159
so hey we had all these like Oh what

00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,229
does the state look like let's pull it

00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:48,819
into you know basic charts okay we kind

00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:52,029
of understand it let's actually try to

00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:54,370
write out translate what is like a robot

00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:56,469
data set of course you know things that

00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:58,870
are big made for robots to understand

00:07:56,469 --> 00:08:00,669
into something that as humans sentences

00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:03,279
that humans can understand using the

00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:06,430
real data so this we would for example

00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:09,940
start to write up a thing say hey Shawn

00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:12,460
can you pull the actual numbers for Utah

00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:14,770
copy and paste them over does this work

00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:17,379
does this not work oh whoops

00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:18,699
like you'll see in comments here I think

00:08:17,379 --> 00:08:20,650
there's one down here is like oh we

00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:21,909
found out only three of the commodities

00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:23,620
that we were dealing with actually show

00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:25,810
up on the site whoops

00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:27,669
is that the same across all 50 states oh

00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:30,129
we can't actually write that design like

00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:32,019
that at all so before it invested in

00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:34,510
creating an entire website you've got

00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:36,490
this kind of space free to play and

00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:39,810
understand it's really cheap Google Docs

00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:39,810
very cheap to play with

00:08:41,709 --> 00:08:53,120
yeah all right once you're at that next

00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:54,950
step then you can test it

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,410
you don't need again don't need to build

00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:59,300
out the entire thing build out the next

00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:00,940
step for you to learn a thing for

00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:02,930
example in that one we're like actually

00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,910
we're really not sure if people even

00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:08,240
want to know about gilsu night for

00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:09,740
example something like that so let's

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,390
build something out so we can test just

00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:13,130
that one thing understand if it's

00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:14,720
important or not and then spend all the

00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:19,459
time investing and building that out or

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,990
not or this next thing so hopefully me

00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:22,760
rambling through this long thing that I

00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:24,080
wrote out which again we'll see if that

00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:27,440
was a good way to go or not you can let

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:30,860
me know when you look at it later the

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,930
idea is you're able to understand the

00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:35,149
data quickly write it up in a way that

00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:37,130
makes sense for your team and then move

00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:38,810
through these tiny testing phases to

00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:41,270
figure out what's making sense and not

00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:42,860
making sense instead of not having the

00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:44,930
data to start with having the wrong data

00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:47,000
start with or building out this entire

00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:48,740
thing finally showing its folks and then

00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,329
being like oh actually none of this

00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:52,730
relates to me at all none of this I

00:09:50,329 --> 00:09:55,180
understand it all and then you've just

00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:59,140
spent all this time that isn't helpful I

00:09:55,180 --> 00:10:01,700
think I will pause now again because I'm

00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:04,040
doing this a new way see if any

00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:06,350
questions so far I've got other things

00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,820
that I'd love to talk about but that was

00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:09,620
a lot of words to start it's early in

00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,610
the morning and wasn't you do you all

00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,200
have any questions so far

00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:16,550
I like conversation more than talk in

00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:18,020
that book so I got it so the question

00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:19,339
was and doing this because I know we're

00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:22,399
recording how long was the entire

00:10:19,339 --> 00:10:24,680
project it changed over time I should

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:27,440
say but we but 18s has been working on

00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:29,240
this project for let's see over three

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,750
years now about three years something

00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,060
like that

00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:33,770
in terms of like a larger project scope

00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:36,490
I don't know if y'all are interested in

00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:36,490
that too it's um

00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:41,149
all this was within a much larger brac

00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:42,890
bureaucracy of course and when this

00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:44,600
project started out it was oh we should

00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:46,750
publish things in PDFs you know like

00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,279
that it was like printed PDFs

00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,540
and we start with a few people had a

00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:50,589
visit and that was like merrily did we

00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,779
really don't need to be doing PDFs

00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:54,339
anymore come on so we started quite

00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:55,750
small and the first thing that we built

00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:56,800
out was you know a little prototype that

00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,120
said yes you can put things on the

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,410
internet and people won't misunderstand

00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:03,730
it and like see you it'll be fine and

00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:06,790
from that we're able to grow bigger and

00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:08,649
bigger and bigger so even the iterative

00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:11,259
process of figuring out what to build

00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:13,569
next also included the scope of the

00:11:11,259 --> 00:11:15,790
project generally and right now we're at

00:11:13,569 --> 00:11:17,740
a place where folks are really happy

00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:20,709
with the website which I'll show you

00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:22,209
this again let's take a different page

00:11:20,709 --> 00:11:27,060
of the website this time because it's

00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:29,550
cool no that's not it that's an older

00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:32,470
there we go

00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:34,509
okay I'll show you some of the fun parts

00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:37,029
that I later so people are pretty happy

00:11:34,509 --> 00:11:38,860
with a website now and now the point of

00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:40,420
our work is to figure out better data

00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:42,850
pipelines to make this more maintainable

00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:44,529
over time pull in some other parts of

00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:47,620
department the interior that sort of

00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:49,899
thing our best story oblate was one of

00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:51,310
our folks going to what was it with the

00:11:49,899 --> 00:11:52,389
administration to news there's new heads

00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,759
of the different parts of the department

00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:56,380
interior the head of USGS went to

00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:58,180
Congress for something and the folks at

00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,889
Congress like hey have you heard of this

00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,029
why aren't you involved in that never

00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:02,470
want to have your boss embarrass to

00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:06,160
Congress so he came back to his folks

00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:09,300
we're like why aren't we doing it so

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,300
we're happy about that

00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:22,120
yeah also all the data generally

00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:23,800
speaking for this site it isn't data

00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,810
that we produce it's data that's taken

00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,550
from other places and so some of one of

00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:29,290
our challenges with the site is figuring

00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:30,759
out which is which bits of the data

00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,800
sorry the question was is there

00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:34,540
Geographic data or why are we pulling

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,850
into graphic data from figuring out

00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:38,350
which which data sets have geographic

00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:39,910
data already on them which ones don't

00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:43,600
and then how we can combine them and not

00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:46,000
combine them so trying to remember so

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,379
say like two or three or four out of all

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,439
the data sets that we're using here have

00:12:47,379 --> 00:12:52,589
Geographic data built in yeah does that

00:12:50,439 --> 00:13:05,950
answer your question are not quite

00:12:52,589 --> 00:13:07,390
okay oh sure so the question was given

00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:09,610
what coming from lots of different data

00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:12,010
sets is there a master list somewhere so

00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:12,910
somebody want to go you know go pull

00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:16,420
these data sets play with them

00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:19,029
themselves is it there yes so one of the

00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:20,080
the main ideas behind us is all the data

00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:21,520
is relative

00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,790
well documented so folks want to go play

00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:28,000
with it themselves they can go do that

00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:30,279
every section of the site has a related

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,260
data and documentation link which takes

00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:35,560
you to information about where that that

00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:36,850
section came from come on you can open

00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:41,260
you can do it

00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:42,820
we also personally or we as the

00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:46,630
developers also care where the link is

00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:48,550
but we also have extra information on

00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:52,180
the all the codes open by the way

00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:54,220
there's a link to our github link to how

00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:55,510
we use the data as developers to create

00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:58,779
all the things so there's like the

00:13:55,510 --> 00:14:00,550
here's the documentation with a data

00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:01,990
dictionary here you can download the

00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:04,360
excel excel by the way because that's

00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:06,070
what are that sort of users that they

00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,180
wanted to play with the data with also

00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,170
here's the section for all the

00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,610
developers where you want all the

00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:12,339
gotchas in the data and how we actually

00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:14,010
pull this in and that kind of thing yep

00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:23,770
did that answer your question

00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:26,980
not going to though yep yep you can fork

00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:30,760
the site right now and build if ever you

00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:33,700
like but also let me pull this up

00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:35,320
because I made it big there's some URLs

00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,570
if you want to go right now and play

00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,160
around with stuff the easier one to

00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:40,510
remember is our live site there's a link

00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,770
in the footer to the github the one

00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:43,060
right below is the github but that's a

00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:44,830
bit longer so if you want go to the

00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:46,000
short version just scroll away the

00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:49,270
bottom and there's a link there to the

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,370
almost source information yep and also

00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:53,140
fun if you're into design stuff we've

00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:55,300
also tried to write and document all of

00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:57,580
our design process as well so for

00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,750
example when I like I was like well

00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,740
should I make this a PowerPoint should I

00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,030
write it up i was like well i'm gonna

00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,470
try writing up and see how the

00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:04,570
presentation goes because then it'll be

00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:09,750
there with all the other documentation

00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:09,750
and we'll see so I'd give a question

00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:28,580
yeah so the question was do I have any

00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:31,400
strategies for that conversation around

00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:32,960
getting real data out of folks and like

00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,070
you know being on that team and trying

00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,870
to have that conversation with your

00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:39,200
stakeholders like no really this is

00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:41,060
going to be a thing with this project in

00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,500
particular it seemed to work well and I

00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:47,120
think I've seen this work in other cases

00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:49,310
too it seemed to work well too well we

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,720
have the luxury of having time if you're

00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:52,280
on a short term contract that sort of

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,560
thing it's not it's much more difficult

00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,970
I was in a place where I could build

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,860
relationships with folks across the

00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:59,810
office so they understood and do small

00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:01,780
things for people across the office so

00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:05,600
they got used to how these things work

00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:07,010
and so you know okay you don't want me

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,180
to have access to this entire thing

00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:08,540
because you haven't approved it quite

00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,460
yet

00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:11,990
how about what are the columns that you

00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,700
usually lose what how are these things

00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:15,650
split up can you give me like ten rows

00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,270
but you're going to say that okay these

00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:19,520
are exactly the types of information

00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:21,650
that will be in those ten rows that sort

00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,360
of thing that seems to work okay because

00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:24,980
again I say oh we need the real data but

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,710
if you can get a sample that is actually

00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:31,160
structured the way it will be that's

00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:33,350
pretty good there's another we did we

00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:35,320
sometimes did things for okay give us

00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:38,240
all the data we will not make it public

00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,630
for three more months or something like

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,150
that

00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:42,680
but let us play with it behind the wall

00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:45,470
so we can actually see what's going on

00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,850
and I think I have a note if you ever

00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:48,370
read that thing to one of the nice

00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:50,450
things is once you get into a more

00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:52,310
advanced place with all these things

00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:54,410
once you start adding things like data

00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:55,370
tests and they're helping you know the

00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:57,890
folks that are creating the data

00:16:55,370 --> 00:17:01,130
actually make the data cleaner in the

00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:03,440
future then you make all the friends you

00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:04,900
know it's this process over time does

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,550
that help answer your question at all

00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:12,540
yeah have you have any tips

00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:12,540
[Laughter]

00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:26,329
yeah exactly she had mentioned that us

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,220
more about boat kind of trust between

00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:30,679
groups and making that in like a

00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:33,200
narrative process over time yeah so a

00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:34,640
lot of this exactly it's a lot of that

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,290
especially in this context this is the

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,850
kind of were taking datasets from across

00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:39,559
government and trying to make them into

00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:41,870
something that you know human can

00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:59,570
understand who's not in that process so

00:17:41,870 --> 00:18:01,010
yeah right the question with which you

00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:02,480
write the classic question are you

00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:05,750
measuring success how are you measuring

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,040
success is it is it user inside is it

00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:11,030
something else that sort of thing yeah

00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:14,090
yeah so a few different ways so 18f as

00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:15,980
an organization was started on the idea

00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:18,110
that that we can provide better

00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:20,179
government services across federal

00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:21,770
government and it will provide

00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:23,929
government services in a more modern way

00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:25,130
meeting you know you see the site and

00:18:23,929 --> 00:18:26,390
you don't think it's a government site

00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:30,200
because it's actually doing something

00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:33,980
but that helps yeah relatively user

00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:35,559
friendly so one of the things that we're

00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:38,480
very proud about with this particular

00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:41,480
the site is that now the organization

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,580
that we work with is working on founding

00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,960
its own data services team and wants to

00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,850
extend this kind of user centered

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,120
approach across its entire organization

00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:52,760
so for us that's that's a huge success

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,750
as for and it's like this reach right so

00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,490
it's a little bit different than some

00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,929
other organizations I think in the way

00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:58,429
that we measure whether this has been

00:18:56,929 --> 00:19:01,460
useful or not it's kind of uptake by

00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:03,770
other groups also this has been cited as

00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:06,620
the kind of future of AIT I

00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:08,120
internationally Germany has worked the

00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:10,820
site and has build in building their own

00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:12,080
based on this code I think we've gone to

00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:15,890
Mexico and done trainings and user

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:17,120
centered design so again our metrics a

00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:20,270
little bit different I think some other

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,620
folks one thing that we are sad about is

00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,910
that doesn't get a lot of traffic and

00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:25,160
that's been a challenging thing for

00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:26,179
government overall I think you've

00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,669
probably seen in the news how

00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:30,050
communications are a difficult thing and

00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:31,309
government it was difficult before and

00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:32,750
now it's the administration change it's

00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:35,000
extra difficult the layers of approval

00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:38,030
you need so having conversations about

00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,470
how to do like something like this you

00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:41,000
know have a hot day based on this data

00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,980
and invite different groups of people

00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,020
into place or something like that is a

00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:47,120
really different way of thinking about

00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:48,530
outreach in the government context it's

00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,380
not just like they're like oh we sent

00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:53,750
out a you know a thing to what they do

00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:54,650
they public public releases public I

00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,700
remember the thing that they

00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:57,290
traditionally do in government is a

00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,929
little bit different than how many of

00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:00,860
you would probably think about outreach

00:19:58,929 --> 00:20:05,059
so that's one of the things we're still

00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:06,350
working on oops we've got a couple we've

00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:08,440
got five minutes but we can take skew

00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:08,440
more

00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:24,250
yeah so the question was how how might

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,960
the new administration in particular

00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:28,540
what their stance on transparency effect

00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:30,610
things like this it's interesting it's

00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:31,750
both a lot and a little there are

00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:33,280
certain things that it seems like the

00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,660
new administration is really focused on

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,670
like those big ticket items that are on

00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:38,260
in their minds and then meanwhile

00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:40,300
there's the rest of government and this

00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:43,030
is not particularly high on the new

00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:45,340
administration's like radar so so far

00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:47,410
it's been a bit like well it's still

00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:49,570
going but it doesn't have like the

00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:52,150
support like it used to have under the

00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:54,970
old administration but on the other hand

00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:57,370
the I think because of that the the

00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:59,200
office that runs this within the

00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:01,540
Department of Interior has they see it

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,920
as an opportunity to figure out where

00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:06,480
internally in government that can help

00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:09,400
things move along and so there's there

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,830
the the effort that created this is not

00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:15,130
going away what it might be called in

00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:17,080
the future don't know but the the the

00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:18,670
department itself is still really

00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:21,100
excited about all the things that

00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:21,970
happened here so we will see well

00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:24,010
whether they say when one door shuts

00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:25,540
another window opens something like that

00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:29,910
so that's kind of where we're at right

00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:35,160
now let's say okay we've got a few more

00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:35,160
good yeah

00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:59,740
yeah so the question was in in private

00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:01,330
enterprise where sometimes you're given

00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:02,440
like you know half of a person here at

00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:03,490
that person there and you've got six

00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,890
months to create a thing is that

00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:07,720
iterative process still possible I say

00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:09,190
it depends I'm sure there are certain

00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,650
situations where you're not given that

00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:12,730
flexibility and an org but I still think

00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:15,370
there's a last-minute I mean when we

00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:17,350
first started this for example you know

00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:18,700
no one knew what a July's is no area

00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:21,490
otherwise we're not like letting me use

00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:22,720
pieces of data sets right so if you have

00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:24,730
the patience to be a bit of an

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,830
evangelist for showing the results from

00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:29,830
this sort of work you can slowly move

00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:31,480
along but it it's tiring so it depends

00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:33,520
on whether you want to take that up for

00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,810
naught I think but there tends to be

00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,310
small pieces maybe you won't get a

00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:38,560
hundred percent of the iteration that

00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:41,350
you wanted but you'll be able to do at

00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:44,310
least a user testing cycle or three you

00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:47,230
know and that's always better than zero

00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:50,610
let's see can we go all the way back in

00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:50,610
animal yes

00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:00,140
oh so the question is how do we think

00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:03,110
about roles that you might need for a

00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:05,630
project like this so in our organization

00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:09,350
we typically staff based on project

00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:11,270
needs this kind of thing but often for

00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:13,580
some plaintiffs our artists our projects

00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:15,580
aren't huge we'd probably step well in

00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:18,650
this case it was staffed with two folks

00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:20,179
who are more dev oriented one a

00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:21,980
particular so they had a lot of

00:23:20,179 --> 00:23:23,960
experience and I'm like online mapping

00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:27,740
and data work

00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:30,049
we had a Content designer PM UX kind of

00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:33,890
thing that was me and let's say I'm a

00:23:30,049 --> 00:23:35,480
visual designer so that's five and that

00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:37,850
was kind of how we wrote it and it

00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,830
really worked quite well you can do all

00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:41,570
organizations very design heavy relative

00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:43,730
to I think a lot of private industry in

00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:46,039
particular because none of this is like

00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:48,260
crazy data science right it's a lot of

00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:49,640
trying to communicate policy and that's

00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:52,190
really hard and trying to have all those

00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:53,450
conversations with stakeholders and so

00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:56,840
that tends to be more of our challenge

00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:57,860
than other things but yeah did that

00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:03,370
answer your question

00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:06,080
oh I see

00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:07,429
got it yeah so the question was like oh

00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,860
do you see a CSV and they're like oh my

00:24:07,429 --> 00:24:11,470
god I need a data person no I don't

00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:13,340
think we look at it that

00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:14,809
straightforwardly we also have you know

00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:16,010
if somebody I don't know got assigned to

00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:17,539
a project and then never done online

00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:19,780
mapping before which I'm not sure if we

00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:21,860
have anybody like that like zero right

00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:22,970
there's enough people in the org that

00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,650

00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:31,309

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,480
relatively a lot of data projects so you

00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:35,840

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,950
people did but yeah oh my gosh I think

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,630
