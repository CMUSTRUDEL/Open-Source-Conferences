it kind of like like Heather did this

00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:17,650
incredible talk that nicely like just

00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:19,869
lead into my talk which is just it was

00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:23,920

00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:29,470
you know luck so so thank you Jesus I

00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:32,379
guess the so so so I'm a day journalist

00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:34,390
I work at this news organization called

00:00:32,379 --> 00:00:38,410
the intercept how many of you heard of

00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:40,210
the intercept they were started by Laura

00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:42,579
Poitras Glenn Greenwald and Jeremy

00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:46,000
Scahill you know after the Snowden leaks

00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:49,329
and you know and we we basically came

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:55,239
out of you know this like big data dump

00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:57,160
as an organization and and and one of

00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:58,750
the things that I do there as a data

00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,360
journalist and a designer which is a

00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:04,390
very like we're title is that I make

00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:06,429
like projects like this I hope like

00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:10,840
build projects like this and I'm just

00:01:06,429 --> 00:01:16,509
going to show it actually where's the

00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:23,049
browser set the browser yes it is okay

00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:27,909
so so so this is a database of 800

00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:33,009
people about roughly who were all

00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:35,020
charged with terrorism since 9/11 by the

00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:37,929
Department of Justice and most of them

00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:45,579
were caught under under FBI stings so

00:01:37,929 --> 00:01:48,130
what can where's my mouse okay so what

00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:51,880
we did with that was as part of this in

00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:53,950
our new series we we built this data set

00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:59,380
we did analysis on that what that data

00:01:53,950 --> 00:02:01,659
set we kind of shared that analysis with

00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:04,779
these organizations make the data

00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:07,119
available for everybody to kind of

00:02:04,779 --> 00:02:08,920
download it off of a CSV file which is

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:12,400
available on

00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:14,650
github that you can check out and also

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,660
you could like see the people who are in

00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:19,030
this in this data set right and you can

00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:21,580
like filter it so if you want to see who

00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:25,240
is charged in New York

00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:27,120
oops this thing will like filter it down

00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:30,940
and you can like see individual cases

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,010
and need their stories and read their

00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:38,319
read read what their indictments were

00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:42,340
whole what the charges were sorry so so

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:44,230
this whole saying kind of leads I'm not

00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:47,080
going to talk much about the work that I

00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:48,310
do because I want to talk about because

00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:53,410
I would because I really want to talk

00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:55,000
about this like you know this topic of

00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:58,870
like data and the abuse of power and

00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,200
specifically how like common ways data

00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:06,190
can be misused to to tell a false story

00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:09,220
or a bias story or an or an exaggerated

00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:11,860
truth in some way and and and the way

00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:15,340
that I'm going to start is is you know

00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:17,290
with an example of a school in Seattle

00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:21,040
called lakeside where a group of

00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:23,260
librarians are teaching a class you know

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,350
unlike you know how to spot fake news

00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:28,600
and and and this is a class for like 5th

00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:30,579
graders right you know which is which I

00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,890
really think is like a great sign of our

00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:35,140
time there we are in right now and and

00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:37,930
and you know and it teach them to ask

00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:41,200
questions like you know what is like you

00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:44,709
know what's the evidence is it old is it

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:47,459
a joke you know and give them advice

00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:51,070
like like you know consider the source

00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:53,739
read beyond the headline and this is a

00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:56,049
great idea for for fifth graders and for

00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:58,180
everybody I think so so so in the spirit

00:03:56,049 --> 00:04:00,040
of this you know bulletin board I'm

00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,860
going to cover some of the common ways

00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:08,410
that I've noticed data being misused as

00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:11,230
well and and I'm going to start by by

00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:13,900
you know talking about this Iranian

00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:15,190
American poet so much relief you know

00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,680
who has a really interesting observation

00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:19,870
and who writes about

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,810
you know like in who writes about

00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:24,430
American wars and who doesn't she says

00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:26,680
that people who haven't been to war

00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:28,240
believe they cannot write about it since

00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,400
the a since they lack personal

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,840
experience of it which really limits the

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,389
information and the narrative that the

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,280
public gets to hear about the war this

00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:38,350
is the actual quote in the case of

00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,630
American wars narratives are left to

00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:42,070
vets and embedded journalists who invade

00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:45,490
and then get to write about their

00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:47,860
invading doubling their power this sort

00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,690
like really really like you know let me

00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,860
have stuck to me because I think the

00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,650
same thing happens when we ask

00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:57,910
institutions to collect and publish data

00:04:53,650 --> 00:05:00,010
on themselves and we need to like and we

00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:02,590
need data on public institutions so that

00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:04,389
they can keep so we can keep them

00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:07,150
accountable but when that data is

00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:10,389
collected and shared by the institution

00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:12,130
itself look at it there in a very

00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:14,410
powerful position to control the

00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:16,840
narrative you know which is another like

00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:19,180
you know doubling of power now I do

00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,520
believe that that not that that everyone

00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,229
has a certain point of view

00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:26,620
and a certain bias and no individual can

00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:29,530
embody you know like in all perspectives

00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,970
of a society but by then biases tilted

00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:33,669
towards those and those in power

00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:36,539
especially in tools of accountability it

00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:39,000
can have dangerous consequences since

00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:41,949
data has a reputation for being

00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,710
impartial and scientific and then

00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:47,289
automatic you know legitimize er right

00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:48,970
you know politicians use it to to

00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:51,460
indicate that their arguments are

00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:53,530
correct and rooted in fact you know

00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:55,570
president Trump sites like numbers all

00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:59,590
the time President Obama there to you

00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:01,510
know even like hired Edward Tufte you

00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:04,270
know the famous state of realization you

00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:05,979
know expert to help explain his stimulus

00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:08,470
plan to the public right which is also

00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:11,169
that that that data you know is

00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:14,020
incredibly powerful and can be used in

00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:16,090
in you know many ways so so as the data

00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:19,360
practitioners you need to vet your data

00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:20,080
the same way you would let any human

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,000
source

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,540
you know blindly trusting a biased

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,600
dataset is just as as

00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:31,170
harmful as as blindly trusting a biased

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:34,320
source former New Times developer Jacob

00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:36,990
Harris talks about how he treats data

00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,610
just like just like any other human

00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:40,860
source he says because like you would

00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:42,750
think maybe the source has an agenda

00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:44,100
maybe the source is lying maybe the

00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,320
source doesn't know what they're talking

00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:49,110
about so whenever someone is giving you

00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,820
data or citing data especially when they

00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:53,580
are telling you what they what they

00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:57,570
think it means you should always be on

00:06:53,580 --> 00:07:00,450
the lookout for ways that that data is

00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:03,330
being sampled or framed or modeled or

00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:04,770
you know or limited or you know or like

00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:07,440
an otherwise just use to support a

00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:09,960
certain point point of view right and

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,460
you try to keep your mind open to other

00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,800
possible interpretations of what the

00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:16,290
data meet so I'm going to talk about

00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,110
some of the ways inspired by examples

00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:20,820
I've seen under the Obama administration

00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:22,860
during the last years and also under the

00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:27,080
trump and the last like whatever like

00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:29,610
103 days or whatever it is and and this

00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,140
kind of falling like like you know

00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:32,700
presentation is gonna be very depressing

00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:35,040
so I'm really like like I really

00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:40,410
apologize like right off the bat you

00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:42,510
know for for bumming you all out this so

00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:45,300
the first type of bias is we don't

00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:47,010
collect it you know what an institution

00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:50,220
chooses not to collect can say a lot

00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:52,020
about the institution a lot of times you

00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,090
find that important data that you want

00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:57,810
is not being collected Oh a striking

00:07:54,090 --> 00:08:00,030
example is a pre-shooting data in 94

00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:02,220
more than ten years before the shooting

00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:03,780
of Michael Brown in Ferguson Congress

00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:06,150
instructed the Attorney General to

00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:08,520
acquire data about the use of excessive

00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:10,950
force by law enforcement officers and to

00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:13,620
publish an annual summary of the data

00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:15,630
that was in 1994 but this was never

00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,400
implemented I think most people would

00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:19,200
agree that that that collecting and

00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,840
making you know a record of people

00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,550
killed by police is is actually

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,100
ordinarily you know important and it

00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:28,730
seems almost inconceivable that no

00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:30,690
search record like you know exists

00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:31,969
collecting this data is saying something

00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:34,789
right it's saying that

00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:38,000
this happened we counted it you count

00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:40,579
you matter and this is a really this I

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,240
feel is one of the key contributions of

00:08:40,579 --> 00:08:45,379
the field of data journalism but but

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,449
first of all we need to acknowledge that

00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:49,670
we live in a time where so many people

00:08:47,449 --> 00:08:51,800
get killed by police and not every one

00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:54,740
of them is going to get their 15 minutes

00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,240
of national attention and even if they

00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,589
are one of the ones that do good

00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,319
attention that attention eventually dies

00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:02,000
down days pass other things happen now

00:09:00,319 --> 00:09:04,279
even though some will continue to

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,350
remember it and and talk about it then

00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:08,720
the national conversation in that was on

00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:10,910
and maybe like you know come back again

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,589
when some when some other similar

00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:14,990
tragedy happens but you'd never really

00:09:12,589 --> 00:09:18,490
know right so to address this in 2012 be

00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:22,250
blind Bogart of New Reno news and review

00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:24,290
began began a crowd-sourced database of

00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:27,290
deadly police violence called called

00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:29,750
fatal encounters it was a precursor to

00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:32,209
the to the Washington Post 2015 police

00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:35,269
claims the database which began in the

00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:37,759
midst of you know a black lives matter

00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:41,120
protests and for rigidly they went on to

00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:42,889
win you know the Pulitzer you know Berg

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,360
art and the Washington Post and others

00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:45,680
who have worked on police shootings data

00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,959
I'm making a record of what happened

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,399
that can be used for analysis and making

00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:50,720
public accountability like you know

00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:51,889
possible

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,720
it's a record and it's an

00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:56,750
acknowledgement here's another example

00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,069
you know which is more recent the the

00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,689
Department of Housing and Urban

00:09:58,069 --> 00:10:02,720
Development collect data on racial

00:09:59,689 --> 00:10:05,389
disparities in access to housing in an

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,829
attempt to to address that Latino

00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:10,009
segregation and other forms of racial

00:10:06,829 --> 00:10:12,680
discrimination in addition to to housing

00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:16,670
patterns this data includes racial and

00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:19,220
ethnic concentration of poverty access

00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:21,290
to education employment transportation

00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:23,990
and environmental health care is also

00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:26,059
like you know part of it in January um

00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:27,889
you know with this new administration a

00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:30,170
bill was introduced that would end that

00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:32,779
data collection and our ability to know

00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:35,689
when and where racial housing

00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:38,180
discrimination is happening the bill

00:10:35,689 --> 00:10:41,149
says explicitly no federal funds may be

00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:43,720
used to design build maintain utilize or

00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:47,560
provide access to a federal database

00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:49,660
nation or community on community racial

00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:52,420
disparities or disparities and access to

00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:54,819
affordable housing vice number wise

00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:58,449
number two okay we don't collect it and

00:10:54,819 --> 00:11:00,430
you can't either you know and this bias

00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:02,139
is when when an organization will go

00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:03,310
like well like you know one step beyond

00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:04,629
right they're like you know we're not

00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:06,639
gonna collect it but you know guess what

00:11:04,629 --> 00:11:08,769
we're gonna make sure that that you

00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:11,350
can't collect it either you know for

00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:13,540
example in like in 1993 a Center for

00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:15,910
Disease Control and Prevention study

00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:19,839
showed that having guns at home sharply

00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:22,660
increases their risk of homicide the the

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:25,600
NRA responded by lobbying Congress to to

00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:29,860
cut the CDC's funding by more than 2.6

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:33,279
million dollars not only that but

00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:35,819
Congress then then passed a measure led

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:38,829
by Republican congressman Jay Dickey of

00:11:35,819 --> 00:11:40,899
Arkansas forbidding the CDC due to spend

00:11:38,829 --> 00:11:43,569
any money advocating or promoting gun

00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:45,790
control this measure has been in effect

00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:47,829
for more than twenty years and and and

00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:50,680
as a result we have very few scientists

00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:52,199
in this country studying the causes of

00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:55,779
gun violence

00:11:52,199 --> 00:11:56,920
another example is is how the NFL you

00:11:55,779 --> 00:11:59,410
know raised there behind-the-scenes

00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:01,660
campaign to to influence many US

00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:04,149
government research on on football

00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:05,620
related brain injury and after years of

00:12:04,149 --> 00:12:09,339
playing down the long-term effects of

00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:12,879
brain injury you know on NFL players in

00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:15,970
2012 they awarded a unrestricted gift of

00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:17,649
30 million dollars to the to the NIH you

00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:20,139
know to research football and brain

00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:23,259
disease but when in 2014 the NIH

00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:25,180
proposed to collect long-term data to

00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:27,069
detect and characterize degenerative

00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,809
changes to the brain on our football

00:12:27,069 --> 00:12:31,000
players the NFL denied to pay for the

00:12:28,809 --> 00:12:34,839
research instead taxpayers like you know

00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,759
paid paid before that cost and then 2015

00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:39,100
congressional investigators found NFL

00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:41,319
having improper influence on government

00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:45,009
research you know NFL obviously like you

00:12:41,319 --> 00:12:48,009
know rejected all accusations okay why

00:12:45,009 --> 00:12:51,250
is number three we collected but you

00:12:48,009 --> 00:12:53,079
cannot have it sometimes an organization

00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,589
will collect data but will decline to

00:12:53,079 --> 00:12:58,260
make it public

00:12:54,589 --> 00:13:01,620
but you know um the recent shooting of

00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:04,170
in in Charlotte of Kingdom our Scott a

00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:06,720
43 year old african-american man whose

00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:09,870
brain injury affected his ability to

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,070
communicate was his a is a clear example

00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:14,430
for me

00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:15,959
Scott was a was shot and killed by

00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:17,760
police officers who were in the

00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:20,459
neighborhood looking for an unrelated

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:23,220
man the police claimed that Scott was

00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:26,279
was carrying a gun which became a point

00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:28,380
of contention although all patrol

00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:31,110
officers are mandated to to wear body

00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:33,510
cameras in Charlotte the the officers

00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:36,450
did not turn the camera on until Scott

00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:38,580
was shot and it was only after enormous

00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:40,920
pressure from the protesters and after

00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:43,500
Scott's wife released her own video that

00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:46,890
the police released a shortened edited

00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:48,630
version of the video another example of

00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:50,910
the this type of control that the

00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:53,040
agencies are able to exercise over this

00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:55,170
data but again over their own data is

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,940
the fact that the NFA declines to share

00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:58,770
information that is being collected on

00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,600
American citizens even when those

00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:03,420
citizens requested themselves

00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:06,270
Republicans Jeff Larson tried to get his

00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:08,550
personal data from NSA he furthered the

00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:11,279
the NSA for the data that has been

00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:13,260
collected on him but but but all he got

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,910
was was just denial whereas letters

00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:17,760
citing you know national security

00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:19,200
concerns and then of course here's a

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,120
more recent example that you know

00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:23,790
Heather just just mentioned you know the

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,100
White House you know you know the Trump

00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:28,350
lighthouse has removed all data from its

00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:30,240
public search of a portal of federal for

00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:31,380
federal data this stage was set up by

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,540
the Obama administration to create

00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:35,100
transparency around how you know

00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,779
government runs including things like

00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,089
budgets and how federal funds are used

00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:40,770
and who visits the White House and the

00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:43,050
page was just was just emptied of all

00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:44,850
data sets without any announcement of or

00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:47,970
notice you know and now it says check

00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:50,459
back soon for new data and if you click

00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:52,529
on the data catalog you know to browse

00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:55,500
you know White House data sets you know

00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:57,600
it was it literally returns zero results

00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:00,630
you know and this data is is still

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:03,000
clearly hopefully being collected but it

00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:04,410
is not being shared publicly right you

00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,540
know which means it is harder for public

00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:09,120
to know for instance you know when

00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:11,460
you know lobbyists visit or who might be

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:15,390
influencing policies all right

00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:17,070
the next bias reframe what we share so

00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:18,660
when the government or other entities do

00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:20,250
share data with the public it's

00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:22,140
important to understand how it can be

00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:24,810
framed in in raise that limit

00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:26,730
accountability framing can happen in in

00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:29,910
many ways and I want to talk about three

00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:32,940
types the first one involves how data is

00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:35,640
being advocated for example the Obama

00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:38,720
administration released a report last

00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:41,460
year on on casualties of a drone program

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,900
but the report included only only a

00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:44,760
fraction of the most conservative

00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:47,130
estimates of drone related civilian

00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:49,140
deaths and it provided data in in

00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:51,780
aggregate terms with no individual

00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:54,300
accounts to give context to what made up

00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:56,250
that number in aggregate form these

00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,870
counts cannot be compared to two

00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:00,630
estimates by the Bureau of Investigative

00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:03,120
Journalism or by other non-governmental

00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:08,730
groups so it's really not possible to

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:11,010
verify estimate understanding how the

00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:12,660
data is sampled is also a crucial part

00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:15,030
of interpreting data the term

00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:16,680
administration has focused on a lot on

00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:19,110
crime already like in the past one or

00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:21,660
three days right and and and it

00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:24,990
frequently sites like you know that that

00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:27,450
that you know crime is up you know now

00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:30,750
that now this is technically true but

00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:33,390
only if you're looking it in a very

00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:35,490
limited time span right so so violent

00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:38,160
crime data as referenced by Trump looks

00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:42,090
like this somewhat flat since 2009 and

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:45,390
yes there is in fact an uptick in 2014

00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:47,400
and in 2015 but if you zoom out you see

00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:49,920
that the crime rates are actually at

00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:53,940
almost you know their lowest level since

00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:56,250
1970s and have been you know like you

00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:58,890
know in steady decline you know since

00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:02,190
the early 90s and and the amount of

00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:03,720
change between 2014 and 2015 is is what

00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:05,910
looks like a pretty small and pretty

00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:09,330
standard fluctuation in the context of

00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:11,760
the last 30 years another like recent

00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:15,270
example you know that I'm sure all of

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:17,430
you have seen you know is is this you

00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:19,070
know incredible like you know like the

00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:20,720
these photos of like

00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:23,570
what the crowds were at the Trump

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,040
inauguration right and and that and the

00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:26,420
size of the crowd appears to be very

00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,430
different depending on where you take

00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:31,070
the photo from but but of course you

00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:33,760
know the the White House would frame it

00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:36,680
you know in this certain way

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:39,530
finally the language around how data is

00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:41,720
labeled has a big influence on how we on

00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:46,310
how we understand data and how closely

00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:48,050
it it reflects reality in Obama's second

00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:50,870
term this administration announced that

00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:52,610
they would make that would make those

00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:54,890
with a criminal record a priority for

00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:56,990
deportation over immigrants without a

00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:59,060
criminal record and they released data

00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:01,520
classifying sixty percent of those of

00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:03,980
those deported as criminals when you

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,510
think about someone being deported as a

00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,740
criminal you think about you know

00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:09,910
someone who has committed a serious

00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:13,520
crime maybe even a violent crime but

00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:15,950
criminal label here is is misleading

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,290
because one third of those labeled

00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:20,600
labeled criminals had no conviction

00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:23,000
beyond the immigration offense itself if

00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:25,400
we take out the biased labeling you see

00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,620
that actually only 40% of those deported

00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:31,670
had a conviction other than simply being

00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:33,800
in in in the country illegally and only

00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:36,260
20% had a violent potentially or

00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:39,620
potentially violent crime another

00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:41,420
another example of labeling is how the

00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:43,040
US government labels all military-age

00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:46,930
males you know killed in a drone strike

00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:48,950
at EK i a or enemy killed in in action

00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:50,510
but we actually don't know anything

00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:52,700
about these people other than their

00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:55,190
their age and gender every 25 year-old

00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:57,020
man is not the enemy is not an enemy

00:18:55,190 --> 00:19:01,520
you know combatant but but in this data

00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:04,510
set he is defined as one I'm gonna move

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:07,760
past some more examples so the last big

00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:09,770
big bias is is what I call you know the

00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,170
data is the bias like MacLean when the

00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:15,310
data set it like entirely is just a

00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:18,530
product like you know all our bias right

00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:21,020
so so you know in other words like you

00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:23,690
know the data is no longer a reflection

00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:27,290
of reality instead its entire purpose is

00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:28,700
to be used as a tool to further like you

00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:32,770
know to further some sort of like you

00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,770
know existing data Tavor an agenda

00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:38,080
redlining is a practice of denying

00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:40,210
services to certain people based on

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,640
their race or ethnicity either directly

00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:44,770
or through selectively raising prices

00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,170
once you've method of redlining is

00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:50,590
through history banking and there are

00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:52,990
maps where you can see areas marked by

00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:55,990
the red line you know where banks would

00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:57,730
not invest this map shows the grades

00:19:55,990 --> 00:20:00,130
that that the home owners Loan

00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:02,110
Corporation gave to different

00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:04,810
neighborhoods signifying whether they

00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:06,850
were secured areas of investment many

00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:10,750
banks refuse to make loans in red and

00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:12,340
yellow areas and this is where the term

00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:14,440
redlining comes from you know the red

00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:17,500
parts on these on these maps I think

00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:19,990
this data constitutes entirely nothing

00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:22,630
more than than the agenda of the banks

00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:24,310
and so in that way I consider it it's

00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:27,090
such a bias data said that the data is

00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:30,100
made up of nothing but bias itself

00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:32,650
here's a more recent example right

00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:34,300
Trump ordered the Department of Homeland

00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:36,660
stopped a weekly list of crimes

00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:39,040
committed by undocumented immigrants now

00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:41,320
now this is motivated by the idea that

00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:43,180
that that undocumented population are

00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,890
associated with higher crime rate which

00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:47,920
is untrue according to social scientists

00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:49,870
who study it furthermore no context is

00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:52,000
provided such as rates of crime in

00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:54,610
underlying city or comparison to rates

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,340
of crime of American citizens in that

00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:59,380
area etc so the decision to collect this

00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:01,840
data and present it publicly in this way

00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:04,330
seems to be motivated by the desire to

00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,100
to convince and like you know people

00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:08,650
that immigration is associated with

00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:11,860
crime and such and as such comes

00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:13,600
entirely from it from a place of bias so

00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:17,350
for data sets like this are just a

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:19,270
residue of bias so anyway so so here are

00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:21,520
the five types of biases that we

00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:23,230
mentioned you know like you know we

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,210
don't collect it we don't collect it and

00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:29,320
you can have it we collected and you

00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:32,520
can't have it we frame it we reframe

00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:35,410
what we share and the data is the bias

00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:38,230
and this is and this has been pretty

00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:40,080
depressing talk just you know as I like

00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,740
earlier like you know warned you about

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,940
and maybe

00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,950
you know but it shouldn't come as a

00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:47,620
surprise that powerful institutions try

00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:50,110
to manipulate data just like any other

00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:51,520
medium but as their practitioners there

00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:53,500
are a lot of things that we can do about

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,720
this and and and we should be hopeful

00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:57,910
about it you know there are some really

00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,920
great lessons we can we can learn from

00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:01,570
people here in the data community who

00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,880
have tackled these problems in creative

00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:06,940
ways you know this includes taking

00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:09,400
action in all steps you know in the

00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:12,130
process so when you have a new data set

00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:14,260
or when a piece of data you know piece

00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:15,910
of existing data is cited your analysis

00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:17,980
should aggressively vet the data and

00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:20,500
question it you know when you have a

00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:22,510
burning question you know but you cannot

00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:24,160
have the data you know to answer it

00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:26,740
there are tools and techniques you know

00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:28,720
that the communities and communities you

00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:30,970
know to support in your data requests

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,620
and when you have requested a data but

00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:34,600
your requests have been declined there

00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:36,220
are several steps that you can take to

00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,260
reverse that decision like you know

00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:41,380
maybe going through through you know

00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:43,420
like a legal process and then you have

00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,890
done everything that you can think to

00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:47,620
get a certain piece of data and it

00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:49,780
hasn't worked it might be time to think

00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:51,370
of a creative way to at getting at the

00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:55,360
underlying problem that you're trying to

00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:57,429
solve so okay I want to leave you with

00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,590
this last thought which is that data can

00:22:57,429 --> 00:23:01,660
just they cannot just be as biased as

00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:03,280
any other type of information and bias

00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:05,230
data can be used by those in power to

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,550
abuse that power so as a community of

00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:08,980
data practitioners it is our

00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:12,490
responsibility to recognize when and how

00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:16,350
bias manifests itself in data and how we

00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:16,350
can fight it all right thank you

00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:22,229
