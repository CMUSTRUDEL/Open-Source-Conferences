00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:09,870
thank you yes so the title of my talk is

00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,880
surveying the calming plaid running

00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:16,770
hands to be centrally process

00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:18,690
decentralized data so starting off hi my

00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:22,590
name is Noah you can find me on twitter

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:29,099
at underscore Tana piston pump ishtam is

00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:31,769
the namesake OG for noah so a quick kind

00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:33,809
of introduction or a preview of the

00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:35,969
structure of the talk so I'm hoping to

00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:37,710
make it quick so that we can spend some

00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:40,410
more time discussing and this is kind of

00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:42,899
like a great size of a group of people

00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,570
to kind of talk about the ideas here so

00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:48,120
part one of the talk is going to be this

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,800
thing called the cloud what's its

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,440
problem

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:56,160
and then finally what is a commune so

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,809
just getting into it part 1 so the

00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,949
attended definition a good tentative

00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:00,840
definition would be something like the

00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:02,640
cloud is just the network of computers

00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,670
and those computers are run in warehouse

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,189
size buildings that we call data centers

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,990
we also probably can't get into them so

00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:12,090
here's a picture of one such data center

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:13,770
this is a Google's data center in the

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,430
Dallas I think that's how you pronounce

00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:20,250
it a little bit down the road from here

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:22,020
so they're the warehouses some cooling

00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,939
systems I think that's an electrical

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,670
distribution system but I really don't

00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:29,400
have any idea and your data is somewhere

00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:32,040
near there you know probably not it's

00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,009
probably not there so what does it look

00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,570
like inside it looks like this oh and

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:39,240
what's that that's a network of

00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,560
computers and here's a picture of them

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,350
from above this is a different data

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:47,100
center this is one in Iowa what's inside

00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:51,090
the computers computer resources what

00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:53,490
are those so I think an nice kind of

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,689
non-technical definition is that

00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,130
computer resources are the means of

00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:58,380
digital production they're the raw

00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:02,340
materials that programs require to run

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:04,320
and Google defines computer resources to

00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,730
be any physical or virtual component of

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,950
limited availability with

00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:10,260
computer system so every device is a

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:13,020
resource every internal system component

00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:14,940
is a resource kind of short of it is

00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,830
that the sorts of things that computers

00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:20,220
are made up of as some examples are

00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:24,870
things like CPUs GPUs non-durable and

00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:27,030
durable memory NIC's pages sockets okay

00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,350
and so maybe we can kind of like find

00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,330
the definition of a cloud and the cloud

00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:33,120
is just a network of computer resources

00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:35,700
so here's a quick question who might

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,760
have a computer here's an answer these

00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:42,210
people they look so interesting who are

00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:44,370
they those are Millennials here's

00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:50,430
another quick question who else might

00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:53,400
have a computer possibly also you 77% of

00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:56,310
Americans have a or on a smartphone and

00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,040
a smartphone is a computer so you're

00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:03,030
asking what's inside of the phone is an

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,950
example is the iPhone 4s exposed it's

00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:08,700
got some compute resources inside of

00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:11,490
there yeah and you might wonder if

00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,709
they're everywhere and they are so the

00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:16,320
laptop computer resources desktop

00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:19,020
computer resources tablet computer

00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:21,720
resources a juicer computer resources

00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:24,000
and I think that's them I'm not positive

00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,760
that that's them but I think that's them

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,209
okay Wow right these things are

00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,570
everywhere

00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:32,130
and yes they're ubiquitous and this is

00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:34,290
kind of what they look like this is a

00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:38,250
picture of their ubiquity okay this is

00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:41,130
equal a lock a called a selfie internet

00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:42,780
selfie picture of the internet all these

00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:45,570
different lines show connections between

00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,040
different connected devices and so

00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:49,590
remember when I said that the cloud is

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,890
just a network of compute resources well

00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:54,800
looks like the Internet is that as well

00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:58,230
so maybe the internet is a cloud ray

00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:00,720
substitution okay I don't think the

00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:01,860
Internet is a cloud because I don't

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,070
think a cloud is just a network of

00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,540
computer resources I think the cloud is

00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,950
maybe something better described as a

00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,600
network of computer resources that can

00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:12,600
be shared between the programs running

00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,209
on it running on the resources running

00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,310
on the cloud

00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:17,410
so sharing is kind of a pretty important

00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:20,769
aspect here so here's a picture of cloud

00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:23,880
maybe here's a picture of the resources

00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:26,560
being shared it's kind of like a static

00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,960
sharing of resources so you see that

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,840
none of the individual resources under

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,070
the individual servers are kind of

00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,570
sharing resources between different

00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,970
programs of them they're kind of my

00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:40,120
sequel gets list of resources Cassandra

00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:42,250
DS memcache those and so you can also

00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,440
make things a little bit more dynamic a

00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:46,599
little bit more fine-grained where each

00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,789
individual application each individual

00:04:46,599 --> 00:04:51,610
program can kind of be spread across

00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:53,919
kind of given different resources so if

00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:56,169
you ever use something like AWS or GCE

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,880
and actually have no idea how it works

00:04:56,169 --> 00:05:01,240
in GCE because I've never used it but at

00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:04,419
least in AWS you know you can rent an

00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:08,289
instance and say I want you know one CPU

00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:11,590
and I want five gigabytes of RAM and you

00:05:08,289 --> 00:05:13,840
can run your program that way and so you

00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:17,500
know this thing seems so great with all

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:20,530
the sharing and kind of it is it is kind

00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,639
of great it's a pretty incredible system

00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:23,409
and people are building really

00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:26,470
incredible systems on them but it's also

00:05:23,409 --> 00:05:31,300
kind of not great so what's this problem

00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:34,510
it was a menacing cloud so this is a

00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:36,849
really great paper by Langdon winner was

00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:39,130
written in 1980 it's called do artifacts

00:05:36,849 --> 00:05:42,270
have politics and that's a really long

00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:44,680
quote and I won't read it all here but

00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:46,630
maybe the most important points are he

00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,159
distinguishes between the ways in which

00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:51,130
two ways in which an artifact can have

00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:53,500
politics so there's kind of intentional

00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:56,370
ways that an artifact can have politics

00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:59,320
can be designed with you know a certain

00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:00,940
political purpose in mind I don't know

00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:05,289
if anyone has heard of Robert Moses

00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:07,120
Robert Moses back in the 20th century is

00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:10,509
largely responsible for the structure

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,370
that New York City has and he does I

00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:14,169
designed these arches on the parkways

00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:15,970
that he would build to only be 9 feet

00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:18,729
tall and the reason he did this is

00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:21,580
because he wanted people who were able

00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:23,500
to purchase cars to be able to drive out

00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,420
to the beaches on Long Island but he

00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,150
didn't want any busted

00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:29,580
to be able to go out there yeah and so

00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:32,520
is largely inspired by his you know

00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:35,190
serious racial prejudice so that's one

00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:37,370
explicit way in which you know an

00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:39,840
artifact or a technology can have

00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:45,080
politics but there are other sorts of

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:47,480
ways now before going into that I think

00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:50,010
one of the things he points out is that

00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,990
there's an impact that a artifact has

00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:54,150
after it's kind of been enacted so after

00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:56,040
a society or a community chooses to

00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:57,750
adopt a certain technology the

00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:00,870
implications are kind of long lasting

00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:02,190
afterwards and so there's a section here

00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,140
where he says you know in that sense

00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:06,480
technological innovations are similar to

00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:08,340
legislative acts or political founds

00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:12,000
that establish a framework for public

00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:14,400
order that would ensue so that over many

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,440
generations okay and so he also says

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,940
here are the issues that divide reunite

00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,620
people in society are settled not only

00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:21,690
in the institutions and practices of

00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:24,000
politics proper but also and less

00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:26,040
obviously intangible arrangements steel

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,330
and concrete wires and transistors nuts

00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,390
and bolts and we could also say today

00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:35,520
and compute expenses so less obviously

00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:37,590
no way I think maybe obviously yeah and

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,300
so the other thing I want to kind of

00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:41,760
draw attention to is when he talks about

00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,970
technologies as ways of building order

00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,200
you can also maybe translate that as

00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:50,100
technologies or ways of distributing

00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:51,300
power and so what are like maybe the

00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:54,330
cloud politics

00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:57,350
let's cloud power I think it's pretty

00:07:54,330 --> 00:08:03,000
clearly the politics of centralization

00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:07,190
so your data is centralized and it can't

00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,650
be the notes from Google slides here but

00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:11,910
one of the questions I wanted to ask is

00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:13,650
you know there's maybe like a normative

00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:16,140
or philosophical sense in which we think

00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:19,170
the data is ours like it's our property

00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:21,000
maybe in some way but I think there's a

00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:23,880
much more important question to ask

00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,370
which is is it really ours if in

00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,660
practice we don't have control over we

00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,310
don't

00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:32,840
where it is you don't know who's using

00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:36,979
it you don't know what they're using it

00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:38,270
for you can't really be called yours and

00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:40,970
especially can it really be called years

00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:44,000
if it's being used to maybe like change

00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:46,910
your behavior so there's a talk given a

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,720
few weeks ago by sky Toomas Hendrik

00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:50,120
Ilves

00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,440
I think that's I say his name is the

00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,650
ex-president of Estonia

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,240
you give a talk at Stanford called

00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:59,840
liberal democracy in the digital age and

00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,660
any kind of surveys the election the

00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:04,670
events leading up to the election

00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:07,400
discussing things like hacking that took

00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:08,990
place the spreading of people's emails

00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:13,250
talk about sweet talks about the impact

00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:15,410
that it has mentioned the fact that

00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:18,650
there are some fold voter election rolls

00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:21,380
that were hacked it's just the data of

00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:22,730
who lives where and talks about what

00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:24,850
that is one of the things that brings up

00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:27,620
is this company Cambridge analytic ah

00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:34,010
Cambridge analytic ah attempts to use

00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:37,400
data to target electoral advertisements

00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:41,330
at potential voters to try and build nor

00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:44,090
like I think he describes it as by kind

00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:45,740
of scraping people's Facebook Likes they

00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:49,880
built kind of like a personality profile

00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:52,280
of them and then target electoral

00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:59,270
advertisements at them using that

00:09:52,280 --> 00:10:01,520
information Oh another important thing

00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:02,300
is that it's largely funded by this guy

00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,310
Robert Mercer

00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:07,580
it was a huge Trump supporter there's

00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:09,200
really good New Yorker article that and

00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:10,430
so I mean you know you could ask

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,930
yourself the question of whether

00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:13,490
something like this is humane you know

00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:15,590
whether it's reflective of the kind of

00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:17,050
society that we think is healthy in the

00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:20,240
kind of society that we want to live in

00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:22,070
I think even if you do think it's humane

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,990
maybe you think that for example this is

00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:26,120
the right of like you know the free

00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:27,500
market I'm not necessarily trying to

00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,540
take issue with something like that but

00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,850
maybe you think it's it's humane because

00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:33,910
this is what people using their freedom

00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:35,350
to create do with it

00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:36,280
but I think it's still reasonable to be

00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:39,040
able to ask whether there are

00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:41,260
alternatives okay so maybe there are

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,550
alternatives maybe if the problem is

00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:44,470
centralization maybe if it's a

00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:46,380
structural problem then maybe the wave

00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:48,610
and the place to look at something like

00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:51,900
decentralization so that kind of brings

00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:51,900
me to the question of what is a

00:10:52,860 --> 00:11:01,390
communist which is what I use to define

00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:03,730
a cloud for and you know don't we

00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:05,860
already have that this is what it looks

00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:09,040
like today and this is what I think or

00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:12,430
maybe hope or it looks like married

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,560
tomorrow so maybe instead of commune

00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:19,770
where it sounds like an odds more like

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:22,330
an AA like commute for theses about it

00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:23,920
so it's not a programming language or a

00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:28,360
programming language runtime

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:29,710
I think whatever a commune cloud ends up

00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,690
being it should be able to share

00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:33,940
fine-grained compute resources on

00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:35,980
consumer devices should be able to

00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:40,150
identify consumer devices with their

00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:41,890
owners and should allow owners to

00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:43,630
arbitrarily federated and defriend

00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:45,330
federated devices if you should be able

00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:48,700
to share your resources with others

00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:51,370
collect your resources together maybe be

00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:53,500
able to you know build clouds that are

00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:55,360
the size of your home maybe the size of

00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,280
your neighborhood you know start to

00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,250
extend them out to you know different

00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,900
sections of your city basically like

00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:03,910
cloud for the association it's not a

00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:05,650
cloud composition you might think this

00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:07,750
is kind of foolish because there are

00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:10,180
maybe massive security concerns things

00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:11,380
like finance right I mean the idea here

00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:13,240
is that you should be able to do

00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:15,520
anything that you can already do in the

00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,020
cloud just do it on consumer devices and

00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,280
maybe that's a little naive bit of

00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:20,890
certain things which you can't do on

00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:26,500
consumer devices that you can do up in a

00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:28,000
place like AWS in ec2 and I want to come

00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,680
back to the topic of botnets a little

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,180
later but I think that's that's an

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,810
important concern the one thing I will

00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:38,470
say is that if you use a browser then

00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:39,540
you run arbitrary computation like all

00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:42,149
day long you know

00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:43,860
as long as you're browsing you didn't

00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:45,449
write that HTML you don't know who wrote

00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,740
that HTML you also didn't write the

00:12:45,449 --> 00:12:48,779
JavaScript and you don't know who wrote

00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,910
the JavaScript and the reason why this

00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:53,519
is safe is because Chrome has pretty

00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:55,019
sophisticated sandboxing mechanism and

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,230
there are a bunch of different ways to

00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:59,850
sandbox processes it's not just the way

00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:01,110
that chrome does it and so I think that

00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:05,069
there's a lot of promise and maybe

00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:06,810
engaging those alternatives to see what

00:13:05,069 --> 00:13:09,690
could be done kind of in general in the

00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:10,980
general case we're running it is Besant

00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:12,060
I think it's kind of film because we

00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,019
already have something like this we

00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,120
don't really need it and it's definitely

00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:17,370
vaporware it definitely does not exist I

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,589
don't have a demo but I do want to point

00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:21,029
out some things that I think are like or

00:13:19,589 --> 00:13:24,509
have some properties that are kind of

00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:25,740
nice or desirable and whatever might

00:13:24,509 --> 00:13:28,440
become something like a community out

00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:31,949
and so one of them are botnets you know

00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,420
so um there's a spawn net that I think

00:13:31,949 --> 00:13:37,519
is still around today I think it's only

00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:40,980
about 85,000 hosts today but circa 2007

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,750
had between one the 50 million hosts at

00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:44,790
its height you know it's enough

00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:46,889
collective bandwidth to knock small

00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:50,579
countries off the internet this is a

00:13:46,889 --> 00:13:54,930
quote from my anti-spam researcher at

00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:57,870
message Labs in 2007 but if you added up

00:13:54,930 --> 00:14:00,660
all of the 500 top supercomputers of

00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:04,399
2007 it blew them away with only you

00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:07,889
know what is that 125th of its machines

00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:09,660
and this is actually another major issue

00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:12,839
I think with the kinds of systems that

00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:15,060
we have set up so because it's so access

00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:17,699
to get or because it's relatively easy

00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:19,920
to get access to resources for malicious

00:14:17,699 --> 00:14:22,380
purposes means that if you say run your

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,209
own email server right and you become

00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:26,430
the target of an attack like this like

00:14:24,209 --> 00:14:28,139
what are your options your only options

00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:31,350
are really to kind of flee into the

00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:33,540
domain of say at Google because they

00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:35,550
have the resources they have the

00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:38,939
infrastructure to be able to mitigate

00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:41,939
those kinds of attacks and I saw an

00:14:38,939 --> 00:14:45,149
article just this past week that Google

00:14:41,939 --> 00:14:48,300
will now offer a legal protection to

00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:48,700
startups in exchange or startups who are

00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,410
being

00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,900
kind of trolled by pencils in exchange

00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:56,290
for equity so it's kind of a weird world

00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:58,180
that I think application development and

00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:00,700
maybe kind of development in generals

00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:02,230
leading into where these platforms are

00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,000
almost becoming you know something that

00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:06,610
we're dependent on to provide certain

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,260
kinds of foundational services and I

00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:12,190
think it's only going to increase kind

00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:14,320
of this centralization maybe the cage or

00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:15,580
the cages around us maybe something like

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,040
a new beef them you know where you're

00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:21,520
sharecropping it out on you know a bunch

00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:23,080
of Google hosts so there's also all

00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,530
these at home projects that you might be

00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:27,550
familiar with things like steady at home

00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:30,730
composed these are with volunteer

00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:35,050
competing projects execute a bunch of

00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:36,280
different signal processing jobs not too

00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:38,530
impressive but this one is pretty

00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,990
impressive folding at home it's composed

00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:42,730
of a bunch of volunteer nodes as well

00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:46,480
using heterogeneous resources like both

00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:51,540
GPUs and CPUs and I think currently it

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:54,280
is the world's second fastest computer

00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:56,560
it's been super beneficial to the

00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:58,180
scientific community you know allowing

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,570
researchers to run these computationally

00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:03,700
costly atomic level simulations and it's

00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:06,310
produced 129 scientific research papers

00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:08,410
I don't know how relevant that is I came

00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:11,080
from the humanities where the average

00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:14,770
readership for the paper was about 15

00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:17,500
people so I don't know if 129 scientific

00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:19,920
research papers is a you know just 129 x

00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:23,110
15 people reading them but seems pretty

00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:25,540
important and then there's also all

00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:27,610
these other decentralized applications

00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:29,890
and things are kind of starting to get a

00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:34,780
little exciting today so these are kind

00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:37,030
of some examples of them so that I think

00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:39,160
this fellow here and maybe those two

00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:41,830
people back there are involved in

00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:44,350
building is the package manager called a

00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:47,110
package manager for data under the

00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:48,060
covers there's a couple different node

00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:51,030
modules

00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:54,210
Hyper are hyper archive right and then

00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:55,710
hyper core and people are building

00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:58,590
really interesting things on top of them

00:16:55,710 --> 00:17:01,740
like this one right beneath that is

00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:02,970
hyper vision and that's kind of p2p live

00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:05,280
streaming or decentralized live

00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:07,200
streaming decentralized switch we've got

00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:10,890
things like IP FS and ITF s is a little

00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:13,020
sneaky actually so ipfs release I guess

00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:14,610
the first full release of this library

00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:16,140
called lid p2p which is kind of the

00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:18,180
underlying peer-to-peer networking

00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:19,410
infrastructure and there's like a really

00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:21,300
small section where they talk about

00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:23,310
resource discovery and they mentioned

00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:25,200
things like CPUs they mentioned things

00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:28,350
like memory that we should be able to

00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:31,380
discover these resources on the ipfs

00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:33,870
network so maybe ipfs is kind of you

00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:35,670
know going to be building something like

00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:39,510
what I'm talking about I don't know I

00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:45,540
know that etherium which is kind of

00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:47,010
menacing diamond there's something like

00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:49,590
a runtime for that so you can kind of

00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:52,650
run programs execute programs on the

00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:56,840
Imperium blockchain Bitcoin obviously

00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:58,620
everybody knows Bitcoin this wheat

00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,970
multicolored wheat here this is

00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:03,360
democracy earth they're building

00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:05,940
something called sovereign which is I

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,710
think an attempt at decentralized

00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:10,370
democracy it's democracy on the

00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:12,780
blockchain that's a really interesting

00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:15,240
project I think it's a really important

00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,590
project the democracy the form of

00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,840
democracy that they advocate for us

00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:19,830
something called delegated democracy I

00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,420
don't know if anybody here has ever

00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:23,580
heard of delegated democracy but

00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:25,710
basically what it is is every individual

00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:27,450
on every issue is given a vote and you

00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:28,920
can either choose to delegate your vote

00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:31,470
to someone else or vote on an issue

00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:34,190
directly so it's kind of a hybrid form

00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:37,770
of direct and representative

00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:39,420
representational democracy and the

00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:43,580
people behind it actually started a

00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:46,770
party in Buenos Aires Argentina and

00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:48,390
campaigned on the idea that you kind of

00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:50,400
put them in power and then they'll build

00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:51,870
kind of deploy this application and give

00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,430
it everyone all their constituents

00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:54,780
access to it and then all their

00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:56,460
constituents can kind of

00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:58,140
almost a way of kind of hacking you know

00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:02,970
representational democracy and kind of

00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:05,100
layering over top of it this delegative

00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:06,410
reploid democracy on top of it

00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:09,690
this patch pay this is like

00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:10,530
decentralized Twitter Facebook you know

00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,000
for hippies

00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:13,680
maybe not exclusively for hippies

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,330
there's a lot of hippies on there the

00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,570
people who seem like hippies that's not

00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:20,550
meant as a judgement that's Menace like

00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:24,720
high esteem and then the last one here

00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:26,400
is war bit this circle series of circles

00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,440
and that's something like decentralized

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,640
slack and there's many many more I mean

00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,780
it's really exciting and the thing I

00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,780
kind of just want to point out about

00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:35,880
them is for the most part and I could be

00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:38,490
wrong but this kind of resource sharing

00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,590
is already going on okay so it's just

00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:43,650
implicit it's it's kind of hidden behind

00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:45,720
the application semantics and I think

00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:47,670
that it's really important to kind of

00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,230
pull that resource sharing resource

00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:53,100
allocation and resource delegation out

00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:54,330
from behind and those kind of make it

00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,460
explicit at least as you look for the

00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:59,220
first level so this is in any stuff

00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:03,150
that's original read a whole lot of

00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:06,360
other things about it assume odds Andros

00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:07,740
Mariano's marinos is the founder of

00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:13,320
resin I don't know if anyone's familiar

00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:16,170
with resin this is browser cloud this is

00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:18,870
one of the lead developers on ipfs this

00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:20,940
was I think their master's thesis cue

00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:23,100
machine is a really interesting project

00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:27,000
that I haven't seen a lot of talk about

00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:31,020
McKee machine is like a supercomputer on

00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:35,930
top of web browsers as well yeah that's

00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:35,930
it so five minutes but maybe we can

00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,680
