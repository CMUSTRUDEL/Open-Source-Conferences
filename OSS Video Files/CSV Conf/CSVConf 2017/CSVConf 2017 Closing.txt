on stage so first of all I want to go

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,360
through some really funny llama photos I

00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:44,100
took so these aren't in great order but

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,829

00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,030

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:51,059

00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:54,420
Where's Waldo llama this is the abs mean

00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:57,420
this is a great sequence of really

00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:00,750
compassionate llama photos with Napoleon

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:05,549
I got really intimate I actually touched

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:08,159
lips with Napoleon there was a lot of I

00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:11,670
mean how are we ever going to top the

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:18,900
llama basically there's one specific one

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:20,460
yeah a lot of llama selfies but just a

00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,380
recap of the day I had a lot of fun

00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,750
taking some photos of everyone getting

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,670
up on the second floor watching people

00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,130
eat the carrots or the llama eats a

00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,890
carrot taking photos of John behind his

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:34,020
back this was my favorite moment of the

00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,869
day seeing people will speed along with

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,729
the carrots on their mouth so I tweeted

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:40,890
a bunch of these photos if you guys want

00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:42,450
copies I can give you photos of the big

00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:48,409
copies I'll probably put them in google

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:51,570

00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:53,670

00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:09,990

00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:14,130

you know how to edit sari videos you

00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,760
should come talk to us and but Aaron

00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,350
single-handedly supplied all the a/v

00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,960
equipment for all three tracks out of

00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:27,330
his own personal repertoire which is

00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:34,800
awesome and so big huge round of

00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:36,390
applause to Aaron and like I said he

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,690
he's run in an event called indiewebcamp

00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:43,230
and he should definitely check it out so

00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:45,810
it was super awesome John basically

00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,310
handled all of the adult logistics

00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:50,760
involved with the conference calling

00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:53,130
people on the physical telephone like

00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,200
booking things doing receipts and

00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:57,030
payments and hotels for speakers and

00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,150
like making everything happen he called

00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:02,940
the llama people the most important task

00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:09,000
so huge shoutout to John shitake without

00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:11,250
this would not happen and I had local

00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,140
organizer help so we want input on where

00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,760
CSV comp should be in the future we

00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,140
haven't decided yet it might be in

00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,540
Portland again but I have local Portland

00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:24,960
help Nate and Danielle helping me out

00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:27,630
local keeping it weird we had Joe and

00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,980
Dan open knowledge international running

00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:34,290
the data tables that everybody like the

00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:36,780
data tables this year and of course

00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:40,220
Alain helping out with the dongle and

00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,220
going all the way from Canada

00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:47,269
and then the person who arranged the

00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:48,950
talk so that no matter what hour you are

00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:50,900
on you're like how do I choose between

00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:52,580
these three talk there's always two

00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:55,129
talks or three talks that I want to go

00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,629
to it one Karthik was the mastermind

00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:59,319
that made your life really difficult

00:03:56,629 --> 00:04:05,900
over the last few days the program chair

00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:07,970
dr. Karthik and I just took the cat

00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:11,090
photo but it's really a group effort and

00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:14,120
we're the fun organizers if you would

00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:15,680
like to get involved in organizing you

00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,690
can come talk to us to hear what it's

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,359
like we make you know millions of

00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:21,769
dollars off of this conference are how

00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:24,139
much in the hole are we I don't want to

00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:25,970
know so but what I was going to say is

00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:28,880
the best thing about this conference is

00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:30,620
the people that come and speak and the

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,820
second best thing as the people that

00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,970
come and watch the people to come and

00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:36,229
speak and no offense to all the audience

00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:39,440
members that didn't speak but if you

00:04:36,229 --> 00:04:41,660
haven't ever submitted a proposal so

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,760
just speaking honestly the hardest part

00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,620
of running a conference is getting the

00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,150
word out to people so that they hit the

00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,760
deadline by our call for proposal

00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:51,950
deadline to submit and the more work we

00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,660
put into it the better proposals that we

00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:55,669
get so I'm starting right now the end of

00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,289
this conference for next year I'm

00:04:55,669 --> 00:04:59,479
announcing our call for proposals which

00:04:57,289 --> 00:05:01,610
isn't even created yet but just start

00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:03,110
thinking about it already because it's

00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:05,900
just a constant flog to get the word out

00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:08,660
about it and if everyone in their minds

00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:10,280
could take a moment and think either for

00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:13,760
yourself or for if you already have

00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:15,979
given a talk who amongst your world

00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,960
would you like to see talk at CSP comp

00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:19,160
and maybe send them a Twitter DM and be

00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,380
like you should take it see us week off

00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,419
next year or if it's you and you've

00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:25,789
never spoken or you haven't spoken here

00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:29,000
should I speak as we talked next year it

00:05:25,789 --> 00:05:31,490
is very easy to submit a talk it's a

00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,080
Google Form and we notice that when you

00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:34,400
submit a Google Form and then three

00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,900
months later you get accepted you don't

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,990
remember even what you proposed and

00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,220
that's totally fine so we should

00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:43,940
probably come up with a better system so

00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:46,310
people can keep track of that but so we

00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:48,510
really want your help to make CC comps

00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:50,220
even weirder next year

00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:51,780
we honestly don't have a plan for

00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:56,700
outdoing ourselves with the llama this

00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:58,110
time so that's all I have to say does

00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:01,470
anyone else have anything else to say

00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:04,020
that I forgot well I wanted one more

00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:06,060
time thank our sponsors the Moore

00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:08,310
Foundation the sloan Foundation and open

00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,050
knowledge international and I wanted to

00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:12,480
let you know that even though we are

00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:13,800
ending the kind of program for the day

00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,420
we actually do have this space for

00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,340
another hour so if you wanted to go back

00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:19,470
to the data tables area or hang out with

00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:21,930
your friends this is a space for you to

00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:24,570
use the next hour so and Danielle put

00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:26,250
the great link in the slack channel will

00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:27,930
tweet it out as well of all of the

00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:30,510
places in Portland that have outdoor

00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:33,120
seating because it's a beautiful day and

00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:36,930
you should also use the connections used

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,910
here to go out and have some fun so I'm

00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:42,630
