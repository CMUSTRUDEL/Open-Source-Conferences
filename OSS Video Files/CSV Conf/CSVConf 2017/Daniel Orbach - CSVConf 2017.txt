hey guys how's it going can everyone

00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,570
hear me can you hear me in the back

00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:11,369
fine yeah cool thanks for that thumbs up

00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:14,459
so today I'm going to talk to you about

00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:16,680
this topic bar graphs how we got to

00:00:14,459 --> 00:00:18,060
where we are where we're going to go

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,730
next and how those things are kind of

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:23,550
related so given the interdisciplinary

00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,109
nature of this gathering I think it's

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,349
probably good to point out that I'm a

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:30,089
designer I work at moment we do digital

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:32,400
strategy and product design in New York

00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:34,680
and Chicago and we primarily work in

00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:38,640
finance in healthcare to really

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:40,020
data-driven industries that that kind of

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,120
aligned with my personal interest for

00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,469
data visualization and while I was

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,960
living in New York before I moved to

00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:49,019
Chicago I thought it would be a great

00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,760
idea somewhat misguided to record every

00:00:49,019 --> 00:00:53,609
single subway ride I took in the year

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,920
2015 to kind of create my own data set

00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:57,420
and see what I could learn about it and

00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,670
a lot of what I'm going to talk about in

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,809
this in the in these next you know 15 20

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,660
minutes is about what I learned from

00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:05,790
doing this exercise so that's kind of

00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,650
where that's coming from but at the end

00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,150
of the day this this is going to talk

00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,740
about how to make prettier charts and

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,780
graphs it's even though I'm a designer

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,340
right and I care deeply about that it's

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,490
more about the context in which we

00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,470
consume visualizations today and how the

00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:22,070
small decisions we make an end up having

00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:24,960
a really huge impact on how people are

00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:27,000
learning from the data visualizations we

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,770
make and even how they explore so to

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,900
understand what's going on now and

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,640
what's going on in the future and I

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,980
think it makes sense to actually take a

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,540
few steps back and ask the question how

00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,280
did we get here how did we get to the

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,560
point where people are you know making

00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,510
incredibly complex crazy data

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,890
visualizations sometimes without really

00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:46,320
considering the implications of what

00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,550
they're making or taking the steps to

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,950
make sure that what they're creating is

00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:53,070
legible or consumable by you know the

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,450
actual human beings on the other end so

00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,900
I'll take you through a few really

00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:59,700
interesting data visualizations

00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:01,860
historically and the stories behind them

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,570
so this first the first kind of step

00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,580
when we realize when data visualization

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:08,459
started to happen this is actually

00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:10,349
really recently is visualization is

00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,799
documentation so understanding that you

00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:16,290
know a table is not or a CSV is not the

00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:18,840
best way for information to live that

00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:21,060
there's actually more utility by by

00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,299
visualizing it and one of the earliest

00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:26,459
data visualizations on record is

00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:27,989
happened in the year 1630 this is

00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:28,769
towards the end of Galileo's life so

00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:29,909
we're starting to get high-quality

00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:31,890
telescopes

00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:35,849
Christopher shiner decides to point his

00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:37,530
telescope at the Sun and record sunspots

00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:39,599
but instead of describing the sunspots

00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,790
mathematically or you know using

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,349
equations he actually decides to just

00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,760
draw them out draw a circle for the Sun

00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:47,189
and then fill in the dark spots where

00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,930
you see where you see dark spots in a

00:02:47,189 --> 00:02:51,930
telescope and over time he's able to

00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,219
kind of capture the movement of the

00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,319
earth the movement of where he is

00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:57,840
relative to the Sun using and display

00:02:55,319 --> 00:03:00,269
that using one of the first examples of

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,430
a principle called small multiples I

00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:04,319
think that's a tough D term but really

00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:06,599
just showing multiple instances of the

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,010
same visualization next to itself and

00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:09,540
this is used today in weather and

00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:12,420
finance

00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,340
in health care too so once we figured

00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,359
out okay we can take data out of the

00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,459
table

00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:19,889
it got to the point really quickly where

00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:21,659
people understood that visualizing data

00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:23,849
is actually a persuasive act whenever

00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:25,999
you engage in you know visualizing

00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:29,279
information there's some sort of bias or

00:03:25,999 --> 00:03:30,719
opinion that you have about that

00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:32,400
information even if you're trying to be

00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:36,840
really you know impartial

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,939
that tends to manifest and a person who

00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,370
really took this principle to heart is

00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:43,950
William Playfair this one individual in

00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:45,840
the year 1822 and throughout his career

00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:48,200
actually invented the pie chart the bar

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,700
chart the circle chart

00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,799
waterfall chart I think to a lot of what

00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:55,739
we use in Excel came from this guy and

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,329
this is in 1822 this is the United

00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:58,829
States is older than a lot of the

00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:00,930
primary tools we use to visualize

00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:04,680
information which is I think kind of

00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:07,349
crazy so in this chart what you're

00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,840
looking at is you know there's obviously

00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:12,120
multiple data sets here on one sort of

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,129
sheet but you're looking at the wages of

00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,689
an average worker and the price of wheat

00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,120
so over time he's trying to make the

00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:17,949
argument

00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,030
that the quality of life of a person is

00:04:17,949 --> 00:04:21,519
increased because they're able to buy

00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:22,840
more wheat for their dollar but because

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,070
this is one of the first examples of

00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,960
these visualizations he actually

00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:28,360
accompanied these with pamphlets very

00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,710
dense pamphlets with very clear

00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,419
instructions on how he wanted you to

00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:32,560
read the visualization and what he

00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:34,210
wanted you to get out of it and even

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,710
tell you kind of what his point of view

00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:42,040
is so we're starting to have opinions or

00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:47,770
express opinions and we eventually kind

00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:50,139
of reach that that we breach we move

00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:52,389
past it we move past it and we start to

00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:53,949
get datasets that are just too big to

00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:55,449
have opinions on just by looking at them

00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:58,810
we have to begin to explore data for

00:04:55,449 --> 00:05:01,690
answers and one of the most famous

00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:03,220
examples of this is a Jon Snow

00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:04,150
visualization which a lot of you have

00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,100
probably seen before

00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,090
I don't watch Game of Thrones someone

00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:11,139
told me you know if you put this slide

00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:12,280
up here people laugh so I did it and so

00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:13,030
this is the actual Jon Snow we're

00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,320
talking about and this is a

00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:17,139
visualization probably a lot of you have

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,539
seen where you know people talk colors a

00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:21,340
disease transmitted through the air Jon

00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:23,200
Snow figures out this is not the case

00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:24,880
because he visits broad street where a

00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,740
lot of the cases were happening and sees

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,450
that oh guess what there's a water pump

00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,950
infected with human feces and turns out

00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:32,470
that cholera is actually a bacterial

00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:34,539
transmission not through the air and at

00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:36,490
the D me ology is born so we have

00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:37,810
writing down data for the first time

00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,220
having an opinion about data the

00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:41,320
beginning of sort of data exploration

00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:44,169
and all these instances data

00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:46,150
visualization is evolving alongside the

00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:47,620
complexity the information and the

00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:49,479
technology available at the time you

00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,340
know you start that telescopes you get

00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:53,349
people doing small multiples you start

00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,750
that people living in really close close

00:05:53,349 --> 00:05:57,340
quarters and disease kind of starting to

00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:00,220
travel between people you start to get

00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:01,990
epidemiology so the field of data

00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:04,060
visualization is actually evolved

00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:05,889
alongside these three things and if we

00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:08,169
go to the pret sorry if we go to the

00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:10,090
present if we go to today we can

00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:11,740
actually figure out where data

00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:14,590
visualization is going to go based on

00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:16,539
these three kind of factors so no

00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:18,520
surprise to anyone in this room data and

00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:19,870
technology are going crazy they're

00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,750
evolving in a breakneck pace there's

00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:25,830
been an explosion in our ability to

00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:27,330
both create data and document it so a

00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:28,740
couple of really interesting examples

00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:31,260
here you may or may not know this but

00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:32,670
the plane engines on the planes we a lot

00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:35,160
of us took to get here actually leased

00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:37,890
by the companies that owned the bodies

00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:40,860
for the planes and GE lease is a lot of

00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:42,660
them and they actually use they transmit

00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:44,220
10 gigabytes per second of data from

00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:47,460
those plane engines to data centers that

00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:49,230
are then analyzed timing data you know

00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:51,780
systems data all sorts of stuff it's

00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:54,510
crazy but there's also data available to

00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:56,940
civilians in huge quantities right New

00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:59,610
York City has open data IMF s open data

00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:01,460
and NASA a lot a lot of organizations

00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:06,000
are open sourcing their information

00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:07,110
which is great but I kind of going on in

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,150
the opposite trend moving in the

00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:10,880
opposite direction is data literacy

00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:13,680
especially here in the United States

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,450
it's getting worse and worse

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,160
so when you take these two trends and

00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:18,720
you kind of directly juxtapose them to

00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,850
one another it's apparent that we're

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,919
struggling to keep up with this you know

00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:25,140
massive information which is a problem

00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:27,150
so what do we do about it what's the

00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:28,800
solution of this problem there's a

00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:30,180
really really great opportunity here to

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,010
take advantage of the fact that we live

00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:34,740
in the future but kind of work around

00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:36,120
some of those difficulties and as I was

00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,550
putting this talk together I ran into

00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,840
this Stephen King quote which is that if

00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,040
you don't have the time to read you

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,800
don't have the time or tools to write

00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:45,030
and this translates really well to the

00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,700
point I'm trying to make here which is

00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:50,100
that we need to consume a lot of data

00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,990
visualization ourselves to be able to

00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:54,180
create better for other people we need

00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:55,919
to be able to understand how we perceive

00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:58,830
as people so that we can be better

00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:00,390
creating for people so this first this

00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:03,419
first half here understanding how we

00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:05,729
perceive the way that we see the way the

00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:07,350
human si is rooted in evolution right so

00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:09,180
I think I actually saw this on a Penn &

00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:10,800
Teller show they went through this

00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:13,410
example which is really cool but if

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,729
you're let's say you're looking for you

00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:16,500
know Buffalo in a field because you're

00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:18,900
hunting Buffalo in the great Midwest

00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,460
which is where I'm from you might see

00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,020
five in the distance and if you see five

00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,640
you'll know that it's five immediately

00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,440
without having to count but if you see a

00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,670
much larger number a herd of buffalo for

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,020
example that are scattered

00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:29,460
wouldn't be able to tell me immediately

00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,800
how many are here like you would with

00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:34,530
five and that five or six numbers

00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,060
threshold is really really important for

00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:38,430
organizing and grouping information

00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:40,500
because if I take this chunk and I break

00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:42,840
it out into sets of four or six you can

00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,730
instantly count way faster just because

00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,960
you know things are visually organized

00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:48,000
relative to each other but I can

00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,590
influence how you count so right now you

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,690
might be seeing you know six rows of

00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:52,980
four but I can change the way you're

00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:55,320
looking at those rows just by changing

00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:57,060
the shape or by changing the color so

00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,400
the small decisions that we make with

00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:00,600
space changing color rhythm you know all

00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,380
of those things have a really huge

00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,880
impact on how information is consumed

00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:07,920
but more so than what is there it's also

00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,900
what isn't there right so being able to

00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,700
question a context or think critically

00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:14,310
about what it is we're seeing is really

00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:16,200
important this is an example that I

00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:18,090
really enjoy but it's kind of hard to

00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,860
read so you're looking here what you're

00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:22,350
looking at here is a chart of cigarettes

00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,910
smoked by worldwide lung cancer ranking

00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:25,740
so you know the fewer cigarettes you

00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:27,570
smoke the less lung cancer you have

00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,910
generally the trend kind of makes sense

00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:31,980
but there's two countries here that jump

00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:33,690
out Japan which is right here and

00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,980
Azerbaijan which is right here they

00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:37,560
smoked roughly the same number of

00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,000
cigarettes but Azerbaijan has way less

00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,620
lung cancer so you might think to

00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,990
yourself why why is this is there

00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:44,640
something in the air is it genetic we

00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:46,620
need to explore this problem further and

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,450
a lot of visualization is kind of

00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,940
emitting that critical piece that you

00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:53,150
need context to understand so if you add

00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,230
another layer of data here and I know

00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:57,530
gradient color overlays aren't always

00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,940
best practice with scatter charts but

00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:01,440
you can actually see that Japan if you

00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:03,390
look at life expectancy as the number

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,340
one life expectancy in the world at 83

00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:08,010
years and that Azerbaijan is much lower

00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:10,320
at 70 when you find out that the average

00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:12,240
age of a lung cancer diagnosis is 71

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,650
years old you find out that you know a

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,210
lot of people in Azerbaijan are just

00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:17,310
passing away before they're able to even

00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:19,410
be diagnosed with lung cancer so as

00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:21,060
people who are visualizing information

00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,890
taking that extra step to kind of

00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:25,050
understand what it is we should be

00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:27,510
communicating and making that apparent

00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:29,970
is really key and this is only gonna get

00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:31,380
harder because right now you know we're

00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:32,940
the ones working on creating these

00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,080
visualizations or generating them but

00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,820
very quickly we're going to get to a

00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,030
point where that's not the case where

00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,890
you know you

00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:40,330
again excuse some numbers some models

00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:42,070
into tensorflow what you get out on the

00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:43,600
other end is something that is really a

00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:44,830
product of the biases of the model

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,900
you've created so you're taking these

00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:48,460
biases that normally you know humans are

00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,050
responsible for and you're abstracting

00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:52,180
them two three four levels and whatever

00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:54,160
comes out your you know it's really hard

00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:55,510
to evaluate especially so this is I

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,970
don't know how many people in here you

00:10:55,510 --> 00:11:00,670
censor float machine learning library by

00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:04,210
Google but this is a kind of a companion

00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:06,880
web app to that tensor board which you

00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:08,590
can use to better understand how your

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,350
models are learning through all the

00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:13,450
iterations or epochs that you're kind of

00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:14,920
letting them run for and a study

00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:17,580
actually just came out last week that

00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:19,780
the these charts and human input has a

00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:21,430
being able to sort of iterate through

00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:24,670
this through visualization as a huge

00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:25,690
impact on the outcome of the model but

00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:27,190
it's not just happening in two

00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:30,490
dimensions it's also happening in three

00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:32,770
dimensions so this is a hello world in a

00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:34,780
visualization in machine learning where

00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:37,420
you take you know ten thousand digits

00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:39,610
and you kind of sort them and you use

00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:41,590
supervised learning to see kind of like

00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:42,820
what a digit is when you write and this

00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:45,490
is really interesting because you can

00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:47,050
see that the eights are green band a few

00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:48,910
eights that wind up where the fives are

00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:50,440
because they look like fives so you can

00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:53,430
kind of understand how your model is

00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:55,420
learning which is really really amazing

00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:57,220
so seeing critically is about

00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:59,170
recognizing what's missing as well as

00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:01,450
what's there and we need to be able to

00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:03,190
see critically to understand how we

00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:05,560
consume so that we can get better at

00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:07,390
creating for people so the three

00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,920
questions here that seem really really

00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:10,690
obvious and low level but they're

00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,670
questions that are really important so

00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:14,080
I'll take us through kind of what what

00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,850
the implications of these questions are

00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,950
and how we can ask them more in our own

00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:19,720
work so this first question is should

00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:21,070
should this be visualized even at all I

00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,110
think a lot of times when our handed a

00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:25,120
data set with the prerogative to you

00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:27,550
know make make something visual we just

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,710
do it but that's not always a good idea

00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:32,500
and here's an example of when it's a bad

00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:33,670
idea on the simple end so for those of

00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,230
you that don't know the lines in New

00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:38,440
York two of them are the D and the 6th

00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:39,760
subway line and I would ride these lines

00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,860
every week so you're looking at the

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,810
total number of times I rode the Train

00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,840
on a given day of the week and for me

00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:47,150
whenever I look at the

00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:48,770
all I see is this even if I'm trying to

00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:50,690
look over here my eyes eventually just

00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:53,030
swoop back up to that top and it's

00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:54,290
unavoidable and that's great if you're

00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:55,640
trying to make that point but it's bad

00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:58,040
if you're trying to you know show that

00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,830
data so if it's less than 20 points less

00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,300
than 20 data pieces just make it a table

00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:04,730
it lets people see the actual numbers

00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:07,190
it's simpler takes less time you

00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:08,840
represent things clearly and I can still

00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:10,310
see that there's a 32 in Tuesday but

00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:13,130
that doesn't take away that you know

00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:14,810
there's a 15 and 25 and Sunday so it

00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:17,600
also absolves you of all these decisions

00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:19,070
like labeling colors scale you know how

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,780
are we going to import these data

00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:23,300
libraries you just have to deal with a

00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:25,400
lot less of that you can also go too far

00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:28,520
the opposite end and they have things be

00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,660
way too complicated so if you have you

00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,070
know if you're trying to show too many

00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:32,780
variables or if you're trying to take

00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:35,140
data and jam it into a visualization

00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:38,150
that doesn't necessarily accept it that

00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:39,590
it can be really really frustrating and

00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,790
a lot of times this happens because we

00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:42,950
don't necessarily have a clear objective

00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:44,570
of what we're trying to show so if

00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:45,380
you're if you're ever in a situation

00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:47,630
where you're looking at something like

00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:49,970
this taking a step back and just asking

00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:51,770
what am I trying to do here can actually

00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:53,030
help a lot so in this instance I'm

00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:54,410
trying to show you know on days when I

00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:56,360
took the train a given number of times

00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:58,940
what mix of lines that I ride on that

00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,740
day so taking a step back and just you

00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:04,700
know rejiggering it and figuring it out

00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:06,380
can help another question that's really

00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:08,990
good to ask and a question that user

00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:11,480
research can actually help you solve if

00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:12,530
you're into that sort of thing is the

00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,140
assumptions that you're making because

00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:16,010
we all make assumption so it's kind of

00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:17,570
something you have to do when you're

00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:20,630
when you're designing because you never

00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:21,680
have all the information so even a you

00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:24,890
know a really innocuous looking

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:27,680
visualization like this this I'm making

00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:28,940
the assumption that green and red don't

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,830
mean good and bad that they're actually

00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:32,750
associated with the one two three and

00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:33,950
four five six subway lines and if you

00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,330
don't live in New York or have never

00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:36,680
been or don't care about the New York

00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:38,510
subway you might think oh there's just

00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,070
there's more green than red here so

00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:41,600
something good is going on and then you

00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:43,310
get confused trying to figure out what

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,750
I'm trying to tell you but because it

00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:47,450
doesn't make any sense if you think

00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:49,820
about it that way so making a really

00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:51,410
simple change and just you know changing

00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,610
colors to be something more neutral so I

00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:53,670
mean that people don't have associations

00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:55,230
with is

00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:56,460
helpful and this happens a lot

00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:58,440
especially when you're designing

00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,190
visualizations for audiences in

00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,690
different countries or different

00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:03,150
cultures where certain colors have

00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:06,900
certain associations and we just don't

00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:08,310
even know about it you can also you know

00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:10,470
if you're looking at a pie chart like

00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:12,030
this I'm making a ton of assumptions

00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,830
here even with something really simple

00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:15,480
and even though it is an exploration

00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:17,340
right I'm assuming that it's I'm making

00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,960
it for an artistic exploration not

00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:20,910
necessarily a scientific exploration

00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,560
that I don't need labels that you can

00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:24,870
see or care about all these small

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,450
slivers when you really might not and

00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:28,800
you can take things after looking at all

00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:30,150
these assumptions you can take it and

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,920
simplify it and say you know what I'm

00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:34,170
just going to take all those slivers

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,330
pack them into a you know one of their

00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:37,530
own slices group all of the labels and

00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:39,900
all of a sudden that gives me more room

00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:41,520
to actually label things correctly so

00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:43,590
thinking about the assumptions you're

00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:45,720
making who they're for those will inform

00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:47,460
the changes you're trying to make and

00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,500
then finally what you're trying to

00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,880
depict and this is also you know it

00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,980
might seem really basic to a lot even

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,990
this room but a lot of designers that I

00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:57,300
know this is a question you struggle

00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:59,970
with a lot if you're trying to show

00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:01,830
relationship kind of among items every

00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:03,630
financial relationship over time a

00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:05,820
distribution or comparison though that I

00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:07,590
think before really most basic types of

00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:09,630
relationships but they can also be

00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:11,220
combined mixed and matched and being

00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:13,710
able to I think something that's really

00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,090
great that was hit on earlier it's just

00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:16,350
being able to write out a sentence with

00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:19,290
what it is you're trying to show and

00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:21,030
then think about okay is did what is

00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:22,650
what I just wrote out a comparison among

00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:24,570
items is it something that's related to

00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:25,980
time is it both if I'm combining them

00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:27,480
how am I going to do that being

00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:30,480
intentional about those decisions will

00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,260
really go a long way so those three

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,210
questions

00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:35,070
should this be visualized what

00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:37,260
assumptions am i making and what am I

00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:39,960
trying to depict these are really great

00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:41,700
questions to ask they're really great

00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,990
questions to ask whenever you open up a

00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,660
tool to start creating data

00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:47,310
visualization especially towards the

00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,660
beginning of the process but there are

00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:50,040
also really great questions to ask

00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,870
whenever you're consuming a

00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,550
visualization that someone else made or

00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:54,720
giving someone feedback if they're you

00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:56,670
know a colleague or co-worker

00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,680
thinking about should this have been

00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:00,750
visualized in the first place is this is

00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,820
this even appropriate to be a data

00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:04,230
visualization what assumptions did this

00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,730
person make trying to think of

00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:07,740
you know things from their point of view

00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:09,120
if they're you know reporter working for

00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,829
a certain news organization and that

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,880
organization is either right-wing or

00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:14,339
left-wing what are some of the

00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,480
assumptions that that person might make

00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:17,429
or what are the biases of that

00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,630
publication and then finally what are

00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:20,339
they trying to depict you know

00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:22,020
understanding that at least for the time

00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:24,500
being they're humans on the other ends

00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:27,179
of these data visualizations and that

00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:29,070
that that person has an intent which you

00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:30,630
can think about you know assuming that

00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:31,740
they're at least somewhat reasonable

00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:34,260
what are they trying to show me what are

00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:35,850
they trying to convince me of so I think

00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:38,250
if we can ask these questions whenever

00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:41,100
we're making or whenever we're consuming

00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:43,160
it'll let us really be more critical and

00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:56,210
that'll let us create more thoughtfully

00:17:43,160 --> 00:18:02,190
Thanks questions concerns accusations

00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:06,710
yeah sure

00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:09,120
and that's a great question so I used

00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:10,830
Excel so you thought an app on my phone

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,870
called blogger where you can actually

00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:15,150
manually log whatever information you

00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:16,559
want whenever it happens so every time I

00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:18,419
got in a train I would pull my phone out

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:21,750
of my pocket and note the line note the

00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:23,520
time of day and write it down which

00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,549
interestingly helped me understand that

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,360
even if you put yourself in charge of

00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:29,280
encoding all of your data you're going

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,020
to miss days make mistakes that's going

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,059
to go wrong like it's really hard to get

00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,650
it right so then putting it into Excel

00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:36,780
messing around with it doing a bunch of

00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:40,049
vlookups and then there's a really

00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:41,549
amazing thing you can do which if you if

00:18:40,049 --> 00:18:43,410
you generate a chart in Excel you can

00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:45,320
actually copy and paste the vectors into

00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:48,390
illustrator or any other Adobe program

00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:50,610
for free main to keeps all the geometry

00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:52,620
and then you can take that geometry and

00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:54,240
make brushes out of it for The Strokes

00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:57,210
of shapes and do all kinds of crazy

00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:03,299
stuff so that's that was this particular

00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:05,970
project yeah we're sort of designing

00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:06,850
with the style teacher so maybe like not

00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:09,310
as car-like

00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:13,090
for example this one here is fairly new

00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:15,850
to me is there some sort of like rubric

00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:18,040
or something that you because I when I

00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:20,170
look at this I see essentially you took

00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:22,300
a la subway guys mm-hmm like that's what

00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:24,750
it tells me initially but it looks like

00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:27,100
seems like you're saying like basically

00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:29,440
how do I know people are going to

00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:32,950
understand this to be able to use it you

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:35,290
know functionally is there when you're

00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:37,390
sort of focusing on these new types of

00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:38,140
charts and graphs is there yeah that's a

00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:40,570
great question

00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:42,870
I think there's there's two parts to

00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:45,790
that the first part is being really

00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:47,200
diligent about collecting inspiration or

00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:49,360
things that inspire you or things that

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,100
you think are working well even if it's

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,960
not necessarily for what you're working

00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:54,250
on right now so I have a huge folder on

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,900
my computer with a bunch of

00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:57,610
visualizations that are not traditional

00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:59,170
and are really interesting that I found

00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:00,820
or people show me and I just collect

00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:02,860
them and then when it comes time to

00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:06,070
actually make something that's new you

00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:08,410
can reference that folder look at things

00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:09,550
that you like a lot and you know start

00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:12,010
to mess around and put things together

00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:13,330
and then once you've done that actually

00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:14,680
pulling taking someone pulling them

00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:16,270
aside and asking them in a sentence

00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,250
describe what you see here and then

00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:21,610
having them tell you will allow you to

00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:23,440
kind of to iterate over over what it is

00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:25,270
you're doing and try and come come to a

00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:32,040
solution that kind of satisfactory

00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:32,040
that's what I would suggest yeah

00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:41,620
have you project accessibility you guys

00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:45,430
yeah that's a good question earlier this

00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:48,040
year I was working on a project for for

00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:50,530
a medical chart and a client told us

00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,210
that it might have to be faxed we ended

00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:56,680
up printing it out and faxing it to

00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:59,950
ourselves to see if it held up there

00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:02,710
actually are pretty great tools for they

00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:04,930
integrate into some design platforms for

00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:06,610
accessibility so just last week I don't

00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:09,430
know if you know about sketch but it's a

00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:11,200
really popular vector editing tool kind

00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:13,090
of like Adobe Illustrator and it's

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,680
pretty affordable and there's a really

00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:16,000
great community around it and just last

00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:18,910
week someone released a package that

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,490
allows you to test color blindness and

00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:23,590
low resolution accessibility and

00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:26,620
contract basic contrast be even beyond

00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:28,090
just color with all of your designs so

00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,320
looking at I don't know if that's

00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:30,910
exactly what you're asking about but

00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,820
finding a plugin like that for your

00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:35,950
software application and plugging in

00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:37,990
then designing something for print or

00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:39,880
first slides putting it in that medium

00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:42,100
as you design it on a regular basis to

00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,330
kind of check to see if your colors are

00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,190
actually rendering how they should

00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:47,830
blender or bringing someone in to

00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:53,290
actually use the design and ask them if

00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:55,000
it's working for them alright I think I

00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:56,800
think that's the end of my time here if
