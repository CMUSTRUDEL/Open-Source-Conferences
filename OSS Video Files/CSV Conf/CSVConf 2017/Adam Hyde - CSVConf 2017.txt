00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,910
Yatta

00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,800
thank you actually I'm surprised at how

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,139
many people are here this is not a

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,750
straight out data talk this is more

00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:17,880
about producing open-source products and

00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,070
this is only the second time I've given

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,230
this talk the first time was I think

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:25,140
yesterday or the day before yesterday at

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:28,080
penguin Con which is a really

00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:31,170
interesting conference in Detroit if you

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,600
ever feel like getting your favorite

00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,250
penguin costume and go into an

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,410
open-source conference I recommend

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:40,320
penguin Connaught awesome full of really

00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,030
fascinating amazing people anyway so

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,649
this is called quit scratching someone

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,110
else's edge and it's about producing

00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:48,420
excellent open-source products it's sort

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:51,300
of going to be connected to this book

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,039
that I put out the chemistry method but

00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,390
this is just one strategy of other

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,120
greater strategy that I want to talk

00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,859
about so first a little bit about me

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,890
and you can find me at Adam hide dotnet

00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:05,369
I'm in New Zealand and I'm now living in

00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:08,670
San Francisco and I've started a few

00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:10,950
open source projects flus manuals which

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:14,400
is a community that writes free manuals

00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,990
for free software book typed I didn't

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,049
write it but I was a founder of it book

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:21,810
type as a book production software book

00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:23,430
Jes there's a lot of produce in this

00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,640
realm which is all about open source

00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,990
solutions for producing books I'm a

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,490
co-founder of collaborative knowledge

00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:34,079
foundation cocoa I founded book Sprint's

00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:36,000
which is a methodology to write a book

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,490
in five days in fund and books currently

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,350
it started off with writing software

00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,850
manuals and the cabbage tree method

00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,670
which I'll talk about I'm also a shadow

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:47,009
with fellow and I used to be an artist

00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:50,009
and stuff this is me standing in front

00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:52,710
of RT 32 which is one of my favorite

00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:54,689
gadgets as an artist it's a ex-soviet

00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:57,090
radio telescope I used to make sound a

00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:59,670
purpose this is the collaborative

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,710
knowledge foundation cocoa Foundation we

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,729
are working towards solving scholarly

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:07,020
publishing problems with open source and

00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:08,610
building good-faith networks we were

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,740
part of the group that brought together

00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:13,170
open source alliance

00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:14,460
for open science that met for our first

00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,490
meeting yesterday which is a wonderful

00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:20,850
day and we're building them interesting

00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:23,040
infrastructure pub sweet Inc editorial X

00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:25,110
wheat editorial is a monograph

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,410
production suite and these other tools

00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:30,650
are basically enable us to build they're

00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:33,960
kind of like sweets for building

00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:36,140
workflows for publishers most of its

00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,160
JavaScript based but we use 100%

00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:41,280
open-source tool chain so you can find

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:45,810
this at staff at get lab cocoa dot

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:48,900
foundation github is proprietary so it's

00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:51,380
just scratch so those are no of you know

00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:55,010
anything about open source there's this

00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:57,270
famous chap Eric Raymond who sort of

00:02:55,010 --> 00:03:00,780
categorizes himself as being the first

00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:02,580
open source anthropologist or

00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,470
self-appointed open source

00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,210
anthropologist he wrote this book called

00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:09,030
the cathedral in the bazaar and other

00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:13,590
works right and his here's a few famous

00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:15,230
statements one of them is every good

00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:18,320
piece of software started with the

00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:21,390
developer scratching their own itch so

00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:23,760
this is the you know considered as a

00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:25,500
sort of foundational work of cathedral

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,140
and bazaar and this is a foundational

00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,490
concept and I think it's very true you

00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,610
can see it in action like in

00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:35,010
prototypical form with linus torvalds

00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,520
you know he wanted a free operating

00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,280
system

00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:42,000
there wasn't one what he was the one

00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:44,310
that he wanted and he he started on it

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,130
that you know the itches wanting the the

00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:50,280
operating system and he started on it

00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:52,290
that's a scratch and then of course he

00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,330
did the famous first posting of his

00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:56,880
email saying anybody want to help and

00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:58,950
then the rest is history writes and just

00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,170
developed into this massive communal

00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:02,400
scratch so there's a couple important

00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:04,710
things about this it's just a scratch

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,690
model right it's like you know if you

00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:08,760
have a problem that you want to solve it

00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,900
that's the itch and scratching it is

00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,330
going through the process of actually

00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,130
solving that problem I think the

00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:15,870
critical part of this is two critical

00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:17,970
parts but the one I want to focus on is

00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:20,970
that the fact that it's your itch is

00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,570
critically important right because it's

00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,480
if you

00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:25,800
I have a problem you're an insider to

00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,110
that problem you understand these

00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,840
nuances incredibly well right this is

00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:33,420
kind of the thing that set off just

00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:37,170
about every open source product project

00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:40,110
and that therefore was you know that a

00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:41,580
developer has this specific problem they

00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:43,620
think I've got to solve that it's

00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:45,330
annoying and then they work towards

00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:48,300
solving it and because they know it very

00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:49,650
well they know the nuance of the problem

00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,830
and they developed a really interesting

00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:54,780
solution right in this case the

00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:56,580
developers both the use case specialists

00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:59,030
in the code specialists right so the

00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:01,620
developer knows the problem the use case

00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:03,060
and they also know how to solve the

00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,920
problem because they're a developer so

00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,840
they work towards solving it all right

00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,010
so known your itch gives you these

00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,530
insights and motivations you're

00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:12,390
motivated to solve this thing and you

00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:14,910
have as internal understanding of what

00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:16,980
the problem is but it's this knowing

00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:19,410
your itch which is the important part of

00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:21,990
it it gives us it's an important

00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:24,120
qualitative and experiential factor it's

00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:27,030
critically important in my opinion it's

00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:29,820
different from for example proprietary

00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:31,410
approaches where you know you have a

00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,590
different kind of culture your open

00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:37,020
source is kind of like a cultural method

00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:39,900
for solving problems it sort of evolved

00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:42,120
as a culture whereas commercial

00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:45,150
strategies proprietary service trees are

00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,790
much more intentional and they are often

00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:49,590
treat the user as a research object

00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:52,140
right so we go out and find out what the

00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:53,310
user wants what document that and then

00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:55,530
we'll build it right and you can say

00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:57,900
well this old-school this is true for

00:05:55,530 --> 00:06:00,090
just about every methodology that's

00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,530
evolved out of the software development

00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:03,090
lifecycle tree if you know about

00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:06,900
software development life cycles it's

00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:09,060
just a it's a roof ceiling under which

00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,870
it houses a number of different ways to

00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:15,510
develop software these models

00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:17,550
methodologies spiral agile is mistakenly

00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:19,950
called a methodology it's not it's an

00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:21,570
idea kind of but you know right from

00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:23,100
waterfall right through to you know

00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:24,660
following all these things through scrum

00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,570
and whatever you want to choose

00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:30,150
you're basically treating the user as a

00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:32,430
kind of research object right you can

00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:34,260
some methodologies you have

00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:35,669
advertise you turn the user into an

00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,530
advertiser you draw a picture of them

00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:40,740
you think I know exactly what that

00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:42,960
person wants which is second guessing

00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:47,639
user right it's really the user is

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:50,130
external to you and I think that that's

00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:51,930
where a key differentiator why open

00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:54,360
source has been so successful in solving

00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:56,250
the problems right that the developers

00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,050
have their own problem they solve it and

00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,310
they solve it incredibly well because

00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,070
they understand that problem they're

00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:03,990
internal to the problem and I think

00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:07,110
proprietary takes us other approach

00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:10,560
right and it sort of works it's proved

00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:11,850
it's pretty good at working but the

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,760
question is for me is that I don't

00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:17,790
really care about proprietary software I

00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:21,570
don't I don't want any part of it so how

00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:23,520
could we work with this itch to scratch

00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:25,560
model to solve problems in the user

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,660
space because open sources generally

00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,780
failed at this right I think you can

00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:32,669
look around the world at the different

00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,710
categories of software and you can say

00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:36,270
well open sources solve the

00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:39,150
infrastructure problem right you can say

00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:44,880
it's one more release the internet runs

00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:46,860
and OpenSSH and bind whatever you want

00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,720
to name all open source infrastructure

00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:52,200
is their operating systems are their

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,419
driving internet every phone has got at

00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:57,720
its core pretty much an open kernel of

00:07:54,419 --> 00:08:00,030
some description even you know many

00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:03,930
proprietary Oasis has got open

00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:06,090
components or a largely open so it

00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:08,370
solves the infrastructure and it's also

00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:09,840
solve developer tools right JavaScript

00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:12,000
libraries you can pretty much can't

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,340
develop any piece of software without

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,990
using open source so open source is one

00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:20,760
in these categories and it's been a

00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:22,919
progressive one right when Linus

00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,570
Torvalds did this original email there

00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:27,150
wasn't that much open infrastructure and

00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:29,610
so opens infrastructure was first solved

00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:32,250
with databases and operating systems

00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:36,169
then came developer tools after that and

00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:38,640
so it has been an evolving process and

00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:40,440
one of the last year is that open source

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,810
hasn't sold and I think needs to solve

00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,440
is how to make good user facing products

00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:47,120
and I think it entirely failed

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,400
there's not many products out there that

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,290
you could say we're beating the

00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,750
proprietary competition when it comes to

00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:54,140
user space right so if you look at Libre

00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:57,500
Office

00:08:54,140 --> 00:09:00,860
it's a copy of Microsoft pretty much of

00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:03,620
word social media we've pretty much lost

00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:06,230
right and there's the open frameworks

00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:09,310
open source platforms for social media

00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:11,780
haven't really won the social media game

00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:13,370
just about every desktop application

00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:16,150
even disrupt environments you know I

00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:19,880
think unity is a beautiful operating

00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:22,070
system desktop open source this top if

00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:24,140
you don't know it it's what until

00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:27,320
recently has become the default desktop

00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:29,600
for Ubuntu is going to be replaced by

00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:32,120
genome but it's a great desk top get lab

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,980
I think is a better product than github

00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,810
I think it actually looks better and

00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:39,680
works better I think matter most is a

00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:41,960
better product than slack I think there

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,060
are some examples and I think there's a

00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,950
lot of failures and thank mostly what I

00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:48,230
see as failures and we should be

00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:51,110
crushing the proprietary competition

00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:54,760
right in the space in the user space so

00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:58,760
why has open-source failed in this area

00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:01,010
and was it failed in the in the user

00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:03,080
space so to speak and I think that the

00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:04,610
fundamental problem comes down to that

00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,710
open source is not being good at

00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:11,000
scratching other people's itches right

00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:12,830
so in this situation we have a user it

00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,210
has a problem and you having developers

00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:16,370
that are trying to solve it in the open

00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:19,400
source world we've pretty much put the

00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:21,380
user at the end of the line and the the

00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,360
developers are trying to guess what they

00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:25,730
need and they're developing towards that

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,140
the developer is no longer internal to

00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:29,300
the problem space and doesn't have that

00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:31,630
that same nuanced understanding of what

00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:35,840
the problem is so there's kind of been a

00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:37,400
breakage here and that developer the

00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,650
open source developer the core solution

00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,630
provider and all open source projects

00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:43,070
pretty much and if you doubt that just

00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:45,020
look at the language that's used in open

00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:47,360
source you know the word contribution is

00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:50,180
made what do people mean right they mean

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,520
a contribution to a codebase you look

00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:55,400
through any forums you can see people

00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:57,020
talking about coders and non coders

00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,910
right there's not even a language for

00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:00,490
people who

00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:04,210
and a nuanced language for people who

00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:06,370
aren't coders and so we sort of we've

00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:08,170
sort of failed would push the user out

00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:09,370
and that makes sense if developers the

00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:10,870
developer in their own tools because

00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:12,940
there are their own users that make

00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:14,980
sense but when it becomes developers

00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:17,740
solving problems for other people it

00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:20,400
becomes a real problem right because the

00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:23,470
user in this case and I'd like to re

00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:25,180
categorize or reclass the user is not a

00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:27,100
user right a user is somebody sort of

00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:29,590
hangs on to the goodwill of developers

00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:31,990
and sips what they're given and uses it

00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:33,670
right consumes it but the user shouldn't

00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:35,890
be thought of them this way the user is

00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:37,840
actually a use case specialist they the

00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:39,190
expert of the problem they are internal

00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,140
to the problem and they're incredibly

00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:43,240
valuable to you when you're developing

00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:44,200
open source products they shouldn't be

00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,450
somebody that you're trying to

00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,880
second-guess they should be core to the

00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:51,670
solution model right right in there and

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:55,570
at the beginning and helping you design

00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:58,480
the solution so if we want to scratch

00:11:55,570 --> 00:12:01,270
some announces it the user must be

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:05,680
central to designing the problem at the

00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:07,450
solution is my opinion so there's a very

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,370
simple takeaway from this and this is

00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:11,950
generally where I was kind of finished

00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:15,040
the talk because open sources are hard

00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:18,160
beef to change right it's a calcified

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,890
culture and you have to be very careful

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,210
I brought I've done this kind of

00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:24,400
presented this kind of idea in various

00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:26,820
open source forums and pretty much got

00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:29,740
you know burnt at the stake as a heretic

00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:31,120
because you're challenging the status of

00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,650
the developer right it's been the

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,270
primary solutions provider and it's not

00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:37,110
something that open-source culture is

00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:40,330
comfortable with generally speaking

00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:43,870
open-source people have most of most of

00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:45,790
the the same and open source projects

00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:47,770
and everybody else comes after and they

00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:49,510
find it find a way to work including

00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:51,400
using all the all the software

00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:52,780
developments tool chains etc even though

00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,870
they might not be comfortable with them

00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:58,990
right so there's a is an established

00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:01,360
legacy dynamic and so trying to improve

00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:02,920
upon this is very hard it's not about

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,339
changing workflows it's about changing

00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:08,200
culture so what I'm trying to do is

00:13:06,339 --> 00:13:10,630
change the way that I've sent this idea

00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,470
away from saying okay well everything's

00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:13,960
got to change you know

00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:15,610
and just say if you can if you have an

00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,140
open-source project or about to embark

00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:19,420
on one if you could if you could think

00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:21,940
about these two principles if you're

00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:23,710
producing user-facing solutions you

00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,450
would do a lot better in my opinion the

00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:27,010
solution will be a lot better and you

00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:29,350
can be guaranteed that it's going to use

00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:32,020
from the get-go it's basically design

00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:33,900
first and design with the user right the

00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:36,580
user as a use case specialist is

00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:38,740
critically important so sit down with

00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:40,390
the people who have the problem work

00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:42,670
with them to work out what the solution

00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:46,780
is and then work towards that solution

00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:48,550
and build it so the reason why I used to

00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:50,680
start this talk of only done a couple

00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:53,170
times ICS say but as I'm thought through

00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,000
it a number of times and it's just you

00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:56,380
know say okay well the cabbage stream is

00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,150
it which is the method that the

00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:00,640
collaborative knowledge foundation has

00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:02,980
evolved design is the way to do this but

00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:05,470
it's not these two principles I think of

00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:06,730
the guiding principles and they can

00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,680
point to a whole lot of different

00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:10,120
pathways to get there right so you could

00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,430
just start if you have an existing

00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,170
project sitting down with users bringing

00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:16,030
them in and saying okay how would you

00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:19,060
design the solution how you know what is

00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:21,250
it that you need but I do want to talk

00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:23,980
since I have a few minutes very briefly

00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:26,590
about an example of how to do this and

00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:28,570
this is the cabbage stream user I think

00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:31,480
I've got five minutes or so ten minutes

00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:32,830
well cool there's a cabbage tree method

00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,750
and you're welcome to one of these books

00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:38,770
should you wish you want them and I've

00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:41,140
got some stickers also and the chemistry

00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:44,800
method chemistry by the way as a there's

00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:46,930
got nothing to do with the methodology a

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,400
chemistry is just a tree in New Zealand

00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:50,530
I have a house in New Zealand and it's

00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,420
on Cabbage Tree Road and people told me

00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:55,990
collaborative product development was a

00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:58,870
really boring name so so that's why it's

00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:00,430
called this and and also by the way

00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:03,070
methodologies in case anyone's wondering

00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:05,110
is just something somebody's made up

00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:07,240
right this is another important point

00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:08,770
that you should experiment in them in

00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:12,550
trying to develop the methodology that

00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:14,950
best suits you to get you towards better

00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:16,450
products you know if you would adhere to

00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:18,540
these two principles design persons of

00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:20,620
signs the user don't take anyone's

00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,910
blueprint on how to do it sit down and

00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,410
work it out for yourself because every

00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:24,760
culture every production culture is

00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:25,190
different and you've got to work out how

00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,470
you can

00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:30,260
right on this that best suits your your

00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:31,400
culture your project anyway so the

00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:33,740
cabbage tree method we had the

00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,540
opportunity with with cocoa

00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:37,220
collaborative knowledge foundation to

00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:39,950
design a methodology from the beginning

00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:41,210
for developing products the first

00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:43,180
product was with University of

00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:45,590
California Press where we developed a

00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:47,570
monograph production platform rank book

00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:50,660
production platform largely before open

00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:52,220
access works so we thought ok so how we

00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,660
going to do this right we could design a

00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:56,150
platform and give it to them see there

00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:58,760
you go you know you can praise us now or

00:15:56,150 --> 00:16:00,740
we might sit down with them and work out

00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,540
what they want with them but in a way

00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,280
which is sensitive more sensitive to

00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:06,530
open-source culture right not treating

00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:08,510
the user as an avatar not researching

00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:10,220
them you know not water foolish not

00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:12,560
spending three months running

00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:14,420
requirement documents stuff that it felt

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,370
good to us that felt like we wanted to

00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,470
do so we had this opportunity to design

00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:20,570
that process

00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:22,880
so before I start out I just wanna say

00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:25,300
the Capucine method is a method

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,170
documented here methods are not

00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:29,300
religions they're just guides

00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:30,590
navigational instruments but this

00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,570
particular one is good for building

00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:33,950
platforms working with organizations

00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:35,930
that have worked through problems right

00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:38,540
so this is this is category where I see

00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:40,910
it fitting so you can take that for what

00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:44,000
it what you wish but haven't I said

00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:46,820
outside of that realm yet it's also it's

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,830
a strongly facilitated method right so I

00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:50,960
developed this methodology cookbook

00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:53,570
sprints where you facilitate a group of

00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:55,700
people through the process of writing a

00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:57,800
book in three to five days and I proved

00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:01,010
that I understood come to understand

00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:02,960
that these processes need guides right

00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:04,939
production orientated processes and

00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:07,520
community processes need guidance and

00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:09,890
might in my opinion and so I and I think

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,360
we should be seeing the evolution of the

00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:13,339
facilitator with an open source

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,959
facilitative leadership rather than the

00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:16,699
sort of benevolent dictator model which

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,829
is you know someone starts a project

00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:20,959
they're there forever and whatever they

00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:23,810
say goes even if it's crazy

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:26,480
and I think facilitated leadership is a

00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:28,040
very interesting idea and it's an idea

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,990
about how you would facilitate

00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:32,060
communities and all their operational

00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:34,550
parts to build the solution together and

00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:36,740
to be a healthy community but we

00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:38,840
practice facilitated design right where

00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:42,200
we actually literally facilitate

00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:45,680
the use case specialist to design their

00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:47,630
own software right so and this is

00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,760
against a lot of open source but also

00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:52,460
just general software principles right

00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,920
there's this sort of sometimes unspoken

00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:56,330
sometimes loudly spoken mantra that you

00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,700
know users don't know what they want and

00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:59,960
we say no that's crazy talk right users

00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:02,270
know exactly what they want they're not

00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,130
users the use case specialists and you

00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:07,130
should listen to them and so we

00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:09,980
facilitate these people to design their

00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:12,650
own products and this is pictures of use

00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:15,070
case specialist literally designing

00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:17,270
their own products and these are all

00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:19,690
publishing staff this is not software

00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:22,370
developers right all systems designers

00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:24,560
so I just walk you through how we do

00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:26,270
this first of all we have a facilitated

00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:28,940
session which is the first session where

00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:30,890
we come up with a this light bulb at the

00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:32,990
top which is the big idea right we do

00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:34,820
this in one session and we talk about

00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:37,220
you know where are you now what are your

00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:40,040
kind of problems and then together we

00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:43,610
reimagine solution and that actually

00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:45,080
might even materialize is kind of you

00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:46,550
know high-level what you might call

00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,830
system architecture it doesn't really

00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:50,540
architects just like drawing of you know

00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:53,000
we want this and then we want this and

00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:57,110
we want this and then we go through

00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,850
iterative design cycles where we say

00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:00,980
okay that's the big picture we'll think

00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:03,350
about that we'll come back we take up a

00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:05,510
slice we sit down and we facilitate them

00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:07,700
again through a process where they're

00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:09,500
then design this software that's leather

00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,780
or the software and they say this is

00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:14,360
what we want and then we we go away and

00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:16,640
we build it with UX specialists and co

00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,200
specialists then we bring it back and

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,310
say is that what you want they say just

00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,720
known and then they design the next

00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:23,870
thing we iterate and iterate until we

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,680
get to the hand this is a particular foe

00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:26,660
for the collaborative knowledge

00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,790
foundation we have these what we call

00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:31,100
design sessions we facilitate with the

00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:34,670
users with the use case specialists a

00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:36,650
very brief brief comes out of that we

00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:38,630
then have a design meeting with the code

00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:39,890
specialists and UX specialists some

00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:41,420
things are really locked down some

00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:44,840
things open-ended and we talk those

00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:46,760
through we update the brief the code

00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:49,610
specialists and generally start coding

00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:51,050
straightaway do a special is can update

00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:52,530
marks and then head them to the brief

00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:54,870
and we just keep going

00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:57,930
things very conversationally based it's

00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:59,520
not really like lockdown highly managed

00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:01,980
development processes because that's

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:05,430
generally speaking not so comfy for

00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:08,040
open-source cultures in going from the

00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:09,750
design session to the final brief and

00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,580
everyone starting workers no more than a

00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,810
week and has to happen immediately after

00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,940
the design session that would go through

00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:16,350
this right and then the the iterative

00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,270
cycles when we do the build and come

00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:20,370
back is like you know it can be

00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:22,980
something about two weeks to six weeks a

00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:24,660
month here's an example Kate and Cindy

00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,240
from University of California Press

00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:29,970
to production editors designing their

00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:32,130
own software Cindy has got a whiteboard

00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:33,900
mapper on a hand in the hand and on the

00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:37,320
right is a whiteboard and she's drawing

00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:40,260
this which you probably don't understand

00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:41,820
but this came out of conversation you

00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:43,470
can basically see that there's a kind of

00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:45,450
a drop-down menu here there's edit

00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:49,260
buttons is sort of status as a styling

00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:52,200
editing review and something else I

00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:54,480
don't I clean up so we took this out of

00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,160
one session they literally drew this

00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,750
themselves I really sit them at one

00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,010
point you know we talked about a lot of

00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:01,500
issues and said well what would you like

00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:03,540
to do what do you want they said okay

00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:06,390
well and they drew it up there was right

00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:08,250
we then synthesized this I did this that

00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,870
same day or the next day on a piece of

00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:12,450
paper I said I think this is what they

00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:14,160
want from looking at the whiteboard it's

00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:15,630
all the same elements and from the

00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,870
conversation I knew what they were

00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:22,380
thinking so just drew this up sent it to

00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:24,000
the UX person they they mocked this up

00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,620
which you can't really see but it looks

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,750
morally to think it's just a cleaner

00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:29,220
version and this is the working code

00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:31,440
right that's literally what we've built

00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:33,780
for them so this is a book builder

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,520
component and and you can see each of

00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:37,200
these individual things here is that one

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,420
little component that they designed and

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,940
so they are literally designing their

00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:43,530
own software right and then this is just

00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:45,570
the next thing that they've designed

00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:48,870
which is am an editor that we're just

00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:51,240
about to implement so that's it that's

00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:54,210
all I wanted to say yeah and that's

00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,680
chemistry method but the design first

00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:56,850
design with the users the thing I'm

00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,950
trying to communicate and there's a lot

00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:00,630
of history behind that of course users

00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:02,970
seem to design all this but my point is

00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:04,740
that your project needs to develop its

00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:05,830
own ways of doing this right don't

00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,450
follow established me

00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:08,740
Dola geez but finding the right paths

00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:11,289
for you that's the starting point

00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:12,549
because you can't deconstruct your your

00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:15,940
current culture and then suddenly like

00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:17,559
throw this new methodology on top of it

00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:19,330
you have to iterate towards something

00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:20,559
that makes sense to you if you are

00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:21,669
starting your own project you're in a

00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,200
better place you can actually

00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:26,440
intentionally design it which is pretty

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,490
interesting but if you wish to go down

00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,080
you know you're working with

00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:32,519
organizations you need to work through

00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:34,960
workflows or maybe you developing and

00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:36,730
Syrians or something like this this is

00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,649
the kind of platform that I think the

00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:41,110
chemistry method could be useful for

00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:43,600
anyway so I have a book here it's

00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:45,090
written collaboratively that this way

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,350
doesn't have my name on it but it's got

00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:49,630
pretty much everything we've learned so

00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:51,610
far in here and we'll be iterating on

00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:55,659
this and also you can get it for free

00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:58,269
online we use completely we use the

00:22:55,659 --> 00:23:01,059
system that we we design the cabbage

00:22:58,269 --> 00:23:03,130
tree method to help build editorial

00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:05,440
which is monograph production system we

00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:08,260
then use editorial to produce the book

00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,960
on the cabbage tree method and so this

00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:12,610
is a and the source file format is HTML

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,559
and this is using vibrio style open

00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:17,799
source JavaScript library to render that

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:21,070
HTML into an online book so you can see

00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:22,960
the book here and this is all paginate

00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:25,450
it like a book in the browser or HTML

00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,399
open source and then that created the

00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:28,419
PDF from which we printed the books it's

00:23:27,399 --> 00:23:30,880
just a little Side Story

00:23:28,419 --> 00:23:33,020
anyway that's dog feeding right round

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:36,450
around okay thank you

00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:36,450
[Applause]

00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:40,569
you

00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,569
