00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:14,429
hi everyone my name is will

00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:16,859
I'm a software developer at Nia 4j near

00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:18,570
for J is a graph database how many

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,029
people are familiar with with near for J

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:27,090
or graph databases in general okay say

00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:30,240
maybe like forty percent so I I work on

00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:32,120
the developer relations team which means

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,890
I build a lot of integrations so

00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:37,860
building tools to make sure you can use

00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:40,649
neo4j with other frameworks things like

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:44,090
that and then I also run what we call

00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:47,640
our data journalism accelerator program

00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:51,180
so we we noticed this more and more

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,910
interest in using graph databases for

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:56,550
data journalism and we wanted to make

00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,079
sure that there were resources for

00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,980
journalists getting started with neo4j

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:04,500
so we have this program that basically

00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:06,240
we sort of work with a few projects at a

00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,909
time to make sure that they can be

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,260
successful with with near 4je if that's

00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:14,310
data modeling import querying

00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:17,610
visualization sort of all of the things

00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:21,150
that you need to draw insights from from

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,920
data for journalism stories and so what

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,979
I'm going to talk about today are a

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:29,520
couple of data sets related to data

00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:32,460
journalism that folks are using neo4j

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,310
with specifically the the Trump world

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:37,409
one and then and then we'll see another

00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:39,600
in a second here so these are the two

00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:41,729
data sets we're going to talk about the

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,950
Panama papers we'll just mention and

00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:48,500
sort of briefly and then we'll dive into

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,500
what we're calling the Trump world graph

00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:53,040
so first of all for for the the sixty

00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,240
percent of you that didn't raise your

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,409
hand when I asked if you're familiar

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,909
with with graph databases or neo4j

00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:02,460
let's talk about what is a graph

00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:05,579
database and you know I thought the the

00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:10,110
most concise way that I could explain

00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:13,780
this is course in 140 characters so this

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:15,700
is near for J and 140 characters

00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,739
you know jay is an open source it opens

00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:21,159
our software that stores and queries

00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:23,439
data as nodes and relationships using

00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:27,280
the cypher query language with index

00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:29,650
free adjacency so that's 140 characters

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,379
but there's a lot in there so let's

00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:34,900
break that down a little bit so open

00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:36,939
source software you know for J's an open

00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,439
source project you can can download it

00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:42,400
get started you can build it on source

00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:44,319
the code is on github so the software

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,079
that stores and queries data so

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:53,500
primarily a database you know focus on

00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:55,180
on durability and the the key point I

00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:58,239
want to get across here is that it not

00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:00,430
only stores your data like most

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,069
databases do but also provide a

00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:06,280
mechanism for acquiring your data as a

00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:10,120
graph so let's define what we're talking

00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,790
about when we say graph so so with a

00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:17,319
graph data model we're talking about

00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:20,049
nodes and edges so in this in this data

00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:24,040
model here on the right you can see we

00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:26,889
have officer nodes that are connected to

00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:30,040
legal entities they're either a director

00:03:26,889 --> 00:03:31,540
or shareholder of some legal entity we

00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,659
can see the intermediary which is the

00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:37,510
law firm that created this legal entity

00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:40,750
and we can see that they have address

00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:45,220
nodes so this is the the graph data

00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:47,889
model that actually the I CIJ used to

00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:51,099
model this leaked data from a Panamanian

00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:53,650
law firm that became known as the Panama

00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:58,060
papers is everyone familiar with the

00:03:53,650 --> 00:04:01,359
Panama papers so this Panama papers was

00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:04,689
a huge data leak from a Panamanian law

00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:07,870
firm that you know lots and lots of

00:04:04,689 --> 00:04:12,189
famous and influential people we're sort

00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:13,720
of caught up in this leaked data in show

00:04:12,189 --> 00:04:16,329
that they actually did have have

00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:20,169
offshore companies that were tied to

00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:22,870
them so that's the data model and then

00:04:20,169 --> 00:04:26,830
we need some query language

00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:29,800
to query our graph and near 4j we use a

00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:32,260
language called cipher or open cipher

00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,570
this is an open source language so there

00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,669
are other other database projects to

00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:39,340
implement it as well

00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:42,070
let's cipher you can think of as equal

00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:45,060
but for graphs as anyone written a

00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:48,220
cipher query few folks cool

00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:50,979
so cipher is all about pattern matching

00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:53,979
so you can see on that first line we're

00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:56,949
describing a graph pattern that we're

00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:59,260
searching for in the graph so we define

00:04:56,949 --> 00:05:01,150
nodes within parentheses so you can see

00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:03,940
we have address nodes officer knows

00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:06,039
entity nodes and then relationships are

00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:09,280
within brackets so here we're looking

00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:13,030
for officers these are these are people

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:15,729
that have some address and that are

00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:19,389
connected to entities so these are the

00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:22,720
legal entities and we can filter on that

00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:25,090
where we're address contains Portland so

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,240
those first two lines they find Paz in

00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:31,870
the graph where we have officers with an

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:35,070
address in Portland and now find the

00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:37,389
legal entities that they're connected to

00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:39,940
and then in the return Clause we're

00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:41,650
doing doing a group by and then an

00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:44,099
aggregation to count the number of paths

00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:46,990
and what we wind up what we end up with

00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:49,810
is the answer to the question for every

00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:52,210
one with an address in Portland what are

00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:55,330
the jurisdictions of the offshore

00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:57,580
entities that they're connected to so in

00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,919
Portland the the British Virgin Islands

00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:02,380
is the most common offshore entity

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,789
followed by the Cook Islands and you can

00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:05,410
see by the counts there we don't have

00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:07,570
that many people that have offshore

00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:11,020
entities that were found in the Panama

00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:13,780
papers data set and and largely you know

00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:16,389
most of the people caught up in this

00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:18,550
data set we're in wearing Europe because

00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:21,639
of offshore laws it doesn't make a lot

00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:23,440
of sense to use Panama as the registry

00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:26,099
for that but you still have some some

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,690
people with addresses in the US at least

00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:31,390
anyway it does must be an example of

00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:34,110
cypher to give you an idea of what it

00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:36,660
looks like and then the other piece here

00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:40,800
is with graph databases we have this

00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:43,350
concept of index free adjacency and what

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,360
this means is just that as we traverse

00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:47,610
the graph as we go from one node to

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,070
another that they're connected to we do

00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:51,900
this without having so do an index

00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:54,690
lookups so we have a constant time

00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:56,610
performance of graph traversal which

00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:58,620
means that our queries can scale to very

00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:03,090
very large data sets and still have the

00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:05,130
same performance characteristics ok so

00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:07,440
that was sort of an overview of graph

00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:11,310
databases so we're all on the same page

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:17,040
so let's talk about the Trump world data

00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:18,750
set so what is this well I think it's an

00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:22,200
interesting it's an interesting last

00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:26,040
year or so in in data journalism you

00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:28,410
know since since Trump was seen as a

00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:32,400
serious candidate I think a lot of

00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:34,800
journalists realized that this has vast

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,080
sort of business connections are very

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,570
different than lots of other

00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:42,480
presidential candidates and so the the

00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:44,250
ways that they sort of report on these

00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:47,700
kind of things in the past is very

00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:49,890
different with with Trump and if you

00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:54,390
look at his financial disclosure

00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:55,830
document which is sort of the starting

00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:59,670
point for a lot of these types of

00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:02,930
integrate investigations to find you

00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:06,060
know connections to his assets and

00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:08,370
business connections you can see there

00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,960
there are hundreds of LLC's and

00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:11,490
corporations in there LLC's and

00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:15,210
corporations that have fractional

00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:16,980
ownership in each other and so on and so

00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:18,960
if you look at sort of the the tools

00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:21,000
that journalists need to use to make

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,610
sense of this data both for their

00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,150
investigations internally and also to

00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:30,080
present this data to their readers a

00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:34,500
very common data structure that's used

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:37,350
is the graph and we've seen this a great

00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:40,740
example is little sis so little sis

00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:42,690
collects crowd-sourced data anyone can

00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,370
upload information about

00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:46,740
usually influential people and their

00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:49,470
connections they do a great job of

00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:52,830
modeling and presenting this data as a

00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:54,960
graph we've also seen lots of lots of

00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:57,600
other research you know across lots of

00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:59,700
different publications as a way of using

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,860
a graph to explain these types of

00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,170
connections but it's important to

00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:07,320
realize that we can also instead of just

00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:09,660
using these types of visualizations to

00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:13,890
present information to readers that we

00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:17,010
can also as journalists store model and

00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:20,450
query our data as a graph at scale as

00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:25,050
well to work with work with public data

00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:28,160
so earlier this year Frederick and

00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:30,750
Bastian Obermeyer so these are two

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:33,870
German journalists that's to go to

00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:37,200
slicin they wrote this this opinion

00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:38,880
piece in The Guardian talking about sort

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,450
of the reason that the data

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:45,330
investigation for Panama papers worked

00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:47,580
and the in their eyes the reason that

00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:50,460
this worked was because of collaboration

00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:52,740
so Frederick in Bastian maybe they were

00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:54,630
the original journalists to receive the

00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:58,590
leaked data from Panama papers directly

00:09:54,630 --> 00:10:00,240
from the source and rather than working

00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:02,220
with the data themselves and trying to

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:06,650
keep it to report on an investigate

00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:08,250
themselves they went to the IC IJ to the

00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:10,500
international consortium of

00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:13,050
investigative journalists which is

00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,090
basically a network of over 300

00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:16,740
journalists that collaborate so they

00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:18,720
took the data to the IC IJ because they

00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:21,900
realized that to get the most value out

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,520
of this data we need to share this we

00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:27,390
need we need a large team to work

00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:31,290
together and what I see I J ultimately

00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:33,660
ended up building was a tool that

00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:37,350
modeled the data in the Panama papers

00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:39,780
leak as a graph in year four J and they

00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:43,470
built this sort of search engine on top

00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:46,460
of it so the journalist could search the

00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:48,980
data set for people

00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:51,290
in their areas that whether it's there

00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:53,420
their geographic area that they're

00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:56,690
interested in covering and search the

00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:59,660
data as a graph and here we can see an

00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:02,210
example so in in the bottom in the

00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:06,080
middle there that is the former prime

00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:07,910
minister of Iceland goon Laughlin and i

00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:10,160
say former because he was forced to

00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:12,800
resign when the information in this

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:17,510
visualization came to light and that's

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:20,210
the fact that he has an interest in an

00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:23,000
offshore company that he did not report

00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:25,520
and the reason this this was discovered

00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,740
you can see the other person note at the

00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:30,410
top of this visualization that's his

00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:32,660
wife who also has an interest in this

00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:34,130
offshore company winters and this was

00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:37,610
discovered because they have a shared

00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:38,960
address so so off to the right that's

00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:41,450
their address that they have in common

00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:44,270
and so the journals are able to see oh

00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:46,490
there's this connection to the prime

00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:48,560
minister to someone but they share the

00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:50,240
same address i wonder if they have other

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,460
connections oh that's his wife and

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,200
digging into the documents further saw

00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:57,260
that oh well he should he sold his

00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:59,150
interest in this company to his wife for

00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:01,190
$1 and didn't early report that and

00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:03,950
ultimately had to resign so this is just

00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:05,870
just one example of the kinds of

00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:12,130
insights you can get from this type of

00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:16,270
data when you look at it as a graph so

00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:19,010
so meanwhile you know we've seen lots of

00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:20,570
journalists working to sort of make

00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:23,270
sense of the public data that's out

00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:25,670
there around Trump starting with the

00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:28,670
financial disclosure documents and sort

00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:31,790
of digging into other areas as well but

00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:34,330
there wasn't anything like the ICA J and

00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:37,810
Panama papers sort of sharing data

00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:41,840
across groups publicly

00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:44,980
Intel BuzzFeed published what they

00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:47,780
called Trump world and this was their

00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:51,140
dataset that they had used internally to

00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:52,830
keep track of connections around the

00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:55,890
Trump administration

00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:58,620
so people took companies and and

00:12:55,890 --> 00:13:01,620
people-to-people connections as well and

00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:04,230
they they release this to the public in

00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:06,209
this blog post that said hey here's the

00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:09,329
data that we have please let us know

00:13:06,209 --> 00:13:11,760
what are we missing please please help

00:13:09,329 --> 00:13:15,420
us fill this in and they very quickly

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:17,760
had you know I think they sort of

00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:20,430
tripled the size of their data set from

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:24,690
from other people submitting things in

00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:27,269
just a couple of days and one of my

00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:30,209
co-workers wrote this blog post about

00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:32,279
how you can import this data into tenir

00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:36,200
for J to model this is a graph so you

00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:38,670
can do things like see clusters around

00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,529
some of the cabinet members what

00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:41,670
companies are they connected to what

00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:43,399
companies are they connected to in

00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:45,570
common these kind of things

00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:47,220
and I should say this is the format that

00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:49,519
the BuzzFeed originally released the

00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:52,649
data this is just a Google spreadsheet

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:55,550
which we can easily export to CSV to

00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:59,130
import into lots of different things and

00:13:55,550 --> 00:14:02,790
when when we publish this blog post we

00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:06,060
got a lot of journalists came to us and

00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:07,740
said hey this is great you know we want

00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:10,560
to work with this but we have this other

00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:12,779
data set can you help us sort of merge

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,190
these or can you make this publicly

00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:16,950
available in a way that you know I don't

00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:21,000
have to you know go through the import

00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:22,950
process in India for J and my team was

00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,500
working on another project at the same

00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:28,290
time that we called near forge a sandbox

00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:31,170
and so the idea with near forge a

00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:34,140
sandbox is we wanted a way to be able to

00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:37,079
allow anyone to spin up an ear for J

00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:39,480
instance with a data set already loaded

00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:42,449
and with a way to sort of share queries

00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,940
and visualizations and so we had sort of

00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:47,579
an alpha version of this and we thought

00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:50,070
well people are very interested in this

00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:55,459
data set you know let's make this one of

00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:59,190
the the sandbox examples which we did so

00:14:55,459 --> 00:15:02,100
I'll give you an example of the sandbox

00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:04,840
so here and you can you can go to near

00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,490
40 comm slash sandbox

00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,080
and just sign in with Twitter and then

00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:12,040
you're presented with these different

00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:14,740
use cases and I'm going to spin up the

00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:18,270
Trump world sandbox so what this is

00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:22,000
doing is its spinning up an AWS instance

00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:25,150
and loading it with initially the data

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,750
from from BuzzFeed so we import directly

00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:33,150
from the Google spreadsheet and then we

00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:36,820
give the user access to to this one

00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:41,200
neo4j instance so this is private just

00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:44,560
to that user and we can jump into near

00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:46,660
4j and here's an example of what what

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,100
near for day looks like this is near for

00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:54,070
J browser which is like a query

00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:55,630
workbench for near for J and we have the

00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:58,390
fonts a little small but we have lots of

00:15:55,630 --> 00:16:01,210
different sort of guides that we can

00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:03,460
walk through to explore the data so

00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:06,370
let's let's skip here and just look at a

00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:09,010
couple of interesting queries that we

00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:11,620
can run to try to give you give us an

00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:14,410
idea of what this data looks like so

00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:18,520
here's here's the query you might want

00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:21,340
to run this is two degrees of Jared

00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:23,410
Kushner I want to change this to Joshua

00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:25,690
Kushner because Jared end up being very

00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:29,380
connected so this essentially says find

00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:31,450
Joshua Kushner finds the person node

00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:34,900
that represents Joshua Kushner and then

00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:36,640
traversed out two levels deep and show

00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:39,250
me everything that you find so find all

00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:43,510
of the the people and companies that are

00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:46,930
within two hops of Joshua Kushner and if

00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:49,210
we look at this well we can see ok

00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:51,100
here's Joshua Kushner he's on the board

00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:53,560
of a lot of companies he's invest in a

00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:55,720
lot of company so he's the founder of of

00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,520
this VC fund thrive capital which

00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,610
invests in a lot of startups we can see

00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:03,040
all of the startups like github and

00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:06,280
mapbox that thrive capital has invested

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:08,680
in Peter Thiel is here Peter Thiel's an

00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:10,090
investor in thrive capital as well as

00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:12,010
directly connected to Donald Trump

00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:15,459
because he had some role in his

00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:17,650
and his transition team so you can see

00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:20,260
this is the this is the type of data

00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:22,300
that we have here we can use New York a

00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:26,260
browser and graphical ization sort of

00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:29,470
explore this data we can also do things

00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:31,330
I think are interesting to give you an

00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:34,090
idea of just sort of the connections in

00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:36,220
the data is look for shortest paths

00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:38,410
between two people or between two

00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:42,370
companies so what's the shortest path

00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:46,230
from Vladimir Putin to Donald Trump is

00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:50,860
in this data set and it turns out to be

00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:53,110
not a very long path so you can see that

00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:55,780
Donald Trump is connected direct to

00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:57,940
Larssen who's the Secretary of State who

00:17:55,780 --> 00:18:00,520
has some connection to Vladimir Putin

00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:02,350
and by the way we can we can inspect any

00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:05,530
of these relationships and we can see

00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:07,030
the source document for for this

00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:11,200
relationship that comes from the

00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:12,840
BuzzFeed data set so we have two

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:18,060
connections that are just two degrees

00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:18,060
from from Donald Trump to Vladimir Putin

00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:25,120
so that's sort of an example of the type

00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:26,500
of things we can look at I'll I'll share

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,900
these slides later lots of lots of these

00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:31,720
queries are in here but one thing I want

00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:34,090
to talk about before we before we break

00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:37,810
here is just this this idea of data

00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:41,290
fusion so being able to model and query

00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:42,820
your data I know the graph is helpful

00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:45,220
and I think a graph is a very intuitive

00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:48,070
data model Seifer is very expressive

00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:50,080
that's nice but really one of the the

00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:53,160
big powers of using graphs and data

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:56,890
journalism is this idea of data fusion

00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:59,970
so a graph is a very flexible data model

00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:03,550
that allows us to very easily combine

00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:06,130
data sets so one of the one of the

00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:08,320
things that someone in our journalism

00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:11,800
accelerator program was interested in

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:14,860
looking at were data on federal

00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:17,560
contracts so are there any vendors of

00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:19,750
federal contracts that show up in the

00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:23,200
Trump world data set so companies that

00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:23,600
are receiving federal contracts that may

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,020
have

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,640
of say a board member or an investor who

00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:31,630
may be related to the administration

00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:36,500
this is potentially interesting

00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:40,000
information so so what we did is we we

00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:42,590
loaded this data into engineer for

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,020
jae-in in the sandbox there's sort of an

00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:48,140
example that shows how we can can pull

00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:50,000
in the CSV file for all government

00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:52,100
contracts we search the Trump world

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,340
dataset to see if there are any sort of

00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:58,429
vendors in there and then we extend the

00:19:55,340 --> 00:20:03,260
data model a bit so here's just one

00:19:58,429 --> 00:20:06,440
example from a specific contract so

00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:09,710
here's here's the the contract so we

00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:11,330
have a contract node that we add so the

00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:13,820
specific contract was issued by the

00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:17,690
federal prison system and if we

00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:19,659
inspected it it's for lease of prison

00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:22,220
space essentially private prison

00:20:19,659 --> 00:20:25,909
contract that was awarded to the

00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:28,610
Merchandise Mart properties company well

00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:32,840
it turns out this is this is a

00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:35,090
subsidiary of for NATO Realty trust that

00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,770
is an investor in the Kushner companies

00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:38,299
so there's some connection to Jared

00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:40,970
Kushner who's the CEO of Kushner

00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:45,320
companies or was at least and then we

00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:48,350
can see well the chairman of Vornado is

00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:51,230
an advisor to Donald Trump and we can

00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:53,270
also see that the CEO of ver Nadeau made

00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:56,150
campaign finance donations to Donald

00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:58,250
Trump as well and you know it's also

00:20:56,150 --> 00:21:00,860
interesting to note that sums Trump was

00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:03,470
elected shares and private prison stock

00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:05,780
have gone up significantly I'm sort of

00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,860
the belief that it's going to be the

00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:09,260
Trump administration is going to be

00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:11,299
beneficial for the private prison system

00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:14,539
so it's this this type of data that I

00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:16,370
think is useful to sort of dig into to

00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:18,020
see you know are there potential

00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:20,210
conflicts of interest here

00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:22,970
and these kinds of things so this is

00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:25,250
this is just one simple example digging

00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:27,470
into this we can also see you know the

00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:30,240
the contract that was awarded by the

00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:32,190
Secret Service to

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,110
so one of the the Trump real-estate

00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:36,030
companies for the lease of space and

00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:41,720
Trump Towers to maintain an office there

00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:44,820
and so on we we've worked a lot on

00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:46,500
importing other datasets as well so

00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:49,920
things like open corporates which is a

00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:53,220
corporate registry things like little

00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:54,870
sis which I mentioned earlier and all

00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:57,660
this is on github so there's scripts

00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:59,880
sort of import all of these data which

00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:01,650
are are very interesting when you are

00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,510
able to query across them there are lots

00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:07,740
of nonprofits and Trump world so we

00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:09,990
import some of the 990 data as well so

00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:13,440
the key takeaway I want to leave you

00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:16,200
with is just sort of that there are two

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:20,130
benefits for using graphs databases for

00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:21,900
open data one is you know the data model

00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:23,910
is very intuitive modeling data as a

00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:26,370
graph makes a lot of sense because

00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:28,230
that's how we we think of the data and

00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:30,420
then we have this nice query language we

00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:32,520
don't have to write sequel joins we just

00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:34,770
sort of draw the graph pattern that

00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:37,380
Debbie want to search for and then the

00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:40,530
other benefit is this idea of data

00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:43,410
fusion and our ability to combine data

00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:45,270
sets I think is really really powerful

00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:47,160
as well when you can combine data sets

00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:48,870
and then query across them to find

00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,850
insights you wouldn't just by by

00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:54,360
inspecting by inspecting one of the data

00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:57,480
sets if you're interested in learning

00:22:54,360 --> 00:23:00,240
more about this there's the near 4j

00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:02,910
sandbox which I mentioned it has also a

00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:06,090
data set on on US Congress and campaign

00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:09,210
finance the Panama papers data set is in

00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:11,190
there there are also some more more sort

00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:12,630
of data science e type things like how

00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:14,970
do you build a recommendation system

00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:17,940
with movie data this kind of stuff so

00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:20,240
I've encourage you to use that as a

00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:23,730
starting point for digging in further

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,470
and with that I think I am just about

00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:30,260
out of time

00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:30,260
two minutes for questions all right yeah

00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:07,470
yeah yes so the the question is

00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:09,270
basically you are there are there

00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:15,960
stories coming out of this data using

00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:19,350
using this approach and there are things

00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:22,230
in the works right so so Panama papers

00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:23,820
is a great example of sort of you know

00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:27,810
stories that have been published using

00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:30,810
this kind of analysis and I mentioned

00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:33,240
the data journalism accelerator program

00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:34,860
that we have there are lots of

00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,310
organizations that we're working with

00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:39,780
that are sort of working towards

00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:43,340
publishing things that that you know

00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:43,340
maybe haven't haven't come out yet

00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:59,990
so with other open source graph

00:24:53,690 --> 00:25:01,700
databases like Jeffy okay okay yeah so

00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:05,750
so a quick comparison between year for J

00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:08,720
and Jessie yeah so so Jessie is a tool

00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:13,250
that's mainly useful for running graph

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:15,169
algorithms and visualization the new for

00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:18,080
J can do those kinds of things as well

00:25:15,169 --> 00:25:21,769
but new for J is primarily a database

00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:24,759
focused on durability and storage of

00:25:21,769 --> 00:25:27,559
your data sits a transactional database

00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:30,889
whereas whereas gap is more useful for

00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:32,750
more complex visualizations not

00:25:30,889 --> 00:25:37,929
necessarily as sort of storing and

00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:37,929
querying your data cool thanks everyone
