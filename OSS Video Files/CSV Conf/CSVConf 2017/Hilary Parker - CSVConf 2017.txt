[Music]

00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:10,410
okay so yeah my name is Hilary Parker um

00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:12,690
and see I have absolute their big horn

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,940
slaughters um so yeah as Karthik's I

00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,920
said I'm a data scientist at Citrix

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,710
currently I've been there about a year

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,720
before that I was at Etsy and I'm

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,359
pointing that out in part because a lot

00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,000
of the theme of this talk I actually am

00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:29,039
borrowing a lot of the kind of cultural

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,560
things I learned from the culture at sea

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,270
in terms of what I'll be talking about I

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,160
also have a podcast called not so

00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:39,450
standard deviations recommend checking

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:41,370
it out cool so yeah like a like any good

00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:45,480
talk I'm going to start with a tweet of

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:47,579
mine from two years ago and so I know

00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,289
that the title of this talk is a little

00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:51,570
confusing and opinionated analysis

00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:53,610
development what does that mean and

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,739
really the idea for this talk started

00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:59,219
about two years a year and a half ago

00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:00,840
November of 2015 and at that point I

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,870
just been through kind of all the summer

00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,790
conferences with are and like

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,220
statistical conferences and I felt like

00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,680
there was a real gap in the way that we

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,670
talk about people writing code and I

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,869
don't know how many people here know

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:18,689
they use our conference yes and so use

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:20,790
our for example is this code I mean the

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:23,040
title makes it sound like it's for using

00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:25,860
our but it's really more about like

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,720
developing our packages I would say and

00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,150
so as you can see this tweet I was like

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:33,299
we really are missing a word for people

00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:35,640
who want to write code like reproducible

00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:37,799
code careful code efficient code for

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,960
doing analysis but not necessarily

00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,780
developing packages if they want to open

00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,729
source and share with a bunch of people

00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:47,820
and so then I said like what about

00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:49,439
analysis developer any other ideas and

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,869
so obviously this is headless talk I

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,890
decide to stick with this but I do want

00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:54,720
to go through what some other people

00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:57,299
were saying and shoot them down here

00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,960
when they're not available so easiest

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:02,460
argument ever so the first one like I

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,820
get this a lot like how is this

00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:07,560
different than a data scientist and so

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,959
in order to answer this I just got one

00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,790
of like the first Google results for

00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,640
what is the data scientists and the

00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:17,099
like this woman who knows all of math

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,489
and statistics and all domain knowledge

00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:22,560
and soft skills so like business schools

00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:25,110
obviously knows how to program like

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,209
database like is essentially the DB

00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,530
admin for her company and then also

00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:31,319
knows how to communicate and visualize

00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:32,760
the data so like all of these are things

00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,590
that you need to know I could have

00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,900
substituted Andrew Conway's you know

00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,909
Venn diagrams hopefully with the unicorn

00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,879
on top of it I want to borrow that in

00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:43,769
the future but obviously like data

00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:45,720
scientists is like such a useless term

00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:47,760
in my opinion it doesn't actually get to

00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,799
any like you can say your job house data

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,120
scientists if you basically have no

00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:53,310
information about what that person

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,109
actually does on a day to day basis so

00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:57,480
it's not a good way to define like this

00:02:55,109 --> 00:03:00,389
very specific subset of what I was

00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,920
talking about and someone else chimed in

00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:05,010
and said what about a reproducible

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,290
researcher and I like this and I think

00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:09,359
reproducibility is something I've cared

00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:12,090
about for a long time it's a good word

00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:13,799
generally but I think there's more than

00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:16,829
just reproducibility with what I'm

00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:18,780
talking about specifically there's you

00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:20,699
know you want to create analyses or the

00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,530
code for analyses that's reproducible

00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:24,449
but there's also a sense of accuracy

00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:26,129
like you want to know that your code is

00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:28,470
accurate and doing what you think it's

00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:30,750
doing there's also a collaborative

00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:32,790
aspect that we never talk about so if

00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,769
you're writing analysis code that you

00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:37,620
want other people to access and possibly

00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:39,329
contribute to like reproducibility that

00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,730
idea kind of falls apart it doesn't

00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:44,040
discuss collaborative pooling at all

00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:46,379
so I thought it was a little bit too

00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:49,859
limited to just call this reproducible

00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:51,660
coding hadley with them then chimed in

00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:54,659
and was like oh what about a data

00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:56,489
analysis engineer and this is a this is

00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:58,739
a divide that we have not been able to

00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:01,079
solve yet so I think of it as like I'm

00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:03,900
Regina George Traynor I'm Gretchen

00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:05,669
trying to make fetch happen and Hadleys

00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:09,209
Regina George like you're not going to

00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:10,829
make that happen so yes I mean but

00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:13,739
really when you come down to it there's

00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:16,109
sort of a tomato tomahto like you have

00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:19,320
software developers of your software

00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:21,060
engineers I think we like to think those

00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,570
is the same person or the same type of

00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,490
person same job title and so

00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:27,680
the same thing like a software developer

00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:29,510
develop software since I wanted

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,050
something like an analysis developer

00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:35,060
develops analysis I personally like

00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:38,060
developer a little better than engineer

00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:41,510
I like the fact that development kind of

00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:43,670
brings this up like it's a word you

00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:45,200
think of it in terms of so this is a

00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:47,570
picture of my cat but I had to like

00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,340
sneak in and this was her as a kitten

00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:51,140
and this was her much-older and I like

00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:53,620
the development like she's developing

00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:55,730
into this you know majestic creature

00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:57,980
similarly you know you develop an

00:04:55,730 --> 00:05:01,790
analysis you get it into a more final

00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:03,560
state and yeah I like I also developed

00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:05,750
as a photographer I'm not quite at

00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:09,200
Maxwell's level yet but I'm trying to

00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:11,240
get there so let me talk about

00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,430
developing an analysis there really are

00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:16,040
two specific components so I think it's

00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:18,140
really important to tease apart the

00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,600
first is developing the narrative of the

00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:22,400
analysis and so that's like the almost

00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,590
waves of scientific argument like what

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,030
point are you trying to make what models

00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:28,100
are you going to use to make that point

00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:29,960
what arguments are you going to make

00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:32,140
like what type of visualizations are you

00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,550
going to make to display those arguments

00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:36,590
and just generally how are you going to

00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:38,180
convince your audience that the thing

00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:39,320
that you're doing is it's like the

00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:42,590
conclusion you made is the right

00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:45,110
conclusion and so it's kind of like I'm

00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:46,760
going to sidestep all of this and say

00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:49,130
okay that's obviously really important

00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:51,470
that's why we train statisticians why we

00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:53,720
train data scientists you could talk

00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:55,280
about this pretty much forever and this

00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,560
is a constantly evolving thing that

00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,270
needs to adapt to the audience but then

00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,270
let me talk about like what I call the

00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:04,010
technical artifact it gets a lot more

00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:05,990
specific where it's like what tools are

00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:08,990
you going to use to make the deliverable

00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:11,000
that's going to tell your narrative what

00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:12,680
technical coding choices are you going

00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,950
to make like are you going to be using

00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,420
like the tidy verse or our Python like

00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:21,410
there's just a bunch of choices you make

00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:22,790
and talking about that is frequently as

00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:27,560
important as talking about the narrative

00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:29,830
aspect and so so that's sort of the why

00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,450
I think this term needs to be there and

00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:34,250
so then I got this tweet from Carl

00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:36,860
broman who's like the sweetest person

00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:38,509
ever and I

00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:42,080
feel guilty that I'm sorry him under the

00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:44,509
bus on this talk but he's saying Oh like

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,860
what about a good analyst I didn't get

00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:47,659
the stuff from him a lot of people are

00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:50,240
like well all these things you described

00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:51,560
of writing accurate reproducible code

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,770
that's just like part of the job

00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:57,500
description of a data analyst and so as

00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:59,479
I said explicit six disclaimer that

00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:02,449
carl's like a really nice guy he'll

00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:05,150
email you with pages of help if you ask

00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:07,159
him for it he's non-judgmental the doc

00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:09,979
being said I took issue with this idea

00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:12,560
of a good analyst because obviously the

00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:14,779
opposite of that is like a bad analyst

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:19,849
right someone who's doing their job

00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:21,560
poorly and that just didn't like sit

00:07:19,849 --> 00:07:23,659
well with me I think like it's like

00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,759
convincing people to do something based

00:07:23,659 --> 00:07:29,960
on like shaming them is almost never a

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:31,279
good idea but I will say one thing as my

00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,919
thoughts on this have evolved a little

00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:35,509
bit since this original tweet which is

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,490
that I was talking specifically about

00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:39,770
the job title and the person here is

00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,529
like analysis developer but I actually

00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:44,569
think it's more important to talk about

00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:48,680
analysis development or this process of

00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:50,509
making this technical artifact and so

00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,940
like I said before calling people a bad

00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:55,099
analyst I think it's just like not a

00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:56,900
helpful not a helpful way of

00:07:55,099 --> 00:08:00,440
communicating that they're not doing

00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:03,319
this effectively and why is that because

00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:06,889
creating analysis is very hard it's very

00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:09,110
error ridden we all know that and it's

00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:11,599
like channeling my Elaine Seinfeld we

00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:14,330
kind of yada-yada it away we talked

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,349
about the we talked about the narrative

00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:17,870
and we talked about the point we're

00:08:15,349 --> 00:08:19,580
making and we kind of hide away all of

00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:22,430
the work we're doing on the code to get

00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:25,909
there and there's a lot of reasons why

00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:27,349
that happens I know from statisticians

00:08:25,909 --> 00:08:29,060
point of view I have a statistical

00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:31,879
background there's this idea that it's

00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:33,229
limiting creativity like you just need

00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:36,019
to do what you need to do to get the job

00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:37,310
done and and then I think frankly

00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:38,750
probably the biggest reason is that a

00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:40,699
lot of people are embarrassed by their

00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,690
analytical code and they don't want to

00:08:40,699 --> 00:08:43,519
share it because they're just

00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:45,620
embarrassed with all their four loops or

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:49,730
whatever it is they don't want people to

00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:50,580
see but as I said before there's really

00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:52,800
there's a

00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:56,880
bunch of common problems when you create

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:59,280
analysis that we all know about and if

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,230
you avoid these common problems it frees

00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,000
up your cognitive space for more

00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,990
creativity so if you're writing code

00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,180
that you know is going to be

00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:07,380
reproducible and you have testament to

00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,510
know that it's error free you're going

00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,280
to have more time to actually think

00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:13,590
about that narrative part which is in

00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:16,560
many ways the more important part from

00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:18,060
like a scientific perspective and so as

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,490
I said we all know these problems I

00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,960
actually went through and made a list of

00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,730
a bunch of the problems and the point of

00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:26,130
the slide is not for you to like look

00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:27,990
through every single one but they're

00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:29,280
things like oh you rerun the analysis

00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,870
and you get different results

00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:33,090
like I think we all know that's an issue

00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:34,680
with reproducibility and there's other

00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:36,600
ones like a second analyst can't

00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,560
understand your code which could be

00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,910
thought of as an error and

00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:43,860
reproducibility you make a mistake

00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:46,380
that's an error with the accuracy of the

00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:48,780
code so if you think that you're you

00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:50,520
know calculating a linear model and

00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,780
you're actually not calculating the

00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,270
linear model results then you're going

00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:56,040
to have problems and so as I said

00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:58,170
remember before I say there is more than

00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,840
reproducibility I think you can kind of

00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:03,590
group all the problems we run into into

00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:08,760
these three areas of reproducibility

00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:10,980
accuracy and collaborative miss so as I

00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,530
said before it's really important to

00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:16,380
define the process of analysis

00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:18,630
development because by defining it like

00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:21,030
by not defining it we're doing a

00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:22,890
disservice to people who have these

00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:25,710
errors that we've all come across but we

00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:28,530
can all list and think about and instead

00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:30,900
we're like leaving people with the

00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:32,820
ability or the we're leaving people a

00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,320
lot of rope to hang themselves with like

00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:37,140
we're leaving people to think that

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,670
they're personally batted analysis or

00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:40,920
they're personally like making all of

00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:44,190
these human errors in their code and

00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:46,650
that's why they're making mistakes so

00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:49,020
human error as I said before there is a

00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:51,510
that's the inspiration in this and this

00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:54,410
is because as we had this really great

00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:56,850
culture of blameless post-mortems that

00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:59,130
centered around the idea of like

00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:02,070
redefining human error and how we

00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:03,480
understand it and that the reason why I

00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:05,640
see did this is because

00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,530
at seas like this website with so much

00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,540
traffic so the operations team that like

00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:11,340
kept the website going was one of the

00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:13,860
most important teams at the company and

00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:15,450
so this whole like paradigm of human

00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:18,900
error really comes from that operations

00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:21,240
world and a lot of the work at Etsy

00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,920
centered around this like paradigm

00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:26,310
shifting books the field guide to

00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:28,320
understanding human error and so you

00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:29,960
could like read the whole book I'll give

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,980
you the summary which is that

00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,860
essentially the paradigm shifts that's

00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:37,230
presented in this book is the idea of

00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:39,240
switching from blaming a person to

00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:42,870
blaming the process for failing the

00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:44,670
person so you know if there is like a

00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:46,800
place where this is implemented a lot is

00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:48,870
within the aviation industry like if

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,540
there's a plane crash they go through

00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:54,150
and like very very diligently look at

00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:55,740
the the flight itself and figure out can

00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:58,170
they create new safeguards so that there

00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:59,820
won't like whatever the pilot did that

00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:01,110
caused this problem they can create

00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:05,250
safeguards so that that doesn't happen

00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:07,010
again and there's a lot of trust in this

00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:10,380
I think it's really important because

00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:13,320
there is the assumption that the person

00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:16,110
who did the error the person who's like

00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:18,120
committed this error they were acting in

00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:20,070
a way where they thought that this error

00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:23,850
wouldn't happen like I don't think

00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:25,500
anyone who during a job has a mistake

00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:27,540
they didn't like set out to make that

00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,160
mistake rate like they set out thinking

00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:31,860
they were doing the right thing and then

00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,970
the process failed them so that they got

00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:36,780
a result that they weren't expecting

00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:39,900
that makes sense I feel like okay she's

00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:41,550
puzzled looks and so yeah like the I did

00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:44,760
the whole ideas like the current system

00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:46,500
fails a person with good intentions and

00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,320
as I said s he had this culture I think

00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:51,030
it was like a really famous culture and

00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,110
I did want to just say because I don't

00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:54,660
know how many people saw the news from

00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:57,480
Etsy yesterday but John all small he was

00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:59,610
the CTO and he he's left yesterday from

00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,920
Etsy and kind of like a dramatic day for

00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:04,470
them but he was like an amazing person

00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,180
and I'm so grateful to have worked with

00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:07,080
him and he influenced my thinking so

00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,600
much like something like give a

00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:11,970
shout-out to him on this like difficult

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,890
time for them but anyway it just created

00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:15,690
this really wonderful culture at Etsy

00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:18,150
and I think anyone with an engineering

00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:20,880
background will be familiar with this

00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:22,290
type of practice where like if engineers

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,030
made mistakes they felt really safe

00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:26,610
talking about it they felt really safe

00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:28,080
sharing their mistakes because they knew

00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:29,580
that they want to be personally blamed

00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,120
they knew that their jobs were in

00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,550
jeopardy

00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,050
by sharing it and then by sharing it

00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:35,640
everyone could work together to create

00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:39,600
safeguards against this problem from

00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:41,760
ever happening and so yeah like the

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,640
blameless post mortem process is the

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,470
idea of like in SVT it was like a very

00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,820
formal we all get together in a room and

00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:50,520
talk through exactly what happened

00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:52,740
create a timeline and figure out like

00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:54,540
what what happened what we can change

00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,460
about the system in order to keep it

00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:57,990
from happening again

00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:59,970
so like visually just like really nailed

00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:02,100
us home you have an error that happens

00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:03,660
you have a blameless post-mortem where

00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,000
you discuss the system changes to

00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:09,600
provide the air and then you adopt a new

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,430
process at the end and then just to like

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,080
talk about the opposite of this culture

00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:15,260
which again I think is the current

00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:17,850
culture in sort of the analysis world

00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:19,050
and at like an engineer who thinks

00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:22,140
they're going to be reprimanded or

00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:23,970
blamed for an error is going to be

00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:26,190
disincentivized to share the details

00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:28,350
necessary to get an understanding of the

00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:30,990
mechanism pathology and operations of

00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:32,970
the error so if you have like a blame

00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:34,290
fold culture then you're going to have

00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:35,760
people who are embarrassed to share

00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,340
their code who are embarrassed to talk

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,210
about their process

00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:43,200
sounds like the current state of

00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:46,230
analysis development so as I said before

00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:48,630
like we all have run into these problems

00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:50,730
right and when I think about this

00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:52,740
conference there's already been like we

00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:54,660
were all going to sessions where we are

00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:57,300
presenting possible solutions to these

00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:59,220
problems and so like one of the talks

00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:01,770
was about a data validation service

00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:04,290
where you would have like a set like CI

00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:06,630
testing for your data validity so that's

00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:08,040
like a really good example of an action

00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:09,240
item that would have come from running

00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,820
into a problem here

00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,870
and so like we as a community have kind

00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,790
of gone through this blameless

00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:17,730
post-mortem process where we've run into

00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:19,320
problems and then adopted new processes

00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:21,060
and we come to conferences and talk

00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,339
about those processes and think that

00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:25,320
they're the right solution and so when I

00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:28,200
have this slide of problems we could

00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,190
actually create basically a list of what

00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,410
we think

00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:34,800
the best solutions are for those like as

00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:36,720
a community in my opinion and when I

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,459
talk about having music I actually want

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,180
to call these opinions and so I have

00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:46,430
things like code review creating modular

00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:48,959
tested code using executable scripts

00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:50,730
Watchers for change data I think that

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:53,550
was a lot of like what my postdoc was

00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:55,230
just talking about kind of only changing

00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:56,819
data when it you need to are only

00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:59,579
updating parts of the visualization

00:15:56,819 --> 00:16:01,439
rather than the whole thing but I think

00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:03,449
we can all like I would be hard-pressed

00:16:01,439 --> 00:16:05,279
I don't think anyone at this conference

00:16:03,449 --> 00:16:07,050
would disagree with most of what's

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,120
happening here

00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:11,339
so if we talk about so this is sort of

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,639
the opinionated and opinionated analysis

00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:17,009
development and as I I love this part of

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:20,370
the talk because I have lots of years of

00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:23,220
experiences being opinionated as an

00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:25,740
example of that I remember a few years

00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:27,569
ago I went to a party and my friend was

00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:32,279
like oh I never fight with anyone else

00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:34,259
except for you and so I know how to be

00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:36,180
opinionated in the wrong ways and how to

00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:38,519
alienate people and I'll give you a

00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:41,610
little bit of a an idea of how to do

00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:43,079
this from personal experience but how

00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:46,949
did not win friends and influence people

00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:48,360
as the most important thing like you

00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:50,730
know going in and saying like well

00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,769
actually you need to test your code like

00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:54,750
or you need to do these you know you

00:16:52,769 --> 00:16:57,000
need to have someone do a code review

00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:58,560
and why wouldn't you do that that's

00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,380
definitely a way to not convince people

00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,630
to do code review and you can add in

00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,819
like the wonderful medium of Twitter so

00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:07,020
that you're purposefully

00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:09,299
miscommunicating and not evil to express

00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:12,390
yourself this seems like the point of

00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:13,890
the medium at this point and in my

00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:16,049
favorite you can kind of be the kool-aid

00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:17,819
guy and like how specific tools that you

00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:20,220
think people should use but you're like

00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:22,049
well actually if you use are in our

00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,339
studio and you use this package that you

00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:27,419
wouldn't have any of these problems and

00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:28,740
I'm only going to set 140 characters and

00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:30,720
so again I actually think this was kind

00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:32,549
of the current culture of talking about

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:36,840
and spreading to lean and I think it's

00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:38,640
pretty toxic and like I said before one

00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,650
of the things like I feel like it's

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,630
important to honor the fact that like

00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:44,400
as one of these people who had to learn

00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:47,880
the hard way how to stop doing this and

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,590
I do think like it does come from like

00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,200
people who aren't self conscious and

00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:54,120
they're enthusiastic and helping other

00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,820
people this is the same quote as before

00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,410
like if you feel safe and you feel safe

00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:00,570
to make mistakes and you'll be excited

00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:03,150
about sharing it but we're kind of just

00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:07,050
not sharing it in the right way in my

00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:09,270
opinion and so I mean with this

00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:11,100
opinionated software and defining the

00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:13,290
process I think we can actually have a

00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:15,900
shift from saying I know better than you

00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:17,520
like I'm the kool-aid guy coming in to

00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,960
saying something like you know lots of

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:22,320
people run into this problem all the

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,240
time and here's software that takes best

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,920
practices and makes the solution for you

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,660
if you shouldn't feel bad about making

00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,850
this mistake it happens all the time in

00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:33,300
fact we've engineered a solution to help

00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:35,520
with this and so opinionated software

00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:37,110
generally is this idea like I think I

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,760
mean my understanding is the first

00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:40,620
opinionated software was like Ruby on

00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,990
Rails someone can correct me if I'm

00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:45,270
wrong with that but the idealist

00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:47,160
opinionated software is just that it's a

00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:50,070
belief that a certain way of writing

00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:52,230
code and a certain set of practices it's

00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:55,970
inherently better because it helps you

00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:58,560
craft results around that process and

00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:00,210
and this creator of Ruby on Rails had a

00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,560
quote saying you know it's a strong

00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:02,850
disagreement with the conventional

00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:05,850
wisdom that everything should be

00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:07,980
configurable and in that framework like

00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:09,780
it should be impartial and objective but

00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,880
in my opinion that's the same as saying

00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:13,140
that everything is secretly hard and I

00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,790
think that's sort of where we're at

00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:16,200
right now with analytical code where

00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:17,520
it's like you can do however you want

00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,080
we're going to run into these problems

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,350
and we're not going to tell you the

00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:25,800
right solution to them and and just to

00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:27,990
like identify what are the most

00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,670
motivating things for me like that got

00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:32,100
me thinking about this was sitting in a

00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:33,570
meeting lines where someone had created

00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,310
kind of this like non opinionated

00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:36,660
software you can even almost think of it

00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:40,650
as software that is implementing the

00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:42,720
wrong opinions and and it is Safina xi

00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:44,790
reproducible it was had like these weird

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:48,120
dependencies on like dynamically

00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:49,800
changing things without any sort of any

00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:52,110
sort of visibility into the connections

00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,640
from different data sets and I just

00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:54,190
remember sitting in that meeting and

00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,710
thinking

00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:58,899
like like this is bowling like there are

00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:00,730
rules like there are rules to how we do

00:19:58,899 --> 00:20:02,470
this and we shouldn't be embarrassed

00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:03,639
about talking about it and we shouldn't

00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:05,470
make it like someone's personal

00:20:03,639 --> 00:20:07,629
responsibility how didn't do it right

00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:10,509
so you know you can say like this is

00:20:07,629 --> 00:20:11,860
analysis there are rules or if you're

00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:13,750
really on board with me you can say you

00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:16,509
know this is analysis development of

00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:18,700
analysis engineering and there's rules

00:20:16,509 --> 00:20:21,000
how we do it and it's not because we

00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:23,470
were personally failing it's because

00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,149
that we've run into these problems all

00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:28,809
the time and that we're in a blameless

00:20:25,149 --> 00:20:30,730
culture where we can talk about it so

00:20:28,809 --> 00:20:32,200
just to kind of sum up I think it's

00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,879
really important that we define the

00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,860
process of technically creating the

00:20:33,879 --> 00:20:37,870
analyses I think it's really important

00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:40,809
that we define opinions based on common

00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:42,759
processes common errors and then shift

00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:44,799
the blame from individuals using these

00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:48,850
like blameless postmortem kind of

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:50,710
culture as a community push for software

00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:52,360
that we think makes it easy to implement

00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:54,100
these opinions so I think you know

00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:56,860
obviously R and Python and some other

00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:58,509
languages are good with that and then

00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:00,820
really focus on the creativity in that

00:20:58,509 --> 00:21:05,019
narrative developing aspects and instead

00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:07,419
of focusing on people doing it wrong

00:21:05,019 --> 00:21:09,519
so with that you know like like I think

00:21:07,419 --> 00:21:11,080
we would all do be well served to try to

00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:13,809
stay away from sort of this culture and

00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:16,029
dictating what people should do and I

00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:17,799
think if we start to do this and define

00:21:16,029 --> 00:21:21,039
the process we'll just be in a much

00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:24,220
better place in the community so so

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:25,710
that's all I have but can definitely

00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:29,320
take questions or feel free to tweet

00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:32,160
opinions at me - definitely you so that

00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:35,030
so cool

00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:37,090
[Applause]

00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:37,090
