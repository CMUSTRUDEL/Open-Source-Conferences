00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,570
you know OOP sorry yeah move that seems

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,750
okay everybody hear me

00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:23,430
all right okay cool see if I get this

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:31,679
working again here we go yeah okay cool

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:33,020
um say my name is Derrick I a little bit

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,790
nervous about this talk so I feel like a

00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:37,620
funny to mention that the first line of

00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,390
my speaker notes are hi my name is Eric

00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,420
which is which is pretty good but um

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:46,860
that's my cat but I work at the office

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:48,450
for creative research which is a I think

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,530
he calls the probably a database studio

00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,640
in Brooklyn

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:55,199
um it's I feel like that's not totally

00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,480
the best description of what it is that

00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:01,079
we do we're pretty pretty small group I

00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:04,140
think this is this is my friend and the

00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,570
guy who's started the studio talking

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,820
about it saying we make visualizations

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,229
online tools community platforms and

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,390
public interventions that increase data

00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:13,979
literacy facilitate understanding and

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,869
promote equality our work is meant to

00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:18,090
provoke surprise and delight while

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:21,090
deriving while driving critical thought

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,810
and facilitating understanding I thought

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,520
that was a pretty good description

00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,790
doesn't tell you exactly what it is that

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,439
we do but more or less that first part

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,820
of that sentences is the case where

00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:33,020
we're sort of all over the place we will

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:35,700
we build websites for science education

00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:39,270
purposes we do data sculptures that

00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,520
we've put in Times Square we're working

00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:44,009
on a community map room project right

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,170
now but the project that I'm here to

00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:48,390
talk to you all about there's a thing

00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,340
called feel kit and feel kit is very

00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,990
much an in-progress project so I'm kind

00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,869
of here does in kids doing that very

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:57,090
well but that's the logo um very much in

00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:58,590
in progress projects so I'm here to sort

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,020
of talk about where where it came from

00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,540
where it's headed what are some of the

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,070
ideas behind it but the gist is is that

00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,469
it's an open data and open science

00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:10,430
effort that same the field research and

00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:12,459
field researchers and conservationists

00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:14,500
so that is its

00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:17,950
it's targeted towards scientists but

00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:20,739
mostly scientists that do work in the

00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:23,769
field and I'll elaborate a little more

00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:26,590
what I what I mean by that so the

00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:28,959
project more let's begin here this is

00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:34,000
the this is the Okavango River Delta is

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:35,859
as seen from space the Delta is is

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,950
entirely inland it's part of a drainage

00:02:35,859 --> 00:02:41,170
basin in Northwest Botswana where the

00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:43,120
river basically just comes to an end and

00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:45,370
drains out right after passing through

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,069
your Angola and the midea to the for the

00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:49,540
Northwest there and almost been

00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:51,909
designated there's an ESCO World

00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:55,060
Heritage Site it's it's considered

00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:56,849
largely unprotected and for the most

00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:58,689
part generally under studied as well and

00:02:56,849 --> 00:03:05,250
there's all kinds of reasons for that

00:02:58,689 --> 00:03:07,389
but including the geography there but I

00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:09,669
but those two things are really sort of

00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:11,379
related in my mind the the difference

00:03:09,669 --> 00:03:15,459
between being a unprotected and under

00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:16,870
studied and and really why that's a

00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:18,760
problem for conservation is that there's

00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:20,260
not there's not as much of a sort of

00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,879
baseline understanding of even the

00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:25,359
current conditions for wildlife in this

00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:28,000
area sort of suss out whether or not any

00:03:25,359 --> 00:03:29,739
sort of efforts you know political

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,840
publicity or otherwise are actually been

00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:36,909
working so partnering with local

00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,099
populations in the area with funding

00:03:36,909 --> 00:03:40,810
from the National Geographic Society

00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:42,129
the Okavango wilderness projects has

00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,319
been able to attend expeditions to the

00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:45,459
river with the explicit goal on the sort

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,680
of accomplish those things I was talking

00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:49,419
about sort of build the baseline

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:54,970
understanding of the ecosystem in the

00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:56,500
area and raise awareness of B of what's

00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:59,250
going on in this sort of amazing

00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:03,000
ecosystem in the in the middle of Africa

00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:06,340
so the work started back in 2011 and

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,409
we've been going sort of our our part as

00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:11,199
part of the studio for every pretty much

00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:12,939
annually ever since and for the most

00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:14,799
part I think you could describe this as

00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:17,620
sort of a conventional science and

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,120
documentation efforts sort of an effort

00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,870
to record wildlife sightings and things

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,690
like that

00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:25,350
but you know for our part of it we

00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:26,850
wanted to bring something new too

00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:29,310
the way we're doing data collection in

00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,990
the field and that is both how we

00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:34,470
collect it and what would a mole to do

00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:35,790
with it so this is this is one of our

00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:38,610
collaborators Jacob who works with a

00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:40,770
nonprofit called conserva Phi certifies

00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:42,870
a group that is looking to lower the

00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:45,240
barriers to entry for technology based

00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:47,730
conservation and that's him working with

00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,340
one of the sensors that they designed in

00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:51,780
the field and part of what's been done

00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,780
with the van gogh project is to use

00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:56,550
these sort of low-cost open hardware

00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:58,890
solutions to capture a wide away wide

00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:01,530
array of information about the area on

00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:03,480
an ongoing basis and this includes all

00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:04,410
kinds of things like this is you can't

00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,840
see this very well again because the

00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:09,150
light but they've been working on

00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,680
building sort of open-source hardware

00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:14,130
solutions see a lot of sort of expensive

00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:16,200
sensors like this is a water flow sensor

00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:17,580
that that they're still working on in

00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,720
prototyping but that's one example of

00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,510
the kind of data that we might be able

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,970
to collect in the field this is a this

00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:25,490
is a weather station many of which we

00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:28,290
can we can set up an area to sort of

00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:31,080
monitor what's going on even after even

00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:34,550
after we've left and with this data on

00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:39,030
our side what we've been trying to build

00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:40,800
you know it sorry with all of that data

00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:43,230
and along with things like location of

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,540
team members vehicles animal sighting

00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:48,930
social media posts we've been trying to

00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:50,790
build sort of web representation of

00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:52,830
these expeditions that the more or less

00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:55,980
let's folks follow the follow the the

00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:57,060
team and effort in real time and I think

00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:00,840
one of the big things about this to me

00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:03,000
is that there's no there's not

00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,230
necessarily one single focus to the data

00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,240
collection or a presentation here

00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:10,320
there's the idea is breadth so if this

00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,330
looks like there's a lot of things going

00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:16,110
on that's that's intentional there are a

00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:17,520
lot of things going on social ones that

00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:20,970
some others fine-tune this like this is

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,260
this is one day of a sort of journal

00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:24,210
entry of the expedition and we've been

00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:26,910
able to aggregate you know photos from

00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:31,460
the field individual sightings that I'll

00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:33,240
talk more about in a second but this is

00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,650
the idea is that this is one

00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,260
representation of a whole lot of data

00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,940
that's coming

00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:39,310
of this project I'm even going to try to

00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:40,990
do my best to show a video of how this

00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:42,390
site actually works but this is one of

00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:48,820
those things that probably won't work

00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:50,890
come on why is it going to happen there

00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:52,330
we go okay so this is this is the

00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:53,830
representation as it stands you can sort

00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:59,170
of see where where this area is situated

00:06:53,830 --> 00:07:01,140
in Africa and this is this is the the

00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:04,450
main site that we build what when you

00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:06,490
when you let up into the vigor as a

00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:07,720
project and you know sort of following

00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:09,550
on what I was saying that hardware

00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,380
philosophy was of using these low-cost

00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:13,600
solutions to collect a broad variety of

00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:15,790
data in the same way this this web

00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:19,840
presence is sort of a low-cost software

00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:21,360
solution to showing a lot of data you

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,470
know for the most part this is built on

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,820
other open technologies we're not

00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:27,730
spending like a great deal of money to

00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:29,020
sort of produce this and this will get

00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:30,730
moving in a second and they sort of took

00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:33,160
a bad video this someone could be the

00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:34,630
apologist but I'll just say the idea

00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,490
that you can you can actually follow the

00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:40,030
team in real time like as they move as

00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:41,710
they move through the Delta area you can

00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:44,460
you can actually sort of explore all of

00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:47,430
these observations that they're making

00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:49,540
different wildlife observations to

00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:51,640
different sensor readings like on the

00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:53,020
weather stations you can get to that

00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:59,160
Journal section I showed earlier up

00:07:53,020 --> 00:08:02,160
there if I can get out of this video

00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,160
sorry

00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:10,449
and one of the big ideas of this is that

00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:11,979
this is really just a front-end sitting

00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:13,889
in front of this massive repository of

00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:16,860
information that we built coming out of

00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:19,840
years and years of going going back here

00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,460
this is just you know a snapshot of one

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,720
query against the API but you know you

00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:25,330
can see that there's there's over

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,750
there's almost almost four million like

00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:30,340
individual recordings in here and there

00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,990
all kinds there all kinds of things like

00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:34,240
this is a very like heterogeneous data

00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:36,270
set where we've got like right now this

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,440
is I think these are all bad of the day

00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:40,659
which is a sound recording of that

00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:43,479
Sumeria sound recording was actually a

00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:47,680
big part of this project along with

00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:49,390
daily daily baths apparently but this is

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:53,190
sort of where I came into this project

00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:55,060
with with all this work existing and

00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:58,270
what the question we started to ask

00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:01,810
about it is what can we what can we move

00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:04,060
on to from all of this work that is

00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:07,120
still something that is still something

00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:10,959
that has the kind of core mission of

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,950
this project but it's something that

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:18,490
sort of like builds on the things that

00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:20,079
we've learned and is repeatable so cool

00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:21,910
so the key things to me about into the

00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:23,860
Okavango is this idea of it being a

00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:26,110
low-cost platform but that I don't

00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:29,860
necessarily always mean cost but this

00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:31,959
was cost in this context can also mean

00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:35,399
things like training team members it can

00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:38,770
mean things like upkeep that can mean

00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:41,680
things like hiring developers to write

00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:43,899
software for for custom sensors things

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,899
like that and and the platform that we

00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:48,040
were getting towards providing sort of

00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:49,750
eliminated some of the some of the pain

00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:52,570
and getting going with with with these

00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:53,829
tools and also the in addition to just

00:09:52,570 --> 00:10:00,190
the financial cost of actually using

00:09:53,829 --> 00:10:02,050
them so this this is sort of a set of

00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:04,750
dichotomy aside they've got any about

00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:07,230
about fieldwork where there's there's

00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:10,570
sort of this tendency because these

00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:12,970
because these expeditions into areas

00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:16,060
where it might be hard to get to it

00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:17,370
might be dangerous to be there it might

00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:20,860
be

00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:22,860
you know any number of reasons the

00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:25,390
expense associated with these

00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:27,640
expeditions can also mean that they tend

00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:29,620
to become more narrow where you might be

00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,450
going there to study one particular

00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:33,280
aspect of an ecosystem because it's so

00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:36,670
hard to get there it's so hard to get a

00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:38,470
set of equipment there that the the

00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:40,990
focus starts to narrow and the sort of

00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:43,780
general usefulness of the data you're

00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:45,310
producing there's as well so part of

00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:47,170
what I think is get about okay thank you

00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:48,310
is it's moving it's moving some of that

00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:51,420
where you've still got this sort of

00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:53,590
expensive to lead expedition but

00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,850
building a broader base for the kind of

00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:56,380
information that you can collect once

00:10:54,850 --> 00:11:01,450
you're out there and doing that mostly

00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:04,990
also by introducing low cost tools and I

00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:07,950
was talking about so what I what I mean

00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:10,420
about the way that the way that these

00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:13,090
conservation efforts can end up being

00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:15,400
very expensive can create a me on this

00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:16,360
other project we were working on which

00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,680
is we were building a set of data

00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:21,070
visualizations for the great elephant

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:23,140
census which was an effort that sort of

00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:25,300
wrapped up recently to basically go and

00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:29,440
count every single African savannah

00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:30,880
elephant in Africa and if you're

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,010
wondering how they do that it's kind of

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,690
the way that that might seem obvious how

00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:37,000
they would do that they actually got an

00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:39,340
airplane and actually many many

00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,870
airplanes and flew to sort of narrow

00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:46,660
transects up-and-down covering as much

00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:50,410
areas they were allowed to or that was

00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:51,850
reasonable to given the Train I'm sort

00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,960
of using models based on those based on

00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,310
how the health and smooth they can

00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:57,480
actually take those raw counts of

00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:59,920
elephants on these airplanes and produce

00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,000
sort of total accounts for for how many

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,130
elephants they think they're getting

00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,090
there are present in a given area but

00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:06,010
one thing that's kind of strikes me

00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:08,770
about this is this is like a this is

00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:11,560
like a single single purpose and very

00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:13,540
expensive way to do this kind of work

00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,890
and that if you're in an airplane you

00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,540
know conceivably you're seeing all kinds

00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:20,680
of things about the terrain you're

00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:23,370
seeing other animals you're seeing Park

00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:25,600
Assist from poaching you're seeing a

00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:27,970
human densification and you're seeing

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,750
fires you're saying you know any number

00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:30,189
of things and there

00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:33,160
there's some question about like when

00:12:30,189 --> 00:12:35,290
you mount this sort of expedition to do

00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,730
this kind of work what are the tools at

00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:38,050
your disposal to actually broaden the

00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:41,259
base of what you're doing while you're

00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:42,879
out there this is sort of like you know

00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:44,980
what is the what is the orthogonal data

00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:48,819
that you could be collecting and making

00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:51,339
useful in a larger group so we started

00:12:48,819 --> 00:12:52,509
on field kit to try and solve some of

00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:56,350
these questions we came back to the

00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:58,300
hardware again so consider five working

00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:59,620
with can service fine they're produced

00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,629
they're working on producing another set

00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:03,639
of low cost tensors this is this is the

00:13:01,629 --> 00:13:05,620
board for the sort of base unit that

00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:07,480
we're working with right now and what

00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:09,579
this is is it's basically a piece that

00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:12,819
sort of solves the communications

00:13:09,579 --> 00:13:15,069
aspects of sensors in the field so when

00:13:12,819 --> 00:13:15,879
you're getting live data from places

00:13:15,069 --> 00:13:18,009
where you might have not have an

00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:20,800
internet connection you need things like

00:13:18,009 --> 00:13:22,720
the ability to store data continuously

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,639
the ability to send data over a

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,740
satellite uplink potentially the ability

00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:29,769
to send data over Wi-Fi when it's

00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:31,629
available and all of that can be kind of

00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:33,279
kind of expensive one of the one of the

00:13:31,629 --> 00:13:34,750
most expensive components of systems

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:38,709
like this can be the satellite radio a

00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:39,939
satellite modem so the idea behind this

00:13:38,709 --> 00:13:42,339
piece of hardware is that it can act as

00:13:39,939 --> 00:13:45,730
sort of a hub between multiple sensors

00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:46,990
to collect and communicate data so some

00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:49,449
of the some of the question after that

00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:51,699
is where does this data go so this gets

00:13:49,449 --> 00:13:53,379
to the software so we wanted to try to

00:13:51,699 --> 00:13:56,050
learn some lessons from what we did with

00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:58,930
into the Okavango which is more or less

00:13:56,050 --> 00:14:01,540
that we were had produced this very

00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:04,059
ad-hoc system over a course of years

00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,649
that led us to these large sort of

00:14:04,059 --> 00:14:08,680
monolithic data structures but it was

00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:12,009
difficult to difficult to share a reason

00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:13,540
about so this was this is all stored in

00:14:12,009 --> 00:14:16,600
sort of a document database and

00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:19,180
essentially had an arbitrarily deep and

00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,559
arbitrarily structured objects that were

00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:24,730
really trying to capture as much data as

00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:26,829
possible at the time but what starts to

00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:29,709
happen is that we ended up with layers

00:14:26,829 --> 00:14:32,139
upon layers of these code driven ingest

00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:34,389
routines and this is a lot of people

00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:36,880
writing Python basically to sort of take

00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:38,589
this data from a field sensor and/or

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,420
from a form that someone filled out on

00:14:38,589 --> 00:14:43,430
their computer later on to say

00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:46,280
they want to upload a photo of a bird

00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:49,700
they know what bird it is maybe we want

00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:51,860
to take that that bird sighting and add

00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:54,740
the taxonomy information for birds and

00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:56,690
then produce a document and it's geo

00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:58,550
JSON here because actually the root of

00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:00,410
all the documents for GOG some features

00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:02,450
and that everything we're recording had

00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:04,010
a location attached but the problem with

00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:06,950
that and if you're if earlier talk is

00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:09,230
that this is a very satisfactory process

00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:11,770
and the structure in the end of those

00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:15,170
documents is really only the sort of

00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:21,350
imprint of these sort of hard to

00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:22,280
understand nested ingest routines so

00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:24,250
there's a couple things we want to do

00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:27,080
here we want to kind of break this apart

00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:28,910
move a lot of that sort of input

00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:32,420
processing into a field where the user

00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:33,980
can do something with it and also get

00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:35,780
data that we can reason about in a way

00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:38,990
that we can potentially share so if

00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:40,610
we're doing one expedition in the

00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:43,610
Okavango there might be related

00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:45,050
expeditions particularly around bird

00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,610
populations and we want to be able to

00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:49,100
share data in some sort of meaningful

00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:51,200
way and it may not be that that way is

00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:52,490
is you know in the form of like

00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,570
publishing paper or something like that

00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:56,540
but some sort of meaningful

00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:59,140
representation of the shared effort of

00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:01,370
going here and documenting this wildlife

00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:02,630
so what we came up with is more or less

00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:05,570
breaking it out into two different

00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:07,850
pieces sort of strictly defined metadata

00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:09,230
structure to give us information that we

00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:12,200
knew we were always going to have about

00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:14,110
the individual observations and also

00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:17,870
bringing some sort of senses of

00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:20,630
tightness to the tea the other component

00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:24,500
of the data I just wanted this pretty

00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:27,080
quick but this is just sort of the sort

00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:29,000
of new ingest pattern that we came up

00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:31,420
with it's pretty straightforward the

00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,770
idea is that we add and it can become a

00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:36,380
set of data can be coming from any

00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:37,790
number of any number of sources this can

00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:39,410
be things like rock block which is a

00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:41,930
satellite provider or Tulia which

00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:44,270
handles SMS and we want to be able to

00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:46,040
pull the tailored data out of out of

00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:47,600
those formats we want to be able to

00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:52,220
parse the set of standard formats and

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:54,220
also a set of binary packs in the case

00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,930
of that that device it showed earlier

00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:58,990
and we want to be able to map those onto

00:16:55,930 --> 00:17:00,880
some set of knowable objects after the

00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:02,200
fact so just to run through what this

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,569
might look like just real simply it's

00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:07,839
just basically pull something like a CSV

00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:10,449
out of out of the larger objects parse

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,610
that CSV and then produce some sort of

00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:14,579
user-defined mapping to get an object

00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:17,350
and this is done this is not too crazy

00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:19,980
but what this lets us do is use like a

00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:22,000
sort of uses a set of standard

00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,860
technologies that are out there to get

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,589
to data that might be meaningful between

00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:29,200
projects so this is just JSON JSON

00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:31,210
pointers you know you can imagine

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:35,290
storing this pretty easily having this

00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:36,460
be fairly easily editable and in our

00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:38,230
case we're just sort of building a lot

00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:43,890
of these in advance for the for the

00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:47,950
sensor kits that we're starting with so

00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:50,920
where are we now where we've been using

00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:53,890
a system kind of like this to to get to

00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:55,720
get a sort of demo of similar

00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:57,460
functionality to what we had with the

00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,470
into the Okavango project running on a

00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:01,150
generic platform like this so this is

00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:03,010
something that you're able to go and

00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:05,980
sign up for and build an expedition

00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:08,590
connect a sensor and get some output

00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:10,060
that that is sort of similar to the way

00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:12,670
we were handling it with into the

00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:13,840
Okavango projects and this is in some

00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:15,250
way it's like slightly less ambitious

00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,340
right now than what was going on and

00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:20,500
into the Okavango but the importance of

00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,820
it I guess is that this is not something

00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,280
that's bespoke it's not something that

00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:27,610
was tailored just for this project this

00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:28,840
is a potential platform that we want you

00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:33,430
know people that were not interacting

00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:34,960
directly with to be able to use and I'm

00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:37,480
getting close to out of time but it's

00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,780
good customers note but there are so

00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:43,300
many more problems for us to solve one

00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:45,700
is that you know easy to say that it's

00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:47,500
we can define these mappings between

00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,120
objects and JSON but there's a lot of

00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,400
user interface complexity and behind

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,480
then there's sort of some debate about

00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,940
where we want to draw the line between

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,640
sort of out-of-the-box usability and how

00:18:54,940 --> 00:19:00,040
customizable it is there's issues around

00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,450
the sort of taxonomy of those typed

00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,490
objects that we're trying to produce how

00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:04,929
do you how do you sort of decide on what

00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,630
a what a bird signing should look like

00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:07,040
in a way

00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:09,410
you can collaborate between projects

00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:11,210
huge questions the other one is just

00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:13,010
these are huge amounts of data that

00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:15,050
we're talking about the Okavango project

00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:17,930
priests about four million data points

00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:20,690
so if imagine that you know we've got

00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:23,300
even tens of people using this system

00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:25,370
powering the same sort of data and how

00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,690
do we deal with that those those are all

00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:28,190
good open questions that we're working

00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:34,040
on we could give some solutions to this

00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:37,850
I would say stay tuned feel Georg has a

00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:41,330
has a mailing list sign up that's our

00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:42,590
website that's conserva side so there's

00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,910
going to be a more coming more coming

00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:45,710
out of this but this is going to be an

00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:48,950
open source project we're working right

00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:50,630
now to get those sort of license stuff

00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:52,640
sorted out so that we can have it up on

00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:55,340
github but you can find that under our

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:59,450
website and will you know about it once

00:19:55,340 --> 00:20:02,000
that happens but I think we want this to

00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:02,960
be a larger community effort and that

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,370
we're sort of trying to lead the

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,470
development on this but I think like I

00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:08,720
said it recently is what exactly a

00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:11,000
software shop so we're sort of depending

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,620
on the idea that people are going to

00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,480
have other resources to bring to bear on

00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:19,060
on this kind of work and are interested

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:20,330
in it so I'm not I guess I will wrap up

00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:23,180
thanks

00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:26,400
[Applause]

00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,820
[Music]

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,029
you

00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:31,029
