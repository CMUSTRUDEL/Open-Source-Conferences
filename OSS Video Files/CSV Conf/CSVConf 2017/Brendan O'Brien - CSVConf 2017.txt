yeah hi everybody hey Kevin yeah so I

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,259
don't know if anybody is if unnoticed

00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:16,049
the Barenaked Ladies or the Canadian

00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:17,550
prophet there's a oh I think of the 90s

00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:21,210
tune lovers in the dangerous time

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:24,750
anyways it felt appropriate so today I'm

00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,950
going to present for you some stuff on I

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,250
wrote sky nights because you've been

00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:31,830
intro you've been insured on what a data

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,960
rescue is which has been great so I'm

00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:35,640
one of those people I work on data

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,180
rescues with a whole bunch of other

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,250
lovely people around the around the way

00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,290
and so today I'm gonna present for you a

00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,370
theory of what a data rescue is because

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,920
it's a little more complicated than it

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:49,050
seems and a theory on why they make why

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,610
they're great let's see how that is

00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,780
hopefully people will just be flowing

00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,120
and I'm just going to talk over it I

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,010
really don't care so if you're come on

00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,370
in if you want to come on in nobody deal

00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:02,100
so you kind of know these are now a day

00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:04,649
rescue is it is a government archiving

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,750
event and so this is that just to give a

00:01:04,649 --> 00:01:08,280
quick recap its we've had thousands of

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,320
people now across the country gather

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,650
together on weekends on their off hours

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,110
to try to archive government data this

00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,510
is a process that started back in

00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,920
Toronto on December 18th and has been

00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:23,310
continuing ever since and picked up a

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,450
rapidly along the way and so yeah you

00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,740
kind of know what these are they've got

00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:29,360
a little bit of media attention which is

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,360
kind of funny I could reenact that photo

00:01:30,229 --> 00:01:34,710
yeah which is like yeah you made the New

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:38,850
York Times and it's a side of your goofy

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:41,460
head but yeah it's it's got a lot of

00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:44,159
attention but when it comes to like

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,049
details we're kind of a little short on

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,630
some of this stuff because everything's

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,490
in a really big state of rapid flux like

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,590
questions like who's running these it

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,990
depends on who you are weird on the data

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,880
live we're working on it like how much

00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,610
government data have we archived talk to

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,130
me in a week and you think I'm kidding

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:05,280
like this issue got opened on Monday

00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:06,689
with that government data over at the

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,829
EPA scare I don't know if anybody heard

00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:10,050
about this in the news or it was like

00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:10,470
somebody threw a pop-up which may or may

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,200
not have

00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:14,190
then a contractor maybe or maybe not

00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,050
saying that data was going to leave it

00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:18,690
on front get deleted on Friday and so

00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,250
like seven flex explode and everyone's

00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:22,020
like we need to say oh we have what we

00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:25,080
don't have and so this is my colleagues

00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,340
very like gentle like what the hell do

00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,260
we know about and what don't we know

00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:31,610
about and so while I was working on that

00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:34,650
I got a chance over the weekend on

00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:36,060
Thursday to work on just determining the

00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,620
coverage like what we entered what we've

00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,360
actually archived and so I thought I'd

00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,320
share some of that today because I think

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,820
there's some really interesting insights

00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:46,560
that come out of that process so yeah

00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,850
we've been working on a feature over the

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,990
weekend it's not finished in time I was

00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:51,000
really hoping to show to you but like

00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:52,620
it's kind of trash right now so we're

00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,620
not going to but the moon thrust was

00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:58,980
we've been taking like just like lists

00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:01,350
and lists and lists of URLs from various

00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:03,690
different organizations that we work

00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:06,060
with we try really hard to work with

00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:07,590
anybody and everybody who has

00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,150
information about archiving government

00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:11,070
data this includes the Internet Archive

00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:13,650
this includes the newly minted data

00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:14,940
refuge this includes archive is that

00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,100
space which is project I'm heavily

00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,660
involved in climate mirror Tufts

00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,300
University is doing a bunch of GIS data

00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:23,550
we've got like who else you Michigan has

00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,510
a bunch of stuff but there's a group in

00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:26,880
Boulder that's doing a bunch of

00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:29,100
archiving it's like like we have like at

00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:31,080
least 10 organizations that all have

00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,370
information about data they've archived

00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,310
and it's all sort of tied back to these

00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:37,500
URLs and so if you sort of start to get

00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,510
an understanding of coverage

00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:42,060
I built a data structure you've probably

00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:43,739
seen before which is just taking URLs

00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:46,100
breaking them into their components and

00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:48,780
forming a tree right so we've got this

00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:50,820
this is a very contrived to tree but

00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:54,840
it's like isn't a nice illusory example

00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:57,780
the current just EPA across HTTP HTTP

00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,820
and FTP is like 18 to 22 thousand nodes

00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,549
somewhere in there and so that's and

00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:04,890
that's not complete because there's yeah

00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:07,200
we'll get into that so there's an

00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:08,970
example like this is the path to a

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,680
document the next thing is as you add to

00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:12,120
this tree it doesn't duplicate stuff and

00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,950
so we can associate information with

00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,530
each one of these nodes about what we

00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:20,340
know about a specific given data set so

00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:21,730
for example this is a path to a doc that

00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:23,380
is this is a real

00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:26,040
all I think no it's not I lied I changes

00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:30,220
in CSV because write a CSV conference

00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,900
but if you but this is nice because we

00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,520
what we end up with is we take all of

00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,770
the lists that everybody has given us

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,360
and we sort of say okay cool let's let's

00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,490
establish this and now we get to start

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,570
to examine something for completion so

00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:42,130
these little check mark so you can see

00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:44,350
we've this projector is kind of not

00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:45,670
great but hopefully you can see this so

00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:48,460
we can still go through that k we got

00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:50,020
that and by in this case we're calling

00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:53,260
like archived meaning we have a

00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:55,330
identical hash of the resource in two

00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,580
places at least it's a bit of a

00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:59,200
challenge but right so we can sort of

00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:01,120
calculate coverage and then we get what

00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,340
we really want which is like coverage of

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,160
how much of this sort of scheme we have

00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:07,930
we just been super sweet but also super

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,790
challenging because we get new lists all

00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:13,270
the time and like links die and all

00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:14,620
kinds of stuff and but we also all read

00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,000
it we we've been working with this

00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,320
concept of UNCHR all about for a long

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,720
time which is just data that can't be

00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,280
hit with a regular web scraper and so

00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,290
that's been a huge source of like a

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,850
nightmare as you can imagine and so we

00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:27,250
can flag you know it's inside of this

00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:28,420
tree saying okay that specific thing we

00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,040
know that there's probably more data

00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:32,440
under there let's have a human go take a

00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,970
look at this sort of in general and so

00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,400
while I was working on this I thought

00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:38,560
some like illusory stuff came out of

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,830
this for visualizing this code because

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,510
this tree is great but if you've got to

00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,590
visualize it you sort of start to think

00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,690
about the data structure that would be

00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:49,660
more efficient for actually displaying

00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:51,880
this on a screen and like this sort of

00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:56,380
past spotting some sim bar to try and it

00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:58,150
sort of visualize it and I've been at

00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,310
this for like four or five months now

00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:02,800
with a bunch of us and like this this is

00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:04,870
a really fun moment because what this is

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,730
saying this function is a kind of life

00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:09,940
but what this does is this takes this

00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:11,890
tree and turns it into this which is

00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:14,020
basically just a list of nodes on the

00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:15,490
left right so we've just got like this

00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:17,650
everything that we know anything about

00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:19,690
and then a list of links so there's a

00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:22,990
different representation of the same

00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:23,980
thing right so and it's kind of

00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:26,390
interesting and then if you want look at

00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:28,640
that visualize it looks like this

00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:30,680
to me that's just like trash like I

00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,630
can't understand what that is but the

00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,710
one thing I really want to do when I see

00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:36,680
a list that looks like that is I just

00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:38,120
want to draw more lines and then when I

00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,470
draw more lines like well that's cool

00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,470
but it would look more badass to look

00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:45,770
like that and so like yeah there you go

00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:48,740
this is better so I know this is dumb

00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:52,250
but you kind of realize that like look

00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:56,180
at these two sets this is ordered and

00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:57,680
wonderful and this is chaotic but if you

00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:00,470
want to get into set theory

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:03,680
arrey is a subset of B because I've

00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:06,620
drawn a bunch of silly lines right and a

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,780
is much easier to comprehend B has some

00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,950
interesting properties and so like what

00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,720
are those interesting properties well

00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:13,340
when we're talking about sort of

00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,200
improving the integrity of information

00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:17,750
we're really all really afraid of this

00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:20,450
right somebody coming in and just like

00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:24,650
snipping that one very vital node in the

00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:26,690
tree and if that if epa.gov 404s we lose

00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:30,350
access to data and that's no good and so

00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:32,930
this thing on the left this a example is

00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:37,130
a very beautiful very easy to understand

00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:38,330
thing this thing on the right okay so if

00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:40,070
I'm going to snip some nodes out of this

00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:41,930
thing it's kind of like well it doesn't

00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:43,580
it doesn't really matter this is much

00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:47,300
more chaotic but this structure is far

00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:50,000
more impervious to destruction and so a

00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,740
lot of what we're doing in this in these

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,720
data rescue events is actually in

00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:56,390
creating data more impervious to

00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,950
destruction by adding more links and the

00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:59,590
way we're doing adding more links is by

00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:01,670
talking to as many people as possible

00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:03,470
understanding what do you have archives

00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:05,090
what do you have archives let's let's

00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:08,930
sort of merge our sets and understand

00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:10,520
who has what and so there's these two

00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:12,680
structure represent a really interesting

00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,390
sort of like spectrum right like and so

00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,130
I like through this level up because I'm

00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:18,080
well I'm an engineer I'm also deeply

00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:20,570
artsy and so it's like this looks a lot

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,250
like order and chaos and like they these

00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:24,380
two sort of familiar present' a bit of a

00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:26,290
spectrum they live in constant tension

00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:28,340
right like the one on the left is

00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:30,740
comprehensible but it's really fragile

00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:33,020
and the one on the right is super

00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,810
resilient and very powerful but it's

00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,969
very

00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:37,830
to make sense out of both of these have

00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:40,289
like a silly amount of merit right like

00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:41,490
if for us to be able to understand just

00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:42,960
like because we've been asked this

00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,430
question like just what do we have and

00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,960
what don't we have and that's been a

00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:47,430
mind-boggling ly difficult thing to do

00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,920
we make this ordered list not the sends

00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:51,420
like oh okay we have 46 percent of EPA

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,130
that was easy we should have done that a

00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,690
while ago but this thing on the right is

00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:56,430
actually kind of where we're going right

00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:59,670
like we wanted to build a sort of like

00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:03,720
more impervious sort of network and so

00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:05,220
I'm thinking a lot about this sort of

00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:10,410
dichotomy in this order

00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:13,290
chaos dichotomy and for me that's like a

00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:15,480
it's like a very it's a nice like point

00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:17,339
of meditation because personally like

00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,960
before I got into this data rescue stuff

00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:20,760
I've been working in like the tech

00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,800
sector as an entrepreneur for a long

00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,779
time so I'm like one of these like

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,700
recovering cold-blooded capitalists I

00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:29,870
really love the idea of making money

00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:34,050
feel like I'm in like I still do but I

00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:36,480
when I came into this project I I have

00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:38,339
always been really sort of comfortable

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,080
with chaos like the last five years of

00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:44,670
my life have been working on building

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:47,339
products and the closest metaphor I have

00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:49,080
for what it's like to work in the tech

00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:50,550
sector right now is it's like playing

00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,100
full-contact football

00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:55,589
blindfolded in other space with jetpacks

00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,700
it's like the closest I can imagine this

00:09:55,589 --> 00:09:58,440
kind of feels like everything out like

00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:01,080
like on a Tuesday you'll just get this

00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,970
like oh this new startup that you didn't

00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:05,040
know existed that feels exactly what you

00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:07,320
build now exists does what you do better

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:11,100
and has raised 15 million dollars and

00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:15,480
you suck so like go home and throw up in

00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:17,670
my life for a long time and so it's well

00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,170
I think on this spectrum if I had to

00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:21,630
place myself I think I live somewhere

00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:23,610
close to here with like everybody in

00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:25,830
like punk rock bands to me on the right

00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:30,839
and then like a lot of things to me on

00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:31,830
the left and and I realized this as I

00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,450
started showing up at these little

00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:35,730
rescue events is because I'm like I've

00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:39,300
grown quite a high tolerance for chaos

00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:41,100
and like I didn't realize that until I

00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:43,080
started encountering

00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,910
this is going to sound overly general

00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,980
but I

00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:50,390
Demming types people who are more

00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,130
structured than me like they have more

00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:54,260
like there is more I've been working a

00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:55,760
lot with organizations with institutions

00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:58,280
that have institutional knowledge and

00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:04,070
just don't move or think the way that I

00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:06,190
have learned to move and so this and and

00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:09,110
that leads to some really interesting

00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:10,790
interplay because with a lot of the

00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:12,020
people that I work with I sort of get

00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:13,580
the impression that sometimes they look

00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:15,980
at me and they have the impression that

00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:17,390
I sort of look like this and then like I

00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:19,490
have the impression of them that they

00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:21,490
are kind of like this and then when we

00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:24,830
work together it kind of feels like this

00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:27,500
but we but when we do actually get in

00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:30,470
the same room and do stuff together it's

00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:33,560
like total fire emoji like I really

00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:36,250
believe that the work that we're doing

00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:38,450
at these data rescue events is

00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:41,620
mind-blowing ly productive like you

00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:44,990
watching what we have accomplished over

00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:46,190
four or five months is it's nothing

00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:47,750
short of like astonishing like we have

00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:49,460
built a lot of really great stuff great

00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:51,020
we've built that fast cool but more

00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:53,000
importantly I've done it in conjunction

00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:54,770
I've been working on this in conjunction

00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,360
with people who are way smarter than me

00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:58,790
we have a way more specific domain

00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:02,030
knowledge than me I've seen some like

00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:04,220
beautiful beautiful connections happen

00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:07,370
like going to a data rescue event is

00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:09,740
seeing a climate scientists sit next to

00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:11,180
a software engineer and try to work out

00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:13,970
how are we going to save this data set

00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,930
that I really need and along the way the

00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:17,690
climate scientist

00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:19,640
in an ideal world is sort of explaining

00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:20,870
a little bit too they did to the dev

00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,000
like hey this is why this is really

00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:24,560
important and this is this whole new

00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,930
level of contact with information that

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,430
you never had before and I've had my

00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:31,790
eyes opened in ways that like I didn't

00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:33,410
see happening before this project and so

00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:36,020
for me this you know to try and sum it

00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:39,140
up is it kind of feels like my lesson

00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:41,000
here is to move away from the chaos a

00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:43,040
little bit and more towards be ordered

00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,640
to understand that there's real value in

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,020
working slower and then not a slower see

00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,700
and like I don't have the language for

00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:51,140
action which is a conscious well but

00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:53,870
it's not just slower but it's like more

00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:55,790
deliberately with more

00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:57,920
sort of like gravitas do what you do to

00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:59,330
like not just like inventing a new spec

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,590
every five minutes and saying like

00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:02,780
you're the greatest because it's all

00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:04,040
written in some fancy new language or

00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:07,490
you use this framework because it's so

00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:09,320
much faster or like whatever and I think

00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:12,980
that I really believe that this is sort

00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:15,800
of one of the most exciting parts of the

00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:18,470
data rescue project is like we it

00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:21,440
enables people to move and interact

00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:23,120
along this spectrum the special is a bit

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,190
contrived but I think you can hopefully

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,100
see what I'm getting at like we have

00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:29,480
people who have been having to meet me

00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,950
but like I have these regular

00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,810
conversations with people who are like I

00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:34,520
guys go out and build stuff and they're

00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:37,010
like dude you're moving like too quickly

00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:38,570
you need to slow down and some way out

00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:40,430
of the middle of that tension is coming

00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:42,560
this really productive work right

00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:44,270
the academic pipes are referencing

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,830
earlier like sit down and write really

00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:48,320
thoughtful papers or they come up with

00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:49,850
like like I don't do enough research I

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,980
could just straight up don't and and it

00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:53,240
shows up when someone actually presents

00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:55,130
me with a little bit of research where

00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,120
they're like look these are 15 people

00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:58,070
who've been writing about this thing

00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:01,880
that you have just stopped all over and

00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:03,950
so like for me this has been really it's

00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:06,260
been a massive growth experience for me

00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:07,370
the majority of people have been coming

00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:10,040
that I've been working with him and

00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:12,170
coming from the other direction but it's

00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,640
it's it's the place to say that's why I

00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:15,590
sort of put the emphasis on a movement I

00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,750
think that moving along the spectrum is

00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:19,220
actually quite painful it's very

00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:21,350
difficult to sort of step outside your

00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:23,090
shell and work with people who you don't

00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:24,560
normally work with right like a lot of

00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:26,420
this sort of grinding noise that comes

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,340
out of working together is the sound of

00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:30,860
progress but it comes with a sort of

00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:33,050
cost for all of us it's highly stressful

00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:34,280
work and you ask anybody who's been

00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:39,230
deeply connected to the data rescue

00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:41,960
project I'm looking it's really

00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:45,410
stressful work it's just like it's a lot

00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:47,650
to get involved and yeah that's a repeat

00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:50,060
of that slide I don't know why and so

00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:53,780
we've been thinking a lot about this and

00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:55,100
this this sort of like this concept is

00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,420
sort of shaken out of the side the other

00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:59,540
side of this which is like this notion

00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:01,160
of data together mad Zumwalt from the

00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:03,260
ipfs project is the first one to sort of

00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,060
like coin this thing as far as we know

00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:08,150
and this is sort of like thinking about

00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:09,530
it's a recontextualizing of data it's

00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:11,750
something that we all hold together

00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:14,030
right it's it's now thinking a little

00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:15,890
bit more along the pure edge side of

00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:16,850
things and it's really stuck with a lot

00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:18,380
of us haven't worked in this project

00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:20,750
because it sort of seems to sum up

00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:21,890
nicely like the together in a sense like

00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,300
this nice vibe that we're all trying to

00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:26,510
go for in the data bit because we're all

00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:27,740
nerds and so he would be he's gonna be

00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:29,660
really mad at this slide or maybe you

00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:31,430
won't be but like he thinks more about

00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:33,800
this like order chaos as sort of like

00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:35,360
analogy for a centralized distributed I

00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,410
don't think this is totally applicable I

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,470
think you'd be upset about this like

00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:43,550
chaos distributed part of things but

00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:45,230
this is the notion of like as the we are

00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:46,550
definitely what we're doing is forming a

00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,840
distributed network right whether

00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:49,900
whatever you want to call it we're

00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:53,150
building these deep connections between

00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:55,250
archives and repositories to try and say

00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:56,870
if you need this information that at

00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,920
some point is disappeared these are the

00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,780
places you can go to get it that's

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,640
that's the central purpose point of

00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:03,290
value will provide and ideally at these

00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,970
data rescue events data that was super

00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:08,570
vulnerable has been archived so that

00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:11,540
that is possible to begin with so the

00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:13,400
move the best bit is is sort of in this

00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,770
also yeah and for the the exciting thing

00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,650
about this is I think this data together

00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:20,630
illustrates two very very wonderful

00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:23,030
problems and potential like points of

00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:27,320
deep significance the data part right

00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:28,880
the move the bits part that's that's a

00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,100
huge technical undertaking right like

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,410
just making backups um all this stuff

00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:35,660
deduplicating our work understanding

00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:37,340
like digital provenance like the notion

00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:39,170
of like we've extracted this in a

00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,910
meaningful way where we can sort of

00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:42,980
prove to the best of our ability that

00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:45,020
this information at some point came from

00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:47,060
a government source or a legitimate

00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:49,100
source that we can all trust it's been

00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:51,860
told it's been touched by these people

00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:53,390
and it hasn't been sort of like modified

00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,890
in any way shape or form we have it

00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:56,990
duplicated in two places so we can

00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:58,250
understand that this is truly like it

00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:00,350
just adds to the veracity of that

00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,880
information so the data bit is sort of

00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:03,350
fairly straight it's not straightforward

00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,630
but it's a very big technical challenge

00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:08,420
is very exciting to work on but for me

00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:10,130
the bit that like the like squishy side

00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:12,680
of me really enjoys is the together a

00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:14,630
bit right is this like what does the

00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,059
other bit who is together right like who

00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,709
is

00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:19,079
this set of people that is engaging in

00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:20,730
this stuff right and and it's easy to

00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:22,259
sort of naturally gloss over that and to

00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:24,600
think that it's just like oh it's just

00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:26,220
everyone right like yeah but but now

00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,899
you've sort of glossed over the biggest

00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,889
part of the problem which is like we're

00:17:27,899 --> 00:17:30,299
getting a whole bunch of people from a

00:17:28,889 --> 00:17:31,919
very different set of backgrounds into

00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:33,870
the same room and we're asking them all

00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:37,320
to sort of behave in concert and that's

00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:38,999
a lot to ask and that's as we can all

00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,679
sort of say I can say first and it's

00:17:38,999 --> 00:17:41,909
like it's challenging because it's it

00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:43,919
challenges who you are

00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:46,980
it makes you think about your title it

00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:49,529
makes you think about it makes you think

00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:52,169
about my ego I think I know how to do

00:17:49,529 --> 00:17:57,059
everything right and that has been

00:17:52,169 --> 00:17:58,289
checked very heavily and but but at the

00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:59,309
end of the day the together thing is

00:17:58,289 --> 00:18:00,450
really exciting because it's an

00:17:59,309 --> 00:18:02,129
acknowledgment that we're part of a

00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:05,490
group or part of a peer based system

00:18:02,129 --> 00:18:07,619
that is going to grow in response to a

00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:12,389
very big challenge right this notion

00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:13,970
that as the government sort of is sort

00:18:12,389 --> 00:18:15,929
of being turn a bit like the

00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:17,190
dependability of the government is sort

00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:19,440
of being thrown into question we're

00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:21,840
having to grow this this together this

00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,850
public to try and accommodate some of

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:30,059
that and that for me is really exciting

00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:32,039
and so yeah I be so hopefully through

00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:33,210
this you know you might believe me you

00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:35,129
know you might not believe me I really

00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:36,960
think that the big advantage here is

00:18:35,129 --> 00:18:38,249
like getting the real upside of these

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,840
data rescue events is getting people

00:18:38,249 --> 00:18:42,570
from different backgrounds into the same

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,999
room it's worth saying that I don't know

00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:46,590
if that metaphor applies on extreme ends

00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:47,999
of the scale right like I think it's

00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:49,320
natural to sort of try and abstract that

00:18:47,999 --> 00:18:50,340
pattern to say oh and that means I

00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,389
should just go like marching on the

00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:54,269
street and talking to people who I've

00:18:51,389 --> 00:18:57,049
never talked to before like it's one of

00:18:54,269 --> 00:18:59,309
the benefits here has been that the

00:18:57,049 --> 00:19:00,960
everybody has come to the table with

00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:02,549
this impression of like there's a big

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,929
problem we all need to fix so we're all

00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:05,639
going to sort of put ourselves put our

00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:08,909
ourselves second and the problem first

00:19:05,639 --> 00:19:11,570
but also that we're not that far away in

00:19:08,909 --> 00:19:13,710
professions right like like a data

00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:16,980
scientist scientists a computer

00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:18,529
programmer and like a PhD student in

00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:20,730
physics all have like a very similar

00:19:18,529 --> 00:19:21,960
there's at least a common language there

00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:23,759
right and so maybe there's some grinding

00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,680
noises but we're not like it sounds so

00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:28,650
painful that we can't get anything done

00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:30,930
so you know before I like begging you to

00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:33,360
come to add a rescue event like I think

00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:35,370
one of the biggest sort of takeaways for

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,170
me for personal growth and if you can

00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:39,240
hopefully apply to your life even if you

00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:39,780
aren't sort of like archiving government

00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,240
information

00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:44,670
it's like making someone making friends

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,130
near you maybe not directly in your

00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:49,410
field seems to be one of the recurring

00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:51,990
themes of success as far as I can tell

00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:53,640
and so if that's a pretty easy lesson to

00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:56,480
apply anywhere in your life and

00:19:53,640 --> 00:20:00,450
hopefully hopefully that is applicable

00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,930
but you know if you if you have time and

00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,850
interest

00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:04,200
you should totally trying to do rescue

00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:05,730
you should totally start a day to rescue

00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,040
and if you have interest in doing that

00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:10,920
just totally talk to me because we can

00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,810
we can do more of those it's as I said

00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,700
it's been a really high state of flux

00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:17,100
like we're constantly we're working on

00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,930
all kinds of aspects to this so it's

00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:21,030
kind of chaotic right now like if you

00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:22,380
ask any of us like what you know how do

00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:24,180
I get involved like sometimes the answer

00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,710
is different because last week there was

00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:28,470
just some piece of information that's

00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:30,360
changed so I apologize on behalf of the

00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:31,920
entire community if like we don't give

00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,020
you a straight answer on stuff but like

00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,830
please keep talking to us because we're

00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:37,950
desperately

00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:39,840
yeah we're desperate for more people so

00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:42,270
if you want to if you want a concrete

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:45,000
thing to get involved we had a slack

00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:47,490
this is the slack that I sort of am the

00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,960
most I haunt the most which is archiver

00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:50,790
stuff space and slack archiver's that

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,770
space is a project to help assist in

00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:55,050
archiving data it sends stuff today to

00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:58,710
refuge the if you want to hit me up on

00:20:55,050 --> 00:21:00,810
twitter i'm be underscore to i-5 because

00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:01,680
i'm be v on everything else but yeah i

00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:03,390
thought i'd leave some time for

00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,190
questions because maybe i don't know if

00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:07,140
you guys have had a chance to like quit

00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:10,640
somebody who is actually at like a data

00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,640
rescue stuff so yeah

00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:24,670
a little bit also people in academia

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:28,330
especially information sciences are they

00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:30,430
changing their if you like data rescue

00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:33,340
is how the data should be stored to

00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:36,970
begin yeah I mean hmm

00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:38,860
so are so the question was are our data

00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:41,530
scientists sort of coming embracing

00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:43,150
chaos a little more is our the

00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:45,130
librarians bracing chaos a little more I

00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:46,810
don't think that the librarians are

00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:48,910
increasing chaos a little more and I

00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:50,230
think that's good and that and I think

00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:54,400
that's the point here right it's like

00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:56,710
this this like this is the there's value

00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,360
on both ends of this and and I think

00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:59,950
that that's the point right like you

00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,690
need you need the order to make sense

00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:03,760
out of things and we still we're always

00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:06,600
going to need people who live quite

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:09,220
staunchly on the ordered side i've

00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:11,700
programmer Yahoo's you know like I was

00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:13,720
I'm super happy over here but I think

00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:15,130
yeah to a point we are getting

00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,300
compromises and we are moving forward

00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:19,140
but like that's going to be an ongoing

00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,140
thing I think

00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:32,600
certainly yeah so there's been a huge

00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:34,460
push to there's a couple of things so

00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:37,180
everything we archive coasts the data

00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:40,010
refuge org so that's a good start

00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:42,280
people for me my burps and I just don't

00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:46,730
realize that that one into a microphone

00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:47,870
the the rest of stuff a lot of it so the

00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:49,400
next thing and the next thing to do is

00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:50,930
to actually publish this feature that I

00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,510
was just talking about which is the hi

00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:55,490
give us a URL you want to know about or

00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:57,500
the title of a data set and we will show

00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:58,730
you where it's archived right like it's

00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,500
on the Internet Archive because like

00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:02,600
Internet Archive has like easily the

00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:04,340
best coverage of all this stuff so those

00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,990
tools are forthcoming as I mentioned

00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:08,750
it's all sort of like in rapid flux but

00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:10,550
uh yeah I think data wreckage is

00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:12,680
definitely the best place to start for

00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:14,060
some of that stuff and then if you want

00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:16,100
to do the technical stuff the archiver's

00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:18,500
dot space app is where we actually

00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:29,720
tracked like progress of sort of

00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:32,150
extracting data and so yeah yeah so I

00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,230
that's that everybody who had sort of

00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:35,260
like kicked into the project at the end

00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:37,040
with that sort of said you know like

00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:39,200
they've either taking the approach of

00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,930
like we're gonna settle seven roots here

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,130
and like really sort of stick around or

00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:45,410
we were going to collaborate our way out

00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,700
of existence and so like the

00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:48,770
environmental governance and data

00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:51,200
initiative which is edgy which I didn't

00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:53,780
talk about much but is the is sort of

00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,040
one half of this they have a desire to

00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:58,820
collaborate their selves themselves out

00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:00,170
of existence personally I work on like

00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:02,300
online products and I think at some

00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:04,790
point we need a place where we can visit

00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:06,350
to say like hey this is you can download

00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:08,630
this as that package you can put this

00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:10,280
over as like a web archive like I think

00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:12,250
we need to write tools that do these

00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:14,330
translations and we need to start to do

00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:15,950
interoperation between data repositories

00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:18,050
and so that's stuff that we're working

00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:19,460
on I don't know if that'll go away or if

00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:21,850
that'll turn into a series of services

00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:23,720
that get built into other frameworks

00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:25,610
hopefully the latter to be honest

00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,860
because like more services is kind of

00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:29,780
like then you have to break your

00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:31,910
microphone spin up more stuff and like

00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:33,200
it's just a lot work so yeah I think a

00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:35,300
plan is to try and either collaborate

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,429
out of existence or to set up very

00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:38,710
permanent structures that are like

00:24:36,429 --> 00:24:41,789
funded and the answer to that question

00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:41,789
depends on who you're talking to

00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:09,669
yeah and so this is still a really great

00:25:07,769 --> 00:25:11,679
metaphor for this like a lot of this

00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:13,539
kicked off in Canada because the

00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,580
Canadians there was the census in Canada

00:25:13,539 --> 00:25:16,869
became optional in 2012 I don't know if

00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,830
anybody knows this it was just

00:25:16,869 --> 00:25:19,659
mind-blowing

00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:22,629
so like the census didn't get filled out

00:25:19,659 --> 00:25:24,539
in Canada and that's so there was

00:25:22,629 --> 00:25:26,769
literally the like stop collecting and

00:25:24,539 --> 00:25:28,749
that triggered a real lightning rod

00:25:26,769 --> 00:25:30,039
moment in Canada and people like wash

00:25:28,749 --> 00:25:33,100
their minds and like there were marches

00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:36,580
there was a celebratory March when the

00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:38,080
census came back so in terms of and

00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:39,369
that's why I say like I think it's

00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,350
important to grow the public in

00:25:39,369 --> 00:25:43,869
relationship to this because I think we

00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:46,059
are going to see a need for citizen

00:25:43,869 --> 00:25:48,070
science a need for like look we're gonna

00:25:46,059 --> 00:25:50,019
have to do some of us ourselves and as

00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:52,119
we're doing that we should be observing

00:25:50,019 --> 00:25:53,409
every single practice that the

00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:55,539
government's observing right like

00:25:53,409 --> 00:25:57,639
project open Daysha data as a metadata

00:25:55,539 --> 00:25:59,110
spec is phenomenal it came out of the

00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:00,730
data.gov thing so whatever you want

00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:02,379
about data gov it's a really good spec

00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:03,429
we should be doing it for anything

00:26:02,379 --> 00:26:06,119
that's collected to citizen science

00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:09,730
because maybe later it gets to like

00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:11,590
capacity to be used in the same way it's

00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:14,429
not ideal I mean ideally the government

00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:14,429
does all this but like

00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:28,280
exactly

00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,080
and that's where I think that growing

00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:32,240
the public is part of this I don't think

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,100
I really genuinely believe it's not the

00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,450
entire solution but I think it's a giant

00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:38,270
chunk of the solution like I think that

00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:40,190
building systems to help facilitate that

00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:41,750
exact organization and the distribution

00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:44,510
and dissemination of that knowledge

00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:46,910
across a number of technologies and a

00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:48,770
number of platforms is the only way to

00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:51,200
sort of compensate for this like tragic

00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:54,260
loss of the dependability of the US

00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:57,770
government yeah but yeah so I'm we're in

00:26:54,260 --> 00:27:02,720
the same boat yeah yeah one more

00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:04,850
question is anybody know cool yeah

00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,230
hopefully that wasn't too airy-fairy I

00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:09,400
know I'm a deveneux so let's talk about

00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:12,300
engineering stuff but like that whatever

00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:18,329
cool thanks

00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:18,329
