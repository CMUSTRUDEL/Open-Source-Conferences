00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:12,009
thank you so much to CSV conference for

00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:13,450
having me I'm a big fan of CSVs I was

00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:15,610
actually going to include a screenshot

00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:18,820
showing you that emoji data begins as a

00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:21,250
CSV and then you extract emojis and then

00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:23,740
it becomes a pretty graph but I'll spare

00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:26,740
you that I'm really I'm really excited

00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:28,660
to be here today many people ask me how

00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:30,670
did you become an emoji data scientist

00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,900
is that something you always wanted to

00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,469
be when you grew up when you were

00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,719
growing up

00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:37,120
and given that emojis weren't around

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,760
when I was growing up nor was data

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,010
science I did not always know I wanted

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,530
to be an emoji data scientist I kind of

00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:46,420
fell into this by accident because I was

00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,980
always for many years now I've been a

00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:51,069
data scientist I worked in a bunch of

00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:54,069
industries I really enjoy it I also

00:00:51,069 --> 00:00:56,140
really like emojis people remember the

00:00:54,069 --> 00:00:57,729
first time they saw a dodge must a Ford

00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,739
Mustang or the first time they saw their

00:00:57,729 --> 00:01:01,989
favorite rock star I remember the first

00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:05,829
time someone sent me a tears of joy

00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:07,570
emoji and I asked the person I asked her

00:01:05,829 --> 00:01:09,729
does this literally mean you're crying

00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:12,299
when you're laughing because I thought

00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:16,180
like what else could it possibly mean

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,590
and I mean that's how my fascination

00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,270
with emojis began and one day I realize

00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:21,549
I can actually combine my passions for

00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:23,890
emojis and data science and that's what

00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:26,289
I'll be sharing today I was really

00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,969
inspired by Angela's talk yesterday when

00:01:26,289 --> 00:01:30,520
she talked about industry data science

00:01:27,969 --> 00:01:34,570
versus indie data science and I think my

00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:36,579
journey is also one of transitioning

00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:38,950
from an industry data scientist it's

00:01:36,579 --> 00:01:40,299
like the big building I worked at

00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,700
Facebook in New York we had a huge

00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:44,560
building and it kind of looked like that

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,359
and the guy with the beaker is just like

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,299
scientists because otherwise the bar

00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:50,920
graphs just look boring to an indie data

00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:54,460
scientist which is just you know me on

00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:57,609
my laptop and I think throughout this

00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:59,619
journey the most meaningful realization

00:01:57,609 --> 00:02:02,409
I had is that I could harness my data

00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:05,140
science skills and abilities finding a

00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:06,579
good question finding data analyzing

00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,830
data cleaning that data telling the

00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:11,050
story building models which I had done

00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:12,930
in advertising and demography and brain

00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:16,019
imaging and all of these feel

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,099
where I learned a lot but I really

00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:19,140
wasn't asking questions that I

00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:20,489
personally was passionate about and I

00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,980
realized that I could use these same

00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:24,870
technical skills to answer questions

00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,280
that I personally was really curious

00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,739
about that I wanted to know that I

00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,799
thought weren't being answered and that

00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:33,450
is the story of the birth of prismo ji

00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:38,040
which is an emoji data science lab in

00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:42,060
New York so how did this begin the story

00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:44,129
I'll take you back to last summer when

00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,750
brexit happened and I was scrolling

00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:48,510
through my Facebook feed and I saw this

00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:51,120
link to an article in quartz the world's

00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:52,620
reaction to brexit in emoji and I was

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,959
super pumped when I saw this link

00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:57,239
because I was like this is so cool like

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,430
someone used emojis to understand

00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:02,040
sentiment in response to brexit I've

00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,750
always thought of doing that like oh my

00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,340
god they beat me to it but I was excited

00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,689
because I believe in open source and

00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,090
collaboration so I was like alright

00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:11,040
let's find out what they did and I read

00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,359
the actual article and this is not a

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,239
snippet of the article this is the

00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:17,849
entire article there is no data in this

00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:19,379
article as we would say when listening

00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:21,510
to an academic talk

00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:24,260
it says francois hollande one tear

00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:27,959
coming out of his face Nicola Sturgeon

00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:30,510
bicep emoji it's just a bunch of emojis

00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:32,669
and people's names that's the whole

00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:35,489
article and I read that and I was like

00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:38,250
ok this is the bar for emoji sentiment

00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:40,560
analysis it's a pretty low bar that

00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:44,310
quartz is setting over here and why

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,989
don't I try to surpass that so first I

00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:49,979
had to react to this article in emoji

00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:52,379
and that was my reaction so what I did

00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:55,409
is that I I spent the next three days

00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:58,169
engaged in a one-man hackathon I locked

00:03:55,409 --> 00:04:01,680
myself in my room drinking only water

00:03:58,169 --> 00:04:03,900
and coffee and and I just spent three

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,849
days learning how to extract how to

00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,919
download emoji how to download tweets

00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:09,810
from the Twitter API how to read that

00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,060
into our how to extract emojis from

00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:14,669
those tweets how to make graphs how to

00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:17,190
visualize that data it was like I was

00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:18,870
like on the moon it was so exciting to

00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:22,260
me because it hadn't been done before

00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:24,840
and since courts had just published this

00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:26,710
not very well done article it was timely

00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,930
so I thought if I do it right away I can

00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:31,000
published somewhere and three days later

00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:32,680
I finished the article it gets published

00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,889
in motherboard here are the most popular

00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,970
emojis from the brexit reaction and

00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:39,250
that's how I became an emoji data

00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:40,810
sciences this was the most fun I'd ever

00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:43,569
had a lot more fun than I had doing

00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:45,729
advertising research or you know working

00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:47,020
in grad school or you know doing all of

00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:49,000
the other data science I'd done this was

00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,740
really cool so let me walk you through

00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,940
some of my work on this brexit piece and

00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,620
then later on I'll talk about some of

00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:55,870
the other analyses I've done the

00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:57,819
question we were trying to answer is a

00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:59,830
simple one how do people use emojis to

00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:03,250
react to a major political event in real

00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:04,750
time and you know the first step is

00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,759
always getting the data which and

00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,800
cleaning the data which takes 80% of of

00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:10,599
the time of a data scientist as the

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,280
maximum goes and the approach was

00:05:10,599 --> 00:05:14,500
straightforward I use the Twitter API to

00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,990
sample 100,000 tweets for five hashtags

00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:19,840
related to brexit I remove three tweets

00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:21,810
I use regular expressions in our to

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,039
figure out how to extract the emojis I

00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:25,569
computed the emoji count so basically

00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:27,669
all I did is I downloaded a bunch of

00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:30,370
tweets about brexit and I counted how

00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:32,229
often each emoji appears I matched those

00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:33,520
tweets with an emoji dictionary and I

00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:35,169
figure out what is the count of each

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,090
emoji in this data set and then I

00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:39,430
compare that with with a control group

00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:39,909
with a baseline I use the sky emoji

00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,409
tracker

00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:43,570
Matthew Rothenberg who's built a great

00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:45,430
site which has every emoji that's ever

00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:47,680
been tweeted in the past five years so

00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:49,240
that gives you a baseline of how popular

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,270
are these emojis in general yeah that

00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,759
was my reaction to and then I also

00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:56,969
looked at the hashtags in these tweets

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:59,229
so high level these are the emojis that

00:05:56,969 --> 00:06:01,270
these are the top 10 emojis people use

00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:03,370
to talk about brexit and the ones in

00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:05,830
blue are the ones that over index on

00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:08,320
brexit and this is my first time playing

00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:10,840
around with emoji data this is untested

00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:13,150
code I'd hacked it together and the how

00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,979
that thing heard that made me happiest

00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:16,630
is that the flag of the UK is and number

00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:18,789
two on the list which tells me that my

00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:21,219
code worked so it was the flag of Papua

00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:23,349
New Guinea then my 72-hour hackathon

00:06:21,219 --> 00:06:26,349
would have been a waste um and I would

00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:27,759
have to start from scratch so that was

00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:29,770
cool what was also cool to me is that

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,360
there's a lot of there's a tremendous

00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:33,669
diversity of reaction in the set of

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,289
emojis you have positive emojis thumbs

00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:37,750
up and the clapping hand sign the heart

00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:39,339
you have sad emojis that the crying face

00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,900
the pensive face you have the see no

00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:43,659
evil monkey

00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:45,610
there's a lot of variety here and this

00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:47,229
is something real this is bricks it like

00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:48,729
people's lives were changed like Europe

00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:50,289
is figuring out how much of a penalty

00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:53,470
they're going to assess on Britain and

00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:55,090
here are people on Twitter using emojis

00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:56,949
to react to something that's happening

00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:58,599
in real life and is affecting them

00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:00,250
tremendously so this was really

00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:01,960
heartening for me because I think a lot

00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:04,030
of people who don't work don't use

00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,650
emojis think emojis happen just in a

00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:07,870
vacuum randomly people are just randomly

00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:09,310
picking emojis but no emojis actually

00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:12,580
correlate with the emotions people are

00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:14,409
trying to express another thing we did

00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:17,259
is we came up with the idea of a hashtag

00:07:14,409 --> 00:07:19,180
signature of a given emoji so we had

00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:21,940
five different hashtags we looked at not

00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:24,639
my vote vote remain EU rested and vote

00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:26,860
leave spanning the the spectrum from pro

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,020
brexit to anti brexit and then I figured

00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:30,550
out across our entire dataset what is

00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,020
the distribution of these hashtags and

00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:34,120
it's something like this and then I

00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,580
asked myself for a given emoji what is

00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,750
this distribution look like and

00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:40,569
comparing those two allows me to

00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:42,479
understand how are people using certain

00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:45,849
emojis to express certain emotions and

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,680
the findings are really intuitive and

00:07:45,849 --> 00:07:49,479
that also makes them interesting so you

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,120
find that the British flag heavily over

00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:53,830
indexes on vote leaves people are much

00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,120
more likely to include the British flag

00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:57,310
when they're using the hashtag vote

00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,469
leave I'm suggesting it's a it's a sign

00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,819
of patriotism or nationalism the party

00:07:59,469 --> 00:08:03,699
popper emoji people who are using

00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:06,039
patently one day tweet vote leave and

00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:07,919
when people tweet vote remain they're

00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:09,849
crying it's the loudly crying emoji

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,409
subsequent research has shown that the

00:08:09,849 --> 00:08:13,990
loudly crying emoji with the two tears

00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:16,060
is often ironic so we'll have to explore

00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:18,460
that in future in future research and

00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,659
it's also the praying emoji because when

00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:21,460
brexit first happened a lot of people

00:08:19,659 --> 00:08:23,319
didn't know what they voted for there

00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,520
was a lot of like voter regret so there

00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:26,020
was thought of it they were going to do

00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,969
a do-over this is like the day after a

00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,500
brexit um they didn't end up doing that

00:08:27,969 --> 00:08:31,569
of course but here you see people are

00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:34,479
praying for a do-over which is like

00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:35,709
really cool um here are emojis and

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,050
people are using them to express their

00:08:35,709 --> 00:08:39,370
emotions about a real-time event so that

00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:41,140
was my first step as an emoji data

00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:44,079
scientist and I was like this is cool

00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:45,190
what else should I work on and then one

00:08:44,079 --> 00:08:48,910
day I don't know if you guys listen to

00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:50,529
pop music my friends I have a younger

00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,820
sister who's in high school they also

00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:53,610
are telling me about a feud between

00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,680
Kanye West and Taylor Swift

00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:58,800
and that is my next does anyone know

00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,970
what I'm talking about oh wow awesome a

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,290
few people know what I'm talking about

00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,700
awesome when I give this talk to high

00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:05,399
school students everyone starts jumping

00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,110
up and down at this point so that was my

00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:08,670
next emoji analysis the data scientist

00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:10,890
emoji guy to Kanye West and Taylor Swift

00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:13,820
and a quick backstory is that Taylor and

00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:17,579
Kanye had had a pretty serious beef

00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:18,720
Kanye West used mentioned Taylor Swift

00:09:17,579 --> 00:09:21,390
in one of his songs in a derogatory

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,269
manner he claimed he had her permission

00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:26,490
to do that and she denied that she said

00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:28,350
he's making that up he's insulting me

00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:30,480
and then Kim Kardashian jumped in and

00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:32,820
she released a leaked snapchat video of

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,790
Taylor giving him permission to use that

00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:37,560
tweet Justin Bieber jumped in like maybe

00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:40,110
Drake even jumped in it was like a huge

00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:43,140
huge controversy in the hip-hop world

00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:44,700
and I was like okay this is really cool

00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:46,170
because I'm really curious to know how

00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:49,200
people are using emojis to talk about

00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:50,339
this controversy so what I did is I

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,350
looked at tweets mentioning Taylor

00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:54,110
tweets mentioning Kanye and I looked at

00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:57,510
the top five emojis in these streets and

00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:59,279
what's really interesting here is the

00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:01,890
thing that immediately jumps out is the

00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:03,360
snake emoji a lot of people are using

00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:04,949
the snake in woody to tweet about Taylor

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,570
and for you guys who've been following

00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:08,940
the controversy it's because people said

00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:10,920
Taylor was a snake she was lying she was

00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,510
ungrateful to Kanye she couldn't be

00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,850
trusted and that was the meaning of the

00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:17,760
snake emoji this got so serious that

00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:19,620
Instagram for 24 hours banned any

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,660
comments with the snake emoji on Taylor

00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:24,089
Swift's profile because something like

00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:25,440
80,000 or maybe 800,000 people were

00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:27,390
leaving snake comments on Taylor's

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,380
Instagram and like they banned that

00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,880
because she thought she called that

00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:32,490
cyberbullying and she appealed to

00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:35,880
instagrams like you know directors and

00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:37,610
yeah like that that got pretty real so

00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:41,100
another way of visualizing this data is

00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:42,990
if you plot each emoji on a spectrum

00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,670
where the farther to the left it is the

00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:46,800
more likely it is to be used in a tweet

00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:48,390
mentioning Taylor Swift and the farther

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,850
to the right it is the more likely it is

00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:52,140
to be used with Kanye and here again you

00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:54,779
see something really interesting is that

00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:56,820
the the more feminine emojis the pink

00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:59,339
hearts the Purple Heart the rose the

00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,540
kiss they're heavily more likely they're

00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:03,089
much more likely to be used in tweets

00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:04,380
mentioning Taylor Swift the snake emoji

00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:06,400
of course is there also that's the snake

00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:09,790
bottom because it shouldn't be there

00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:11,320
um the heart is there Kanye West doesn't

00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:12,910
really have his emoji action isn't that

00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,700
interesting in comparison he has the lit

00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:18,880
fire which people use with Kanye West

00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:21,190
um this got me thinking I wonder if

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,690
there is a common emoji language we use

00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:25,840
when we talk about our favorite

00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:28,000
celebrities as DJ Khaled's would say

00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,820
what are the emojis we used to talk

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,190
about fan love that's his term for how

00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:36,100
we adore our favorite celebrities so I

00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:39,040
extended this by looking at five

00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:40,540
celebrities and I looked at the top five

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,820
emojis people used to talk about them

00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:44,320
and the fascinating thing here they

00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:46,810
might be a little too small for you guys

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,860
to see is that four of the five emojis

00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:49,510
are the same for four of these

00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:51,160
celebrities it's the heart eyes emoji

00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:53,350
it's the red heart it's tears of joy

00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:55,000
it's loudly crying emoji which is

00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:56,260
fascinating because there's no collusion

00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,210
happening between all these people

00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:00,130
tweeting about these celebrities this is

00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:02,680
just a free market it's chaos it's like

00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:04,060
a bun 250,000 people tweeting about how

00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,010
much they like there's these celebrities

00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:08,560
and they're all a lot of them are using

00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:10,120
the same emojis that's crazy because we

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,100
don't learn emojis in school we learn

00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,480
words in school but no one is teaching

00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,800
these people that when you talk about

00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,140
your favorite celebrity use the heart

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,390
eyes emoji it's just this is like order

00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:21,460
coming out of chaos this is like and

00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:23,950
it's public data it's open data it's all

00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:25,720
out there it's like it's staring us in

00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:27,850
the face it was just waiting we just

00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,980
needs to be analyzing it's like that's

00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:31,240
really cool obviously the interesting

00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,220
scientific question is how does this

00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,720
order emerge from this chaos how do you

00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,490
are all these people using these same

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,720
emojis are they using them to mean the

00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:39,820
same things and I think there's a lot of

00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,470
interesting research to be done there we

00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:44,110
also see uniqueness right Beyonce has

00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:46,630
the queen bee emoji Justin Bieber people

00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:48,250
use the fire emoji Drake is very

00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:50,950
interesting because his number one emoji

00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:52,360
is the tears of joy and after doing this

00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:54,430
I googled why's everyone laughing at

00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:56,170
Drake and apparently he had challenged

00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:58,750
someone to a rap battle and like Twitter

00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:00,700
just attacked him for that yeah it was

00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:03,460
not good and DJ colleges in the middle

00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:05,080
he's a man on his own his emojis are

00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:07,990
unique to him he has his own unique

00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:09,220
emoji signature and many folks have

00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:10,750
picked up on this now this is big

00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:13,570
everyone's talking about DJ called in

00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:15,370
his unique emojis because he talks about

00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:17,320
major keys to success he talks about

00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:18,970
bless up he talks about give thanks to

00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,380
the sky like he has all of these

00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:22,360
motivational sayings

00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:26,050
and people just associate emojis with

00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:27,370
those sayings which is really cool I in

00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,980
just a few minutes I want to talk about

00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:32,710
some of the more recent work I've done

00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:34,240
III did some work on Election Day a much

00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:36,820
more sensitive topic to many of us in

00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,830
this room and what was really

00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,360
interesting to me and I think just

00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:42,880
looking at it from a bit of a high level

00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,200
is that sweets are our data right

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,490
they're structured data but it's just a

00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,520
bunch of data floating around in the

00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:50,440
ether and how do we make sense of that

00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,850
data that's the question right and the

00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,260
thing is natural language processing is

00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:54,850
hard so if you try to analyze the

00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,680
sentiment of tweets based on the words

00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:58,600
in those streets it's really hard for a

00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,760
computer to do that so what happens in

00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,590
most journalism about tweets is very

00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,420
anecdotal it's like oh today people on

00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:06,100
Twitter are saying X Y & Z and it's

00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:07,780
based entirely on the social networks of

00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:10,180
those journalists it's not based on

00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:12,370
rigorous data and I think this is a it's

00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:15,430
a first step in applying that type of

00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:18,220
rigorous data science rigorous data

00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:20,740
analysis to understanding what social

00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:24,640
media reaction is on a given topic so

00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:27,490
without any further ado this is emoji

00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:29,380
reaction on election night looking only

00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:32,610
at tweets after midnight eastern time

00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:34,840
and the emojis to the left are more

00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:37,300
likely to be used in tweets mentioning

00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,740
every Clinton and the emojis to the

00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,690
right are more likely to be using tweets

00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:42,400
mentioning Donald Trump and when I

00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:45,310
looked at this it's just like I wanted

00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:47,530
to cry it's just beautiful um because

00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:50,020
this is like what three Himalayan tweets

00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:51,460
like crazy data like someone could write

00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:53,830
a PhD dissertation on how do you

00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:55,180
summarize half a million tweets you

00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:57,370
couldn't teach a computer to do that in

00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,900
a sensible way and here all I do is I

00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:01,030
look at the emojis and I plot their

00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:03,310
frequencies and I get this amazingly

00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:04,570
fascinating credible plot where the

00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:06,430
emojis that are used with Hillary

00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:10,210
Clinton are sad emojis they're deeply

00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:12,100
crying distressed praying emojis but the

00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:14,440
heart emoji the blue heart the broken

00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:16,690
heart it's like all emojis like of

00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,340
people really sad that Hillary lost and

00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:21,340
then you look on the Trump side and

00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:23,620
there's a there's a huge there's a huge

00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:25,420
binary going on where you have happy

00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:27,970
emojis you have the party popper emoji

00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:29,500
the hundred the the train which is like

00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:31,450
I think the make America great train

00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:33,040
emoji people use that train and then

00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:34,180
there's also a lot of anger there's like

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,830
what just happened there's

00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:38,050
rolling eyes there's the middle finger

00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:41,380
emoji which I had never seen prior to

00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:43,570
this work use in the wild this was like

00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:46,800
a sighting of the middle finger emoji in

00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:49,510
the wild and that was really cool to me

00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:52,839
another way of looking at this is if you

00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:54,550
look at the time course of reaction in

00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:56,890
tweets mentioning Hillary Clinton so

00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:58,720
everything on the left is was used more

00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:00,250
in tweets before midnight everything on

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,440
the right was used more in tweets after

00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:04,660
midnight and here you can see that in a

00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,339
very crude fashion how that emotion

00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:08,620
shifted over the day we're throughout

00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:12,520
the day it was you know happy like you

00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:14,500
got this girl like biceps emoji kissy

00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:16,899
face and then after midnight it's just

00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:21,100
like night and day which is like amazing

00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:22,720
to me I also looked at for specific

00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:25,270
emojis and did a more intricate time

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,640
series and here you see something a few

00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:29,980
interesting things the American flag

00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:33,430
emoji spikes in pleats mentioning Trump

00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:35,050
after the results are announced the

00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:36,250
middle finger emoji also spikes and

00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:39,279
tweets mentioning Trump after the

00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:43,000
results are announced the loudly crying

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:44,320
emoji is is heavily is very heavy for

00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,060
inputs mentioning Hillary Clinton

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,260
starting at 10:00 p.m. because people

00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,910
are seeing the results are not going the

00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:51,940
right way and the most interesting thing

00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:54,160
the prey emoji is used at about 10:30

00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:55,630
p.m. 10:30 to 11:00 in tweets mentioning

00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,010
Hillary Clinton because that's when

00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:58,870
people thought Michigan or Pennsylvania

00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:00,430
might turn the other way and they

00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:03,940
thought Hillary could eke out a victory

00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:06,370
a lot of this is storytelling on my part

00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:07,480
ivory I dabble in storytelling but I

00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:10,120
think what's so interesting here is that

00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:12,040
process of taking raw data and finding

00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,540
an interesting story and communicating

00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,980
it back to the public that's what

00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:16,240
excites me so much about emoji data

00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,860
science and emoji data journalism

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,689
because this work isn't buried in a

00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:21,280
journal somewhere it's not buried in the

00:17:19,689 --> 00:17:22,449
confines of a major tech company where

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,490
it's never going to see the light of day

00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:25,449
it's just out there for the public to

00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:27,520
make of it what they will

00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:32,590
and hopefully be inspired to play around

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:34,090
with emoji data on their own this is

00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:35,800
just a quick you know summary idea of

00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:38,200
the divided emoji States of America

00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,429
where you know I think word clouds are

00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,080
also really interesting where you see

00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:42,880
how are people using these emojis and

00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,919
you see the thumbs up you know

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,790
congratulations mr. president make

00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:47,620
America great again

00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:50,440
the middle finger is just

00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:52,300
I don't know if I'm allowed to say that

00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,680
word but yeah whatever it's you know the

00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,390
street is Trump the people

00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:57,309
who voted him and the people who didn't

00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:58,840
vote at all middle finger emoji that's

00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:00,730
like a mic drop tweet right there that's

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,830
like that's really cool

00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:05,020
and then the thinking face emoji which

00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:07,660
is like what just happened

00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:09,580
and it's just so fascinating like

00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:11,020
people's emotional lives are represented

00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:12,670
in the emojis they use that that's what

00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:14,470
seems to me the burning story here and I

00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:16,990
think that's really fascinating I'll

00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:20,230
just talk briefly about my last piece of

00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:22,809
analysis I did which is on emojis of

00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:24,250
resistance so this is right after the

00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:26,020
the Muslim band the travel ban was

00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:28,420
announced there were all these protests

00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:30,970
happening at the airports and I live in

00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:33,670
New York my sister works for the city

00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:35,350
government so we went to the JFK and she

00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:36,760
huddled with the with the lawyers and

00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:38,710
she's like you know doing government

00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:41,309
stuff I'm just like I'm an emoji data

00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:43,720
scientist can I help anyone here and uh

00:18:41,309 --> 00:18:48,850
you know the lawyers didn't really know

00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:50,440
what to make of me and and I said uh you

00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:53,110
know I watch a lot of law and order if

00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:55,630
that helps and it did not help it did

00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:57,280
not help so so I went back home and I

00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:58,929
did another you know one-man hackathon

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,400
this time it took like six hours because

00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:02,440
I've been doing it for a while I'm much

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,090
better at it and I looked at emojis

00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:06,610
people use one there when they're using

00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:07,960
these protest hashtags so the hashtags

00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:10,360
that were big that weekend were no band

00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:12,400
no wall not my president the resistance

00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,960
women's March it also just happened so a

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,030
lot of people were still using that

00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:18,040
hashtag and here I looked at the emojis

00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:20,440
people use when they use these these

00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:23,260
protest hashtags and the interesting

00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:25,300
thing here is that it's the fist emoji I

00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:28,000
mean that was my main finding but it's

00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:30,670
also the American flag it's also the red

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,020
heart which is counterintuitive to a lot

00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,820
of people who think protesters are

00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:36,429
coming from a place of anger or a place

00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:37,780
of anti-americanism but if you just look

00:19:36,429 --> 00:19:41,350
at the emojis they're using a lot of

00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:43,840
people are using patriotic emojis to

00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:46,090
talk about how this ban is not in line

00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,610
with our values and I thought that was a

00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:51,160
really cool way of looking at it here

00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:52,840
are some examples of tweets here's a

00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:55,120
tweet of the Statue of Liberty hugging a

00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,800
young woman in a hijab and the kinda

00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:00,260
tweet is such a beautiful picture heart

00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:01,850
emoji American flag emoji Muslim hash

00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:04,880
like Muslim Ben hashtag no Ben no wall

00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:06,380
hashtag not my president which is just

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,570
really cool I think this is the kind of

00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:09,770
stuff that you know so one of the

00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:11,630
limitations of this work is it's only

00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:13,250
using Twitter data I think next steps

00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:16,100
are to extend this using Instagram other

00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:17,660
social platforms and I think there's

00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:20,600
just so many interesting directions to

00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:21,040
take this kind of work in speaking of

00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,240
which

00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:25,700
speaking of open data science you guys

00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:27,710
to all of you and girls can become an

00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:29,480
emoji data scientist not collectively

00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:32,030
you can become individual emoji data

00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:34,430
scientists I released there's a tutorial

00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:37,220
on our site Prizmo chicom emoji data

00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:38,840
science and are all of this latest the

00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:40,820
code for this latest analysis is open

00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,080
source you can download the data I walk

00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:45,530
you through step by step how to download

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,790
tweets how to extract emojis and what

00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:48,320
really excites me about this work is

00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:49,850
that I think when we talk about open

00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,010
source and open science and open

00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:53,570
journalism the idea of accessibility is

00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:56,360
really important to me and I think

00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:58,280
making data science seem complicated is

00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:00,770
easy making it seem highly technical and

00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:02,390
like you need five PhDs and like you

00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:04,670
need to know deep learning and you need

00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:06,860
to be how from 2001 a Space Odyssey

00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:08,300
that's easy to do but it's hard to take

00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:10,520
something so complicated and make it

00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,660
make it accessible make it resonate so

00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:14,030
when I give this presentation to high

00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:15,620
school students to college students data

00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:16,670
science they would have been there there

00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,750
would have been like what is that but

00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:19,670
when they see this like oh this is

00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:21,020
really cool this is a tool a powerful

00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:22,880
set of tools for me that understand my

00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:24,260
world it's so it's a way for me to go

00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,200
out and look at the questions I care

00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:28,760
about and and find data on them and I

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,710
think it's a powerful educational tool

00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:33,560
and that's why I enjoy giving a lot of

00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:35,270
these talks you know some quick next

00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:37,430
step study emoji usage across countries

00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:39,740
and cultures the interesting thing is

00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:41,600
that all of this is public emoji usage

00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:43,580
whereas for most people their most

00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,200
meaningful emoji usages in private

00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:47,600
conversations so that's a whole other

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,950
ballgame obviously getting that date I

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,390
think some academics are beginning to

00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:53,360
try to figure out ways of getting that

00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:54,350
data I'm in an informed manner but I

00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,730
think that's a whole other because

00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:57,260
that's what we really want to know right

00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:59,300
when she sends you that heart eyes emoji

00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:01,730
like is she flirting with you is she

00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:04,970
just like what does that even mean um

00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:06,650
and yeah I think this is a starting

00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:08,090
point and then also using this as a

00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:10,130
kickoff point to just dive deep into
