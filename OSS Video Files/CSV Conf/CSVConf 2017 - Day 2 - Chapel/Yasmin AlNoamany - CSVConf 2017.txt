I hope everybody sees me seriously like

00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:14,969
behind us and I'm yes Menominee a

00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:19,500
postdoc fellow as Denver to California

00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:21,480
of Berkeley and today I'm going to talk

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,369
about how to combine the storytelling

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,050
with with archives so hopefully we can

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:26,340
show something cool like the theme of

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:30,330
the contest was the spirit of the

00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:33,960
conference and out of you know like this

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:38,820
pouring web archive so I'm going to

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:42,750
start with a story here so if you recall

00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:44,550
at January 2011 something big happened

00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,579
in Egypt it was the Egyptian revolution

00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:52,469
and at this time I was here in the USA

00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:54,690
starting my PhD and but I was you know

00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,910
like able to follow everything that was

00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:01,079
happening at the time because everything

00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:03,690
started on Facebook and on social media

00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,460
and the web so I was able to witness

00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:08,250
everything like what's happening there

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:12,680
at the time and my son music was in this

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:15,479
picture he was - at this time and

00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:19,320
apparently he had a you know like very

00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:21,450
short memory and he wouldn't like

00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,590
remember anything of what was happening

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,490
at that time

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:28,560
so I started to worry like how he didn't

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:31,020
know what what was happening as I'm

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,909
living it now I wasn't in Egypt and I

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,159
was like very sad that I wasn't there

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:38,220
but I was able to really see everything

00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,650
all the stores and from in Alaska all

00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,270
the sides because we have over there

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,009
like we have like different sites like

00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,070
what's happening here in the election so

00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:48,990
I won't explain this a very much no II

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,860
understand you understand what I'm

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:54,869
talking about

00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:57,509
so I started to think like how can I

00:01:54,869 --> 00:02:00,299
have had in you know like when has he

00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:05,159
and his generation like to know what was

00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:06,899
happening when they grow so honestly I

00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,030
start with myself like generating some

00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:10,979
initiative for you know like

00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,620
archiving some stuff about the Egyptian

00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:14,599
revolution and also I

00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:16,580
there are other initiatives initiative

00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:19,549
effort documenting the Egyptian of

00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:21,769
solution okay so I'm plying with that

00:02:19,549 --> 00:02:23,930
and several others and looks like

00:02:21,769 --> 00:02:26,629
appears afterwards and cited digital

00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:29,569
records but these repositories were gone

00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:31,940
like the horrible death of like videos

00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:34,700
images of what was happening in Tahrir

00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:37,190
Square and everything in Egypt like they

00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,079
are totally unavailable now of the life

00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:42,829
web

00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:44,230
so how many of you have fears about the

00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:49,280
alternate archives

00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:52,099
okay great and archive it okay

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:55,310
so for those who don't know what's

00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:57,230
archived it a subscription service from

00:02:55,310 --> 00:03:00,290
the Internet Archive that allows people

00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:02,690
to generate archives of collection as

00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:05,140
that follow specific theme or about

00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:07,790
specific events for example the reason

00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:09,500
there is a collection as archivist about

00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:12,769
the Egyptian revolution and lucky I

00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:14,989
found as a some of these representatives

00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:19,190
that were gone from the real life work

00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:21,109
they are archived on archivist so yeah

00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:24,620
archives of elections are important for

00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:26,299
the future generations but I know that

00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:29,720
some of you told me like I have used

00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:31,700
this a like using archivist is not easy

00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:34,069
or using what archives is not easy and

00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:36,500
actually I have done a study on this and

00:03:34,069 --> 00:03:39,990
I discovered that the people they don't

00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:41,620
go and navigate web archives easily so

00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:45,049
[Music]

00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:47,090
so yeah after suppose excuse us of 13

00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:50,319
years you would know about archivist and

00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:53,599
you would go there and try like to type

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:55,819
some like standard like some terms like

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,989
Egypt's revolution to to look for

00:03:55,819 --> 00:04:00,680
something about the Egyptian revolution

00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:03,019
so this is the interface of archivist

00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:07,040
and here just like have list of

00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:08,599
collections and okay he will be

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,400
presented with different collections

00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:12,049
about the Egyptian revolution so there

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,000
are like three or four collections about

00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:16,220
the Egyptian revolution so I'm going to

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,079
pick one of them that I see that this is

00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:20,000
the most relevant one based on the

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,490
description and by the way some of these

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,330
collections they even don't have any

00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,970
description

00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:28,400
and what's inside these collections so I

00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:32,449
pick one of them and then I take the

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:35,270
first URI okay suppose dance music and

00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:38,629
after many years III wasn't like there

00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:40,819
during the Egyptian revolutions so I'm

00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:42,919
going here just to understand what was

00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:45,770
happening and I clicked on a page and

00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:48,800
then this page okay I am presented now

00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:51,409
with another list of slide dates so

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:55,129
these are different public servers that

00:04:51,409 --> 00:04:57,289
they are I I choose and suppose I'm

00:04:55,129 --> 00:05:00,530
going to life click any one randomly and

00:04:57,289 --> 00:05:03,020
then I see presented with this page so

00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:04,520
for understanding was inside this

00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,349
collection I have to go through all of

00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,349
these pages actually to understand

00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:10,159
what's inside this collection so

00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:12,770
understanding the content of these

00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:20,120
collections is not easy for regular

00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:23,199
users so we tried you know like after I

00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:26,539
joined my PhD I tried first to like

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,069
applies the conventional methods

00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:30,560
visualization methods on these

00:05:28,069 --> 00:05:33,469
collections but it was really hard to

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,479
internalize when it when the the problem

00:05:33,469 --> 00:05:38,150
comes to like thousand to feed your

00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:39,919
islands and thousands of copies for this

00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:41,900
your eyes and you want to visualize them

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,639
all of them together to understand

00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:46,099
what's inside the solution it's really

00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:47,900
it's really hard so we have to think

00:05:46,099 --> 00:05:49,279
about some other ways to understand

00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:52,129
circulation so we thought about

00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:54,139
storytelling and here I'm not talking

00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:56,389
about like stories as it means in the

00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:59,719
this creature so I'm talking about it

00:05:56,389 --> 00:06:01,460
like as with its loose like contact

00:05:59,719 --> 00:06:03,830
sense of social media attitude and I

00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:05,750
actually I have here's like tours here

00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:07,810
for all the previous books so this is

00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:12,080
what I'm talking about

00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:14,659
so sorry storytelling become like very

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,969
popular in institution media and you

00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:19,009
know it have been you like used now

00:06:16,969 --> 00:06:21,770
because of the sheer volume of

00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:24,469
information to it so for example like

00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:26,750
Facebook look back they are able like to

00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:28,699
summarize you're like a year or

00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:31,779
something in just like one minute video

00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:33,390
and there are you know like many

00:06:31,779 --> 00:06:35,640
services I love you

00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:38,250
summarize and select and pick and choose

00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:41,550
represented videos or tweets to generate

00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:43,770
narratives or stories but this is

00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:48,090
storytelling you have limitations so let

00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:50,040
me show you so this is a Egyptian

00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:55,230
revolution the story on a platform

00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:57,660
coldest 35 and 35 is the one of the most

00:06:55,230 --> 00:07:02,310
popular storytelling services it allows

00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:05,520
people so can I get for it allow people

00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:07,500
to generate narratives like out

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,010
substitution media contents mainly or

00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,780
any web pages I think most of the

00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:13,170
journalistic use of story point right

00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,350
now

00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:18,420
so because it's very easy framework

00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:21,210
allow people to drag and drop resources

00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:24,870
and generate like big narratives about a

00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:27,090
specific topic so this is supposes this

00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:30,480
is a story that I'm interested in

00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:32,790
learning about and I'm like browsing the

00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:35,040
story and then I came to one of the or

00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:37,830
eyes and this and I really want to know

00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:40,560
more about this URI and then I go to

00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:42,870
this your eye and I get 404 and I'm sure

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:47,120
that's all of us like get this most of

00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:50,520
the time so yeah this is the program of

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:53,340
storytelling so the resources are not

00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:56,010
persistent and web archives are not easy

00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:58,170
to use so we say we thought about like

00:07:56,010 --> 00:08:00,360
okay what about combining them to

00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:02,100
generate like it's stories but there's a

00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:07,130
sense stories so we're going to use like

00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:07,130
storytelling service services thank you

00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:20,160
- you know for visualizing the stories

00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:24,270
that we will generate from archives of

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:27,300
collections so this is an example for

00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:30,630
what the outputs we targeted so I went

00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,770
to Storify I sorry I went to archive

00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,599
with collections the Egyptian revolution

00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:35,880
and I know this collection very well

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,339
because even I have been studying this

00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:42,539
collection since it started in 2011 and

00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:45,270
it's running till now so I went and I

00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:47,370
tried to select specific pages that may

00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:49,830
tell the story of the 14 days of the

00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:51,930
Egyptian revolution so hopefully my son

00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:53,610
can you know like find something when he

00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:55,620
grows so okay

00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:57,930
I took hours and hours for generating

00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:59,940
this like to go through all day or eyes

00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:01,620
and even you know I have background of

00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,990
the topic and I know the collection

00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:06,600
variable and but it took me hours to

00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:11,220
like select the best represented pages

00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:14,010
that represent the story so how can we

00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:16,850
generate this automatically this is the

00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:19,200
main thing of my topic here so before I

00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:20,970
take you to the steps that's how we

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,180
generated this automatically let me

00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:26,160
first like start to show you the types

00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:28,770
of the stories that can be generated

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,209
from archives of collections and I know

00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:32,820
that there are many journalists here

00:09:30,209 --> 00:09:35,820
today which is expect but I think this

00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:37,670
is would be interesting for you so the

00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:40,500
archival collection has two dimensions

00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:42,720
so it has list of your eyes and your

00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,660
eyes have like each year I have the

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,000
front line so you are eyes on signs they

00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:50,970
can be sexist or sliding and these on

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,880
this we came up with four types of

00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:56,970
stories that can be generated so the

00:09:53,880 --> 00:10:00,690
first type of the story is face to page

00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:03,660
effects design this is like if I'm I

00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:06,240
want to like now like I requested key

00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:08,370
and end from my desktop my browser at

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,440
this and my on my desktop machine it

00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:13,100
will give me the trance representation

00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:16,050
for the page if you know then if I

00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:18,690
requested this the same page from my

00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:20,550
mobile so you know different

00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:22,709
representations for the same page at the

00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:23,340
same time so this can be having like

00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:27,510
also

00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:30,690
some life if I'm here in the state and I

00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:32,220
saw Google calm it gives me the France

00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:34,940
representation other than you know like

00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:37,200
if an on the Middle East so

00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:41,100
unfortunately this is not supported

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:44,670
right now by what archiving so we can't

00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:48,180
really generate this type of story the

00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:50,670
second one is like when you try to fix

00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:52,860
the page and slide the time so for

00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:54,900
example here if you want to know

00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:58,170
everything about the Egyptian revolution

00:10:54,900 --> 00:11:00,390
decade events but from specific websites

00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:02,850
so I don't I want to know everything as

00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:05,310
it appears on the BBC so I start CDC

00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:07,830
more than Houston you stumble so I want

00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:10,590
to know everything from the BBC or I

00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:13,590
want to see how a specific page like my

00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:18,750
personal home page how it evolved over

00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:21,330
time like over the years so so here I

00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:23,400
like satisfy specific page and then it

00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:27,270
gives me like the same page at the same

00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:28,770
time so the third side here is when I

00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:31,380
slice the page and take the time and

00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:36,060
this is very interesting for humanism

00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:38,370
you know historians because here there

00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:41,100
are many studies actually they went

00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:44,010
manually at all the newspapers and try

00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:47,520
to like you know compare between the

00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:49,710
opinions of the country newspaper as a

00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:53,910
different you know like time that the

00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:56,970
Egyptian revolution so so for example a

00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:59,400
house a newspaper to the ice to Mubarak

00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:02,490
resigning so you know like the to

00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:04,080
Mubarak newspapers actually yeah there

00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:06,630
are many shapes of studies that showing

00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:08,850
the importance of this story here and

00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:10,560
this is really important for your

00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:12,930
analysis to compare between the Penta

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:18,000
newspaper and their coverage about a

00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:19,920
specific event so the first one is the

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,160
sliding V the sliding time and here I

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:27,570
just want to produce to coverage

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:29,580
possible for a specific event so this is

00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:32,790
the framework that we propose for

00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:35,400
generating as before three types of the

00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:36,120
stories and since today is a archives

00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,270
like Kino

00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:42,089
suppose that the first one so as the

00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:45,360
framework it has three main components

00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:47,279
so first we establish a baseline of what

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,279
human generated the stories would look

00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:52,740
like and then I will use the candidates

00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:55,320
pool of archives of collection sorry of

00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:57,000
archive age and then we select best

00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,600
representative ages from these

00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,870
collections so I will walk you through

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,310
some of these and steps very quickly

00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:07,260
because there are much detail and Here I

00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:08,730
am citing like all the works that have

00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,740
all the details about this so you can

00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:12,839
like go and see them so first

00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:16,830
establishing a baseline of social media

00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:19,560
stories so we grabbed like thousands of

00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:21,630
stories from Storify and we defined the

00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:24,660
popular ones based on the views you know

00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:27,779
over the time as if they have been on

00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:31,050
the web and then we measured like the

00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:32,760
length of these stories like what the

00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:34,680
type of the resources in these stories

00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:37,380
to get a template of you know how do

00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:41,279
people has generated stories on social

00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:45,390
media so what we got from this or the

00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:48,870
summary here is that 28 likes pages for

00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:50,640
the story and is a good number so most

00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:53,220
of the popular stories and Storify like

00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:56,910
are around 28 and people tend to have

00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:59,070
like more images you know and they're

00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:02,760
like the resources they generate or they

00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:04,830
collect on the story fine so the second

00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:07,140
part here is to reduce the candidates

00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:09,420
you know like full archive the pages

00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:11,520
that we have instance we started by

00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:13,560
detecting the October page because the

00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:16,800
collection has October business and I'm

00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:19,920
going to show you this this is one of

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,959
the pages for one of the most you know

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,250
like famous figures at the time of the

00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:25,890
Egyptian revolution he wasn't a

00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:28,470
presidential candidate and this page is

00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:30,990
one of the wages of the Egyptian

00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:34,350
revolution collection at archivist so

00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:37,440
this page has like two thousand

00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:40,980
subscribers through time and as you see

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:43,350
here that this page you can it has you

00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,690
know like many copies that are off topic

00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:47,790
for many reasons like for example it

00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:49,230
went off topic because of database or it

00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:52,500
went off topic because

00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:54,630
a financial problem this is the ticket

00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:58,590
and arabic and believe me it's like

00:14:54,630 --> 00:15:00,510
translating it correctly and also and

00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:02,220
then it went on topic again and then it

00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:04,230
came back off topic because of like

00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:06,600
hacking or because of the Dominions loss

00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:09,990
so there are actually many reasons for a

00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:13,560
basis to become off-topic archive it

00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:16,350
provides their partners with tool to you

00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:19,380
know like specify the frequency and as a

00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:21,960
depth of scrolling the beaches but there

00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:24,570
is no like control or there is no lies

00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:27,600
notification when these pages goes off

00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:29,940
topic so we propose or we evaluate the

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,370
six methods to discover these off topic

00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:34,380
pages and you know life execute them

00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:37,200
away from the collection because i'm

00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:39,480
sure that if anyone like want to see a

00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:42,060
story they wouldn't fly be happy to be

00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:44,640
presented to any of these pages so we

00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:47,640
exclude them and just select the on

00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:50,220
topic pages and yeah there are a lot of

00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:53,190
details here as you can go in a life to

00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:55,790
my petition please more about it and i'd

00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:59,100
be happy to talk about it either and

00:15:55,790 --> 00:16:03,060
also as the page happens that it can be

00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:04,800
it can have like difference or so many

00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:07,350
duplicates through time because the page

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:10,080
as the content of the page you know the

00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:12,210
frequency of the call can be like weekly

00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:14,730
or daily or every few minutes and the

00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:17,010
page may not a change at this time so

00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:22,160
italian just as there can be a duplicate

00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:25,080
so we also remove the duplicate and then

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,270
we select the best representative pages

00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:31,830
and we specify the best representative

00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:33,300
based on a quality metrics here so we

00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:36,240
came up with the center quality

00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:38,790
variables and don't look at the equation

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,920
so don't worry about it you don't have

00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:43,380
life supposedly with the equation i'm

00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:45,650
going you know this is much better so

00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:49,650
this is one of the metrics here it's a

00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:52,170
is a quality of them the page itself so

00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:53,700
some pages when the people or when the

00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:56,880
bridges are being prose does internet

00:16:53,700 --> 00:17:01,500
archive and many of them actually they

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:02,320
are like the one on the right and i want

00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,839
to ask you like

00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,610
which one do you think is this order

00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:08,530
smithing resources the ones right and

00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:11,170
the one in the list so the one on the

00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:14,980
right no okay

00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:19,510
so the ones that if okay and the one

00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:21,490
like it either anyways okay so yeah you

00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:23,380
can see this by ourselves like the one

00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:24,970
of the ones the left is much better than

00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:27,550
the one on the right and this is can

00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:30,520
pose a problem when we present this page

00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:32,680
and put it on you know any visualization

00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,930
techniques because the missing users can

00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:36,520
be an image and if you want to expect

00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:39,910
these images what you know it wasn't

00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:41,920
sure so based on like this and

00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:45,670
techniques we use with the texted like

00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:47,470
we we actually use the techniques for

00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:50,800
calculating the damage of the beach and

00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:57,310
based on this we give away for higher

00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:59,530
ways for the one on the list also we

00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:01,840
know that the people love - one things

00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:04,980
so the people prepare like mgs and visa

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:07,750
stuff and they would prepare like better

00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,720
snippets like when th you put it on

00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:13,600
which was actually surprised to

00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:15,610
visualize our service so we assess as a

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,070
Bayesian slice and choose the ones that

00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:20,110
gives us little snippet on a Storify for

00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:22,120
examples I want the CNN page because

00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:24,760
it's video or I it gives us better

00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:31,270
snippets it succeeded in expecting the

00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:34,060
image than the the other page so

00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:36,760
visualizing the certain Storify for this

00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:40,780
we have extracted the metadata of the

00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:44,140
pages and we we certify if you are it's

00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:49,060
amazing and very easy to use and we

00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:53,100
override their like extracting as a v I

00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:57,160
convey like you know do the extracts

00:18:53,100 --> 00:19:00,310
automatically and also we book the date

00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:02,590
of each page because this is also not

00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:05,350
extracted automatically so this is an

00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:11,350
example of automatically generated the

00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:13,810
story on a Storify so evaluation this

00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:15,389
you know I mean this is a research and

00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:17,669
academia you have to evaluate

00:19:15,389 --> 00:19:19,739
everything you're doing has to be able

00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:22,259
to publish so you can just like okay I

00:19:19,739 --> 00:19:26,190
generated Jesus stories so this was very

00:19:22,259 --> 00:19:28,889
hard for us to evaluate this and but

00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:32,279
okay we thought about the touring

00:19:28,889 --> 00:19:33,719
you know touring this so if these

00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:35,669
stories that we are generated

00:19:33,719 --> 00:19:40,469
automatically are indistinguishable from

00:19:35,669 --> 00:19:42,899
what human can generate I think we would

00:19:40,469 --> 00:19:44,940
say that we succeeded and it's like

00:19:42,899 --> 00:19:47,190
human and are generated the story are

00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:50,339
better than the random generated story

00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:53,999
so this is actually the thing that we

00:19:50,339 --> 00:19:57,599
were starting okay so we use like human

00:19:53,999 --> 00:20:00,119
evaluators and we use the actually the

00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:02,789
health of experts from Internet Archive

00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:04,229
and their partners so we asked them to

00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:07,379
generate the stories out of the

00:20:04,229 --> 00:20:10,019
collections they already know and we

00:20:07,379 --> 00:20:13,109
give them the criteria of generating you

00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:15,029
know these collections and actually I

00:20:13,109 --> 00:20:18,359
went there and I showed them how to

00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:20,849
generate the stories and you know also

00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:24,959
based on the templates we got from as a

00:20:20,849 --> 00:20:28,169
third we started at 35 and then we were

00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:31,259
able to guess like 23 stories and then

00:20:28,169 --> 00:20:34,799
we evaluated them based on like 1,000

00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:37,739
comparison from like a human and this is

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:39,659
the out story this is how we you know

00:20:37,739 --> 00:20:42,089
like present at the stores like to it

00:20:39,659 --> 00:20:43,829
like for example the one in the nest

00:20:42,089 --> 00:20:47,519
actually I would like to make a small

00:20:43,829 --> 00:20:49,829
this year so who which one of them like

00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:53,999
a or C do you think that's generated by

00:20:49,829 --> 00:21:01,829
humans and which one okay by human a and

00:20:53,999 --> 00:21:04,369
raise your hand okay be by Shawn is your

00:21:01,829 --> 00:21:04,369
health okay

00:21:04,739 --> 00:21:09,599
neither of them okay these young people

00:21:06,659 --> 00:21:12,659
I didn't phone okay so I should be the

00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:15,059
one that generated three a is generated

00:21:12,659 --> 00:21:18,480
automatically and three b is generated

00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:19,110
human so this is the results of the

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,240
evaluation

00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:22,740
so it was like 50/50 and this is

00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:27,929
actually the result I have seen here is

00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:29,879
almost 50/50 so and also it was great to

00:21:27,929 --> 00:21:33,899
see the automatic and the humans are

00:21:29,879 --> 00:21:36,090
much better than surrounding stories so

00:21:33,899 --> 00:21:39,149
hopefully this is beautiful

00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:42,509
so hopefully this is something that he

00:21:39,149 --> 00:21:44,460
would use when he grow up and often many

00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:47,100
years you would like to thank me for

00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:48,899
generating existed and you know he

00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,490
wouldn't struggle to understand what

00:21:48,899 --> 00:21:56,009
happened during the Egyptian revolution

00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:57,869
because yes that's it so all we have the

00:21:56,009 --> 00:21:59,700
students the peepers and slides I have

00:21:57,869 --> 00:22:01,799
like put also gathered in this vlog

00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:05,039
booth and it has all the links for the

00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:07,289
code and the data sets that we have so

00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,870
and I can like have questions at this

00:22:07,289 --> 00:22:13,530
time

00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:13,530
[Applause]

00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:17,950
you

00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:17,950
