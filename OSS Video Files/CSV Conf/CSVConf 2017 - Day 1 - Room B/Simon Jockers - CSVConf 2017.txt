yeah hi everyone my name is Simon and

00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:11,500
I'm super jet-lagged I just want to say

00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:16,630
that so if what I'm saying is kind of

00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:18,280
inconsistent let me know yeah so today I

00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:22,330
want to talk about designing data

00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:24,910
exploration and what I mean by that

00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:28,449
I'll go deeper into in a couple of

00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:31,330
minutes first so I'm with an

00:00:28,449 --> 00:00:32,949
organization called Conte's so this is

00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:35,380
how our website looks like we're a

00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:38,079
journalism nonprofit based in Berlin

00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:41,620
we're basically pop-up Lamoni if you

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:43,630
want so so we do a lot of public

00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:45,629
interest journalism and we use a lot of

00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:48,489
data for that

00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:50,290
so before I going deeper into that I

00:00:48,489 --> 00:00:52,860
want to tell a little story right so

00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:55,059
this story is set in Berlin in 1990 and

00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:59,260
it's just a couple of weeks after the

00:00:55,059 --> 00:01:01,270
Berlin Wall came down so yeah so the

00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:03,730
walls gone yet

00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:05,560
it's kind of weird because people in

00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:08,259
eastern Germany they still live in the

00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,209
GDR right behind the behind the Iron

00:01:08,259 --> 00:01:13,020
Curtain

00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:15,429
but they are no longer afraid so they

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,139
they brought us in the streets and they

00:01:15,429 --> 00:01:20,229
want to get rid of the government and

00:01:17,139 --> 00:01:26,349
after like the insane secret police the

00:01:20,229 --> 00:01:28,979
Stasi so some context on the Stasi so

00:01:26,349 --> 00:01:31,389
the study was a massive spying operation

00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:34,409
mostly targeting actually German

00:01:31,389 --> 00:01:39,069
citizens so they start we had around

00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:41,799
280,000 employees official ones but also

00:01:39,069 --> 00:01:45,009
unofficial ones that means basically

00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:46,630
citizens spying on other citizens so

00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:49,149
it's a very weird story so these

00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:53,319
pictures are actually taken from ritual

00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:54,939
shoddy manuals so it's kind of it kind

00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:59,349
of so it looks kind of clownish but it

00:01:54,939 --> 00:02:02,169
was like serious messes spying thing

00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:08,110
going on right so people wanted to get

00:02:02,169 --> 00:02:12,129
rid of that and as in 1992 comes clear

00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:14,640
that the days of the Stasi over the

00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:17,870
study starts to destroy a lot of

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:21,120
documents that they are collecting and

00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:25,290
in return protesters occupied their

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,300
headquarters and over time this whole

00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:31,320
thing settles no one gets seriously hurt

00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:36,000
and there's a new problem right so this

00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:38,580
data they have a huge huge heritage of

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,620
data and of people who work for them and

00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,560
actually of physical properties that

00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:51,060
they own because they employed 280,000

00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:52,980
people right so right meet David

00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,750
Crawford right so this is my coworker

00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,360
David Crawford his senior reporter

00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:59,580
collective but in 1990 he was a

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,970
freelance reporter from the u.s. working

00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:05,630
in Berlin and he did what people back

00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:08,280
then called computer-assisted reporting

00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:10,830
right that means he used computers and

00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:15,120
databases for investigative reporting

00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:19,560
and in the chaos of 1990 he got hold of

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:28,010
a huge trove of data from the Stasi and

00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:28,010
one part of it is a list of thousands of

00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:37,769
static properties basically around the

00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:41,329
country so it's a list of officers like

00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:44,010
the one you see here but also like

00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:47,610
apartment sports facilities hotels

00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:50,400
restaurants even a campsite or used by

00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:55,079
the Stasi sometimes openly but mostly in

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,760
secret and David realizes how important

00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:59,540
this information is for the citizens and

00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:02,100
he decides to get this out and he

00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:05,299
doesn't want to publish his story he

00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:09,209
wants to publish the whole dataset so

00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:14,250
what he does is he finds a newspaper

00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:17,039
who's willing to actually publish a an

00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:19,859
extra a special issue that basically

00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:25,950
consists just of a list of star B

00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:27,639
addresses and basically so that people

00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:29,050
can find

00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:31,539
started properties or for most other

00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:32,800
properties in the neighborhood so

00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:36,250
basically this is how the thing looked

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:39,219
like and it's just a newspaper with a

00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:41,469
handful of articles and a lot of lists

00:04:39,219 --> 00:04:46,599
of addresses identifying all the

00:04:41,469 --> 00:04:50,979
properties and yeah I mean this is a

00:04:46,599 --> 00:04:52,689
giant success the the top is kind of the

00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:55,360
newspaper published that is kind of a

00:04:52,689 --> 00:04:57,550
weird left-wing newspaper which happened

00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,530
to be the only Western germ a newspaper

00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,090
that was available in eastern Germany

00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:06,669
because they were outspokenly left-wing

00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:08,650
and they basically sold all the new

00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:12,129
stamps with that and afterwards they

00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:13,810
made this issue available via Y a mail

00:05:12,129 --> 00:05:17,020
order because people wanted to read it

00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:18,849
and today this is in the German National

00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:21,370
Archives and if you're ever in Berlin

00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:23,770
you can go to this charlie museum and

00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:30,009
look at the issue of that or a copy of

00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:31,900
this so so long story short like David

00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:35,139
Wright 27 years ago

00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:37,419
and today many journalists scientists

00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:39,430
but also like people who work in

00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:41,529
government or on public authorities are

00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:43,779
literally sitting on large datasets

00:05:41,529 --> 00:05:46,800
right I mean this I didn't explain that

00:05:43,779 --> 00:05:50,740
but this is David sitting on a like a

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,419
giant delivery of probably super secret

00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:56,050
papers because it's kind of a hoarder of

00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:57,610
government documents but I guess there

00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:02,740
are other people here also like hoard

00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:05,110
data right and and I mean this is normal

00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:09,219
right this is what we work with so when

00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:12,699
we analyze data and we use like Jupiter

00:06:09,219 --> 00:06:16,990
notebooks or our or tableau or Excel we

00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:19,270
usually start by exploring the data that

00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:22,779
means we we either use like formulas

00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:24,639
statistical methods or we just browse

00:06:22,779 --> 00:06:30,580
through it or and look at the data from

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:32,919
different angles and when we finally

00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:36,250
publish something say a report or a news

00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:37,599
article then this contains say a graphic

00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,600
or something that is very high-level

00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:44,940
analysis of the data

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:46,260
this is not the data itself right and

00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,930
that's fine right it's our job to

00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:50,640
analyze that and to find to find the

00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:53,150
aspects that are interesting and to then

00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:56,220
like bring that into a forum that is

00:06:53,150 --> 00:07:00,180
interesting and insightful for other

00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:03,960
people but sometimes we have data we're

00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:08,820
not just the high level analysis of the

00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:11,910
data is interesting but like the

00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:16,830
individual data item so the project that

00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:19,440
you see here that is a website that we

00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:21,210
built last year and that is a basically

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,760
what we call a news app or a data

00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:25,920
Explorer that's a web application that

00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,600
accompanies our reporting on a certain

00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,850
topic and here it's like the care system

00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:33,530
in Germany and what we did with this

00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:37,560
application is we made 13,000

00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:40,850
transparency reports from nursing homes

00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:44,370
in Germany available to the public and

00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:46,110
also turned them into something that

00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:48,390
people could actually read so what we

00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:50,570
did is basically we published 13,000

00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:53,640
automatically generated short articles

00:07:50,570 --> 00:08:00,420
that explain the issues with certain

00:07:53,640 --> 00:08:01,980
nursing home and yeah so this is the

00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:07,950
kind of stuff this talk is about right

00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:11,010
and this is a similar project just to

00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:14,610
have another example that's the I CIJ

00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:16,650
offshore leaks database this makes data

00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:18,870
from the Panama papers and from other I

00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:20,180
CIJ investigations accessible to the

00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:23,040
public

00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:24,840
journalists around the world you said to

00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,210
investigate for example money laundering

00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:32,910
or tax evasion in their country because

00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:35,910
this the Panama papers leak contains

00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:37,860
just a lot of local data right that the

00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:39,960
people at the ifoce can't make sense of

00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:42,599
but other people can somewhere else and

00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:44,310
that's also another reason to publish

00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:46,950
your data and make it accessible to

00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:48,990
other people that is that you by doing

00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:51,140
so you allow other people to build upon

00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:54,380
your work

00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:59,180
so this is just a listing but then there

00:08:54,380 --> 00:09:01,160
are individual individual detail pages

00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:03,860
in this where people can get actually

00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:06,680
all the metadata that there is about for

00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:09,850
example organizations or people that are

00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:14,110
involved with like the schemes that are

00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:16,630
present in the Panama papers leak and

00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:19,700
with this we have that it's obviously

00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:21,350
much it does it makes much more sense to

00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:23,830
publish stuff on the web then in a

00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:26,030
newspaper right because you have a

00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:29,080
reputable character limit right so you

00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:31,940
can just put all the data there then

00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:35,300
it's also much easier to navigate and to

00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:37,450
work with big data sets you can for

00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:40,520
example at simple interaction just like

00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:44,900
tooltips or stuff that shows some extra

00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:46,610
info or you can provide more advanced

00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:50,830
tools for searching querying and

00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:50,830
browsing the data as the ICA J does here

00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:58,940
so it's important to realize that when

00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:00,800
we build this kind of applications then

00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:02,480
we don't just design graphics or

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,210
interactive graphics we basically build

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,550
tools for data visualization and we're

00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:10,640
moving some complexity of interacting

00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:15,290
with the data from us the designer to

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:17,600
the user right and what we do is we

00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:20,150
don't do like generic data visualization

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:23,050
tools like to blower Excel we build very

00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:26,810
specific data visualization tools tools

00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:30,230
that are used to visualize one specific

00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:34,070
data set and what we also do is we apply

00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:36,940
some constraints because we wanna get

00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:42,110
access to all the data but we don't want

00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:44,630
users or the audience to be lost so we

00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:46,520
have two kind of constraint how people

00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:50,150
can use this and to make some decisions

00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:54,650
for them and this is was what the rest

00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:56,240
of this talk is about so when designing

00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:57,860
this kind of tools you have to ask

00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,140
yourself couple of questions or your

00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,940
team a couple of questions so the first

00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,720
questions that's pretty obvious that is

00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,310
what

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:09,829
what's the kind of data that I'm looking

00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:11,480
at here so this is a this is probably

00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:13,040
more like generic or technical thing and

00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,110
I'm not going deeper into that but I

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,720
mean your data could be tables or it

00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:21,550
could be grass or it could be

00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:26,689
unstructured data like documents or text

00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:28,399
and yeah I think it's part of our job to

00:11:26,689 --> 00:11:30,620
look and see how this is best visualized

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:34,699
but in order to do that we have to make

00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:37,129
a couple of other decisions and one

00:11:34,699 --> 00:11:41,540
thing that goes well with also what is

00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:43,670
it that we publish is this question so

00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:46,370
until now I've talked a lot about why

00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:47,839
it's so great to publish data but

00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:53,589
there's probably a lot of data out there

00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:56,120
that maybe shouldn't be published so

00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:57,920
usually what in journalism what you

00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,110
usually do when you have it you may

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,300
publish if you ask yourself is there

00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:06,500
public interest in this and if there's a

00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:09,439
public interest then you're good to go

00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,970
but then that may contain also personal

00:12:09,439 --> 00:12:14,389
data or otherwise sensitive information

00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:18,139
and then you have to carefully evaluate

00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:21,319
what's bigger right the public interest

00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:25,759
in this or the problems that could arise

00:12:21,319 --> 00:12:28,189
by publishing the data and then you have

00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:30,829
to think about okay to analyze that we

00:12:28,189 --> 00:12:34,240
have to inform affected parties or do I

00:12:30,829 --> 00:12:34,240
have to ask people for comment

00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:45,619
then you have to look at who are your

00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:48,319
users and in David's case the thing I

00:12:45,619 --> 00:12:50,300
showed earlier for him the target group

00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:55,699
was basically the public of eastern

00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:57,709
Germany but so when you work on

00:12:55,699 --> 00:12:59,809
something like that your target group is

00:12:57,709 --> 00:13:01,879
most probably not just the public right

00:12:59,809 --> 00:13:04,160
it's kind of a group of people that have

00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:06,139
a certain goal or it's a group of people

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,920
that have certain interests in a certain

00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:12,769
topic so you have to sit down and see

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,350
who these people are and think about

00:13:12,769 --> 00:13:17,959
things like okay I can read a I don't

00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:21,019
know three dimensional animated

00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:24,619
scatterplot but other people may not be

00:13:21,019 --> 00:13:28,300
able to do so and also you may be very

00:13:24,619 --> 00:13:30,499
confident with I don't know using

00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:35,980
keyboard shortcuts on your desktop

00:13:30,499 --> 00:13:38,360
computers but other people may not also

00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,860
related to this is what's the

00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,949
environment this will be used in right

00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:45,800
is it like more of a casual thing where

00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:48,800
maybe people read on a mobile with low

00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:51,399
attention when they are on the go or is

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:54,980
it like a more it's a thing where people

00:13:51,399 --> 00:14:00,170
use purposeful and with high attention

00:13:54,980 --> 00:14:01,610
and maybe in an office environment so

00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:04,189
these are all questions that you have to

00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:07,550
ask before you set out and decide what's

00:14:04,189 --> 00:14:11,300
the thing you build right but once you

00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:14,959
build it there's a couple of interesting

00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:17,389
patterns I want to share with you that

00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:20,689
is not stuff I came up with so it's

00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:24,079
things we use in our work but it's I

00:14:20,689 --> 00:14:28,040
think the first time I read about this

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:30,949
was in the ProPublica guy to design and

00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,089
structure of a news application I mean I

00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:33,499
have a lot of examples here and they

00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:39,379
talk about a lot of stuff I will later

00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:42,949
publish notes with the list of links but

00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:47,929
the thing here is Scott client writes in

00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:50,529
the proper optica guide and that there's

00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:52,240
a distinction between the things

00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:53,829
look at in data visualization and

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,680
there's one thing that is the macro view

00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:58,449
that is the far view and that gives you

00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,999
the big picture basically the high-level

00:14:58,449 --> 00:15:03,759
overview in a traditional approach to

00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:06,180
storytelling with data you would

00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:08,589
basically just look at the big picture

00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:12,459
take a couple of numbers from that and

00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:14,740
then look at like a specific anecdote or

00:15:12,459 --> 00:15:16,480
two to write an actual story then you

00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:18,939
write a story about the anecdote you add

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:22,809
some data to it and the graphic and

00:15:18,939 --> 00:15:26,050
that's it but with a new set you can

00:15:22,809 --> 00:15:28,809
actually also publish all the detailed

00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:30,550
data so you can publish all the

00:15:28,809 --> 00:15:33,730
individual data points and you can with

00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:37,899
that tell a lot of anecdotes or a lot of

00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:41,230
stories I'll explain what I what I mean

00:15:37,899 --> 00:15:44,439
by that so this is example for a macro

00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:45,970
view it's the overview of the I CIJ leak

00:15:44,439 --> 00:15:48,490
database that I showed earlier and

00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:51,279
that's just a giant list of stuff where

00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:53,259
you can search and filter right that's

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:56,500
very infective effective for searching

00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:59,019
and filtering and it's probably targeted

00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:01,389
at journalists or researchers working

00:15:59,019 --> 00:16:03,550
with their data but it's not interesting

00:16:01,389 --> 00:16:04,930
right you won't find anything

00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:07,389
interesting if you're just browsing the

00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:11,500
data and it's very easy to get lost in

00:16:07,389 --> 00:16:18,430
that so because of that the ICJ

00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:21,240
published other other fused other macro

00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:24,730
fuse on their data and this is basically

00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:27,339
an index of interesting data that is

00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:30,309
related to politicians or other public

00:16:27,339 --> 00:16:32,019
public figures and what they did is they

00:16:30,309 --> 00:16:36,129
have this overview site where they list

00:16:32,019 --> 00:16:39,160
all the people and you can start from

00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:42,329
that and dive deeper into the details

00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,329
about this person

00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:48,520
so this is a micro fuel that goes with

00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:50,890
that

00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,750
so this is basically a detailed page

00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:55,510
from this I see AJ offshore leaks

00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:57,400
database and it has all the data for

00:16:55,510 --> 00:17:02,260
this specific item in that case that's

00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:05,770
organization and this again has a lot of

00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:08,320
metadata is most probably targeted at

00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:09,910
other journalists but if you're browsing

00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,140
this this is not interesting at all

00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:12,880
right it's just a lot of meta

00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:20,050
information that you need if you are

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:22,000
really into this topic and what they did

00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:25,870
to make it easier for people to navigate

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,720
is they have also like other micro fuels

00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:30,790
that are more targeted to people who

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,670
read this and to browse through this and

00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:39,700
I understand that this is really small

00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:42,430
here but this is basically a that the

00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:44,170
over to page about a single person who's

00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:47,860
involved with some money laundering

00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:51,330
scheme apparently and there's a couple

00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:55,090
of background information on this person

00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:57,820
there's actually a response by this

00:17:55,090 --> 00:18:00,070
person published in this case there's no

00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:03,010
response and then on the left hand side

00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:05,500
you see a network of organizations and

00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:07,180
of things happening and you see that

00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:12,520
there's a lot of context that explains

00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:16,840
all of this and with all like with the

00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:18,880
extra information and the portrait this

00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:21,790
thing gets a lot of relatable to people

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:30,100
right so it becomes way more interesting

00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:32,410
and it's more inviting for browsing so a

00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:36,790
thing that builds upon that is the

00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:40,330
concept of actually personalizing this

00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:42,580
micro fuse so you may have certain data

00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:46,030
where people can actually find

00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:48,970
themselves in right so this is a an

00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:51,790
example from pro públicas work this is

00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:54,790
the vital science database and this is

00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:55,590
the database that shows a lot of data

00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:57,299
both

00:18:55,590 --> 00:19:01,500
Health Care's being practiced in the US

00:18:57,299 --> 00:19:03,630
and in this database you can actually

00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:06,360
look for your doctor so you can just use

00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:11,070
the name of your doctor and find for

00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:12,990
example what medication your doctor

00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:14,730
likes to subscribe and if he God gets

00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:16,590
money from pharma companies for this and

00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:19,380
a lot of other information that is in

00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:20,940
theory somewhere publicly available but

00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:23,010
not like condensed in a single place

00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:26,429
where you're looking for that and the

00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:29,130
extra that ProPublica is providing you

00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:32,429
here with is this option to basically

00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:45,690
find your doctor and then drill deeper

00:19:32,429 --> 00:19:51,480
and see all the details and okay

00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:57,510
another thing that's okay so there's

00:19:51,480 --> 00:20:02,490
something wrong here but so another okay

00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:04,950
yeah okay so I think that has also to do

00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:06,470
with personalization if this story and I

00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:09,059
guess a couple of people have seen this

00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:12,510
so the interesting thing is when I

00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:15,409
opened it here this morning it gave me a

00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:18,840
custom headline right so it knows that

00:20:15,409 --> 00:20:21,480
so it's basically a data-driven story

00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:25,409
about craft beer and micro breweries in

00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:28,200
the US and it has all this tiny little

00:20:25,409 --> 00:20:30,120
data things where you can dig into but

00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:32,700
it's also part of a bigger story and

00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:34,919
they opening the story by giving you a

00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:38,460
question that is directly related to the

00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:40,770
to the place where you currently are so

00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:44,070
basically this is just a clever use of

00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:46,289
IP geolocation to personalize that so if

00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:47,610
you pee New York this would like give

00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:51,450
you a headline that contains New York

00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:54,029
and here it's just used as a clever

00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:56,909
effect to draw people in but you could

00:20:54,029 --> 00:20:58,919
use the same thing too depending on the

00:20:56,909 --> 00:21:00,600
data show people data that is

00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:05,730
interesting to them wherever they are

00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:08,060
right now and the next part that is kind

00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:12,620
of kind of

00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:14,210
also builds upon that is the concept of

00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:16,160
embedding and this is something that we

00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:19,190
very recently see a lot of work where

00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:24,710
people try this and that is like

00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:27,230
embedding or integrating data

00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:29,270
exploration into a narrative so you have

00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:32,150
this story that you can read through and

00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:34,330
as you read through the story you can

00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:39,560
lead the audience through a series of

00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:41,660
different views on the data and by doing

00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:43,340
that you basically lead them to see the

00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:45,860
interesting things but you still give

00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:51,500
them the opportunity to drill deeper

00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:53,690
down into the details and yeah so this

00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,950
is pretty much it I understand that

00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:58,250
there's not a lot of time for discussion

00:21:54,950 --> 00:22:00,230
now I think I can take one question and

00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:02,180
but the thing is the thing I wanted to

00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:04,640
do here is I want to start a discussion

00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:05,990
about how we do this about how we can

00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,510
publish data and make that interesting

00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:11,120
because I see that there's not much

00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:13,010
written about it so if you're interested

00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,020
in in this topic and you want to discuss

00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:17,840
that and thank me later

00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:19,280
and also this is the URL for the for the

00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:23,000
slides I will also publish that later

00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:26,240
and there are a lot of pictures in the

00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,370
slides but this all the all the things

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:37,730
that I told you is in the speaker notes

00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:39,770
inside the slides Thanks so we have time

00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:45,200
for question or should we wrap this up

00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:46,660
here okay one question okay no question

00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:52,430
fine as well

00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:53,960
Thanks okay so I was just told that you

00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:56,300
can meet me at the data play tables if

00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:58,510
you want I try to figure out what that

00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,510
means

00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,690
thank you

00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,640
