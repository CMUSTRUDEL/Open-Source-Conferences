00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:09,990
for those of you just joining the room

00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,870
welcome we're talking about cities and

00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:15,269
data and we have up next is Cate

00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:17,460
Rabinowitz she's the founder of data

00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:19,140
lens DC where she analyzes and

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,599
visualizes data to tell stories about

00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,220
Washington DC she also works with

00:00:21,599 --> 00:00:24,539
clients to bring data to life through

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,300
data science and visualization

00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:29,310
she's a co-captain of Code for DC a

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,710
volunteer civic hacking group the

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:34,289
co-founder of tech lady hackathon an

00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,690
event series promoting women in DC tech

00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:39,690
and she's a recipient of the 2016

00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:42,870
technologist of the Year award and 2017

00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:45,000
DC semtex data scientist award so she's

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:48,890
pretty awesome and this is going to be a

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,530
fun talk so welcome Kyiv in it with

00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:54,510
thank you

00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:57,230
hey everyone we're going to be talking

00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:00,409
about open data and cities today so

00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:06,150
let's jump right in starting with a

00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:09,590
definition slide of what is open data so

00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:13,650
open data is data that is freely and

00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:15,720
ideally easily accessible with little to

00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,210
no restriction in terms of how you use

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,390
the data what you do with it

00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,110
if and how you go on to share it

00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:23,880
specifically today we're going to be

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,060
talking about government open data and

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:29,580
it's important to remember that as

00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:31,860
citizens we are owners of the government

00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:34,350
and as such we have a right to the data

00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,870
that it creates in almost all

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:41,550
circumstances and this is important

00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:44,270
because government data is very valuable

00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:47,790
in terms of social and economic impact

00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:52,140
it is awesome especially when we look at

00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:55,020
what it can do for cities so with open

00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,780
data for cities we can answer questions

00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:00,450
about our cities we can support

00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:03,600
conversations we can uncover and solve

00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:05,910
puzzles we can create change let's go

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:10,080
through a few use cases to see what that

00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:11,580
looks like in practice so these are

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,670
series of maps that I created for my

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,230
city Washington DC

00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,640
and it looks at how different

00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:19,310
neighborhoods in the districts have

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:23,330
changed across the past decade by race

00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:25,760
income and age the darker the blue the

00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:28,540
whiter wealthier and younger that

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,860
neighborhood has become these

00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:33,800
characteristics are often associated

00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:35,750
with gentrification when we bring data

00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:39,140
to these discussions we can get a better

00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:42,650
idea of what gentrification looks like

00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:44,630
and where it is happening within these

00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:47,600
three maps there's one neighborhood that

00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:50,650
is dark blue across every single map I'm

00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,650
going to move as I apologize

00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:04,070
this neighborhood is Navy Yard and in

00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:06,440
the past decade Navy Yard has had a huge

00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:08,260
influx of new residents generally whiter

00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,239
and wealthier than long-term residents

00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,860
it has had a lot of new construction new

00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:15,769
apartment buildings even a new baseball

00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:18,310
stadium with open data we can identify

00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:21,320
these kind of hotspots of gentrification

00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:23,780
see what it looks like and start to

00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:26,230
think about how we can support the

00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:29,540
communities that are affected by it

00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:31,280
open data can also help us understand a

00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:34,160
social issue within our city from a

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,350
different perspective so this is the

00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,320
million dollar blocks project in Chicago

00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:40,820
from data made Co and what they're doing

00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,470
here is they're looking at crime in the

00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:45,500
city of Chicago from a different

00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:48,500
perspective typically when we look at

00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:50,900
crime we think about a map that has

00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:53,090
points on it of where a crime has

00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:55,480
occurred and this kind of perpetuates

00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:58,940
the notion of crime as an individual and

00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:02,570
isolated act what day tomato has done

00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:04,850
here is they visualize data on how much

00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:07,070
money the government is spending per

00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:08,720
block in Chicago to incarcerate

00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:10,940
residents that would have otherwise

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,180
lived on that block so we're flipping

00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:16,180
the perspective here and in doing so

00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:18,289
getting a bit more to the institutional

00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:20,539
causes and societal cost of

00:04:18,289 --> 00:04:22,490
incarceration we can start to see these

00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:24,560
kind of heavy concentrations of where

00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:27,950
that money is being spent

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,390
the kind of lack of people in that

00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:32,530
neighborhood as a result of

00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:34,520
incarceration and on some blocks

00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,960
literally a million dollars being spent

00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,390
and we can think about that in

00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:40,250
juxtaposition to how much the government

00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:41,300
is spending on social services within

00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:50,140
the neighborhood do you have a question

00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:50,140
make oh sorry I should put a space there

00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:58,100
okay so open data can also help improve

00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:02,570
communities this is an example from

00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:05,750
living Lots NYC from 596 acres and

00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:08,630
they've used open data to identify of

00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:11,930
vacant lots within New York City there

00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:13,910
are hundreds of vacant lot spaces in New

00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:16,460
York City and they were able to identify

00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:17,360
the vacant lots and then who owns those

00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:21,200
vacant lots

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:24,020
they created resources for community

00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,690
leaders to then work towards converting

00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:28,100
that into either like a park or

00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:31,100
community garden or whatever the

00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:32,930
community and the lot owner came to an

00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,900
agreement on I think at this point there

00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:37,760
have been about 80 acres converted which

00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:41,360
for New York City is actually a lot of

00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:43,729
space but using open data they were able

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,729
to systematically identify an issue at

00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:49,070
the city level and then bring that

00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:53,690
information resources to the community

00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:56,060
level to help fix that problem open data

00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:58,340
can also help hold government

00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:01,090
accountable so ideally a government is

00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:03,919
always working in our best interests

00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:05,960
transparency and open data are really

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,600
helpful in providing checks on that to

00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:10,820
make sure that that is the case I quant

00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:14,510
New York was playing around with parking

00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:15,830
ticket data and found that the City

00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:18,590
Police Department had been

00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:21,110
systematically ticketing legally parked

00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:23,600
cars to the tune of millions of dollars

00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:26,630
of fines a year so there was at one

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,060
point a parking ticket category that was

00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:30,440
totally legitimate and then it changed

00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,390
it was no longer a parking ticket

00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:36,560
but the police continued to hand that

00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:37,800
out and in this case once this became

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,680
public the

00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,509
department did remedy this in terms of

00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,770
at least going forward they are not

00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:49,139
handing out these parking tickets

00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:52,470
anymore so these are a kind of handful

00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:56,039
of examples of what we can use open data

00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:59,550
for in our cities and a next question

00:06:56,039 --> 00:07:04,740
might be where can I find this open data

00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:07,919
and there are a few different spots the

00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:10,050
kind of like main website for federal

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,930
data is going to be data gov and that's

00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:14,129
going to have your headline economic

00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:17,550
social business and the graphic data

00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:21,180
there are nearly 200,000 data sets on

00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:24,900
data.gov your city also collects a lot

00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:26,669
of data and if you live in a major or

00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,560
midsize and in some case sometimes even

00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:31,560
small City at this point they likely

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,960
have an open data portal and there will

00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:38,430
be a wide range of data on that portal

00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:40,979
in some cases from property tax data to

00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:48,779
public transportation data to crime data

00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:53,099
to demographic data and alright I'm

00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:55,169
sorry I the examples that I gave you I

00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:57,539
think are really excellent use cases for

00:07:55,169 --> 00:07:59,880
what individuals can do with open data

00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:04,710
and I think that's awesome and exciting

00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:07,710
but when I start to talk about open data

00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:10,319
in practice I just I have to be real

00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:14,849
with you guys in practice working with

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:16,409
open data is kind of terrible and this

00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:19,500
is an emotional journey that I've been

00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:22,139
on I think many open data practitioners

00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:28,349
feel the same way it is weird to say

00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:30,240
this a tap you right now but um the

00:08:28,349 --> 00:08:32,699
promise of open data is really awesome

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:37,769
in practice working with open data has

00:08:32,699 --> 00:08:39,959
many many challenges some of you were

00:08:37,769 --> 00:08:41,579
maybe rolling your eyes when I was

00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:45,420
saying that data gov has nearly two

00:08:41,579 --> 00:08:48,120
hundred thousand data sets and that is

00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:50,880
rightfully so because the number of data

00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:55,140
sets is a terrible mess

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:58,740
Trek for the success of open data let's

00:08:55,140 --> 00:09:01,890
use data.gov as an example so of the

00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:05,250
nearly 200,000 data sets 2/3 our

00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:08,160
geospatial the most common tag on data

00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:09,930
gov is oceans so about a third of the

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,780
data sets on David I'll cover about

00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:14,610
oceans when I go to my open data portal

00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:16,350
for information about my country I

00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,880
typically mean like inside the country

00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:21,510
and not the ocean surrounding the

00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:23,040
country so when you go to an open data

00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:25,500
portal and you see that highlight number

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,830
it might not necessarily be what you

00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:31,290
would consider high-value data sets it

00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:34,320
also might not be in a format that is

00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:38,700
particularly friendly this is less true

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:41,070
for at the city open data portal level

00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:43,500
but for the federal government a PDF is

00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:46,620
number 2 in terms of data format type

00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:48,000
PDFs where data goes to die the

00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:52,470
friendliest of data formats

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,510
CSVs is not even in the top 5 number of

00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:58,620
data sets is also a bad metric because

00:09:54,510 --> 00:10:02,370
it can so easily be manipulated I do not

00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:06,030
think this was their intention when they

00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:08,490
did this but if I look at what I would

00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:10,800
consider one data set on the DC open

00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:12,690
government portal moving violations it

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,760
is actually dozens of data sets because

00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:18,240
they have broken it into monthly moving

00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:21,390
violation data sets so when you see that

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:24,300
top headline number of number of open

00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:27,240
data sets it is often a bit more

00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:29,700
deflating as you peel back the layers it

00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,440
might not be the data that you were

00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:36,960
hoping for it might not be in the

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:38,700
easiest format so if you are using or

00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:42,600
thinking about using open data for a

00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:44,730
city you should have FOIA as part of

00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:48,150
your tool box and you should also

00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:50,310
consider advocating for more open data

00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:54,720
because there is a lot of work to be

00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:57,300
done but let's say you have your open

00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:01,470
data through the open data portal that

00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:03,030
is success number one working with that

00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:04,320
data is going to be challenging because

00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:07,620
open data can be

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,510
very messy the way that we're talking

00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:12,480
about using open data today in many

00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:15,450
cases was not the original reason that

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:18,450
it was collected so it can lack the

00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:21,270
infrastructure work has so until very

00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:24,030
recently for accurate complete and clean

00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:25,620
open data reporting there are still city

00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:29,220
agencies that collect this data by fax

00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:31,770
in many cases the system where they hold

00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:34,440
the data is entirely different from the

00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:36,900
system that is their open data portal so

00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,180
translating between these two things can

00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:43,290
be harder and more manual than you would

00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:45,060
like working with open data almost

00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:48,000
always has more freeform text than you

00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:51,840
want it to and this goes back to data

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,180
analysis not being the original reason

00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:57,780
for collecting something like business

00:11:54,180 --> 00:12:00,600
permits data standards are not

00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:02,430
particularly common on the upside if you

00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,680
are working with open data for your city

00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:07,980
and you clean it you might be the first

00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:13,170
person to ever get a clean perspective

00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:16,410
on that data in cleaning data though we

00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:18,900
make decisions and this leads to my next

00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:21,390
point which is that open data even when

00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:24,600
clean is far from fact because there are

00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:27,180
so many opinions that go into any data

00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:29,130
really being made so data is shaped by

00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:31,800
people around it we should consider it

00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:34,320
just as bias and imperfect as the people

00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,030
who create it open data is sometimes

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,940
talked about as a kind of absolute truth

00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:41,310
or a kind of catch-all solution it is

00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:44,640
not it is a means and when we talk about

00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:47,340
and use open data we have to put it into

00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:50,760
the context of the environment that it's

00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:52,590
operating in so open data is complicated

00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:55,350
and let's talk a little bit about what

00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:57,030
that looks like when you're working with

00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:58,800
open data there are always some

00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:01,130
questions and checks you should be doing

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:04,290
really when you're working with any data

00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:08,160
the first is asking who collected this

00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:11,430
data and how did they collect it this is

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:14,280
kind of an involved example here so

00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:17,430
let's take a sec to walk through it in

00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,990
DC as with many cities there is a vision

00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:21,080
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:24,709
initiative to make streets safer for

00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:28,450
everyone there is an app in DC and many

00:13:24,709 --> 00:13:30,770
other cities where citizens can report

00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:33,140
issues that they have whether it's a

00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:37,480
cracked sidewalk or a blocked bike lane

00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:41,390
or a speeding car this in particular is

00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:45,980
pedestrian issues and so that's what we

00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:48,560
see on your left and what we see on the

00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:50,779
right are crashes that involved

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,830
pedestrians so this is not neither is a

00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:58,730
perfect corollary for pedestrian safety

00:13:53,830 --> 00:14:01,330
but the problem with the one on the Left

00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:03,910
which is data collected by people

00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:08,209
logging issues into their apps is that

00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:12,410
you are subsetting who is going to take

00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:16,130
part in that from the start because not

00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:17,779
only does a person need a phone or an

00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:20,240
internet connection or an app that

00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:23,480
person has to know about the initiative

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,490
take the time to actually care about the

00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:28,149
initiative and think that their

00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:34,820
government is going to effectively

00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:38,750
respond to their issue and this subset

00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:41,420
is typically a wealthier subset than the

00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:44,480
general population so when you're

00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:46,279
collecting data through a website or an

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,720
app you're not going to hear everyone's

00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:49,459
voices and it's important to consider

00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,410
who you're hearing more of and who

00:14:49,459 --> 00:14:53,560
you're hearing less of here I have

00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:56,149
circled one particular neighborhood

00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:59,140
because it's where I live Capitol Hill

00:14:56,149 --> 00:15:01,190
for comparison on you blessed you'll see

00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:03,589
complaints and if you looked at

00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:05,660
complaints surrounding pedestrian issues

00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:07,940
you would think that Capitol Hill was

00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:09,860
like a pedestrian deaths own because

00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,250
there is just so much heat going on

00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,380
there

00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:14,899
I live there and I can tell you that it

00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:17,480
is like a Walker's paradise I can also

00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:20,570
tell you that Capitol Hill has probably

00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:23,930
like like their PTA s are probably the

00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:28,130
most involved of like anywhere in the

00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:29,420
city so when you ask people their

00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:31,250
opinion through something like an app

00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:33,230
you're going to get a

00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,880
piñon but they think a car was speeding

00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:37,010
but you're also going to get something

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,860
like how involved that neighborhood

00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:42,020
would be in a PTA meeting because when

00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:45,290
we look conversely at pedestrian or both

00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:47,990
crashes on the right we see it that like

00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:50,720
Capitol Hill is actually it doesn't seem

00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:52,190
that bad so it's important to put your

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,200
data in context in terms of who's

00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:57,980
collecting it and how they are

00:15:54,200 --> 00:16:01,340
collecting it once that data is

00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:04,520
collected there can be a number of

00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:07,430
decisions made about what to do with the

00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:10,040
data and often when you're working with

00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:15,290
open data you're going to find anomalies

00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:17,630
and so this is a line chart of when

00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:21,350
homes were built in Washington DC based

00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:23,900
on open data so if I was just like

00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:25,850
running with this I'd be like wow 1900

00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,770
was a boom year can i Commission a

00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:29,060
historical study on what happened at the

00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:32,030
turn of the century in our nation's

00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:34,820
capital um but that's not at all what

00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:37,250
happened what happened is that when the

00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:39,110
city doesn't know the year that a home

00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:43,550
was built but it's like a pretty old

00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:46,070
home they just tag it as 1900 um so this

00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:49,280
is an example of an anomaly in the data

00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:56,360
being entirely by design and not

00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:58,730
reflective of reality policy also live

00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:01,520
in your data so here is another anomaly

00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:04,240
this is parking tickets in DC and they

00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:06,860
are parking tickets specific to

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,319
inspection stickers so if your

00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:11,740
inspection has expired if you fail to

00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:14,089
report for an inspection

00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:17,329
DC is very small and there's a lot of

00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:20,600
like interaction between DC Maryland

00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:24,680
Virginia so looking at this graph I'm

00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:25,970
like okay DC Virginia like roughly same

00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:28,730
levels of parking tickets that make

00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:30,500
sense like what's up with Maryland once

00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:32,630
again if I was going to run with this

00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,070
I'd be like mm those Maryland drivers

00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:36,110
are fantastic

00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:38,120
let me Commission a study let me data

00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:40,850
science how everyone can be a Maryland

00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:43,280
driver Maryland drivers are not

00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:44,990
fantastic what's actually happening here

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,020
is that in Maryland

00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:50,240
you only get an inspection once and then

00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:51,500
you never need an inspection again so

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,720
because of that you can never be

00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:57,529
ticketed for having an expired

00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:59,779
inspection sticker so policy lives in

00:17:57,529 --> 00:18:01,820
your data and when you're working with

00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:04,190
your data you have to consider some of

00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:08,960
the legal and environmental factors

00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:10,760
around it data also lives in society and

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,390
it's really important when working with

00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:18,080
data that you put it into that context

00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:20,419
this is the racial dot project out of

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,279
University of Virginia and essentially

00:18:20,419 --> 00:18:24,470
every dot corresponds to the race of a

00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:27,860
person this is looking at Detroit you

00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:30,559
can also look at it nationally looking

00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:33,679
at this map there have some unnatural

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:36,440
things going on so that line of

00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:40,419
separation up top and then once again

00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:43,610
this kind of weird like loop in of blue

00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:45,399
we see that it's highly segregated and

00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:47,899
if you were to leave it at that and just

00:18:45,399 --> 00:18:50,809
let the reader kind of come to their own

00:18:47,899 --> 00:18:52,690
conclusions on in my opinion you're not

00:18:50,809 --> 00:18:56,149
doing enough of putting the data in

00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:57,860
context there are very specific reasons

00:18:56,149 --> 00:19:00,020
why this looks the way it does

00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:04,010
there were policy decisions made there

00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:06,020
was redlining there were laws and when

00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:07,570
you visualize data like this especially

00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:10,580
when there's people behind that data

00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:13,760
it's important to put that data into the

00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:17,899
context of society the laws and the

00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:21,279
decisions that we've made so open data

00:19:17,899 --> 00:19:24,830
is awesome at least the promise of it is

00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:29,720
in practice working with it is kind of

00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:32,419
terrible at times but hopefully we can

00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:34,970
use this data putting it in context and

00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:37,190
working with it responsibly to make

00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:39,289
better use of our cities so let's do all

00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:41,720
the things with like all the data for

00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:43,909
all of our cities but actually don't do
