00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:10,410
welcome to our first CSV keynote I'm

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,170
Daniel I'm one of the organizers based

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,820
here in Portland and I'm so excited to

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,980
be able to introduce you all to heather

00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,600
joseph for anyone who isn't familiar

00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,910
with her work she's the executive

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,140
director of SPARC and I have it here on

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,670
my phone so I don't mess it up it's the

00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,650
scholarly publishing and academic

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,240
resources coalition and what that means

00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,460
is that she's on the front line of

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,289
advocating for better data policy in the

00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,900
United States better access to research

00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:37,350
data she's also on the port of directors

00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:39,239
and her she helps organize open con

00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,730
which for me was a transformative

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:43,680
conference that has changed my career

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,020
completely so you all should go to that

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,829
conference this guy in the front wearing

00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:52,020
a shirt so without further ado here is

00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:54,230
Heather welcome to Portland thank you so

00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,230
much

00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,170
I what a great place to give a talk

00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,329
although I did say that I was really

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,739
grateful that I walked into church

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:06,510
chapel and the walls didn't

00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,880
automatically burst into flame so I feel

00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,830
like a great sign and it should be

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,140
should be a reasonably uneventful talk

00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,729
hopefully thank you so much for

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,830
including me in this phenomenal

00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:18,570
conference I'm really excited to be here

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,909
today and if there's anything that's

00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,619
guaranteed not to give you odds or

00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:24,990
indigestion after lunch it's talking

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:28,110
about data policy in Washington DC right

00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:30,539
now so my apologies for the timing but

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:33,090
what I want to do today is actually talk

00:01:30,539 --> 00:01:34,649
about the state of play for open data I

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,869
feel like this is echoing here I feel

00:01:34,649 --> 00:01:38,970
like a little rock star step back from

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:40,890
my computer the state of play and I'm

00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:42,899
going to try to do it in three phases to

00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,640
take a little nostalgic look back at the

00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:47,550
last eight years and seeing the way we

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:51,149
were in my head while I do that take a

00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:52,770
look at where we are now in the very

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:54,420
very eventful and somewhat

00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,130
transformative months since the recent

00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:00,470
election and talk about what that's

00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:03,869
meant to our continued work to open up

00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:07,140
publicly funded data and then spend the

00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:10,140
most time looking at where we need to be

00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,819
and where we want to go and hopefully be

00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:15,030
able to outline some concrete strategies

00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:17,610
and actions that we might think about

00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:19,140
collectively taking together to help us

00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:22,620
keep the momentum moving in the right

00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:24,569
direction towards open federal data and

00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,690
for the majority of my talk I'll talk

00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:30,300
about open government data with a broad

00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:33,500
brush meaning all government data but

00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:35,430
the focus for me is primarily on

00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:38,730
advocating for open access to research

00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:41,520
data and that comes because in my career

00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:43,980
I spent 15 years as a scientific journal

00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,500
publisher and I like to say I was raised

00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,000
by the astronomy and astrophysics

00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:51,390
community I spent my first seven years

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,700
working professionally for the American

00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:55,910
Astronomical Society and this has really

00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:59,099
been important to me and in kind of

00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:01,500
determining how I think about data and

00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:05,100
how I think about what the default mode

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:07,140
should be when when we're gathering data

00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:09,770
and as those of you who are familiar

00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:13,040
with the Astronomy community know

00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:14,600
this is in their DNA right from the very

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,060
beginning I started working for them in

00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:19,460
1989 and they were collecting you know

00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:21,890
digital data and large large scale from

00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:24,350
instrumentation automatically sharing it

00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:28,850
this is just the way that that community

00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:30,860
approach is dealing with data and my

00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:33,080
good friend and colleague Bob Hanish who

00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,880
worked on Hubble Space Telescope like to

00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,350
say yeah sure you know the astronomy

00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,660
community's all for open data because

00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:41,090
our data is worthless right which I

00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:43,880
loved but which actually you know is a

00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:45,710
furious comment at heart because after

00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:49,160
moving out of the Astronomy community I

00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:51,470
went into cell biology and neurosciences

00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,150
where data collected has serious

00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:55,250
commercial potential commercial value

00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:57,470
right so when Bob was talking about this

00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,880
he was saying it was actually a comment

00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,470
that I've kept in the back of my mind as

00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:04,190
I've also thought about the fact that

00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:06,890
not every community approaches data with

00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:08,840
the same native bent towards I'm going

00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:10,640
to share it unless or until somebody

00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,890
gives me a compelling reason why I

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,260
shouldn't and that for me has been

00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:17,090
really something that's propelled me

00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,590
through the work that I've done since

00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,120
the beginning of my career and

00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:23,030
particularly the work that we're doing

00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,800
at SPARC as Danielle noted we're an

00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,330
international advocacy organization were

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,480
nested in the academic and research

00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:31,850
library community but our goal is as a

00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:35,240
global coalition to really try to work

00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:37,670
to set that default expectation and

00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,220
default mode to open in research and

00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:41,720
education so we work on data educational

00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:44,210
materials like textbooks we work on

00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:47,470
scientific journal articles but the

00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:50,270
thrust of what we do is to really try to

00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:52,900
reset the rules of the road and there's

00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:55,640
nothing more powerful that we found in

00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:58,430
in terms of a tool to help us accomplish

00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:00,200
that goal than working in the policy

00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:03,169
environment right policy is very

00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:05,270
foundational it's a real lever policy is

00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:07,340
also a long game which is why I kind of

00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:10,180
chunk this talk into sort of three

00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:13,010
different segments to try to illustrate

00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:14,750
how important it is to have your eye on

00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:16,520
the long ball when we're working in the

00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:19,100
policy environment it's a very

00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:21,060
incremental game to a certain degree and

00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:23,070
I love

00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:25,020
I'll touch on that in a minute I swear

00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:26,820
this is not going to be a talk that just

00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:29,240
goes through here are the policies that

00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:31,680
were passed and here's the language but

00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,300
you have one slide that I want to show

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,000
because I think it's really important to

00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:39,380
understand about how we got to where we

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,970
are now in terms of policy development

00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:44,100
nobody hates to be out on the limb by

00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:46,770
themselves taking a risk doing something

00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:49,470
new more than a policymaker and

00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:51,900
particularly a politician in DC so all

00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:54,090
policy development is incremental and

00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:56,400
depends on having strong policy

00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:58,080
precedents to work from and in the open

00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,990
data community whether we know it or not

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:04,080
we've been incredibly fortunate to have

00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:05,760
a very strong set of policy precedents

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,250
in the United States that are open data

00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,169
policies have been able to be built on

00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:12,360
we heard a little bit in some of the

00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:14,310
talks earlier about the importance of

00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:18,000
things like FOIA the Freedom of

00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:20,310
Information Act and the the foundation

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,350
that it has helped us lay four ways to

00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:25,530
get access to information but there's

00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:27,030
also been a series over you know roughly

00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:30,360
a thirty year period beginning in the

00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:33,150
60s and culminating in the late 1990s of

00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,550
other foundational policies that have

00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:38,010
given us language that we've used and

00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:40,650
we've relied on to build effective

00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:43,320
strong policies for open data in the US

00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:52,320
and weirdly you've probably never heard

00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:54,630
of OMB circular a-133 open data world

00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,370
almost all of our open data policy

00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:58,560
language that we've been successful in

00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:00,810
sort of imbuing in the United States to

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,550
underpin the work that we've done comes

00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:05,490
out of this little circular which

00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:08,190
basically just sets the expectations for

00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:11,280
the US government federal agencies their

00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:14,520
operations in how government information

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,289
and particularly government agent is we

00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,600
interpret it in the digital age is

00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:20,539
utilized right and it has phenomenal

00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,650
language in it from a policy perspective

00:07:20,539 --> 00:07:24,720
government information is a valuable

00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:26,669
national resource right and its value is

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,580
only increased when it's made available

00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:31,740
to all in a timely and equitable manner

00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:33,510
this little circular also lays the

00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,670
groundwork to say what does that mean

00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:38,100
that means it's open it's unrestricted

00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:40,470
and you can't charge any more for it

00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:42,510
than the cost of marginally distributing

00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:45,150
it which in the Internet age is you know

00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:48,110
should be zero so it's it's it's

00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:50,490
wonderful that we have this foundational

00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:54,570
language it's extremely valuable

00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:56,640
it really has you know again built a

00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:58,560
solid foundation but going back you kind

00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:01,200
of notice that a lot happened during

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,080
this period but then in 1998 we kind of

00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:06,240
went into a little bit of a hiatus and

00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:08,490
that's not unusual you have a foundation

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,980
you really need a precipitating event

00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:13,050
something that's going to help catalyze

00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:17,490
action to keep momentum going forward

00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:19,140
and we got one we got one in a beautiful

00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:20,850
way when Barack Obama was elected

00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:22,980
president this is the Open Data

00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:25,350
catalyzing event he's elected president

00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:28,140
he takes office and open data

00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:29,820
fabulousness ensues for eight years and

00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:32,250
I'm only marginally being facetious

00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:35,250
about this because when I look back and

00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:37,530
think about the breadth of changes and

00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:39,990
the progress that we've been able to

00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:42,720
make because of the dedication of this

00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:45,660
administration towards making open and

00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:48,510
open data a centerpiece of their agenda

00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:52,770
a priority in the policy environment

00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:54,330
it's it's quite amazing so I want to

00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:55,950
talk a little bit about the way we work

00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:57,810
to try to embed some you've got to help

00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:59,370
me with with keynote and PowerPoint I

00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:01,770
wanted like the little barbra streisand

00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:03,300
music playing in the background and I

00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:05,090
was going to toggle back and forth and

00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:09,630
you know kind of listen to the music but

00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:11,310
next time next time the slides are

00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:13,440
beautiful enough because of the policy

00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:15,810
so well we'll enjoy the sweet music that

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,490
they that they bring through our bring

00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:18,870
through our ears because this

00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:22,760
administration couldn't have hit the

00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:26,670
ground running more strongly in terms of

00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:28,830
presenting the notions that open was a

00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:31,020
key construct and you all know that the

00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:32,760
open government directive was issued on

00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:35,640
the first day of the Obama

00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,680
administration's coming into office in

00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:40,260
his first term you come out of the gate

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,600
and what what he talked about and what

00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,220
this directive did was make open the

00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,140
presumptive mode for

00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:48,540
the federal government not just for

00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:50,610
operations but also for information

00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:52,710
coming out of the federal government and

00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:54,150
at the time I remember thinking wow this

00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:57,120
is really great you know somebody's

00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:59,250
speaking our language and it's really

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,670
nice looking back as well we'll talk

00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:05,730
about now you know it it's more than

00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:08,460
nice it is it is a seminal moment I

00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:11,970
think for the United States and for the

00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:16,200
operations in the propelling forward of

00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:19,290
the movement to say at the center of the

00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:22,020
center of it all the the public deserves

00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:23,700
access to information that the

00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,940
government produces whatever it may be

00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:28,500
and certainly data is at the centerpiece

00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:31,500
in the open government directive there

00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:34,320
was a few sentences that basically said

00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,720
that in DC speech each agency should

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,040
take prompt steps to expand access to

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,250
information by making it available

00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:42,990
online in an open format no government

00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:45,600
had talked in the United States about

00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:47,940
making information available in open

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,640
formats until this directive came out I

00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:54,270
mean this is really extraordinary stuff

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:56,670
and I was in the talk that the lovely

00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:59,310
woman from the DC City open-data

00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:02,190
government are you here did earlier

00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:04,860
where are you and she's not here she did

00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:06,990
this wonderful talk on unopened data and

00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,970
she had oh there you are sorry you're

00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:10,500
great your your talk was fantastic and I

00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:12,720
loved the fact that you highlighted

00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:15,210
data.gov as something that's in use now

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,040
for for all of its worked because I

00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:19,590
actually went back to the Wayback

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,920
Machine and pulled out one of the early

00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:25,470
iterations of data.gov as an example the

00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,839
open government directive asked federal

00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:31,110
agencies for the first time in US

00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,730
history to identify two high-value data

00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:35,310
sets and to make it openly available

00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:38,550
through data gov I mean and that was

00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:41,280
groundbreaking right in in 2009 asking

00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:44,220
agencies to find and make two data sets

00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,150
available openly had Ted simply never

00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:49,589
been done before

00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:51,450
and data gov came under fire then and

00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:53,970
rightly you know probably rightly so

00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:55,870
it's not perfect but it what it did was

00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:58,080
really sort of set the tone

00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:01,390
um more of the Wayback Machine

00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:04,660
high-value data sets in 2009 the most

00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:07,029
used data set on dead gov was the White

00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:08,800
House visitors log which if you're like

00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:09,910
me and you're nosy Yenta you want to

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,160
know who's in and out of the White House

00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:13,450
I thought it was pretty great but there

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,120
were a lot of stories about like you

00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:18,370
know really is this high value again we

00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,710
sort of fast fast forward now that the

00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:23,529
visitors logs to Marv Lago are not being

00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:25,779
released not not quite as funny but it

00:12:23,529 --> 00:12:28,080
is I think ever more poignant that this

00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:31,180
was information that that really sort of

00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:34,240
laid the groundwork again not perfect

00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:36,460
but it set the expectations from day one

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,010
that open data was a key priority and

00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:41,440
with this administration the open data

00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:44,290
hit just kept coming right it wasn't

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,630
just in terms of putting out policies or

00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:49,060
edicts or saying that shall share data

00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:51,220
we're going to use the right words this

00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:55,630
administration backed up the policy

00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:58,120
actions with specific policy constructs

00:12:55,630 --> 00:13:00,670
with specific actions including sending

00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:03,400
signals that this was so important that

00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:06,550
we need chief chief technology to the

00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:08,170
chief technology officer I love this

00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:10,300
picture of the three CTOs

00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:13,480
some people like The Three Tenors from

00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:15,640
opera I think you know that Anish Megan

00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,980
and Todd Park are like rock stars in

00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,770
their own right we have never had a

00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:23,650
chief technical officer the message that

00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:26,290
that sent however that this was a key

00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:27,940
priority is something that simply you

00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:30,430
know had they they had never been done

00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:34,690
and it's unmatched ditto for bringing in

00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:36,880
achieved data scientists we hadn't had

00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:38,920
that in the United States this is so

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,650
important we need leadership we need

00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:44,050
talent we need visibility that was a

00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:45,610
signal that was sent that's what helps

00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:47,350
build momentum right you can write all

00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:50,200
the policies you want but if you don't

00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:52,270
back it up with the energy and the

00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,950
cachet that having somebody in a

00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:56,350
leadership position brings to the role

00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:59,380
this kind of stuff dies in DC all the

00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:02,170
time this movement didn't die in DC due

00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:05,560
in large part to these lovely folks but

00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:06,390
also due in part to an infusion of young

00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,750
and Tau

00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:11,790
and continuously moving and growing

00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:13,890
people into the pipeline through the

00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:16,560
presidential innovation Fellows through

00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:18,329
18s shout-out to the two people from 18f

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:22,529
that I just met sitting over there here

00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:24,600
there is more amazing amazing taking

00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:26,850
that energy taking the leadership from

00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,040
the top infusing it with people with

00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:30,149
expertise and putting them in positions

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,779
where they can really make a difference

00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:36,510
and raise the visibility of the impact

00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:38,490
that open government data across the

00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:41,640
board could have in a positive way on

00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:43,529
citizens lives I also have to give props

00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,600
to people like the Department of

00:14:43,529 --> 00:14:48,000
Commerce which was the first department

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,220
to implement an open data Advisory

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,230
Committee to Isetta us sitting secretary

00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:55,440
the Secretary of Commerce that little

00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:58,050
c-dac logo is for the Commerce data

00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,450
Advisory Council which brought together

00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:02,760
leaders in the open data movement from

00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:06,149
business from research from code from

00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:08,850
America from civil society to directly

00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:11,670
advise a sitting cabinet secretary on

00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:16,620
effective open data policy fantastic

00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:21,410
really amazing things happening in terms

00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:24,510
of propelling momentum forward during

00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:26,699
his administration the President Obama

00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:28,320
didn't just stop and say I'm doing one

00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:29,670
thing and that's it I'm bringing the

00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,440
talented and then we're never going to

00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:33,000
talk about it again he did this

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,399
beautiful thing with the administration

00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,199
in terms of starting big with a sweeping

00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:39,660
open government directive and in getting

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:43,500
ever more granular in terms of the

00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:46,230
prescriptive nough scripted nough sees

00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:48,930
that were put into place in the first

00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:51,449
year of a second term this executive

00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:53,640
order making open machine open and

00:15:51,449 --> 00:15:55,740
machine readable the new default for

00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,510
government information came out and for

00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:00,089
us in terms of the advocacy work that

00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:03,600
we've been doing to really try to reset

00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:06,300
the DNA of the a community of a research

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:09,180
community these words are amazing

00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,800
they're they are words that that don't

00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:14,010
just speak to one community but rather

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,600
to our nation as a whole that says this

00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:17,730
is this is the way we should be thinking

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,080
about it it's not resetting you know one

00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:22,110
small subset of

00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:23,760
- considering that we should be sharing

00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:26,250
this stuff unless there's a compelling

00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:28,110
reason not to this is in fact the way

00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:30,390
that that the entire country should be

00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:32,640
moving and he followed that up just a

00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:34,320
month later with in case anybody was in

00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,570
my community in our community and the

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,640
research community was worried that you

00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:40,680
know we're not covered fully enough with

00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,690
a memorandum out of the Office of

00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:45,510
Science and Technology Policy which

00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:47,670
further described open access to

00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:50,100
research data and the terms and

00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:54,480
conditions under which that needed to be

00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:56,400
made so a really heavy time when we look

00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,730
back and say in an eight-year period we

00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:02,640
went from no action on open data in the

00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:07,220
US government no really no policies to

00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:10,170
having this series of interconnected

00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:12,330
mechanisms that really helped us move

00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:14,610
the ball forward and just as an aside

00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:16,140
Congress was in on the action too right

00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:18,630
lest you think this was only the

00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:21,990
administration at the same time we had

00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:23,550
Congress in in flux where we had

00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:25,440
democratic control and Republican

00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:27,900
control at different times Congress was

00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:29,790
also moving pieces of legislation that

00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:32,340
were following the open data ball and

00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:34,770
helping it to move forward like the data

00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:37,260
Act which went into effect just last

00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:39,450
year so the most important thing about

00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:42,000
those eight years is that it really

00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:44,940
changed the landscape and helped us make

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,010
open data be considered foundational

00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:49,590
foundational for scientific discovery

00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:51,720
yes but also foundational for better

00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:54,330
health for innovation for economic

00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,220
growth for equity for all of the kinds

00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:58,140
of things that are priorities in the

00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:00,510
federal government so we were really on

00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:02,280
a wonderful trajectory and frankly we

00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:05,600
were spoiled it was not that hard to

00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:08,070
advocate for open data during the Obama

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:12,000
administration so things were going

00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:15,870
pretty well until we had another

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,210
precipitating event and I chose this

00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:20,550
slide because in the headline I think

00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:23,460
for the open data community brings

00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:26,730
unfortunately pretty true right when the

00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:29,330
election happened we no one really had

00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:31,370
much of an idea of

00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:33,410
what would happen in the open data

00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:38,210
environment to the momentum towards open

00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:42,830
data under a trump administration we're

00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:45,860
finding out in the way we are just as an

00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:47,450
aside at spark when we say we do

00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:51,460
advocacy we do pretty heavy-duty

00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:53,840
political advocacy so we spent a

00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:55,940
significant amount of time over the 18

00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,980
months leading up to the presidential

00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:00,560
election meeting with every single

00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:03,380
declared presumptive presidential

00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:05,780
candidate in both parties which meant we

00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:08,420
met with all 15 of the Republican

00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:10,760
contenders to talk with them some of

00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:14,630
laughing like you should have been with

00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:18,290
us talk about I was going to say Jesus

00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:22,220
wept I can say that in here so yeah yeah

00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:23,960
yeah we talked with all of them about

00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:25,520
open data and the importance of open

00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,250
data open access you know open

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,560
everything and you know we had varying

00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:32,030
degrees of receptivity depending on who

00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:35,360
we talked to

00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:37,600
and we also established a really strong

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:40,190
relationship with some of the

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:43,340
strategists on the Republican side which

00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:47,030
are we were hopeful would be helpful to

00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:49,640
us in this new world we are roughly a

00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:53,480
hundred and three days into the

00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:56,570
administration Saturday's 103 days into

00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:59,180
this administration and I don't think

00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:02,930
any of us were prepared despite the the

00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:05,840
legwork that we did for the effect that

00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:09,680
we would see coming out from really from

00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:13,850
day one in January we've had to kind of

00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:15,770
work through fake news on a large scale

00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:18,680
but also fake news and science and then

00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:22,490
data alternative facts and I don't think

00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:24,530
these were their terms or concepts that

00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:28,820
we could have in any way shape or form

00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:31,600
prepared adequately to face in January

00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:34,490
and in February we've had to deal with

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:37,370
404 errors right things being removed

00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:40,880
from websites not errors because oops we

00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:43,520
just left the connection died but things

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,810
like open government I mean the

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,090
information about the other government

00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:50,120
directive actually being taken down from

00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:53,690
the White House website we've had to

00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:56,270
deal with agencies having a data

00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:57,650
scrubbed from their websites the EPA is

00:20:56,270 --> 00:21:01,220
probably the one that people are most

00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:03,140
familiar with but certainly this was not

00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:05,330
something that we were prepared really

00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:07,640
to see to the degree that it's happening

00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:10,850
we had to deal with in the first three

00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:12,470
days of the administration agencies

00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:14,600
being told that there was a moratorium

00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:16,970
on being able to share data in talking

00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:21,980
to the press about scientific data they

00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:25,370
were collecting the FDA HHS EPA really

00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:29,300
things that were completely antithetical

00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:31,160
to the spirit of openness in this arena

00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:33,650
that we had gotten used to under the

00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:35,600
last administration and frankly this is

00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:38,210
really built up to the point where we

00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,880
have a real sense that an empirical data

00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:46,070
driven fact-based operating mode that we

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:49,370
had enjoyed is really endangered the the

00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:52,340
world in DC the world in the u.s. in

00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:54,950
this environment for open data and

00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:57,410
frankly from most other things is has

00:21:54,950 --> 00:22:01,280
completely changed that's the depressing

00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:03,860
part of the talk okay which leads us to

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:06,140
thinking about working on the way we

00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:08,090
need to be and at spark and in the

00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:10,760
community that that's the communities

00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:13,280
that we work so closely with we always

00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:15,950
try to look for pragmatic proactive

00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:18,770
solution oriented action-oriented

00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:20,630
solutions for how we can deal with the

00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:22,490
reality that we find ourselves in and

00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,870
one of the things that we've known I'm

00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:25,790
going to try to give three three

00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:27,710
potential paths forward but before I do

00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:31,130
that I think the thing that we've

00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:34,100
settled on in the you know going through

00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:37,130
the stages of grief since the election

00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:39,200
in terms of trying to deal with where we

00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:42,110
are in that the open movement is that

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,060
we've really come to the conclusion we

00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:46,490
need to up our ante in terms of being

00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:49,190
activists for open data no matter how

00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:51,320
difficult it may be to speak up and to

00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:52,910
take a stand for something we really

00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:55,460
need people to come out of their selves

00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:56,179
and be willing to be vocal

00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:59,450
sort of

00:22:56,179 --> 00:23:02,720
superhero advocates for not only

00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:05,389
protecting the data that we've become

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,399
used to getting access to but also being

00:23:05,389 --> 00:23:09,379
willing to go out on a limb to continue

00:23:07,399 --> 00:23:11,330
to ask for more one of the most

00:23:09,379 --> 00:23:13,580
effective advocacy strategies and again

00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:15,740
I'm really sorry I can't remember your

00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:18,860
name lovely woman from DC who I'm going

00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:20,119
to just keep her Kate one of your one of

00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:22,519
the things that you said is in the

00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:24,080
question and answers someone asked you

00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:25,580
about how to be an effective advocate

00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,340
what can you do to be an effective

00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:29,899
advocate and your answer was I asked the

00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,799
government for things like I literally

00:23:29,899 --> 00:23:33,230
will just ask

00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,820
that's advocacy and I'm going to talk a

00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:37,159
little bit more about how we can do this

00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:38,990
in a coordinated way but I really do

00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:41,990
believe that this is one thing that we

00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:44,179
all need to care about protecting the

00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:46,039
momentum towards open data that we

00:23:44,179 --> 00:23:48,230
really need to become comfortable more

00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:50,210
comfortable with doing because public

00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:52,999
data is in danger data right now in the

00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:56,299
u.s. there's no other way to to really

00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:58,369
spin it so what can we do well first I'm

00:23:56,299 --> 00:24:00,019
like that I'm splitting this into three

00:23:58,369 --> 00:24:02,600
buckets the first thing that we can do

00:24:00,019 --> 00:24:04,309
is play active pragmatic defense we

00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:06,679
don't want to lose the games that we've

00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:11,080
made under the last administration and

00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:11,080
the games that we've worked so hard to

00:24:11,529 --> 00:24:19,249
enjoy so what do I mean by this we're

00:24:17,269 --> 00:24:21,740
already seeing steps that individuals

00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:25,460
and groups are starting to take so if

00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:27,470
public data is endangered data it's

00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:30,259
something that we're seeing on a daily

00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:32,480
basis and early in in January we started

00:24:30,259 --> 00:24:36,610
to see people really becoming concerned

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:39,470
over in particular the fragility of

00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:42,049
climate change data and we started to

00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:44,539
see individuals taking steps and kind of

00:24:42,049 --> 00:24:46,879
taking the page from the open open

00:24:44,539 --> 00:24:48,860
source software development community

00:24:46,879 --> 00:24:52,039
the open data community in terms of how

00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:55,850
they were thinking about dealing with it

00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:58,249
so I don't know whether you you're aware

00:24:55,850 --> 00:25:00,379
of these but I'm assuming this community

00:24:58,249 --> 00:25:02,629
is then fairly intimately involved at

00:25:00,379 --> 00:25:04,759
least some of you in data rescue events

00:25:02,629 --> 00:25:06,499
I'm really proud of the library

00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:08,050
community in particular as they have

00:25:06,499 --> 00:25:10,480
been sort of at the center

00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:12,640
of recognizing the fact that the

00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:16,770
datasets are out there they may in fact

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:20,080
be in in someone spotlight in terms of

00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:22,510
being vulnerable to being taken down so

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,700
what libraries and and interested folks

00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:27,310
are doing is kind of getting together on

00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:29,110
a weekend it's like a hackathon but

00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:31,030
instead it's called a data rescue event

00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:32,290
they're identifying datasets

00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:34,360
they're bringing in people with the

00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:36,460
expertise to help scrape the data

00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:38,260
putting it into libraries on our

00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:40,510
campuses around the countries where it

00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:44,020
can be protected preserved and access

00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:46,570
can be ensured and this happens

00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:48,610
spontaneously and organically in the

00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:50,230
intervening months I can't believe it's

00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:52,150
only been four months but in the

00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:54,850
intervening months we're starting to see

00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:56,980
a little bit more organization coalesce

00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:58,210
around these individual events and this

00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:00,820
is something that I think is really

00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:03,310
great right yes it is simply protecting

00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:05,620
existing data but as a first step it's

00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:08,230
super important that we look out for

00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:09,820
opportunities to do this the data rescue

00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:12,060
community is starting to kind of move

00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:14,590
under an umbrella of the umbrella of

00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:16,810
trying to communicate become more

00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:19,680
organized yet a strength and numbers

00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:24,210
approach and look to see what we can do

00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:26,890
to really sort of provision these

00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:30,880
individual efforts to become more

00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:33,460
large-scale collective efforts to

00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,930
protect more and more data and there's

00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:37,630
actually a meeting in Washington DC

00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:39,820
coming up next week which was supposed

00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:41,980
to be initially it was designed to be a

00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:44,590
meeting of just a small handful of

00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:46,270
groups who are interested in looking at

00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:48,250
what infrastructure is needed when

00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:50,200
investment is needed and what we could

00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:53,140
do to actually make this into something

00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:55,540
that's more organized sustainable long

00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:57,550
term a strategy for protecting data and

00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:59,620
the small meeting now has 50

00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:02,500
organizations including US federal

00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:04,720
agencies research funders library

00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:07,420
organizations the Internet Archive all

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:11,200
working together to try to come up with

00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:13,750
a strategic plan to make sure that that

00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:17,680
this strategy can be enacted going

00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:19,780
forward it is a wide open process so if

00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:21,620
you see data refuge or you see something

00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:23,300
that is now being referred to as a

00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:25,610
libraries plus network and you're

00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:27,620
interested in being involved this is the

00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:30,020
kind of activity that it refers to and

00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:33,320
wide open invitation and please please

00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:35,210
think about getting involved the second

00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,920
strategy is that we don't only want to

00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:38,660
play defense right that's never the

00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:41,150
position that you want to have to be in

00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:43,340
for the long term and I think the good

00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:46,610
news is that we don't have to only play

00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:48,770
defense in this environment the second

00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:51,530
thing I really want to emphasize is that

00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:54,200
progress is still possible in the policy

00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:56,720
environment we're not just relegated to

00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,830
you know rescuing data and hoping that

00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,530
nothing else happened

00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:05,390
we need to recognize that we can also

00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:07,309
run positive pragmatic proactive plays

00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:10,250
that's a lot of peas in one sentence

00:28:07,309 --> 00:28:13,040
that just came out there oh yeah kind of

00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:15,080
like that but we are we really do need

00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:17,330
to recognize the opportunities that are

00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:20,570
in front of us to drive the momentum

00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:22,990
forward single party control of the

00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:26,390
House the Senate and the White House is

00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:28,880
unusual and we have to be clear-eyed and

00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:30,800
realistic and recognize that it does

00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:34,520
present opportunities to move

00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:37,460
legislation having those those ducks in

00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:39,770
a row is not something that happens

00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:42,020
every day and if you can take find ways

00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:45,890
to take advantage of it you actually can

00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:48,200
get things done and that holds very true

00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:50,540
in the data environment so there's a

00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,640
piece of legislation that is has been

00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:54,770
introduced in Congress and identical

00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,110
versions in the House and the Senate

00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:59,780
called the open government data act and

00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:02,240
what this piece of legislation does is

00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:04,550
actually takes President Obama's second

00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:07,429
memo making open and machine-readable

00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:09,380
the default for all federal federal data

00:29:07,429 --> 00:29:11,660
and it would how to fly it into

00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:13,880
legislation and it's really interesting

00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:16,100
to think about the fact that this piece

00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,510
of legislation was introduced it was

00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:20,179
introduced with bipartisan

00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:22,940
co-sponsorship in both chambers and it

00:29:20,179 --> 00:29:25,490
is actually moving on a nice clip it is

00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:28,429
likely that this legislation or I would

00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:31,460
say it is possible to likely that this

00:29:28,429 --> 00:29:33,980
legislation could clear in this first

00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:35,000
session of this first year of this

00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:37,910
session of calm

00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:41,480
what's fantastic about this is that it

00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:43,940
shows the way in a policy in the policy

00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:46,250
environment to move from having a

00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:48,110
directive that's associated with the

00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:50,929
previous administration right the Obama

00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:56,780
M 1313 memo making open a machine

00:29:50,929 --> 00:29:59,419
readable right the the law the preferred

00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:01,130
path forward to having Congress say this

00:29:59,419 --> 00:30:03,530
isn't just the preference of a president

00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:05,030
it's the law of the land and this is

00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:07,130
actually the game that we're learning

00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:09,230
that we need to be very proactive in

00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:12,230
taking advantage of in order to be able

00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:14,630
to move the agenda forward not just hold

00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:16,549
ground but advance the agenda moving

00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:19,669
from an executive directive which are

00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:22,429
ephemeral and they are vulnerable as we

00:30:19,669 --> 00:30:24,980
all know to being overturned with the

00:30:22,429 --> 00:30:27,860
stroke of a pen to legislation that's

00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:30,559
codified and is much more difficult to

00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:32,900
turn over is a really powerful thing and

00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:36,110
that that this piece of legislation is

00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:37,490
actively moving in Congress is a very

00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:39,770
hopeful signal and it's something that

00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:42,500
spark is working very hard to advocate

00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:45,890
for with a set of coalition's that I'll

00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:47,330
talk about in a second as a bonus right

00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:50,510
as I mentioned that piece of legislation

00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:53,150
is has bipartisan support open data in

00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:56,450
general has garnered bipartisan support

00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:58,610
fairly regularly in Congress so it this

00:30:56,450 --> 00:31:01,280
isn't a one-off this is an opportunity

00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:03,679
to to really kind of hold on to this and

00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:06,080
to look for other opportunities to move

00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:09,380
the ball forward last week we had two

00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:11,540
senators a Republican from Colorado and

00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:13,190
a Democrat from Michigan introduced a

00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:15,110
piece of legislation that's giving the

00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:17,059
data rescue and refuge communities a

00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:19,070
boost which is basically saying look

00:31:17,059 --> 00:31:21,350
nobody was expecting what happened in

00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:22,910
the first few weeks of this particular

00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:25,580
administration nobody was expecting

00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:29,270
datasets to be taken down or gag orders

00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:30,830
to be potentially issued so let's let's

00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:32,840
get our policy ducks in a row to make

00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:35,240
sure that that doesn't happen so this

00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:36,950
piece of legislation has been introduced

00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,419
I can't remember it was literally just

00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:40,669
introduced I can't remember what it's

00:31:38,419 --> 00:31:42,500
what it's called but there's information

00:31:40,669 --> 00:31:44,620
about it on the website

00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:46,760
oh the preserving data in government Act

00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:48,600
which really basically would

00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:51,000
says once the data sets up there

00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,650
it's it's we've got to take steps to

00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,570
make sure that it's permanently up there

00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:55,950
we don't want this stuff available just

00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:59,430
for one generation but for future

00:31:55,950 --> 00:32:02,000
generations as well to do this

00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:07,290
successfully right to support or to

00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:09,870
introduce or to drive if you will in a

00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:11,520
positive direction one of the things

00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:14,880
that's a lesson that we've had to learn

00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:17,310
for how we need to be is that we need we

00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,630
need to actively understand what the new

00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:21,120
priorities are for this administration

00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:22,800
it was very easy to see the Obama

00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:26,190
administration's priorities with that

00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:28,200
directive on day one and honestly the

00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:29,790
message that we have seen as we've done

00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:33,660
over the last four months you know

00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:36,450
really a deep landscape analysis as we

00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:38,940
possibly can is that the notion of open

00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:40,950
and transparent as priorities are out

00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:42,720
right we're not going to get anywhere

00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:45,690
open you could get a meeting in the

00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,920
White House and the almost seriously as

00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:49,500
simple as this in the last

00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:51,360
administration saying open hey you know

00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,880
you you would you would be heard that

00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,770
doesn't happen with this administration

00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,180
however when we look at those prior when

00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:58,860
we look at their priorities and we look

00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:00,630
at their language we write we recognize

00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:03,360
that you know other things that are

00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:05,820
interesting are in taxpayers are in in a

00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:09,150
big way good deals are in if you saw the

00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:13,010
news today that's the language we hear

00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:17,430
all the time big wins are in all right

00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:18,990
all right however yeah so it they are so

00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:20,520
how do we how do we take advantage of

00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:22,320
that well one thing that we're doing is

00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:24,960
a pragmatic strategy and I issue an

00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,670
invitation again so everybody here is to

00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,450
try to take advantage of this is what

00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:32,850
resonates we're spinning up a coalition

00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:36,140
that we actually used in under the Bush

00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:38,700
administration to successfully secure

00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:40,620
legislation that requires that the

00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:43,140
National Institutes of Health have all

00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:45,300
the articles that are reporting on

00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:47,310
publicly funded biomedical research made

00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:50,070
openly available online to the public

00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:52,530
called the Alliance for taxpayers at the

00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:55,020
taxpayer access so taxpayers are

00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:57,240
entitled to the research results or

00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:59,310
output including data of research that

00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:01,470
their tax dollars support that is

00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:03,030
something that no one disputes and it is

00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:05,280
actually a language that resonates in

00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:07,770
this current Congress and with this

00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:09,659
administration so this is a coalition

00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:11,129
that the right you know it doesn't cost

00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:12,659
anything to be a part of but that

00:34:11,129 --> 00:34:14,700
there's a strength in numbers approach

00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:18,030
and going and saying we're promoting

00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:20,790
this particular approach we're also

00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:23,820
learning that we have to position open

00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:25,950
data not just as open for open sake but

00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:28,409
open as an enabling strategy to achieve

00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:31,200
the priorities of this Congress and of

00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:33,179
this administration so again open as a

00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:35,609
calling card isn't going to work but

00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:37,919
taxpayers being entitled to data that

00:34:35,609 --> 00:34:40,590
their tax dollars have supported does

00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:42,810
get you in the door and then once that

00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:45,480
data is available it can help you

00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:47,970
achieve a good deal in this way or you

00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:50,280
know whatever fill in fill in the blank

00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:52,530
here with this administration again and

00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:55,649
with this Congress a lot of it is about

00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:58,260
jobs and the economy and that's fine

00:34:55,649 --> 00:35:00,720
right that simply is what's at the top

00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:02,790
of the list for them this is a bill that

00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,250
was introduced this year called the

00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:06,570
financial financial transparency Act and

00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:08,670
you may say what does it have to do with

00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:11,359
us and open beta and this conversation

00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:15,510
this is actually a bill that is asking

00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:19,770
or would require that government events

00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:21,000
reports that are filed with the SEC any

00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:23,700
financial reports that the government

00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,339
produces on the viability and

00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:28,560
productivity of different businesses and

00:35:26,339 --> 00:35:31,670
companies in the United States be made

00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:34,830
available in forms that are structured

00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:38,880
standardized and machine readable and

00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:41,040
searchable I went to a meeting of that

00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,109
the sponsors of this bill had

00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,880
Republicans and Democrats and when I

00:35:43,109 --> 00:35:47,520
tell you that members of Congress stood

00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,560
up at a microphone and said PDF is not a

00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:53,039
searchable enough document we need

00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:56,369
structured markup language right

00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:59,819
I got a little teary it was a little

00:35:56,369 --> 00:36:01,519
crazy they didn't use the words XML but

00:35:59,819 --> 00:36:04,019
they're they're like that's that's we're

00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:06,679
almost there come little woodland

00:36:04,019 --> 00:36:09,779
creatures come to the eat the food

00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:11,999
they're almost there and it really it

00:36:09,779 --> 00:36:14,369
really is remarkable right that this is

00:36:11,999 --> 00:36:17,099
a piece of legislation that speaks their

00:36:14,369 --> 00:36:19,349
language right open in order to achieve

00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:21,749
the aims that they care about right it's

00:36:19,349 --> 00:36:23,309
speaking directly to them and they want

00:36:21,749 --> 00:36:25,499
to make this reporting data available

00:36:23,309 --> 00:36:27,569
for a reason right not just because open

00:36:25,499 --> 00:36:29,609
is better than closed what they see is

00:36:27,569 --> 00:36:31,709
that if these reports are available for

00:36:29,609 --> 00:36:33,539
text and data mining they'll be able to

00:36:31,709 --> 00:36:35,939
find trends and patterns that can help

00:36:33,539 --> 00:36:38,279
investors find small businesses and

00:36:35,939 --> 00:36:39,839
companies that might actually return

00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:43,650
more back to the economy and produce

00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:46,289
jobs so that's fine this helps us

00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:48,359
understand how to talk about our issues

00:36:46,289 --> 00:36:51,989
the issue of open data in a way that

00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:54,509
resonates with Congress um for those of

00:36:51,989 --> 00:36:56,969
you who are veterans of the open open

00:36:54,509 --> 00:36:58,489
access and open data policy wars the

00:36:56,969 --> 00:37:00,719
co-sponsors of that bill are

00:36:58,489 --> 00:37:01,859
representatives eisah and Maloney I

00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:03,989
don't know whether the names mean

00:37:01,859 --> 00:37:06,269
anything to people Robyn's laughing

00:37:03,989 --> 00:37:08,699
because they co-sponsored a bill called

00:37:06,269 --> 00:37:11,369
the research works Act but eight years

00:37:08,699 --> 00:37:13,559
ago that would have overturned the

00:37:11,369 --> 00:37:14,969
policy that NIH has requiring

00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:16,799
essentially the same thing for

00:37:14,969 --> 00:37:19,199
scientific reports they didn't

00:37:16,799 --> 00:37:21,329
understand what what we were asking

00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:24,150
eight years ago but they understand it

00:37:21,329 --> 00:37:26,189
now in the context of financial reports

00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:28,019
and that's you know I kind of get a

00:37:26,189 --> 00:37:30,089
giggle out of that I think it's great I

00:37:28,019 --> 00:37:32,159
think it's funny but I also think it's

00:37:30,089 --> 00:37:34,650
great because we're now able to go into

00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:36,599
their offices and saying yes yes yes you

00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:38,400
like this for financial reports you're

00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:40,769
going to love it for scientific research

00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,140
you're going to love it for you know

00:37:40,769 --> 00:37:48,659
fill in the blank there it's been an

00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:50,849
education and a real opportunity to stop

00:37:48,659 --> 00:37:53,130
and think about using the language

00:37:50,849 --> 00:37:57,719
reframing the issue in a way that

00:37:53,130 --> 00:38:00,539
resonates with with of the powers that

00:37:57,719 --> 00:38:01,619
be if you will and to support this I

00:38:00,539 --> 00:38:03,599
think one of the things that we've

00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:05,249
really had to do is to think about

00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,510
building stronger cross sector

00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:08,460
relationships right

00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:11,940
they care about what's happening with

00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:13,890
the economy with jobs we need to build

00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:16,830
our partnerships and open up our doors

00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:20,340
in terms of really being much more

00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:22,950
inclusive and sort of outward focused in

00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:24,750
terms of those organizations and the

00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:26,610
people that will partner with we need to

00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:29,010
be working with business and Commerce a

00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:31,230
lot more closely in promoting the

00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:34,290
interests of sort of pure open data or

00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:35,910
scientific open data so spark has

00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:39,120
actually joined an organization called

00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:41,220
the data coalition which is a group that

00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,810
has been working on promoting things

00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:45,270
like the open government data act the

00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:46,470
financial transparency act and they've

00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:48,990
been very successful in bringing

00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:51,330
businesses to the table so in going to

00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:52,980
meetings and working with them to

00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:55,380
promote things like the financial

00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:57,660
transparency Act they're starting to see

00:38:55,380 --> 00:39:00,060
us as allies and understand that we

00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:02,310
understand what they're trying to do and

00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:04,170
it's given us wonderful opportunities to

00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:06,570
try to educate them on what it is that

00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:08,400
we want to do in other sectors including

00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:10,530
science and research and we're beginning

00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,720
to build those bridges we need to do a

00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:15,300
lot more of that to be successful in

00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:18,410
keeping the momentum going forward and

00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:21,780
finally I just want to close with one

00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:23,580
final strategy that we've been working

00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:25,920
on and that I think is really important

00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:28,110
for us all to to think about we

00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,970
concentrate on policy and often times we

00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:32,790
think that DC is the only game in town

00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:35,730
or you know insert your country capital

00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:37,740
here publicly funded data isn't the only

00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:39,570
game in town and right now in the

00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:41,010
environment that we're in I think it's

00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:42,720
really important that we look at the

00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:45,090
whole board we look at the whole playing

00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:47,910
field we look at any pieces that we can

00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:49,830
move that might help us in our efforts

00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:52,110
to both preserve the games that we've

00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:55,310
made and also to potentially promote the

00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:57,960
games additional games in particular

00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:59,700
private funders and foundations invest

00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,650
in work that produces an enormous amount

00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:04,230
of data and these foundations are

00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:07,650
increasingly understanding the message

00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:10,830
that open as an enabling strategy helped

00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:14,010
them increase the impact of what they're

00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:16,860
investing in so for example the Gates

00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:19,890
Foundation has an open access policy

00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:20,369
that went into effect in January of this

00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:22,650
year

00:40:20,369 --> 00:40:24,690
but not only requires that articles that

00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:26,789
report on their funded research be made

00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:29,099
immediately available but that the data

00:40:26,789 --> 00:40:31,920
that underpins those articles also be

00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:33,779
made available on day one during when

00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,849
it's published and they're doing that

00:40:33,779 --> 00:40:37,980
because they've explicitly said look

00:40:35,849 --> 00:40:40,380
Gates Foundation has the Global Health

00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:42,930
Initiative the aim of the Global Health

00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:45,349
Initiative is to save lives with any

00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:48,029
delay in getting this information out to

00:40:45,349 --> 00:40:50,309
anybody who can help to save a life is

00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:53,069
unacceptable open in order to save lives

00:40:50,309 --> 00:40:54,960
open data in order to save lives that's

00:40:53,069 --> 00:40:57,420
really powerful but they've been able to

00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,400
connect this as an enabling strategy

00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:01,019
back to their core mission and we've

00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,490
seen in the news where's Carly in the

00:41:01,019 --> 00:41:04,319
Moore Foundation because I really want

00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:11,039
to say congratulations on your open

00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:12,359
they're open policy lots of foundations

00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:14,009
are really beginning to get this an

00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:16,589
interesting foundation sort of

00:41:14,009 --> 00:41:18,059
non-traditional new players like the

00:41:16,589 --> 00:41:21,180
Chan Zuckerberg initiative for example

00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:23,430
are showing a real willingness to engage

00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:25,230
and to jump into this space the Schmidt

00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:27,299
Family Foundation's Eric Schmidt's

00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:30,769
foundation which focuses on climate

00:41:27,299 --> 00:41:33,059
change as well and global global

00:41:30,769 --> 00:41:35,579
environmental issues is also kind of

00:41:33,059 --> 00:41:37,950
playing around in this in this area and

00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:39,930
I think it's up to us to really work to

00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:42,089
encourage them and to help them

00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:44,849
understand what it is that they can do

00:41:42,089 --> 00:41:48,059
to make a difference in in this field

00:41:44,849 --> 00:41:49,650
and what they can do is kind of go the

00:41:48,059 --> 00:41:51,869
route of the Moore Foundation go to the

00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:54,569
root of the Gates Foundation talk about

00:41:51,869 --> 00:41:56,190
open data as a leveraging strategy to

00:41:54,569 --> 00:41:59,369
increase the you know return on

00:41:56,190 --> 00:42:01,499
investment in what they're investing

00:41:59,369 --> 00:42:03,569
their foundation dollars on really kind

00:42:01,499 --> 00:42:06,509
of try to take it home we need exemplars

00:42:03,569 --> 00:42:08,730
right these are organizations that are

00:42:06,509 --> 00:42:09,869
viewed as peer organizations by the

00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:11,609
federal government right they're

00:42:09,869 --> 00:42:13,259
investing at the same almost at the same

00:42:11,609 --> 00:42:15,539
level we're talking about billions of

00:42:13,259 --> 00:42:18,710
dollars in investments they care what

00:42:15,539 --> 00:42:21,329
happens seeing other people doing the

00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:23,369
actions that promote open data is a

00:42:21,329 --> 00:42:26,160
really important and potentially

00:42:23,369 --> 00:42:28,200
productive way to also keep pressure on

00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,460
the US federal government to be moving

00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,890
in

00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:33,290
right direction and I do want to note

00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:35,180
that the research funders are also

00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:37,190
talking amongst themselves they're

00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:40,490
beginning to coalesce there's a group

00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:42,230
that started in December called the open

00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:45,730
research funders group that includes

00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:50,030
gates Soros Arnold the Arnold foundation

00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:52,190
Robert Wood Johnson a sloan Foundation a

00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:54,290
set of folks who are really thinking

00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:56,900
about how can they make a difference

00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:58,640
using open as an enabling strategy and

00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:01,070
they're starting to meet regularly to

00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:03,440
talk about not only what they should be

00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:06,680
doing with policy as covering their own

00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:09,650
research but also what collective action

00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:11,180
might look like if they were to get

00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:15,050
together and actually think about

00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:16,790
putting some linking arms and working

00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:19,130
together muscle into this space and

00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:21,740
that's a theme that I think you probably

00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:23,780
is been running through this talk one of

00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:25,310
the the reactions to the recent election

00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:27,830
that I saw sort of on a personal level

00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:29,770
but also on a professional level was a

00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:32,420
real sense that people wanted who are

00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:35,480
interested in the same kinds of things

00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:37,820
like open data like open but fill in the

00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:39,980
blank have really sort of kind of come

00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:41,359
together and at first sort of just taken

00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:43,609
solace that you know we could be

00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:46,670
together and talk about like wow this is

00:43:43,609 --> 00:43:48,349
really unexpected but as the months are

00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:50,690
passing one of the things that that is

00:43:48,349 --> 00:43:52,790
developing is a sense of we want to stay

00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:54,650
together we really want to link arms and

00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:56,240
see what we can do together what are

00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:57,800
their actions that we can do we're much

00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:01,220
stronger together when we think about

00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:03,830
moving forward and that is really what I

00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:05,690
want to close on leadership is local on

00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:07,280
this issue right sometimes we think

00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:09,650
about national politics as being

00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:13,400
something that somebody else has to do

00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:15,619
in in DC in I hope what I've been able

00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:19,190
to illustrate is that individuals make a

00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:21,890
difference and we have to be willing to

00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:25,369
break out of that edge eggshell and step

00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:28,580
up speak up speak up let me try this

00:44:25,369 --> 00:44:29,750
again rewind that tape speak out we have

00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:32,510
to learn to speak first

00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:34,010
Heather step up and take action and

00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:36,530
there's lots of ways that we can do it

00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:38,810
together the coalition's that that I

00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:41,819
noted before or wide open the data

00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:43,619
refuge data rescue projects a wide open

00:44:41,819 --> 00:44:46,319
is that you have expertise that you

00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:47,400
bring to the table is sorely needed your

00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:49,829
voice matters

00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:51,449
your actions matter more we have a

00:44:49,829 --> 00:44:53,670
lovely representative many

00:44:51,449 --> 00:44:55,349
representatives actually with us here in

00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:58,769
the audience from another opportunity

00:44:55,349 --> 00:45:01,170
the other group of influencers that I

00:44:58,769 --> 00:45:04,410
cannot emphasize the importance of

00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:05,940
enough are open time I call them the

00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:08,459
open conscience right go ahead Robin

00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:11,400
throw something at me encouraging young

00:45:08,459 --> 00:45:13,619
people early career folks whatever the

00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:16,499
discipline is from libraries to research

00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:18,269
to political science to medical students

00:45:16,499 --> 00:45:21,539
there's an opportunity to get them

00:45:18,269 --> 00:45:23,849
together under the umbrella of something

00:45:21,539 --> 00:45:25,499
called open con which is something that

00:45:23,849 --> 00:45:28,319
Danielle mentioned when she did my

00:45:25,499 --> 00:45:30,209
introduction SPARC is loosely one of the

00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:32,599
organizers of open kind this is a

00:45:30,209 --> 00:45:36,299
spontaneous sort of community organized

00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:38,969
event but also year round community that

00:45:36,299 --> 00:45:40,979
can help interested people develop the

00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:43,920
capacity for leadership and leadership

00:45:40,979 --> 00:45:46,380
in advocacy on open issues including

00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,029
open data you could get a cape if you

00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,809
participate in open con I can't

00:45:48,029 --> 00:45:51,539
guarantee it

00:45:48,809 --> 00:45:54,089
Roshan was as from he started open

00:45:51,539 --> 00:45:56,849
access Nepal so he got the cape for

00:45:54,089 --> 00:45:58,589
efforts that he had done but really the

00:45:56,849 --> 00:46:00,959
community efforts the linking arms and

00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:03,239
working together is the most important

00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:05,400
thing I think that we can do to keep the

00:46:03,239 --> 00:46:08,190
ball moving forward so we've got 103

00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:09,420
days down by my count depending on leap

00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:13,769
year we might be able to knock a couple

00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:15,900
days off 103 1357 days to go so I hope

00:46:13,769 --> 00:46:18,059
that you'll keep thinking about this and

00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:19,890
please talk to each other talk to us

00:46:18,059 --> 00:46:21,630
talk to any organization that's in the

00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:23,710
mix of this about what we can do

00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:33,790
together thank you so much

00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:37,339
[Applause]

00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:40,339
questions I don't have the Cape with me

00:46:37,339 --> 00:46:41,740
I wish I did who have it rashon doesn't

00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:49,730
happen anymore do they

00:46:41,740 --> 00:47:16,579
one Pablo okay kuzey yeah one minute

00:46:49,730 --> 00:47:18,200
woohoo oh where am I yes sorry I hope so

00:47:16,579 --> 00:47:21,980
we're not we're honestly not sure yet

00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:24,530
it's been true - I think form very low

00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:26,420
profile very hesitant to step out and

00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:30,560
step on anything

00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:34,160
early young leadership is really where

00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:36,260
we're seeing an emphasis so far in the

00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:38,540
discussions around the foundation but I

00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:40,670
do think this notion that he was

00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:43,430
responsible for all of these amazing

00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:44,390
steps it would be highly likely that it

00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:45,829
would be something that would be

00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:48,589
resonant and it would be an amazing

00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:57,790
contribution to to the discipline we

00:47:48,589 --> 00:47:57,790
have a yes guys thank you

00:48:12,479 --> 00:48:17,349
yeah when privacy is obviously an

00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:19,269
enormous concern that isn't our specific

00:48:17,349 --> 00:48:21,279
purview but we work very closely with

00:48:19,269 --> 00:48:22,900
organisations who have that like epic

00:48:21,279 --> 00:48:25,479
that have that right at the heart of

00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:28,329
what they do we try to stay as deeply

00:48:25,479 --> 00:48:31,059
connected as possible to organisations

00:48:28,329 --> 00:48:34,359
that have that interest at heart I mean

00:48:31,059 --> 00:48:37,209
I think for us we we sometimes will say

00:48:34,359 --> 00:48:39,609
you know as with data as open as

00:48:37,209 --> 00:48:41,410
possible as closed as necessary right

00:48:39,609 --> 00:48:43,150
and I do think there are shades of grey

00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:45,160
in terms of privacy with data that we're

00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:48,009
not talking about everything open to the

00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:49,989
hundredth degree all the time but

00:48:48,009 --> 00:48:51,999
thinking about the default being open

00:48:49,989 --> 00:48:54,579
unless or until that there's some reason

00:48:51,999 --> 00:48:56,589
including privacy reasons that you might

00:48:54,579 --> 00:48:58,029
not want to have everything available to

00:48:56,589 --> 00:48:59,559
be aggregated so that you know

00:48:58,029 --> 00:49:01,749
identifiers can be found there's no

00:48:59,559 --> 00:49:03,219
perfect solution that we're aware of it

00:49:01,749 --> 00:49:06,869
and we try to work very closely with

00:49:03,219 --> 00:49:06,869
organizations who are helpful in

00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:13,340
[Applause]
