00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:15,570
hi thanks for having me so about the

00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:18,480
idea of CSV template so my name is Roger

00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:21,180
Fisher I'm working on a project called

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:26,160
data map and we focus right now on

00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:29,820
elections worldwide we mapped the u.s.

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:33,090
we mapped the u.s. in different ways

00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:37,110
electoral college the counties and we

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:39,270
also started working on the counties

00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:42,960
themselves on a precinct maps for the

00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:46,110
counties this is a Amador in California

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:50,340
for example this is Jackson Michigan and

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:54,690
this is where I live in Berkeley Alameda

00:00:50,340 --> 00:01:00,059
County so blue is Democrat for Democrats

00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:03,930
obviously and the red part is for for

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:09,240
Donald Trump and the problem was while

00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:11,100
we were working on this we encountered

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:16,189
many many problems because there's so

00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:19,020
much variety and so we more and more we

00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:21,540
went to the point where we said well

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,189
this is kind of big seeing much bigger

00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,220
than we thought at the beginning we just

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:29,100
wanted to map some stuff I mean some

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:33,200
data and so we call this now the

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:39,930
election project or the elip and we the

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:42,090
format is CSV and we thought about kind

00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:45,930
of a system of modules where we have the

00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:49,340
election results maps that's what we are

00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:51,990
doing right now but also some more

00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:55,890
experimental stuff like color schemes

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:59,110
and political positioning candidates

00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:01,650
parties I mean kind of money

00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:04,090
in regards to candidates for example

00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:07,840
something the Federal Election

00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:09,820
Commission does also hardware vendors

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:15,220
voting hardware vendors and stuff like

00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:18,250
that so it's also next to the modules

00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:21,670
it's also a way of how to work with data

00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:25,930
basically how how to name data and we

00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:28,720
kind of coin some terms like raw X for

00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:30,700
external data then the data when it

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:34,420
comes together with the map the data

00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:38,230
when it's transformed and I will explain

00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:39,910
that with an example so the idea is to

00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:45,690
have a standard way of accomplishing

00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:49,150
things so that you can talk about it and

00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:51,190
yeah it should be easy to compare

00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:55,720
election data over time and space that

00:02:51,190 --> 00:03:00,610
was what we really wanted to do and it's

00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:03,550
not and the problem is especially for

00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:07,980
County data it's really hard to find the

00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:12,000
data you have to search for every county

00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:15,160
also on them for for some countries it's

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,530
easy like friends you have it in the

00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:19,870
night of the elections you don't have

00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:22,769
exit polls but in other countries like

00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:28,840
the u.s. it's the official data comes

00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:31,900
two months later basically and I think

00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:36,459
that's really a big problem in the u.s.

00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:38,650
because this kind of Trump saying there

00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:41,110
is election fraud this comes because we

00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:43,959
don't have this data in the open it's

00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:46,989
not published it's not nobody sees it

00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:50,290
there are maps all over the place but

00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:52,269
these maps are most often incorrect so

00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:56,400
even the New York Times had a map that

00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:59,430
was incorrect for about three months and

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:03,250
many publications have still maps online

00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:06,070
or people work with data have maps that

00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:08,030
are incorrect so I think that really has

00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:11,290
to change

00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:14,600
so the focus of this talk is to have

00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:18,170
some names so that we really know about

00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:21,290
what we are talking which we call the

00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:24,110
minimal set and then some issues like

00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:27,590
writings which are really tricky the

00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:30,950
residual load and then the process and

00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:33,290
then also percentages which you need to

00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:38,080
encode color and then some mapping

00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:40,570
issues and at the end something more

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:45,140
experimental which is colors and

00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:47,890
positioning and the idea of a global

00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,890
color scheme

00:04:54,190 --> 00:05:01,960
so make the implicit explicit that's the

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:05,620
idea of the minimal set so it's very a

00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:09,430
few terms but these terms we have to get

00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:13,870
them right and interestingly they change

00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:16,090
and/or people use them differently so we

00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:20,440
have in the u.s. mostly registered

00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:21,880
voters or we have only registered voters

00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,310
in other countries we have eligible

00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:26,860
voters so the difference is basically in

00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:29,080
a country like the Netherlands everyone

00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:31,600
can vote which is 18 more or less like

00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:34,480
56 people can't so they are eligible

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,970
voters in the u.s. you have to register

00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:40,360
to vote and so it's a much smaller

00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:43,690
portion of people ballots class that's

00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,190
really when people vote the ballots they

00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:49,480
send in I mean if they are like

00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:51,490
electronic or in paper so that's all the

00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:54,340
votes the total loads if you want and

00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:58,380
the turnout is the ballots cast divided

00:05:54,340 --> 00:06:01,180
by registered times hundred and then

00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:04,810
sometimes you also encounter kind of

00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:07,780
turnout for eligible loaders turnout

00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:11,980
voting age so that's often something you

00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:14,230
can see because you want to know how few

00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:18,310
people basically voted in an election

00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:22,180
and in the US that can go down to 30% or

00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:24,010
35% in some states and when you have

00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:27,790
turnout registered that all looks much

00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:31,780
prettier so you could have 70% turnout

00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:37,120
with the registered voters but only 3035

00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:39,010
percent turnout voting age and the next

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:43,419
thing that's really important I think

00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:46,780
and gets overlooked a lot is ballots

00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:49,390
cast you have valid votes and you have a

00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:52,090
residual world and the residual world is

00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:55,150
all the in valuables that are blank

00:06:52,090 --> 00:07:01,090
clothes / votes on the worlds all that

00:06:55,150 --> 00:07:04,390
stuff and yeah that's the residual world

00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:06,289
I will get to an example for Florida is

00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:12,499
something that can be we're really in

00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:16,849
testing to track so tricky the writings

00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:20,149
are really tricky because it changes

00:07:16,849 --> 00:07:22,669
from state to state so you have states

00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:25,430
where everyone every writing is a valid

00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:32,059
vote so basically someone can win the

00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:35,300
vote if if there enough people voted

00:07:32,059 --> 00:07:38,990
this writing in then you have the ones

00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:42,469
you have to be official writings and

00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:45,110
then you have other states where you

00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:49,059
can't have any writings only official

00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:52,819
candidates and so in Florida for example

00:07:49,059 --> 00:07:56,149
you really needed to know which ones are

00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:59,869
the official writings if you would vote

00:07:56,149 --> 00:08:02,479
for them that they would count and if

00:07:59,869 --> 00:08:04,520
you would take Bernie Sanders that would

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:08,779
be an invalid world so we have to

00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:11,809
differentiate that when we count that

00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:16,749
writing either in the valid or in the

00:08:11,809 --> 00:08:21,769
residual vote and now to the residual

00:08:16,749 --> 00:08:23,839
Florida which is the state which is

00:08:21,769 --> 00:08:27,339
super important for in every election

00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:30,559
basically it can decide the election

00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:32,839
this time the difference between Trump

00:08:30,559 --> 00:08:36,819
and Clinton was one hundred twelve

00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:40,010
thousand nine hundred eleven votes and

00:08:36,819 --> 00:08:42,740
we already know about 1.6 million

00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:47,779
Florida residents are barred from voting

00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:51,680
so already there a huge part of people

00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:54,110
who can't vote and suddenly we also see

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:59,689
and that's official document from

00:08:54,110 --> 00:09:02,930
Florida the residual load comes from

00:08:59,689 --> 00:09:09,410
0.75 percent to one point six nine

00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:12,829
percent from 2012 2016 interestingly the

00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:15,769
paper which talks about this from the

00:09:12,829 --> 00:09:18,170
Florida election commission only

00:09:15,769 --> 00:09:21,199
operates with percentages and it's

00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:23,779
really easy to get the numbers so and

00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:29,899
they say the reason for this is because

00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:34,100
we had mail the mail both basically is

00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:36,199
responsible for this increase and then I

00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,860
thought well let's look and make a

00:09:36,199 --> 00:09:42,259
comparison with another country and the

00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:44,839
the Dutch elections came up as well and

00:09:42,259 --> 00:09:47,509
so I just took the numbers from the

00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:51,220
Dutch because they pretty much fit we

00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:55,749
flirt with the Florida case so we have

00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:59,839
about twelve million eight hundred sixty

00:09:55,749 --> 00:10:04,549
ninety thousand eligible or registered

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:08,049
voters for Florida and we have only if

00:10:04,549 --> 00:10:11,809
you go down to the residual residual

00:10:08,049 --> 00:10:16,339
that's like the third block residual

00:10:11,809 --> 00:10:19,639
equals loads and you see that Florida

00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:21,649
jumped from sixty four thousand eighty

00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:24,709
five two hundred sixty thousand four

00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:27,290
hundred fifty whereas the Netherlands

00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:30,410
have only forty seven thousand four

00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:33,679
hundred fifteen reticule world so the

00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:38,089
difference if you subtract the Dutch

00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:41,990
vote residual load from the 2016 Florida

00:10:38,089 --> 00:10:47,389
vote is on the thirteen thousand thirty

00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:52,910
five and that's higher still than the

00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:57,860
margin so I find that really problematic

00:10:52,910 --> 00:11:03,589
and also if I see up there basically the

00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:05,540
difference from basically almost the

00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:08,660
same amount of people vote but one

00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:11,119
country is three point five million has

00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:15,559
has a population that is three point

00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:17,509
five million higher so I think it's

00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:19,759
really worse to see these numbers and

00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:22,339
that's something we don't see if you

00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:23,660
don't have the name for it the residual

00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:28,740
work

00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:31,350
so two weeks ago I was in Yosemite and

00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:34,890
it was like well we we do all these maps

00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:39,360
and how did you submit a national park

00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:41,640
code that could be interesting I knew it

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,580
I mean I already knew that it's a

00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:47,070
Republican County even though it's in

00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:51,510
California but people loaded Republican

00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:54,630
but I wanted to know just the National

00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:59,150
Park is that also Republican dominated

00:11:54,630 --> 00:12:03,570
or is it maybe the precinct is different

00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:06,360
so when we encounter raw election data

00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:11,850
we have the good we're here so people

00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:14,730
already use CSV text excel we have the

00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:17,010
bad that's PDFs but it's still

00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:20,100
extractable with tableau for example and

00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:24,840
we have two ugly basically a photo as a

00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:27,060
PDF so photo after of the data and you

00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:30,420
can't extract it so the only way of

00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:33,300
doing that is by hand so far unless

00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:36,780
someone comes up with an idea how to do

00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:41,940
this with machine learning kind of very

00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:44,910
intelligent way of doing that so in

00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:47,310
Mariposa County where the sanity

00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:52,020
National Park is located that looked

00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:55,200
like this at first so and then we went

00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:58,710
from the raw so we call this the raw you

00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:01,860
want a went from this we brought it to

00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:09,120
CSV we cleaned it one header no word

00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:11,370
lines we reduced it so all the the mail

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,370
volts we brought we brought them

00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:17,400
together with Election Day volts you can

00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:19,560
also separate them but in this case we

00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:22,410
bring them together we structure it

00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,760
along the minimal set we use the wide

00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:25,829
format

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:29,100
if you know like tidy the data from

00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:31,290
Hadley Wickham where the long format is

00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:34,110
used but we used white from it because

00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:37,230
we want to map it afterwards so we went

00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:41,040
to this and then further down to this

00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:44,240
and so you see registered ballots cast

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:47,459
turn out well it's down Clinton residual

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:50,750
very simple and then we bring it

00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:54,449
together with with kind of the the map

00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:59,310
part is the map part which we call the

00:13:54,449 --> 00:14:02,010
rest the X part again and then we have

00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:06,329
all the data together so that that's the

00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:08,880
process basically and now we still it's

00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:10,649
still impossible to map that so we need

00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,350
further data transformations and there

00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:19,320
again we have a problem so we want to

00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:20,940
normalize to basically color the map we

00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:26,100
need to normalize the data and have

00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:31,220
percentages and so what percentage is is

00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:35,339
it candidates ballots cast is it is it

00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:39,480
can candidate divided by written by well

00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:43,610
it as I looked at maps and I looked

00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:51,449
again at Florida and checked newspapers

00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:57,540
so the in Florida officially 49% the New

00:14:51,449 --> 00:15:00,120
York Times is 48.6% Cook has 49% I think

00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:03,029
this is political CNN they have even

00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:06,540
that was like two weeks ago a fourteen

00:15:03,029 --> 00:15:09,630
and forty point six percent for the nine

00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:13,079
point one percent for the so so yes all

00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:16,980
kind of data and all kind of percentages

00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:19,139
and so we just try to define these

00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:22,199
things and say well its candidate

00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:24,060
divided by validates times 100 it's as

00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:26,610
easy as that and you get to the numbers

00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:29,699
but I think it's really worth doing that

00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:32,600
once for all so that everyone everyone

00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:37,610
can follow that

00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:42,700
and so basically yeah Yosemite is

00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:46,280
democratic precinct in Republican County

00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:50,570
so it's a Clinton had sixty seven point

00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:55,160
twelve percent and drum pad seventeen

00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:59,680
point eighty one then I just go over

00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:02,570
that we have some edge cases with maps

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:05,030
maybe one interesting one is about

00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:09,980
Beauty County also in California which

00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:13,550
is again Republican County you can have

00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:18,260
some issues where where we have

00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:21,620
basically data for seven eight precincts

00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:27,280
in instead of just one and so you have

00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:30,830
to kind of solve this problem - so now

00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:33,770
something a little bit more experimental

00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:39,260
in this election project

00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:41,870
it's about color and yeah all entities

00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:45,920
move and nothing remains till things

00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:48,260
change and so how do we do that with

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:51,620
color how do you have consistency over

00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:57,010
time here you have the Netherlands

00:16:51,620 --> 00:17:00,050
elections 2006 2010 2012 and 2017 and

00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:02,360
you see if you have consistent colors

00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:06,079
it's really nice you can see what's

00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:09,199
happening over time how priorities kind

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:14,030
of fade away new parties come take over

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:21,439
and or some parties again come up or go

00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:28,820
back and yeah with we also do things

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:31,280
like color scales in four countries then

00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:33,440
you have even so you have even more a

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,710
problem with with color because you have

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:40,310
if you have more parties and you want to

00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:44,419
also show the differences you even need

00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:46,429
more colors and and the problem was

00:17:44,419 --> 00:17:49,159
I mean if you're not from the

00:17:46,429 --> 00:17:51,499
Netherlands could you read this map or

00:17:49,159 --> 00:17:54,679
could you read this these maps

00:17:51,499 --> 00:17:57,049
here this French maps they are all the

00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:59,809
same but basically you don't know which

00:17:57,049 --> 00:18:03,049
part is what and so we thought it would

00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:07,369
be really interesting to have a kind of

00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:10,070
a global color space where we have like

00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:12,950
left-right Progressive Conservatives so

00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:18,769
that's one idea here most of a

00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:22,820
subjective one here and just go over

00:18:18,769 --> 00:18:27,559
that and if we combine that with this

00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:32,809
compass idea like here and we see also

00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:37,999
how priorities change we could color our

00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:42,200
maps in a bad way and we could probably

00:18:37,999 --> 00:18:46,429
see some things better than before so I

00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:49,399
found the part from welder is lepen

00:18:46,429 --> 00:18:55,269
they're all in this dark conservative

00:18:49,399 --> 00:18:59,510
part really interesting and here also

00:18:55,269 --> 00:19:01,989
another one where you see basically the

00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:04,309
[Music]

00:19:01,989 --> 00:19:07,759
prediction what would happen with the

00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:11,899
Democratic and Republican Party and what

00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:15,220
really happened and here also I mean

00:19:11,899 --> 00:19:17,419
obviously there are also people put

00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:26,330
politicians differently in this color

00:19:17,419 --> 00:19:30,019
space so yeah that was it just a a quick

00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:32,600
recap the alop the election project is a

00:19:30,019 --> 00:19:35,330
set of modules you look at election

00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:38,480
election results at precinct level the

00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:41,299
stages from raw to AXT from data to the

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:44,359
map the minimal set which really tries

00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:46,429
to define things very very clearly so

00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:49,340
that we can use them everywhere in the

00:19:46,429 --> 00:19:53,040
world and then the more

00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:55,770
experimental features general global

00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:58,650
political color space so that everyone

00:19:55,770 --> 00:20:00,540
can see when he looks at the map what's

00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:03,350
really happening and also what's

00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:06,420
happening over time with a compass

00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:12,050
nearby to position candidates and to see

00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:12,050
