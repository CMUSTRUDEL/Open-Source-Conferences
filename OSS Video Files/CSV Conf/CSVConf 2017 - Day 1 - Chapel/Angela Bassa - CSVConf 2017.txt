00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:15,030
hi oh my I hope you feel like that at

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,029
the end as well

00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:20,369
I feel like of all the people talking on

00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:23,160
the pulpit I'm the one who's not

00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:25,680
preaching to the choir because I'm

00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,810
talking about corporate data science as

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,840
opposed to indie data science which i

00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:33,300
think is what a lot of you folks here

00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,890
are more interested in in terms of

00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,410
vocation but mostly in terms of what

00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,730
works and what doesn't unfortunately

00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,610
that's not my background my background

00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:44,370
is very much in the corporate world I

00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,410
have several reasons for it some of them

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,930
I'm not super proud oh they're a little

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,250
bit cowardly some of them are well if

00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,780
I'm going to go down this route because

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,219
I need health insurance then I'm going

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:58,920
to make a change from the inside and

00:00:53,219 --> 00:01:01,530
become the fifth column so here is sort

00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,589
of my feel-good here's sort of my

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:07,860
feel-good slide about why I think that

00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:11,970
this is an appropriate approach for for

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:13,530
this division of labor I think people

00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:17,280
are really really quite happy when they

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:19,799
can afford to buy the Asian pear instead

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,659
of the Macintosh Apple just because they

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:25,020
want and not because it's cheaper or

00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:27,270
more expensive and I think that's there

00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,490
are different drivers for different

00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:34,640
humans some humans really are driven by

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:37,200
that competitive monetary component of

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,229
data excellence and technical excellence

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,630
and some of them are not and after much

00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:45,659
therapy I'm kind of in the middle I kind

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:48,119
of like being able to afford things but

00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:52,680
but I also don't think that that should

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:54,509
be incumbent upon a whole swath of other

00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,240
humans not being able to do what they

00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:59,490
want so it's a challenge I'm in therapy

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:03,210
I'm sure many of you are as well but my

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:05,640
point here is that there exists a sweet

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,890
spot where you can find somebody who has

00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,840
a need for what your talent is is that

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,450
that person is also willing to pay you

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,310
those who normally don't go hand in hand

00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,230
and it's because you have a vocation

00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:18,510
that solved the particular problem and

00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:20,040
it's a problem that somebody has said

00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:22,590
this is valuable enough to me that I

00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:26,069
will help solve it be that the smullin

00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:30,090
foundation the Gates Foundation or you

00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:30,720
know the Republic of of Brazil which is

00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:35,940
where I'm from

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:37,650
so this is sort of the the genesis for

00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,180
why I think that I wanted to tell you

00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:44,519
guys a little bit about what it would

00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:48,120
feel like to live behind the curtain and

00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:50,880
I'm going to let you guys see us at the

00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,370
corporate curtain so anyway this is one

00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:55,250
of my favorite slides this is a I don't

00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:59,430
know if you guys know who the group is

00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:01,709
any hands oh this is awesome so I will

00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,750
be the person who introduces you guys to

00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:06,720
the concepts of the group the group is a

00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:08,790
security engineer he talks quite a bit

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,130
he is very well known in the field and

00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:13,709
nobody knows his actual name I tried

00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:16,799
quite hard to figure it out first I was

00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:19,320
very unmatched so I'm going to leave his

00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:21,060
his handle there and exercise to the

00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,299
radar figure out who he is he's very

00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,829
smart and he does a lot of

00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:28,280
counterintelligence if you're into that

00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:31,500
but the point of this slide is that

00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:34,280
context in data is everything so how

00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,420
many of you can see the cow

00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,280
don't tell your neighbor if you see the

00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,989
cow

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:44,519
okay let's clip it who cannot see the

00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:46,560
cow right but use of things once you see

00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:51,299
the cow you won't be able to unsee it

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:53,579
forever I came across this picture 16

00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:54,840
years ago and I still use it because

00:03:53,579 --> 00:04:00,660
it's phenomenal for those of you who

00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:05,519
can't see the cow that's an eye that's

00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:09,840
an eye that's another eye that's his his

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:11,819
or her ear ear right here some nostril

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:17,320
action down here

00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:19,180
and so that that context is really what

00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,579
you're seeking is the ability to see the

00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:23,530
whole and identify the parts that are

00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:27,639
descriptive that allow you to get a

00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:30,490
greater picture of the problem or of the

00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:32,410
solution or of the data set to stretch

00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:35,050
the metaphor but this is in essence what

00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:36,880
we are doing behind the scenes in the in

00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:39,580
corporate America corporate Europe

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,680
corporate geography which is very

00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:45,539
similar to the work that happens in in

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:48,130
the indie world so since data without

00:04:45,539 --> 00:04:50,740
context is useless why don't I give you

00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:52,389
guys a little bit of context so my

00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:55,000
background is I'm a recovering data

00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:57,370
scientist I have been doing data science

00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:03,669
for many many years without a PhD it's

00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:06,060
possible and and what what I have

00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:08,590
learned over the years is that

00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:12,220
controlling numbers and controlling code

00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:14,080
it's impossibly difficult it's doable

00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:16,840
but it's very difficult but the thing

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:20,740
that got me really excited to get up in

00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:21,370
the morning was was getting people to do

00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,889
those things

00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:25,690
programming people which sounds

00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:28,539
Machiavelli cool but it's really not it

00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:31,060
is what's the meta level at which I'm

00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:32,979
not the one telling zeros and ones what

00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:36,729
to do but I am bringing together a team

00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:40,180
of people who can produce a whole that

00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:43,120
is bigger than the sum of the parts now

00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:47,620
the difference between MDS data science

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:49,360
and corporate data science is that you

00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,580
work for the man

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,430
the it's not personal it's not academic

00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:57,310
it's a business and it's cutthroat and

00:05:54,430 --> 00:06:00,250
it's cruel and it takes it takes an

00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:01,720
inhuman amount of effort to live it and

00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:08,280
still maintain your kindness and your

00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:10,840
integrity and your and your soul so to

00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:13,240
really get at the point of what it is

00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:15,699
but how can you do this in a way that is

00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,720
is that maintains your integrity so

00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:18,430
these are the three things that I'm

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,650
going to talk to you guys about how is

00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:23,080
it that we data Science and Industry and

00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:25,080
what are the similarities with indie

00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,210
data science and then

00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,629
you build effective teams that can solve

00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:34,949
both industrial problems as well as

00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:37,409
civic problems government problems legal

00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:39,150
problems from a data with with a data

00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:41,789
Bend and then lastly I'll talk about

00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:43,469
what you do to keep that going and so

00:06:41,789 --> 00:06:47,370
that it isn't something that disappears

00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:49,340
at every cycle of regeneration of

00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:54,330
whatever administration or whatever

00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:55,560
management upline you're dealing with so

00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:59,099
some things don't change

00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,990
that's the that's the the the first

00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:02,250
thing between the two you still have to

00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:04,289
be able to data collection you still

00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,639
have to deal with data exploration half

00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:07,469
the clean and you have to transform a

00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:09,419
TTL ad model it validated you've got to

00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:10,919
communicate it somehow you got to deploy

00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:12,110
it you've got to understand it after

00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:14,940
you've deployed it so that you can

00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:19,199
undress play it after you've done all

00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:21,419
sorts of modifications and edits to it

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:25,699
that when you push the notification oh

00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:30,360
bugs fixed is like 122 megabyte update

00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:33,479
still doesn't the I don't know if you

00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:36,779
guys know who II D it what about any

00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:38,580
odontophobia II D is from his with

00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:42,210
Domino data lab and he gave a really

00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:45,629
cool presentation at CDW I month ago

00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:46,650
actually but this is it's recorded you

00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:48,870
should watch the whole thing he's

00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:50,250
brilliant but this is the part that I

00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,960
want to focus on and it's not even his

00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:55,830
slide he stole it so I'm stealing it

00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:58,710
from him this is a Gilardi Kafka slide

00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:01,469
on the cycle of understanding and all

00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:03,449
the bits and pieces that data science

00:08:01,469 --> 00:08:05,190
teams end up being responsible for

00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:06,930
whether they want to or not it sort of

00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:09,509
falls on them and if you're really lucky

00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:11,159
you have a team of data engineers I've

00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:15,509
heard some awesome names today data

00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:18,629
plumbers data what was the best one it

00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:20,849
did I'm not going to remember I'm sorry

00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:23,039
but there are some really good names but

00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:26,669
this is essentially what we're doing

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:29,520
either in industry or or independently

00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:32,010
here's where it changes a little bit the

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,350
piece that is a little bit new

00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:35,820
in the industry world is the

00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:38,280
introduction of production software

00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,840
either this be production software that

00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:42,270
you sell you put a price input on

00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:44,930
shelves or production software that

00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:47,520
powers the internal processes within

00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:51,420
your department or within cross

00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:54,210
departmental II in an example here would

00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:55,740
be improving the logistics with your

00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:57,270
contract manufacturers when you're

00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:00,830
talking to folks who are putting your

00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:03,870
robots together across the world so

00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:06,510
where where does data science need to

00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:08,340
fit once you're behind the curtain and

00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:10,110
I'm telling you guys all of this a

00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:13,380
little bit because I think maybe you

00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:15,540
want to go work for an industry at some

00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:18,030
point a corporate entity some point and

00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:22,310
I'm absolving you of the fact that there

00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:25,170
are good guys out there so find those

00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:27,780
but also because there's a lot of

00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:31,920
information that that is nicely

00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:34,020
transferable so this is a particularly

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,390
transferable one because let me tell you

00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:39,270
a story about siloed data what a lot of

00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:40,800
independent data scientists have to deal

00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:44,100
with and we've heard lots of stories

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,950
about this here today is that a

00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:48,780
particular organization have some of the

00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:51,000
data and then a particular department

00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:53,280
within the civil organization has some

00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,230
data and then the Town Hall has some

00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:57,660
data and then a police department has

00:09:55,230 --> 00:10:00,420
some data the exact same thing is

00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:02,610
mimicked in the microcosm that I work in

00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:04,680
you have finance you have IT you have

00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:06,150
ops you have legal you have marketing

00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:09,770
you have engineering you have product

00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:12,990
and this is this is sort of a poetic

00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:20,340
licensed amalgamation of all the bits

00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:23,940
that are present in a post startup stage

00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:26,250
and this is where data science has to

00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,110
work once you are inside which means

00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:31,380
whatever domain expertise you think you

00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:33,320
had out the window 70% of the time you

00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:36,960
may be really really really good at

00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:39,030
parsing and doing NLP on contracts so

00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:43,380
that you can identify areas that

00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:48,500
increase your risk of takeover or

00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:50,760
any kind of financial problems but

00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,990
that's not the first project that you're

00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,400
going to be working on because that's

00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:55,200
not the highest priority to the business

00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,420
and the business dictates that you're

00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,310
going to now be working on improving

00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:02,640
legacy product and making it more

00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:05,040
resilient and stable yay all that money

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,800
that I went to law schools you can't use

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,600
it anymore at least not for a while so

00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,490
almost every organization that I've

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,720
worked at there's there's PDFs and

00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:16,650
emails and CSVs if you're lucky

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,810
proprietary spreadsheets and they're

00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:21,240
strewn across departments locations

00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:23,970
fiefdom levels there are people who left

00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,890
and store them and somebody forgot the

00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:28,290
password of where the thing was stored

00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:32,010
which is great because there was a

00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:34,110
password because you wouldn't believe

00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:36,180
also the amount of data that is just

00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:38,760
floating internally and everybody just

00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:41,190
like although we're all one company what

00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:44,180
could go wrong and then you have to tell

00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:46,890
them that you know people sometimes

00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:48,780
break up with a significant order of

00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:53,610
significant other and they become

00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:56,160
slightly disassociative and then they

00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:57,630
have really interesting ideas that they

00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,460
can follow through and the enemy is

00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:02,430
within you have to protect your data

00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:04,770
from your own people when you're working

00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:06,570
on altruistic projects that's less of a

00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:09,180
concern when you're working in in

00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:12,840
corporate America you have to lock these

00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:14,810
stuff down and I would have cursed this

00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:18,560
is magical

00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:20,510
there's a flower here alright some

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,960
things change quite a bit so once you go

00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:26,300
into these large organizations here it's

00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,680
it's complicated sort of on purpose

00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,910
because that's the message that I'm

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,360
trying to send is that it gets

00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:34,550
complicated very quickly because because

00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,350
of golf law you have things start simply

00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:39,350
and then you start adding appendages to

00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:41,600
it and adding dependencies and and using

00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:45,050
it for purposes that it wasn't intended

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:47,570
to be used for so up there I have the

00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:50,540
architectures of Facebook is there

00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:55,760
pinterest is there Corps is there Airbnb

00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:58,700
is there Twitter is there so very very

00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:03,770
very complicated data infrastructures

00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:05,890
require data analytic skills that allow

00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:10,040
you to navigate through all of those

00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:12,880
different mappings of how the data

00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:15,050
operates and there's some skill there

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,360
there's there's definitely some

00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:19,970
programmer and data analyst skill but

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:23,600
there's also some overarching skill of

00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:25,070
how do you build the best symphony with

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,050
all of your folks who are your

00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:30,890
violinists who are really great at

00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:35,230
dealing with queueing data ingestion

00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:38,000
pipelines into your your computational

00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:39,500
lambdas I live in a service world now so

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,090
there are people who are really good at

00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,860
understanding all of that piping and

00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:46,850
plumbing and those people are worth

00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:48,710
their weight in magical fairy dust very

00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:51,970
hard to find then you have folks who are

00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:54,290
incredible analysts but they come from

00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:57,590
the school of thought that I came from

00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:59,210
which is who cares truth is truth

00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:01,490
just give me the numbers and I will find

00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:03,770
truth and after a couple of years you

00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:08,180
eat a lot of Crow and you realize now

00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:12,190
how it works because what ends up

00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:16,390
happening is you start having these

00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:18,830
unicorn did it flash I put the special

00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:21,470
animation there because unicorns deserve

00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:23,570
special animation so what ends up

00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:25,560
happening is you hire this unicorn who

00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:28,100
is capable of doing everything

00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:32,129
and you don't change any of the culture

00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:33,689
beforehand and so the the unicorn shows

00:14:32,129 --> 00:14:35,519
up for a meeting and everybody in that

00:14:33,689 --> 00:14:37,740
mean is like why is the unicorn here

00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,180
we're not ready for the unicorn we have

00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,860
all of these other problems that we have

00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,870
to deal with and this unicorn is just

00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,490
going to make everything complicated and

00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:46,230
difficult and it's all going to be about

00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:48,809
this one person then they're going to be

00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:50,670
the 10x developer and they're going to

00:14:48,809 --> 00:14:52,410
be the stop gas through which every

00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:55,879
decision and all of a sudden you've

00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:59,999
created an incredibly dysfunctional team

00:14:55,879 --> 00:15:01,980
in fact what you want to acknowledge is

00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:04,230
that you have blended objectives so I'm

00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:08,100
going to wonder a little bit and I think

00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:12,779
that might have a problem with me if I

00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:17,879
can not wonder this is so hard I'm such

00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:20,569
a wonderer okay so up here I have a two

00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:24,689
by two where most most projects are

00:15:20,569 --> 00:15:26,339
divided in these in these quadrants

00:15:24,689 --> 00:15:28,860
where you either have your team working

00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:30,300
on novel things things that are not on

00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:32,100
the market but they're super secret that

00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:34,589
you can't open source there are the

00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:36,629
crown jewels and then you have sometimes

00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:38,279
the same team at a different point in

00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:40,170
time or sometimes half of your team

00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:42,360
working on something that is very legacy

00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:45,540
very understood it's your money maker is

00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:47,339
the thing that you issue pager duties

00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:50,189
for right like this one is the one that

00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:53,100
cannot go down ever and then you have

00:15:50,189 --> 00:15:56,250
this other dimension to to this 2 by 2

00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:58,199
which is doing R&D which are things that

00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:00,779
are inherently uncertain they're

00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:03,990
iterative because this is a side that's

00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:06,059
much harder to to explain to senior

00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:09,149
management why so much money is getting

00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:10,679
sunk in they're very smart senior

00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:12,420
management understands the ROI the

00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:15,449
return on investment that you get here

00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:18,600
but q' near ones don't and they continue

00:16:15,449 --> 00:16:23,209
to challenge what the point is and then

00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:25,860
you go from very ad hoc processes of of

00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:28,199
these iterative processes all the way to

00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:30,059
production scale and when you hit

00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:32,850
production scale it has to be resilient

00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:35,100
it has to be reliable it has to be able

00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:37,500
to scale and you have to never ever ever

00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:42,930
crap out unless

00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:45,390
unless a vendor of yours will stay

00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:49,440
unnamed because I love them and they

00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:53,430
give me discount when when they go

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:56,070
offline then you know that's smoked so

00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:57,840
the first thing that I want to say in

00:16:56,070 --> 00:17:02,100
terms of the differences but things that

00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:04,350
learnings that can be applied in the in

00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:07,410
the independent data science world is

00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:09,450
that when you're working on on something

00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:12,750
that is at the production scale you tend

00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:15,660
to work on it from a very legacy mindset

00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:20,310
of don't break it for the love of God

00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:22,320
and just make it run at scale and my

00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:24,240
position is that that's a that's a huge

00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,710
waste of resources because that is

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,320
something that is really well understood

00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:30,420
and and you could push the limits there

00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:33,990
and you can bring that very well

00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:37,260
understood process and turn it and

00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:39,350
reframe it as an R&D process so that

00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:42,210
will generate things like improved

00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:43,920
optimizations of of the code improved

00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:46,050
performance of the code when was the

00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:50,010
last time that that code got refactored

00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:51,750
for for the 13th instantiation of the

00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:53,340
architecture that you have no control

00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:55,020
over because if you're lucky you have a

00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:58,740
dedicated team of data engineers

00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:59,400
fiddling with that and on the other

00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:05,730
direction

00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:07,380
you also have legacy projects that you

00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:09,810
could push into production and you can

00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:11,580
improve the delivery into production you

00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:14,190
can introduce things like continuous

00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:15,960
deployment because obviously the first

00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:19,740
time this was done it was a version

00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:22,590
point 8 and it works it makes money and

00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:25,320
it's going to go into version 1.0 in two

00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:29,330
fiscal years no you can actually have

00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:33,930
all of that that embedded knowledge and

00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:37,560
turn that into novel approaches for

00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:39,240
using the legacy understanding likewise

00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:42,390
the same thing happens on the top left

00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:45,060
where you're usually doing things in Rd

00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:47,400
that they are going to end up becoming

00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:49,200
intellectual property that that the

00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,110
company is going to hoard

00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,750
but what you can do is you can push it

00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:56,220
towards intellectual property that is

00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,659
not core to the business that is

00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:01,820
valuable to the community and that's

00:18:57,659 --> 00:19:06,110
what you start open-source so there are

00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:10,260
there are definitely places where

00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:14,940
combinations between you know the dark

00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:19,289
side of the force me and and the Jedi

00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:21,899
can work together so that's what doing

00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:23,370
data Science and Industry is I have all

00:19:21,899 --> 00:19:25,230
sorts of other things that I am very

00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:28,320
excited about none of which I can talk

00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:30,360
to you about because we haven't launched

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:34,559
it yet and it hasn't been vetted by PR

00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:37,200
the name of the game I signed up for it

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:39,690
okay so how do you build effective data

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,720
science teams that that are capable of

00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:45,389
delivering on that promise who's playing

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:48,690
the bingo the data science Pingo anyone

00:19:45,389 --> 00:19:50,909
you can mark through Conway's Venn

00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:51,210
diagram on your on your boards there you

00:19:50,909 --> 00:19:54,419
go

00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:57,779
so the the data scientist archetype is

00:19:54,419 --> 00:20:01,500
this is archetype of this magical beast

00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:03,409
that can just do all of the hacking and

00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,700
knows all of the mass and has studied

00:20:03,409 --> 00:20:08,279
statistics with rigor and have

00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:10,830
substantial domain expertise from having

00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:13,049
spent 65 years trudging through the

00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:15,440
jungles of soybean and trade

00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:15,440
introgression

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:24,090
that's what it turns into

00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:25,950
did it flicker again yeah okay so and my

00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:30,330
point very sad this is full I mean no

00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:32,190
offense to drew drew drew drew drew that

00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:35,190
Venn diagram for a very specific reason

00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:37,169
which I've stolen to bastardize so this

00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:40,529
is not on him but it sets up my joke

00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:43,289
really nicely which is that unicorns

00:20:40,529 --> 00:20:45,600
have a very specific intuition which it

00:20:43,289 --> 00:20:47,549
is not accurate because it is not the

00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:51,750
cumulative experience of the rest of

00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:55,529
their so when you drop a unicorn into a

00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:58,510
room of data normies by what I'm a date

00:20:55,529 --> 00:21:01,990
of norming so I mean that with the

00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:03,610
respect and it just simply doesn't work

00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:06,330
very well because what what ends up

00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:09,760
happening is you unicorns don't exist

00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:12,790
they don't you have llamas which we

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:16,900
might are you know not be able to pet

00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:18,880
soon enough in less than 24 hours but

00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,440
you have zebras and you have horses and

00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,460
you have to rest and you have gazelles

00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,760
and you have all sorts of different

00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:26,799
beasts that offer different perspectives

00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:29,620
that brings different gifts to the team

00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:32,980
that look at things in ways that you'd

00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:37,240
never imagined which brings me to yet

00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:39,400
another piece that of insight that's

00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:49,210
really key who here has heard of super

00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:51,520
chickens oh wow so um xkcd has this one

00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:53,520
magical little drawing that he does

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,750
where he talks about the joy of

00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,760
introducing a room of very smart people

00:21:55,750 --> 00:22:00,970
to a concept that they haven't seen yet

00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:04,270
just by virtue of of serendipity so get

00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:07,000
ready and I'm gonna get to do with this

00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:09,070
is great so super chickens there wasn't

00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:15,400
as an evolutionary biologist I think it

00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:17,590
Perdue Muir William years I think and he

00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,450
studied chickens like you do and he was

00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:21,130
interested in productivity to see if

00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:23,590
there's something that he can do about a

00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:27,220
combination of different personalities

00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:30,400
different genomes phenotypes interacting

00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:33,460
together and his measure you might

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:38,730
imagine is the amount of eggs that that

00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:43,010
they would yield

00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:46,460
that is that the great verb for okay I

00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:50,210
did soybean stuff I did stuff at plan I

00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:53,250
never worked with actual feathered

00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:57,980
soybeans anyway the chickens leaves live

00:22:53,250 --> 00:23:01,200
in a group and if you put a lot of high

00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:03,929
egg-laying chickens in a group of

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,720
moderate and low laying chickens they

00:23:03,929 --> 00:23:09,150
sort of the average goes slightly up and

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:12,000
everybody's fine and no big deal but if

00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:14,730
you select the best laying chicken out

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,030
of lots of populations and you create a

00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:21,270
population that is artificially inflated

00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:28,280
with only super chickens they kill each

00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:32,160
other in a matter of week true research

00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:36,090
so it takes six generations of this

00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:39,500
culling and and all super chickens are

00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:44,850
dead so my takeaway from this is that

00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:47,730
the 10x engineer is real there exists

00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:51,990
such a thing as a single super chicken

00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:56,330
that can elevate the output and the

00:23:51,990 --> 00:24:00,299
morale and the integrity and the

00:23:56,330 --> 00:24:01,950
personality and the joy of a team but if

00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:03,840
you put too many super to students in

00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:06,210
there then then you create these

00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,610
pernicious relationships between them

00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:10,470
that actually detract more than they add

00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:14,490
to what it is that you're trying to

00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:16,470
achieve I'll give you another example I

00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:21,590
didn't want to be cruel but that's

00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:24,750
Charles of Spain Charles of Spain had no

00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:27,450
voice in how he came out right like he

00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:30,660
was born in and just like all of us he

00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:33,059
just fell into whatever his vessel was

00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:37,049
going to be I'm not going to complain I

00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:39,330
sigh no like I do why tonight pass and I

00:24:37,049 --> 00:24:41,880
have all sorts of opportunities that are

00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:45,200
granted to me because of the way that

00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:49,800
I'm the whitest Brazilian you will meet

00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:53,880
and yes I am Brazilian born and raised

00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:55,500
so what happened here is that the same

00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:59,340
thing that happens genetically and

00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:03,180
phenotypically to to royal families that

00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:04,710
do a lot of Imbrium for wanting to

00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:06,120
maintain purity they're doing the same

00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:08,820
thing that they did into the super

00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:12,720
chicken essentially and so what ends up

00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:15,860
happening is that you end up if you do

00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:19,620
that in your team so not chickens not

00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:22,460
inbreeding but in your team if you only

00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:24,630
bring in people from the same

00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:26,550
universities from the same programs the

00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:30,240
same disciplines the same domains the

00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:32,730
same age group the same demographics the

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,470
same original geographies who speak the

00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:36,330
same computer languages who speak the

00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:40,280
same natural languages who have never

00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:42,570
gone through what it means to have two

00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:45,480
transliterate what's happening on-screen

00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:47,340
to their mom right so when when

00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,320
something crazy goes on the news and my

00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:51,990
mom is asking me what's going on I don't

00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:53,760
tell her exactly word for word what's on

00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:56,330
the TV because they're going to be using

00:25:53,760 --> 00:26:01,110
idioms and they're going to be using

00:25:56,330 --> 00:26:03,090
jargon and shorthand that doesn't map to

00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:07,250
what her mental map of a vernacular is

00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:10,110
and I have to do those ETLs on the fly

00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:12,540
that's something that you need to have

00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:15,090
at your disposal in a team wide

00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:17,100
environment so that every single player

00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:20,220
is bringing something or not necessarily

00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:23,490
I mean it's a traveling salesman problem

00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:26,130
it is not trivial to compute if you

00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:28,980
actually want to go out and see how many

00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:30,360
of each kind and at what level you start

00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,800
having diminishing returns I'll leave

00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:34,500
that as an exercise to the reader and

00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:37,820
not gone through that but personally my

00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:40,740
my heuristics are of the last four teams

00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:45,900
that I have built from the ground up to

00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:50,250
deliver on data science promises that

00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:52,200
companies make to the street this is

00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:56,310
this is by far the method that has

00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:58,110
worked best for me and I think one of

00:26:56,310 --> 00:27:01,350
the things that you want to avoid

00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:03,070
obviously you don't want to cause

00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:05,530
intellectual inbreeding

00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:07,720
usually not something that anybody sets

00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:10,060
out to do but what does end up happening

00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:12,700
is you have these mirror toc receipts

00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:15,190
which aren't necessarily meritocracies

00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:17,010
which that's a whole nother semantic

00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:20,740
discussion of whether or not that's a

00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:23,950
charisma curse word that I would use but

00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:25,600
I'm not because holy ground I don't

00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:29,560
believe in meritocracies I think they

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:31,600
are a ridiculous exercise and self

00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:34,510
retention but I'll talk over drinks with

00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:36,670
you if you want to discuss it but the

00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:39,310
survivorship bias is I think something

00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:41,530
that we really don't don't talk a lot

00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:44,880
about much because what you're trying to

00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:48,880
do is you build a really solid kick-ass

00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:54,130
kick-butt team I'm from Boston this is

00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:56,920
so hard is that it you know there's this

00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:59,380
this cartoon by David Whittaker which I

00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:02,500
find just incredibly insightful which is

00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:04,300
that what we think we know we think of

00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:08,110
it as just this fraction of all that is

00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:11,980
knowable and then we just join everybody

00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:15,970
else is knowable as if it's this matrix

00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:17,440
like goo soup that you can just plug in

00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:19,930
and like oh I can fight come through now

00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,330
that's not how it works everybody has a

00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:23,920
finite amount some of the bubbles are a

00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:25,660
little bit bigger some of the levels are

00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:28,720
a little bit smaller but really what you

00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:30,670
have is some real little small bubbles

00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,080
here about one topic and another bubble

00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:34,060
here and another bubble here and when

00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,590
you have lots of people together what

00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:39,070
you're trying to do is to plug the gap

00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:42,280
you're trying to figure out what those

00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:44,740
edges are and if you have any edges that

00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:46,210
don't overlap that tells you who's your

00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:48,940
next person that you need to hire and

00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:50,620
you personally I don't hire for race I

00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:52,930
don't hire for gender I don't hire for

00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:56,380
mathematicians I don't hire for

00:28:52,930 --> 00:29:00,730
engineers I hire for what is it that my

00:28:56,380 --> 00:29:03,670
team needs and then I bring that person

00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:05,950
in and I interview lots of people who

00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:08,080
meet those but that goes for me that

00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:10,540
goes into the job description I want

00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:13,300
somebody who has experience managing a

00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:15,190
power plant in Saudi Arabia don't ask me

00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:17,770
why I needed that I did I found

00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:19,390
but you need to really figure out of the

00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:22,810
things that you're being asked to the

00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:30,730
liver what are the the gaps what are the

00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:35,080
lack of overlaps and build that now as

00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:36,760
you build your team there's more than

00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,870
one way to skin a cat and why would you

00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:41,650
want to skin a cat because they're

00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:43,930
adorable but the joke aside and it's

00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:46,330
it's CSV conference I needed a cat

00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:48,190
picture I just fit but this is to remind

00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:51,130
me there's a there's a really

00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:55,350
interesting research paper from Amy

00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:58,600
Amundsen on and she did it with them the

00:29:55,350 --> 00:30:01,810
there's a google research team doing

00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:03,460
things on just people skills and amy

00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:06,040
Allinson was was heading one of these

00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:12,670
and she found that the thing that makes

00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:14,950
teams more competent with the definition

00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:18,220
of competency being meeting all of the

00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:22,260
measures as defined by the overlords of

00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:25,090
google which it's a well-established

00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:27,190
test whether i agree with with the

00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:29,800
parameters or not but they did find that

00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:32,140
the one thing that corp so size of team

00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:39,070
didn't correlate with improved outcomes

00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:41,680
and the seniority of the average

00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:44,470
seniority of the people or the the

00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:46,180
variance of seniority with same teams

00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:47,680
none of that matter it turns out that

00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:50,350
you could control for all of that and

00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:52,180
not have any significant impact in the

00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:54,040
outcome the one thing that made a

00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:58,060
difference is psychological safety and

00:30:54,040 --> 00:31:00,310
low anxiety so what you're doing is

00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:02,590
you're building a team that is capable

00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:06,360
of have a feeling psychological safety

00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:12,040
and feeling low anxiety now I'm a wimp

00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:14,650
so I need a lot of tolerance from my

00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:17,080
level of neurosis but not everybody does

00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:19,180
that and I have been in teams that don't

00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,830
abide by somebody with my level of

00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:23,440
neuroses and we don't work well together

00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:26,350
that's fine as a point is to identify

00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,070
that soon enough to find a team where

00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:31,840
that's the

00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:34,779
exactly the the skill or the ability

00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:37,679
that will plug a hole in your team have

00:31:34,779 --> 00:31:39,610
you ever heard of those two stood Oh

00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:43,990
formations from the Romans

00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:46,929
like in Sparta where they have rectangle

00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:49,809
and everybody has their shield and they

00:31:46,929 --> 00:31:51,970
form like a perfect cube everybody's

00:31:49,809 --> 00:31:54,820
protected from the incoming arrows and

00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:56,799
everything what happens is you have one

00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:59,559
person and veges drop your shield and

00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,250
there's a perfect entry point for for

00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:02,289
things to go wrong

00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:03,970
so as you're building your team the

00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:06,460
whole point is to create one of those

00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:10,240
where it's almost hermetically sealed

00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:15,129
and the arrows of your enemies can make

00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:17,769
it through again mistakes can be made so

00:32:15,129 --> 00:32:21,429
it took me a long time to get to a point

00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:24,429
where I am better at building these

00:32:21,429 --> 00:32:28,289
teams at coaching these teams at telling

00:32:24,429 --> 00:32:32,019
pin mates that that they've grown too

00:32:28,289 --> 00:32:34,029
far too high and they need to move on to

00:32:32,019 --> 00:32:35,379
bigger and better pastures that's a

00:32:34,029 --> 00:32:38,049
really hard conversation to have because

00:32:35,379 --> 00:32:40,059
that opens up your your overlap hole

00:32:38,049 --> 00:32:42,220
again and you have to go find somebody

00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:47,019
else that will be a good match for that

00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:48,159
team so sometimes you you guys see

00:32:47,019 --> 00:32:54,009
what's wrong with this picture by the

00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:55,659
way yes okay good so a couple of

00:32:54,009 --> 00:32:57,399
mistakes that can be made what are the

00:32:55,659 --> 00:32:59,669
what are the common blind spots that you

00:32:57,399 --> 00:33:02,529
have so as you're building blended teams

00:32:59,669 --> 00:33:04,539
data-analysis until you know at some

00:33:02,529 --> 00:33:06,279
point we will have greater definitions

00:33:04,539 --> 00:33:08,529
of what it is that we do I think you

00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:12,970
know it's between eight and thirty years

00:33:08,529 --> 00:33:15,429
for some kind of coalescence on the on

00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:18,490
the nomenclature but in the interim I'll

00:33:15,429 --> 00:33:19,919
keep talking so a couple of common blind

00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:23,580
squads that we have software engineers

00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:25,870
software engineers often this is not a

00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:28,570
one-to-one I'm not saying everybody on

00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:31,750
column a to column B that's not it but

00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:33,850
software engineers can have often blind

00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:35,139
spots in terms of sampling they're like

00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:36,760
just give me the data and I which is

00:33:35,139 --> 00:33:38,620
engineering beautifully and I will plug

00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,700
in and I will do it Andy there's this

00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:42,669
assumption that the

00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:44,860
the data that they have received has

00:33:42,669 --> 00:33:46,659
been looked at clean detailed whatever

00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:49,149
and so if you have somebody who

00:33:46,659 --> 00:33:51,960
performed that kind of work and works

00:33:49,149 --> 00:33:54,970
together with that software engineer

00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:58,240
that blind spot goes away like that it's

00:33:54,970 --> 00:34:00,340
magical they suddenly feel in a very

00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,320
visceral way that this is my colleague

00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:04,000
and the thing that I don't understand

00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:07,389
that this person does is this thing that

00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:10,149
I take for granted deep learners they

00:34:07,389 --> 00:34:12,460
have a slight lack of rigorous

00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:14,169
statistics funnily enough I know that

00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:15,760
sounds insane totally true

00:34:14,169 --> 00:34:19,389
because deep learners are coming at it

00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:21,940
from a computer science Bend which which

00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:25,929
sometimes makes it so that they don't

00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:28,270
have rigorous analysis and I'm talking

00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:33,339
about like math analysis and topology

00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:35,889
and those kinds of concepts that they

00:34:33,339 --> 00:34:38,320
can use as they articulate what they're

00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:39,909
doing and so you have a lot of folks

00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,500
saying well these models are not

00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:43,510
understandable these models are not

00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:46,179
understandable and that's not true these

00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:47,919
models are not easily understandable I

00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:49,419
don't know that we have the technology

00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:51,369
to know how or the expertise to get

00:34:49,419 --> 00:34:53,290
there but give it 10 years these models

00:34:51,369 --> 00:34:56,139
are understandable we just need to we

00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:58,569
just need to learn how to chunk them in

00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:59,650
ways just like we've done everything

00:34:58,569 --> 00:35:01,030
else I mean the government is not

00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:03,700
understandable the government is ultra

00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:07,599
complex but you you separate different

00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:10,329
pieces and you federate and suddenly you

00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:12,670
I think we're going to have okay I think

00:35:10,329 --> 00:35:14,380
we're going to have AI sociologists I

00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:16,599
think we're going to have a discipline

00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:18,670
of people who go and investigate why is

00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:21,069
it that AI makes decisions the way it

00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:23,710
does same way that we have people who

00:35:21,069 --> 00:35:25,630
study humans and why it is that they

00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:27,660
make decisions the way they do when the

00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:30,310
rationale for their decisions is also

00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:32,349
below their level of awareness I think

00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:36,099
that's how I would like to think about

00:35:32,349 --> 00:35:38,140
AI is their computers they know why

00:35:36,099 --> 00:35:40,750
they're doing it it's just very complex

00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:42,329
and very probabilistic and it makes it

00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:45,970
difficult to understand

00:35:42,329 --> 00:35:49,020
that's a tangent sorry PhDs I don't have

00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:51,730
one so not that I'm biased for anything

00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:55,470
what they lack is ship it Mis

00:35:51,730 --> 00:36:01,990
now have a shifted bone in their body

00:35:55,470 --> 00:36:03,670
y'all are special because you you care

00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:07,540
for truth you can't you are doctors of

00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:09,400
the philosophy of your domain right I

00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:12,130
get it that's what I want from you

00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:16,329
but also I want you to realize that for

00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:18,310
the magic to take place humans at the

00:36:16,329 --> 00:36:21,099
end of the line have to purchase a

00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:24,250
physical or digital product that has

00:36:21,099 --> 00:36:28,720
been launched and marketed in price it

00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:30,750
has to leave the bench so if you have

00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:35,440
somebody who doesn't have that kind of

00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:36,970
background or expertise like me that's

00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,460
the kind of conversation that you can

00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:42,579
have and you can have that conversation

00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:45,369
with with intensity because I can feel

00:36:42,579 --> 00:36:48,130
that pain in a much more visceral way

00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:49,839
than than the person who's not feeling

00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:51,990
that pain and that's why it's important

00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:55,270
to have all of those different kinds of

00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:56,950
players in your team managers I'm going

00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:59,520
to jump it well flip statisticians

00:36:56,950 --> 00:37:01,900
because I'm one we suck at unit tests

00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,849
we're just like but it's intuitively

00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:06,790
obvious that by the setup of this

00:37:03,849 --> 00:37:10,000
equation it follows that what are you

00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:13,359
asking me about I'm asking because I

00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,960
don't have a PhD in statistics and I'm

00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:19,990
like no matter to where is my cetera but

00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:21,460
it's it's something that we really suck

00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:23,770
at until you work with a computer

00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:28,990
scientist who tells you the benefits and

00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:31,329
why and all of the nuances that go into

00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:33,160
it and how to set it up and here the six

00:37:31,329 --> 00:37:35,230
get commands but you need to learn don't

00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:37,450
worry about it just learn be six and you

00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:39,880
work together in a way that a true

00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:43,180
organic team works together versus two

00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:45,520
professors debating it with swords

00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:48,520
and then the last one managers hi I'm a

00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:50,349
manager right now I recovering data

00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:57,310
scientists for now manager which means

00:37:50,349 --> 00:37:59,470
I'm useless because my my drive is to

00:37:57,310 --> 00:38:03,230
keep the team running and to make money

00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:07,710
so that I can reward my team which is

00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:09,780
really close to pee hacking so I have to

00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:11,820
constantly worry that I am NOT asking my

00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:15,630
team to pee hack the data that they are

00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:17,580
so excited to show me and then I tell

00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:20,280
them no we need the answer needs to be

00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:22,170
this and then they're like no Angela the

00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:27,170
answer can't be whatever we want it to

00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:30,300
be the answer is so beware of managers

00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:30,720
even when we even when we try really

00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:33,030
hard

00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,830
we're also also susceptible to these

00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:38,880
blind spots that everybody on the team

00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:41,780
has and that's the point so what you're

00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:46,560
doing when you're hiring for for the

00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:49,500
topologists and I love analytical

00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:51,180
geometries in in the audience what

00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:54,000
you're doing is you're doing a multiple

00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:54,839
a multiple objective decision analysis

00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,420
problem where you have a

00:38:54,839 --> 00:38:58,859
multi-dimensional set of things that you

00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:00,540
want to optimize and you want to find

00:38:58,859 --> 00:39:02,760
not everybody who has the best

00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:05,580
perspectives on everything the most

00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:07,740
senior who has exposure to the most

00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:09,720
number of disciplines who speaks the

00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:16,530
most number of languages but you want to

00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:19,920
find that that distribution that has the

00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:23,400
compound value that outweighs the rest

00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:25,290
it's a very complicated computing

00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:28,020
process I wouldn't advocate actually

00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:30,210
doing it but once you have a team that

00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:31,800
you've inherited that is there anywhere

00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:34,980
you've assessed them and you want them

00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:37,050
to stay as you're going to augment that

00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:38,760
team I would say that you should use a

00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:44,690
framework like this to make sure that

00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:48,810
you're not creating aggregations of

00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:50,010
skills at the expense of skills that

00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:53,700
you're not going to have represented in

00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:57,150
your team so how do you interview for

00:39:53,700 --> 00:40:02,250
these things these are my favorite

00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:05,190
questions essentially I want to know how

00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:06,570
self-aware are you that's the key that I

00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:08,820
want to get at because if you're not

00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:10,260
self-aware to tell me what you're good

00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:12,810
at and what you're not good at and I

00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:16,650
can't fit you in the slots that are good

00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:18,450
not good and then I can't hire you so I

00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:21,240
want to know about your past project and

00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:23,340
I want to know what did you learn and I

00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:25,290
want to know can you tell me about it so

00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:26,670
I'm testing their communication I'm

00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:28,440
testing their understanding of the

00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:30,870
modeling I'm testing their understanding

00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:32,280
of the whole process that things have to

00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:35,490
go through but I'm also trying to

00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:38,220
understand where they're not excellent

00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:39,990
at not because I'm going to then not

00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:42,830
hire them but because I'm going to have

00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:45,870
a much better understanding of what

00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:55,650
price I'm paying for that balance that I

00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:58,430
seek what does that make sense so then

00:40:55,650 --> 00:41:01,800
the last piece after you've built these

00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:06,750
this team that is well balanced and

00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:11,130
works well together great now what the

00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:14,430
end drinks no I wouldn't do that I would

00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:19,890
do that too Karthik so I'm going to go

00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:21,270
back to jail arts class cos slide which

00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:24,210
i think is really phenomenal because

00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:27,900
this is the next step this is what we

00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:31,020
need to do this is the hell so you need

00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:35,640
to apply all of the skills that we know

00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:38,790
on to the the processes that we need to

00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:40,260
walk through so as you're dealing with

00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:43,230
data collection you need to worry about

00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:46,340
that data collection and the biases that

00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:49,080
can be introduced as you're dealing with

00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:50,010
cleansing data and transforming data you

00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:52,470
need to worry about your data

00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:54,150
engineering and do you have any control

00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:57,330
over what's happening there how many

00:41:54,150 --> 00:42:01,110
black black boxes are doing your ETL for

00:41:57,330 --> 00:42:03,150
you in terms of modeling and validating

00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:05,270
there's a lot of ethical concerns that

00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:08,210
go into that that perhaps having

00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:12,450
ethicists or sociologists or

00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:15,510
ethnographers pipe in and give insight

00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:18,030
as to where things are may be varying a

00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:21,810
bit off from from where you would want

00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:23,880
to in terms of communication you have to

00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:24,680
worry about security security of your

00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,390
data security

00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:29,140
your message security of your customers

00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:31,250
data and because this is the business

00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:34,849
side of the world you have to worry

00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:37,809
about when you deploy what the ROI is in

00:42:34,849 --> 00:42:41,240
ROI is return on investment I'm sorry

00:42:37,809 --> 00:42:43,270
jargon but it's important because this

00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:47,240
is what fuels the ability to keep having

00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:49,700
more and more fun things to work on so

00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:51,859
your data teams responsibilities are and

00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:53,390
this is set in stone and this I printed

00:42:51,859 --> 00:42:55,849
out and I give to everybody who joins my

00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:57,770
team we care about it we're data science

00:42:55,849 --> 00:42:59,450
team and you know the Unicorn and

00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:02,150
everybody's special and it takes a

00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:03,589
couple of I was going to say days but

00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:05,869
it's weeks to get everybody off your

00:43:03,589 --> 00:43:09,589
high horse it does there's nothing to it

00:43:05,869 --> 00:43:11,180
and then you get them to understand that

00:43:09,589 --> 00:43:13,160
they need to focus on data quality data

00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:15,319
collection data engineering security

00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:17,660
ethics communication and the return on

00:43:15,319 --> 00:43:20,800
the investment from their shareholders

00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:25,700
their benefactors whoever they may be

00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:28,130
and so why why do you have to care about

00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:30,530
those things why are those cares

00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:32,950
incumbent upon a data team why aren't

00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:36,530
those cares incumbent upon the

00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:37,819
investment management team or the PR

00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:39,859
team well

00:43:37,819 --> 00:43:46,180
usually because nobody has cared about

00:43:39,859 --> 00:43:49,849
it this way until now and I want to give

00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:53,119
my perspective on it which is it's not

00:43:49,849 --> 00:43:55,339
that they are nefarious it's not that

00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:57,890
they haven't cared about this because

00:43:55,339 --> 00:44:02,440
they're evil and they want the world to

00:43:57,890 --> 00:44:04,940
burn it's just that they're not aware

00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:06,230
it's not what they do it's not what

00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:08,150
they've been trained to do it's not what

00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:11,900
they've been trained to worry about you

00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:14,240
have many folks who are and and those

00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:18,109
are great to have in your team as well

00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:20,930
but if you only seek folks who have that

00:44:18,109 --> 00:44:23,510
skill set already developed then you

00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:25,970
lose this amazing opportunity to say to

00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:29,589
take somebody on who doesn't understand

00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:32,089
that yet and figure out what is it that

00:44:29,589 --> 00:44:33,589
the team needs to worry about and

00:44:32,089 --> 00:44:35,210
they'll bring fresh perspectives and

00:44:33,589 --> 00:44:36,950
they will challenge the status quo

00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:38,210
processes and they will say that this

00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:40,460
still this

00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:42,109
process that we instituted in the Dark

00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:44,810
Ages of 2014

00:44:42,109 --> 00:44:49,700
does that still apply to our data

00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:52,609
pipelines in 2017 so it's not the no one

00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:54,770
cares is that folks are unprepared to

00:44:52,609 --> 00:44:58,160
care everybody wants to be a Care Bear

00:44:54,770 --> 00:45:05,300
they don't know how and I have you guys

00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:06,740
seen the Care Bears yeah come on so the

00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:08,780
problem with the Care Bears there was

00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:10,790
one episode where they all went and they

00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:12,349
did their big thing that comes out of

00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:14,510
their belly and they ruined everything

00:45:12,349 --> 00:45:16,460
because it wasn't the right thing to do

00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:19,280
when they destroyed this nice little

00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:22,010
pond with their magical energy and in

00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:24,740
the pond we came over magically ponded

00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:25,849
and you know it was terrible

00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:28,010
and that's just because they didn't have

00:45:25,849 --> 00:45:29,599
enough information they didn't know what

00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:31,280
it is they needed to do when they came

00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:33,320
in and they said how hard could it be

00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:37,250
we're just going to fix everything and

00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:41,839
how hard can it be are the decimal words

00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:43,310
on anything because it's hard so when

00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:44,780
should you start caring now that you

00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:46,790
know that you have to start caring and

00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:50,390
it's on you and it's not on anybody

00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:52,849
else's yes unless you work in a company

00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:55,130
large enough where they've already had

00:45:52,849 --> 00:45:57,440
data leaks and then they went out and

00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:58,849
hire people to worry about it but

00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,609
companies they haven't gone through it

00:45:58,849 --> 00:46:04,910
yet it's incumbent upon you to care and

00:46:01,609 --> 00:46:07,250
it's incumbent upon you to care now I'm

00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:12,050
not going to do Arnold because I'm no

00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:14,420
good but you can feel them right because

00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:17,690
when you come in what you expect as a

00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:20,390
new member you want to have this magical

00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:22,430
data Lake that is shaped just so for all

00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:23,660
of your needs and all of the format's

00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:25,250
are going to be standardized you're

00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:27,349
going to have continuous integration and

00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:29,810
already available permissions and access

00:46:27,349 --> 00:46:31,400
controls are in place so people who

00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:34,630
should be seeing information are not

00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:37,670
seeing information and everything is is

00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:41,960
sometimes even air-gapped so that you

00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:43,730
don't have exchange of data that that

00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:47,150
shouldn't be there you had your IOT

00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:50,580
ingestion taken care of because half of

00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:53,100
your IOT information is coming from the

00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:56,190
North Northern Virginia pipes some of

00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:57,840
your IOT data is coming from Tokyo and

00:46:56,190 --> 00:47:00,180
you have to munge all of that together

00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:01,950
and normalize it and everything is

00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:03,990
already done there's a process there's a

00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:07,140
script to press a button everything is

00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:08,970
magical performance is measured and you

00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:10,560
have a dedicated teammate who's worried

00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:12,240
about performance so they know when

00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:14,400
there's a dip

00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:16,530
there's automated data quality control

00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,960
and automated anomaly detection

00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:20,880
algorithm you have API is exposed to the

00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,530
rest of the business if you're advanced

00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,630
enough you have API is exposed to the

00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:26,010
rest of the world as open API switch

00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:28,440
then you've already gone through the

00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:30,330
whole process of d AG recov aggregating

00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:40,740
and Deana McGee anonymizing it's

00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:43,860
beautiful right yeah because this is

00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:48,210
what actually exists it's this sewage

00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:50,070
pipe full of plumbing and you have like

00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:51,870
this little lake over here that's a

00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:54,330
little dark blue you don't know if it's

00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:56,370
got a little bit of cobalt you have this

00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:58,680
other little blob over here looks a

00:47:56,370 --> 00:48:00,930
little green might have too much iron in

00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:02,280
there and then how safe is it you're

00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:05,430
going to have to go in there with your

00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:07,350
your scuba gear and investigates the

00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:08,640
lunk a little bit is this healthy that

00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:10,680
I'm going to have to clean it before I

00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:12,690
can make any use of it is it worth the

00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:16,230
effort of cleaning it all that yellow

00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:17,550
one I don't know if that sulfur I don't

00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:19,440
want to go so I don't have those sulfur

00:48:17,550 --> 00:48:23,010
swimming gear I mean you get the point

00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:27,270
it's what you end up inheriting has been

00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:29,220
built for other purposes unless unless

00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:32,400
you've your company started out as a

00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:35,490
data company and that's very lucky for

00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:37,770
my girl for instance the last three

00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:40,440
companies that I joined I joined to

00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:41,550
start a data science program they didn't

00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:44,400
have one they had all of these other

00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:45,780
things and I think this picture even

00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,660
though I'm being facetious and I'm

00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:51,630
saying like have job security but know

00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:55,100
what I think but I think this says is

00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:57,270
that this is a good company to join

00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:59,520
giving you tips if you ever want to

00:48:57,270 --> 00:49:03,110
leave the indie world make some money

00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:03,110
then come back which is my plan

00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:08,260
what happens is they build their their

00:49:06,370 --> 00:49:12,340
infrastructure their data lakes their

00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:15,610
processes for the job that they were

00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:17,770
asked to do and until somebody came in

00:49:15,610 --> 00:49:19,690
with the mandate of looking at data and

00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:24,930
worrying about data and treating data as

00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:24,930
an asset and a liability potentially

00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:30,040
things already looked like this and part

00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:34,000
of having that data science discipline

00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:35,680
become something that is not an

00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,270
afterthought it's really part of the

00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:40,210
strategy of the leadership of the

00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:41,820
company means recognizing that those

00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:45,850
guys didn't know we're engineer anything

00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:48,640
right like this to me means the teams

00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:50,470
that came before the rounds of applause

00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,970
because they didn't over engineer they

00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:53,650
didn't build more than they were asked

00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:55,060
to bill they built for the

00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:56,880
specifications of what they have been

00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:59,890
asked and now part of that is

00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:02,350
transforming what's what's extant the

00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:07,060
legacy work into something that you can

00:50:02,350 --> 00:50:12,070
now automate in and transform into the

00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:15,700
pre Willy Wonka Chocolate Factory

00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:17,860
work now if you've done this a few times

00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:20,680
or if you've worked in companies that

00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:22,330
have forced you to feel this pain you

00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:23,980
will realize that the heart can get

00:50:22,330 --> 00:50:25,900
really cold when all you've known is

00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:29,890
winter and I'm here to tell you that

00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:36,070
there is something after winter it's

00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:39,790
really easy it's really easy to care all

00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:41,440
you have to do is leave breadcrumbs so

00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:44,790
imagine this scene in accounting I'm

00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:48,070
going to I'm going to play you a picture

00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:50,770
new person comes into a company and they

00:50:48,070 --> 00:50:52,930
go into HR and HR goes out yes you're in

00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:54,790
accounting go talk to accounting but

00:50:52,930 --> 00:50:56,620
they don't say we're accounting is so

00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:58,030
new person is walking on the hallway

00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:59,200
trying to find accounting and they're

00:50:58,030 --> 00:51:01,390
like you know we're accounting is oh

00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,980
yeah it's right there and then you get

00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:05,410
into accounting and you go what should I

00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:07,060
do and they're like oh yeah here's your

00:51:05,410 --> 00:51:09,990
own boarding because we've been doing

00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:12,630
this for 300 years

00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:15,510
we know Ledger's in

00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:17,640
credit and debit and lines of things and

00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:19,350
assets and liabilities these are well

00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:21,630
understood processes I'm not

00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:26,700
trivializing them they're not easy but

00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:30,080
they are known in data science what ends

00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:32,790
up happening is somebody goes why did we

00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:34,620
the analog would have been that somebody

00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:37,050
goes to an accountant of the company and

00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:40,650
says why do we divest that thirty

00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:43,530
million dollar assets and the answer is

00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:45,480
oh well YUM I think Janet might know

00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:48,540
something about that there was a git

00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:50,460
push somewhere like no the government

00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:53,010
would not allow that to happen

00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:54,720
you need to have forms upon forms upon

00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:56,220
forms filed with the SSC of the

00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:58,830
rationale and why it is that you're

00:51:56,220 --> 00:52:01,650
going to do these things so we don't

00:51:58,830 --> 00:52:04,050
have those kinds of processes in data

00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:05,820
science yet I think if we keep pushing

00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:07,740
the envelope and having blackbox

00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:09,720
algorithms that judge whether or not

00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:11,780
somebody should be sentenced to life in

00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:14,550
prison or five minutes in the yard

00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:17,520
that's that future is going to approach

00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:20,580
rapidly but the way to do right now

00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:23,250
before there is a consensus as to what

00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:25,710
data science is as a discipline from an

00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:27,720
academic standpoint documentation is how

00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:29,790
you program a business you leave those

00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:32,820
bread crumbs documentation is to

00:52:29,790 --> 00:52:35,610
businesses code is to product it's if I

00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:38,070
have to go and ask a human being why a

00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:39,600
business decision was made somebody

00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:41,280
already dropped the ball because that

00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:42,120
decision should have been recorded

00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,750
somewhere and there should be a

00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:47,940
rationale for what the decision was

00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:49,800
intended to do so that it can be tracked

00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:51,930
and it can be verified and we can learn

00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:53,850
from it because not every decision is

00:52:51,930 --> 00:52:55,770
going to be perfect and the hubris that

00:52:53,850 --> 00:52:58,290
only the perfect decisions yet

00:52:55,770 --> 00:53:00,570
documented is a little bit silly because

00:52:58,290 --> 00:53:02,580
if we don't know the rate at which we

00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:04,320
make bad investments we can't improve of

00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:10,080
those on those we can't understand

00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:11,700
better how those get made and so what is

00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:13,440
it that you should document when I say

00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:16,380
leave breadcrumbs what breadcrumbs

00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:18,630
well motivations for projects not just

00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:20,340
results from projects but what sets you

00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:23,250
down this path because if the project

00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:24,680
blows up the idea didn't blow up and you

00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:26,770
can turn left and

00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:29,480
try again and maybe find a better result

00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:33,790
the reason for you to believe your

00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:37,520
hypotheses either previous papers

00:53:33,790 --> 00:53:39,829
preprints blog posts tweets whatever it

00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:43,550
was that sparked the reason for you to

00:53:39,829 --> 00:53:46,010
pursue something dead-end documents the

00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:47,599
stuff that blew up document stuff so

00:53:46,010 --> 00:53:51,950
that when you win the lottery and you

00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:54,130
leave anyone you don't age your group

00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:58,520
with you and they're all left behind

00:53:54,130 --> 00:54:00,559
allow them to be able to to follow on

00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:02,599
your steps and figure out we shouldn't

00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:04,760
spend the same three months that Bob

00:54:02,599 --> 00:54:07,790
spent on this because Bob told us that

00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:11,510
it didn't work I wouldn't I wouldn't

00:54:07,790 --> 00:54:13,460
prioritize those types of projects as

00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:15,800
the kinds of things that you show your

00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:17,540
upline your management upline but have

00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:19,460
it for yourself

00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:21,650
pause project for the same thing and

00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:23,650
conjectures for things that you should

00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:27,020
do next

00:54:23,650 --> 00:54:29,660
rules of engagement taxonomies things

00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:31,160
that will help the group so this is more

00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:34,670
about documenting things that help the

00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:36,140
group not that help HR or or the

00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:41,270
leadership team or anything like that

00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:44,119
and so what will you want to know about

00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:45,790
the data that you're documenting you

00:54:44,119 --> 00:54:47,780
want to know in what format it is

00:54:45,790 --> 00:54:49,130
including any transformations any

00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:51,500
assumptions you want to know how fast

00:54:49,130 --> 00:54:52,940
it's moving at what volume it what

00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:54,140
compression you want to know from whom

00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:56,150
is coming what's the chain of custody

00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:58,609
around that data you want to know if

00:54:56,150 --> 00:55:01,010
it's trustworthy if you have the chain

00:54:58,609 --> 00:55:04,130
of custody or not you want to have some

00:55:01,010 --> 00:55:05,809
hypothesis on the pre yet processing a

00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:06,829
pre and post processing that this data

00:55:05,809 --> 00:55:08,390
has gone through

00:55:06,829 --> 00:55:10,099
anyone know where it's from you want to

00:55:08,390 --> 00:55:12,770
know information about the performance

00:55:10,099 --> 00:55:14,329
of scale any access controls that are in

00:55:12,770 --> 00:55:18,589
place in the speed for which it moves

00:55:14,329 --> 00:55:21,920
through your infrastructure and that's

00:55:18,589 --> 00:55:25,030
the data side the business side so what

00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:30,319
does the business really do did you know

00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:32,510
I'm not joking McDonald's not a food

00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:37,020
company

00:55:32,510 --> 00:55:39,150
McDonald's is a real-estate company look

00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:40,680
it up I'm not kidding

00:55:39,150 --> 00:55:42,600
how does it make money how does it

00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:44,640
create value for their customers who are

00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:46,770
the customers who's buying who's paying

00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:48,900
who are the competitors who's regulating

00:55:46,770 --> 00:55:51,630
what assumptions are based in and

00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:54,060
importantly do you have enough data to

00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:57,170
validate your answers to these questions

00:55:54,060 --> 00:56:00,800
or are you just parroting the party line

00:55:57,170 --> 00:56:02,700
it's very easy to during the onboarding

00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:05,970
brainwashing that takes place you just

00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:09,270
take things as gospel I say from the

00:56:05,970 --> 00:56:11,940
pulpit and you should challenge that

00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:13,320
don't don't strike me but you should

00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:19,260
challenge things that are said from the

00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:22,020
podium and so this is something that's

00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:23,520
near and dear to me I think I talked

00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:25,380
about it a little bit already in that

00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:27,870
you want to optimize across all the

00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:29,820
multiple dimensions of skill but I think

00:56:27,870 --> 00:56:32,790
having junior team members is a great

00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:35,250
forcing function so junior team members

00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:38,520
most times don't know where in the

00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:40,650
multiple different skills dimensions

00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:45,120
they fit so even if they fit in many

00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:47,340
many many dimensions closer to to the

00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:49,770
genesis point they're a forcing function

00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:53,390
for your more senior developers in your

00:56:49,770 --> 00:56:55,890
data engineers senior product managers

00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:58,980
because they they are not jaded and they

00:56:55,890 --> 00:57:02,210
can ask questions that all of senior

00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:04,950
senior people have forgotten to ask and

00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:08,040
that brings us full circle this is how

00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:10,890
you build teams that work to solve a

00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:13,110
problem whether that problem is a Civic

00:57:10,890 --> 00:57:17,040
problem an indie problem or a corporate

00:57:13,110 --> 00:57:20,070
problem and with that I wanted to thank

00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:22,440
you all very much for spending a couple

00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:25,220
of minutes listening to me and I hope I

00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:25,220
hope it was useful

00:57:25,809 --> 00:57:27,869
you

00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:33,050
