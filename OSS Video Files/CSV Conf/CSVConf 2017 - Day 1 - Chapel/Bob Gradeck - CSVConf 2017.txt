00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:10,440
so it's my great pleasure to introduce

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,940
Bob Braddock he's with the regional data

00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,530
center at the University of Pittsburgh

00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:21,420
and he's going to talk about specific

00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:23,039
data ecosystems Thanks so I'm going to

00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,570
kind of fly through this I'll tweet out

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,400
the link to my slides and everybody can

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,680
hear me okay

00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,150
great so I'm at the regional data center

00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,619
and I'll tell you about what what I'm

00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,910
all about in a second but the way that

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:35,010
open data looks like in a lot of other

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,380
cities is the mayor will come write a

00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,690
big check to a vendor who sets up a data

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,910
repository they have a big press

00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:44,250
conference and then the mayor checks off

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,890
the open data checkbox in all is right

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,149
with the world but in in Pittsburgh and

00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,160
western Pennsylvania we built an

00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:51,629
inclusive open data infrastructure and

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,280
so what that means is we have a two page

00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:55,890
legal agreement we can add any number of

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,629
organizations to publish on our open

00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,399
data portal and they don't have to

00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:02,609
really pay another vendor they can just

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,719
work through us so we managed the open

00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:05,159
data portal for the city of Pittsburgh

00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:06,720
Allegheny County and all those other

00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,970
organizations that you saw there and a

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,860
big role that we play is also helping to

00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,540
improve data quality and manage the ETL

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,479
process so we have some datasets that

00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,950
update hourly daily and even monthly and

00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:19,049
so there's a list there if you want to

00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:22,409
go back and read those on the slide

00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:24,409
you're more than welcome to do that but

00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:26,790
the role that we always also playing in

00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:28,380
managing everything is providing the

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,540
role of being a data intermediary in the

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,060
community and I'm going to take a very

00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,840
broad view of data intermediaries here

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:38,159
today and I'm going to define them as

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,020
organizations that really help people

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,110
apply data to achieve impact in whatever

00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:45,299
it is that they do so three roles that

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,530
our community practice the national

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:48,990
neighborhood indicators partnership

00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:52,399
identifies four data intermediaries is

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:54,210
to assemble transform and maintain data

00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,369
second is to disseminate information

00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:58,590
applied the data to achieve impact and

00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:00,689
the third is to use data to strengthen

00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,070
civic capacity and governance and so

00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:03,570
what I'm going to do now is actually fly

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,549
through a lot of examples from within

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,130
this network

00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:08,569
nn IP that are going to illustrate a lot

00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:10,220
of the roles that data intermediaries

00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:11,420
play around the country and a lot of

00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:17,510
this is going to be us but a lot of its

00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:19,220
not so really intermediaries are really

00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:21,379
important to overcome obstacles the data

00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:24,319
use and this is just me putting a list

00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:25,519
of things together but you could see you

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,470
know things that get in the way of

00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:30,500
people using data you know include the

00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:32,480
data the skills don't aren't out there

00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:35,599
for the data users to make use of raw

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,489
data for example both the producers and

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,130
the data users lack context so how is

00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:41,660
the data created what are the what does

00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:45,380
the community need all those things are

00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:47,470
missing in a lot of cases producers

00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:50,750
don't aren't trusted by data users

00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:52,790
vice-versa data qualities and issues we

00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:55,220
heard a lot today accessibility is an

00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:56,750
issue awareness does this data exist as

00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,489
an issue and then even things like

00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,560
exclusionary messaging when we talk

00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:02,599
about data being for the tech community

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,730
and hackers and everybody who can hack

00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:06,140
on data we're excluding a lot of people

00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,849
that don't have those skills so these

00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:12,040
are all some obstacles that we've seen

00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:14,660
in our work that really inhibit data use

00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,650
so just to take that framework that ni P

00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:17,329
put out there

00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:20,239
the first is assemble transform and

00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:21,920
maintain data so one role is to curate

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:26,359
data so our partners in New York City

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:28,579
and DC both curate data on affordable

00:03:26,359 --> 00:03:30,139
housing from a number of federal state

00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:32,269
and local data sources and they built

00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:34,849
nice platforms and tools that enable

00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:36,620
people to go and look up you know when

00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:39,980
the subsidies might expire on a property

00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:42,380
in their neighborhood intermediaries

00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:45,470
also can help broker data requests so we

00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:47,389
have on our site a data request feature

00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:50,840
but communities get together and

00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:52,220
actually do processes like the open data

00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,919
vote in Philadelphia is one for example

00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:56,180
that is really neat where they really go

00:03:54,919 --> 00:04:00,459
out and try to get the community to

00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:02,750
participate in making data requests

00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:04,370
intermediaries also improve data quality

00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:06,560
and this is actually a map of tax liens

00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:08,900
in one neighborhood in Pittsburgh this

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,090
is the data set that our team has helped

00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:13,780
to assemble and put together two and a

00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:15,910
half million records of tax lien data

00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:18,290
transaction-by-transaction over 20 years

00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:19,880
we throw that at the ADA users and there

00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:21,170
like probably isn't even one that can

00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,330
make use of this in any kind of

00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:25,010
substantial way so this data can't be

00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:27,170
used for land banking this can't be used

00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:28,700
to understand you know how to intervene

00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:30,830
at a neighborhood or even a property

00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,720
scale unless somebody comes in and

00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:34,790
improves the quality of it makes it

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,580
useful for for users so we did that with

00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:39,440
Scripps and a lot of going back and

00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,970
forth to the data publisher at court

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,980
records to really understand what they

00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:45,500
do with this data so we wound up with a

00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:47,780
whole summary of how many liens are on

00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:50,120
every property in the amount delinquent

00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,710
and every month we get an update so the

00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,240
liens that are satisfied come out of our

00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:55,310
database and the liens that are new get

00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,630
added to the database and that's all out

00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:00,080
there so people can use this data in

00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:02,000
their work archiving data is a big role

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,340
for intermediaries and in our community

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,110
our university librarians actually came

00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,730
together from a couple of different

00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:11,180
institutions and held a data rescue

00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:12,830
event at our public library it was a big

00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:15,170
success we had about 50 people show up

00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:16,820
get involved and we were even involved

00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:18,590
in helping to provide food for the event

00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:21,260
out of one of our budgets so we kind of

00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:22,610
have this ecosystem view of being a data

00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:25,880
intermediary and this is just one

00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:28,790
example that illustrates that we also

00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,890
have the ability to work with our

00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:33,380
university librarians who are fantastic

00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:35,990
some of you may recognize Aaron Brenner

00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:37,910
in the center of the top picture this is

00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:39,410
our digital scholarship team and they

00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:41,360
actually partnered with us because the

00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:45,050
city had questions about how do we

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,820
release 3-1-1 data so it doesn't harm

00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,900
anybody so you know who cares where a

00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,760
pothole is you should share that

00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:51,920
coordinate but they needed to make the

00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,330
case that we're going to treat the data

00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,250
where somebody's complaining about their

00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:57,050
neighbor's dog a little bit differently

00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:59,420
from that pothole complaint and so

00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:01,580
getting the data management experts at

00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:03,950
our University library involves allowed

00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,630
the city to actually roll out their

00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:08,030
bird's-eye view tool which has data on

00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:09,890
crime 3-1-1 complaints and a number of

00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:11,300
other things and now they want out to do

00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:13,370
meetings with the community and show

00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:16,940
them how to use the tool and all of that

00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:18,230
really happened

00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,580
through a lot of the work from our

00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:22,310
partners both at the city and the

00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:23,690
university library so kind of building

00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:25,310
these connections is an important piece

00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:28,100
of being an intermediary I'll talk about

00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:29,990
more in a second intermediaries are also

00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,320
involved in primary data collection so

00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,330
you may have heard of the motor

00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,880
city mapping initiative a few years ago

00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:37,560
in Detroit our partners at data-driven

00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:40,800
Detroit were involved in helping to

00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:43,260
collect visual observation data on every

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,090
parcel in Detroit which was no small

00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:47,310
undertaking but you know they're kind of

00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:49,590
in the weeds and working to really get

00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:51,470
data that can be used in those important

00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:54,360
decisions that affect that community

00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:56,700
another sort of category from the NNI

00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,310
keyframing is to disseminate and fly

00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,540
data so our partners in Baltimore at the

00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:02,640
Baltimore neighborhood indicators

00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:05,880
Alliance at the University of Baltimore

00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:07,350
put data out through their vital science

00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,540
project where they take a lot of census

00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:12,260
and other data aggregate it and then

00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:15,240
publish it at a neighborhood scale and

00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:17,790
having all that stuff in place up front

00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:20,190
when the whole Freddie gray def and the

00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:22,170
media storm around that hit they were

00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,310
able to provide information to reporters

00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:26,370
from all over the country in the world

00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:27,720
about the kind of conditions that were

00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:29,220
in place in that community so the

00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,230
reporters had a little bit more local

00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,490
context to understand kind of things

00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:36,900
that were affecting his life in his

00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:38,520
neighborhood technical assistance is

00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:41,460
probably one of the things that we do

00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:45,090
most of as an intermediary across our

00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:46,560
whole and an IP network some have forms

00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,910
on their website others will just pick

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,770
up the call and answer emails I think

00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:53,580
lately we've been getting four to five

00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:55,170
requests from people every day asking

00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:58,430
for help with data so that's an

00:07:55,170 --> 00:08:00,330
important role that intermediaries play

00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,160
intermediaries also help build data

00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:04,080
tools and you know we've built some

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,460
where we link together a lot of

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,690
different property data feeds that we

00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:09,060
get from the city in the county for

00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:10,410
example and published it on a property

00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,120
data dashboard and Steve here in the

00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:13,920
front row is depicted here in the front

00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:18,120
at our community meeting where we roll

00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:20,030
the tool out that's an actual photo data

00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,350
enumerator your inner data

00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:24,510
intermediaries also build data into

00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:25,890
community processes so our partners in

00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:27,570
Cleveland have developed this

00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:29,250
Neighborhood Stabilization team model

00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:30,840
where they pull together community

00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:33,300
organizers community development

00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:35,430
organizations code enforcement officers

00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:37,830
at the city housing counselors police

00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:39,090
and they bring the data to the table and

00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:40,290
they roll it out and they say here

00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,760
what's happening with this property

00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:42,180
what's changed on this block in the last

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,950
three or

00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:45,720
or months and everybody gets together

00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:48,089
and talks about what's happening and

00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,800
they divide some property pride property

00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:52,350
targeted intervention strategies based

00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,880
on the data that they see and the

00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:56,970
community analysis is on the report

00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,529
important part of disseminating data for

00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:01,800
example our partners in New Haven do a

00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:03,330
giant statewide community survey where

00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,180
they ask about community well-being and

00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:08,820
quality of life and put out reports with

00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:10,350
a lot of really valuable information and

00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,870
the third main category is to strengthen

00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:14,850
civic capacity and governments within

00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:16,380
the ecosystem and so one of the things

00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:19,050
that we and many of our partners serve

00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:20,640
in that role is as a community organizer

00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:22,860
and that is Burt Reynolds on the screen

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,899
it was actually a shot taken at our last

00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,720
data user group meeting so we use these

00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:28,680
data group user group meetings that we

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,240
we pull together people that have a

00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,339
shared interest in a particular topic

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,570
and just you know ask them what they're

00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,730
looking for learn a little bit more

00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:37,290
about what they're doing and provide

00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,760
feedback on the kind of tools that we're

00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:40,680
developing so Steve was at that meeting

00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,910
showing this tool and getting feedback

00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,770
from a lot of the people in our

00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:45,510
community and so out of this kind of

00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:47,880
meeting we put together a road map of

00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:49,529
what kind of data these organizations

00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,180
want to see and then we'll go out and

00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:52,650
work on it or we'll work on tools or

00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,880
work on a lot of other things that are

00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:58,830
going to meet their needs is the data

00:09:53,880 --> 00:10:01,020
user another way of getting feedback is

00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:03,060
really by setting up events like city

00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:05,490
camp in Oakland through open Oakland and

00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,630
a lot of other folks out there they've

00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:08,430
been doing this for a number of years

00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:09,839
every year they have an event at City

00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:11,700
Hall where they bring together people

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,020
from the community and people from

00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,730
government and get them all together and

00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,980
start to talk about their jobs and kind

00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:18,300
of like job shadowing where you know

00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,000
that feedback can happen in that

00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:24,450
one-on-one personal interaction like

00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,430
what a city camp can do data

00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:27,900
intermediaries can also provide context

00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:30,540
for data users an important thing that's

00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,890
really missing is kind of that

00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:34,260
information that's in your heads about a

00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:35,820
data set if you're an expert you know so

00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,260
what we try to do with a lot of the

00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,440
guides that we've written we think we've

00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:41,520
covered about thirty data sets now

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,950
taking that tastic knowledge that's in

00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,870
people's heads codifying it on paper or

00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:48,329
on the computer so that everybody can

00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:50,820
understand okay what does go into the

00:10:48,329 --> 00:10:53,220
arrest data how does the whole process

00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,329
work all those kind of things are

00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,360
important if you're going to use data

00:10:54,329 --> 00:10:57,339
and use it effect

00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,930
and use it accurately and so what we've

00:10:57,339 --> 00:11:01,800
really tried to do is provide context

00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:03,880
through things like these data guides

00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,589
training is another role that data

00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,690
intermediaries play and this is again a

00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:09,220
picture of our data one-on-one trainings

00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:10,510
that we partner with the Carnegie

00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:13,060
Library of Pittsburgh our community

00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:14,649
library where from our data user group

00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,360
meetings we heard from our users that

00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:17,980
they just weren't even ready for

00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,230
computers they knew data was important

00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:22,050
but they were intimidated and didn't

00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:24,430
quite know where to start so we took

00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:26,740
exercise from the MIT Media Lab and

00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:28,680
built on that to offer data one-on-one

00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:30,880
training series which is all paper-based

00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,360
because we realized pretty quickly and

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,920
just doing a few test experiments that

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:39,970
paper offers no barriers to entry for

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:41,500
anybody for the most part and people

00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:43,120
communicate when you lay out paper on

00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,459
the table in a way different than when

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,290
everybody's staring at a laptop so we're

00:11:45,459 --> 00:11:49,360
going to roll out like a paper based GIS

00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:51,040
class this summer a paper-based data

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,990
visualization class and this is all done

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,660
in partnership with our library who will

00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:59,730
take this and kind of own and maintain

00:11:55,660 --> 00:12:01,600
this this some set of training sessions

00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:03,130
intermediaries can also connect

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,220
organizations and this is a meeting of

00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:07,480
last month's civic data roundtable that

00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:09,670
we put together where we pulled together

00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,279
all of the actors that we knew in our

00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:16,240
civic data ecosystem so the city the

00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:17,800
county us our university librarians our

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,660
student organizations that work with

00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,130
data related projects our carnegie

00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:22,480
library of pittsburgh we all come

00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:24,399
together every month we talk about

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,560
challenges that we each face we talk

00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,209
about ideas for events and we're even

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,890
doing exercises now to map out the

00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:32,170
ecosystem so we could see where we can

00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:35,019
act to strengthen the capacity within

00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:37,120
each of the organizations it's important

00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:39,100
to also celebrate your data users a lot

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,390
of organizations that we work with have

00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,160
day-to-days which is just like a

00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,990
celebration of data where users come and

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,279
show their work and talk about what

00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:47,769
they've been doing and this is a picture

00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:50,560
from ours last October we even had

00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:52,540
Andrew Carnegie the library mascot show

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,800
up which is really special he doesn't

00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,800
show up at all these events to either

00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:59,920
advocacy something that data

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,810
intermediaries do so in the intermediary

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:05,740
role Code for America brigades for

00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:07,149
example have been active in being an

00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,259
advocate for open data and open data

00:13:07,149 --> 00:13:10,359
policies and really

00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:13,660
urging their local governments to adopt

00:13:10,359 --> 00:13:15,009
them so this is another role that these

00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,569
intermediaries can play but even if

00:13:15,009 --> 00:13:18,100
you're not an intermediary or you're a

00:13:16,569 --> 00:13:19,720
data user you can even just tell your

00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:22,470
story about a data set that goes a long

00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:24,729
way when somebody's making the case for

00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:25,989
releasing additional data or proving

00:13:24,729 --> 00:13:27,970
data quality if you tell your stories

00:13:25,989 --> 00:13:30,069
about how people are using data your

00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:32,489
intermediaries and everybody else all

00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:35,049
the other data users will thank you and

00:13:32,489 --> 00:13:37,359
then one of the final roles that we've

00:13:35,049 --> 00:13:39,660
identified is storytelling and this is

00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:42,069
an example from Portland Paul's here in

00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:44,589
here in this city our partners in an ni

00:13:42,069 --> 00:13:47,079
P where they do a lot of publishing a

00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:50,439
curated data and storytelling with the

00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:53,439
community so that wraps up this sort of

00:13:50,439 --> 00:13:56,319
look at what they do but in terms of the

00:13:53,439 --> 00:13:58,029
roles intermediaries play and the

00:13:56,319 --> 00:13:59,109
organizations that they come from they

00:13:58,029 --> 00:14:01,149
can come from a lot of different places

00:13:59,109 --> 00:14:02,529
I'm going to university department but a

00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:04,149
lot of these roles are actually played

00:14:02,529 --> 00:14:07,149
by other organizations so you could have

00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:08,649
nonprofit organizations Civic libraries

00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:10,779
and university libraries play these

00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:13,449
intermediary roles as do civic

00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:15,519
organizations like brigades volunteers

00:14:13,449 --> 00:14:18,009
even through data records your rescue

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:20,589
event journalists and even public

00:14:18,009 --> 00:14:23,139
agencies and so if you think about it as

00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:24,489
a network you know the request of the

00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:25,809
needs come in to any note on this

00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:27,819
network and if everybody's connected

00:14:25,809 --> 00:14:29,819
they can kind of flow so if there's a

00:14:27,819 --> 00:14:32,319
question that we get from a local

00:14:29,819 --> 00:14:34,359
government agency about privacy we can

00:14:32,319 --> 00:14:36,039
relay that to the university librarians

00:14:34,359 --> 00:14:37,869
or if somebody has an idea for a

00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:40,919
training workshop we can connect them or

00:14:37,869 --> 00:14:44,649
even just they can go and connect with

00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:46,799
the Civic libraries so it's kind of like

00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:48,639
one way that we look at intermediaries

00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:50,949
what does it take for them to be

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,989
effective takes institutional support a

00:14:50,949 --> 00:14:54,789
lot of the organizations on that list

00:14:52,989 --> 00:14:57,579
actually were parts of larger

00:14:54,789 --> 00:14:59,679
institutions so the leadership there

00:14:57,579 --> 00:15:01,839
matters both at the top and also within

00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:04,379
the project teams as well so we have a

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,699
lot of really good partners who really

00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:07,929
work closely with us on a lot of these

00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:10,119
kind of things and that's leadership

00:15:07,929 --> 00:15:12,129
it takes legal infrastructure I

00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:13,869
mentioned our two-page agreement but you

00:15:12,129 --> 00:15:15,519
know if you can create a vehicle for

00:15:13,869 --> 00:15:17,109
people to share data without a whole lot

00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,089
of friction you're going to be a lot

00:15:17,109 --> 00:15:21,279
more effective in your work technical

00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:21,970
infrastructure matters we have our open

00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,740
data portal

00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:25,029
is kind of a community resource for this

00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,709
type of thing

00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:28,959
relationships matters you heard from

00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:30,670
some of these stories if you have an

00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,680
organization that can kind of know who

00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:34,600
all the players are at least to some

00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:36,490
degree and what everybody's doing those

00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,720
connections between those institutions

00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:40,600
and those intermediaries in your own

00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,639
ecosystem can can be made communities of

00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,589
practice are really important and just

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:47,410
being able to be flexible and agile with

00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:50,350
all of this matters as well so some

00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:51,939
takeaways as I wrap up here from

00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:53,800
Pittsburgh so create a culture and ethic

00:15:51,939 --> 00:15:55,329
of stewardship for your civic data

00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,189
ecosystem get people to work together

00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:58,569
you encourage your brigade to have their

00:15:57,189 --> 00:16:01,329
meetings at the public library

00:15:58,569 --> 00:16:03,100
instead of at the bar those are the kind

00:16:01,329 --> 00:16:05,129
of things that you can do within your

00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:07,029
own ecosystem to strengthen it and

00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:08,829
improve the capacity it takes a lot of

00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:10,629
work to build the capacity of people and

00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:12,699
institutions in that an ecosystem but

00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:15,220
everybody can play a role

00:16:12,699 --> 00:16:17,139
think about who that network manager is

00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:18,730
in your ecosystem we play that role I

00:16:17,139 --> 00:16:22,120
think in a lot of cases in Pittsburgh

00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:23,290
but those network managers can really do

00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,209
a lot of work to strengthen the

00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:26,740
intermediaries to establish new

00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:29,110
connections between players in the

00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:32,800
ecosystem and to coordinate across a lot

00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:35,769
of different actors third takeaway is

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,839
really 3a and 3b sustainability really

00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:39,250
depends on institutionalizing roles and

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,389
funding we're kind of at the point where

00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,069
we're halfway through our three-year

00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:44,470
startup funding we need to figure out

00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:45,819
the next step so we're trying to think

00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:47,649
about how we institutionalize our

00:16:45,819 --> 00:16:49,480
funding sources and then view your

00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:51,129
intermediaries as part of the Civic data

00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,720
infrastructure it's not just technology

00:16:51,129 --> 00:16:54,730
or computers that are infrastructure

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,600
it's also people and organizations and

00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:58,449
think about it that way

00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,589
and then the final one is really

00:16:58,449 --> 00:17:02,019
communities to practice a really

00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:04,059
invaluable in providing inspiration and

00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:05,500
knowledge transfer so you know some of

00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:07,809
the communities that touch our community

00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,459
are in an IP which has a guide to

00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:11,890
starting local data interview years ago

00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:13,630
about Code for America the American

00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:15,520
Library Association civic analytics

00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:18,130
network which our city's chief data

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,809
officer participates in Coalition for

00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:22,870
networked information is one I know that

00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:24,130
our librarians at the University work

00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:25,539
through and then even things like the

00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,949
what work cities initiative or some

00:17:25,539 --> 00:17:30,630
national organizations like sunlight

00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:33,669
foundation also touch our networks and

00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:35,380
that's it for that you need to contact

00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:39,010
me that's me on the phone

00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:40,390
I do answer my phone and then all my

00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:42,340
other contact information so I'm happy

00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:43,150
to talk more about that but open it up

00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:46,989
for questions

00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:46,989
