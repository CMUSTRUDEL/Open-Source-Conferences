[Music]

00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:11,900
so I came to Oregon about two and half

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,429
years ago to join The Oregonian State a

00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,440
team and I came from Arizona where I

00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:18,560
didn't have all that much trouble

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,849
getting data or getting metadata and I

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,710
found a very different experience in

00:00:19,849 --> 00:00:24,920
Oregon so that's part of why I'm very

00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:27,439
interested in that in this topic and to

00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,269
follow on the keynote speaker I think

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,949
there's a there's an opportunity in

00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:33,590
Oregon right now and maybe also in other

00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:37,640
states too to talk about public records

00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:41,090
and change public records law and I'm

00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:42,469
quite interested in that so I'm going to

00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:44,930
focus mostly on the state and local

00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:46,940
level but I think the same principles

00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:50,270
I'd like to talk about also apply at the

00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:52,699
federal level in some way and toward the

00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:56,780
end I'd like to have a discussion if

00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:58,340
you're all game about how to make sure

00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,379
that kind of basic information about

00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:03,289
data sets that government already keeps

00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:07,159
are made publicly available to the

00:01:03,289 --> 00:01:08,930
extent possible so that's my that's my

00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:10,220
general interest so when would just

00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:11,930
start kind of from the beginning maybe

00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,700
even before making a public records

00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:19,100
request you have to figure out what

00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:21,530
exists and I come out of a reporting

00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:24,020
background not a not a data or technical

00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:26,180
background and so I sorta didn't know

00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:28,700
how to start thinking about that and I

00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:30,350
started just mostly with academic papers

00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:33,049
and then I would just kind of like spit

00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:35,509
back out the name of data set to to a

00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:37,579
public records custodian and sort of

00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:39,590
like see what happened but there's a lot

00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:42,140
of there's a lot of places to get ideas

00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:46,009
I really like requests for proposals I

00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:49,210
cover a lot of law enforcement issues

00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:53,420
through data sets in Oregon and I

00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:54,979
started when I started here by making a

00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:59,149
request to the Portland Police Bureau

00:01:54,979 --> 00:02:01,159
for data inventory and kind of what

00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:03,829
record layouts I had available and it

00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:07,009
ended up with the sit down with the city

00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:10,319
attorney who read my request back to me

00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:14,010
and debated the meaning of each word and

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:16,700
stuff like 20 minutes so um so that

00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:22,709
might happen to you that's the bad news

00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:24,719
you want to have these buzz up front so

00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:25,920
so inventories of databases sometimes

00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:28,590
they exist something that you don't

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,680
exist as in the case of Portland Police

00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:33,780
Bureau but it's a good place to start a

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,419
lot of state agencies in Oregon anyway

00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:40,079
have those it's more difficult to the

00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:41,790
local level agency directive all of

00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:43,680
these are links and you're welcome to

00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:46,739
explore them later but I just kind of

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,139
gave you some recent examples of places

00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:51,599
where I have found datasets and on the

00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:53,549
subject of directives I was reading

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,829
through the Portland Police Bureau

00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:57,780
directives related to gang designations

00:02:55,829 --> 00:02:59,909
and it actually like told you about the

00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:03,180
data in the directives and so I went

00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:07,019
back and asked them for it that led to

00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:08,909
an odyssey but I had a good starting

00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:13,799
point and they did eventually get some

00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:17,220
data reports and audits quite obviously

00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:19,620
again talking about the local level here

00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,509
in Portland there's a great auditor's

00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,470
office and so they'll put that an audit

00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:24,120
and then they'll make available

00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:27,540
everything underlying and you can learn

00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:30,540
tons of stuff that you may not know this

00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:33,870
otherwise performance measures at the

00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:35,489
state level they each agency does those

00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,500
at the bottom of each little graph it

00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:40,409
says the data source and we've learned

00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:42,479
about tons of tons of databases there

00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:44,639
the Federal Register again at the

00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:47,280
federal level is another great source

00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,689
and of course task people but I just

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,560
kind of wanted to zoom all the way out

00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:53,969
because I think we sometimes narrower

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,620
scope of allure what we're really

00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:57,090
talking about I'm interested in systems

00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,349
I'm interested in how programs are

00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:03,180
working and agencies often have some

00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:06,180
some record that some record of what

00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:09,479
they do I think that's a productive way

00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:11,039
to think about it so going back to

00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:13,439
Portland Police Bureau I asked for the

00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:18,180
inventory desk for the record layout and

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:21,989
I learned that some of them are

00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:24,100
protected by trade secrets however in

00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:26,590
another case this case was more

00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:30,130
mystic I asked for the record layout and

00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:32,920
I got the beautiful spreadsheet which

00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:36,040
told me what all the fields were what

00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:38,320
the datatypes were how many characters

00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,600
were available in each field and this is

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,780
really useful in Oregon as you're

00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:46,180
negotiating because quite often there's

00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:48,610
a very high price tag at the beginning

00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:51,370
of gotten cost estimates of a million

00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:57,540
dollars cost estimate so in this case I

00:04:51,370 --> 00:05:00,220
think $27,000 and part of the reasoning

00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,690
when we got down to it was they said

00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:04,720
well you could put a social security

00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:08,260
number anywhere and so we have to have

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,180
an attorney review every single field so

00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,950
one of the arguments that we made was

00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:16,120
you know you can't even have enough

00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:17,830
characters in this field to contain the

00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,360
social security number it seems kind of

00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:23,440
kind of obvious or maybe a little bit

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,170
idiotic but you really do end up having

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,640
a lot of those conversations so I think

00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:31,750
it makes a lot of sense to start with

00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:34,090
what metadata you can get in order to be

00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:37,960
in a good negotiating position when you

00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:43,840
get a cost estimate so highly recommend

00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:45,010
that so writing a data request I think

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,040
in whatever state you want to reference

00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:51,010
the law maybe maybe specifically use the

00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:52,360
language of the law in your kind of

00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:54,670
introduction I'm asking for the

00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,110
following records use the name of the

00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:58,120
data set that you found in your

00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:00,910
beautiful audit or report or that you've

00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,400
gotten from an academic because the more

00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:05,410
specific you are the more authoritative

00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:09,100
you sound and the more seriously they

00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:12,430
take when I don't know what fields exist

00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:13,120
because the I haven't gotten access to

00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,890
that metadata

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,040
I will quite often like kind of make a

00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:20,170
wish list a field and sometimes that's

00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,730
productive in that you'll find well that

00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:23,350
isn't in this database but that's in

00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:25,450
this other database that we can link to

00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:27,310
and so you'd like just really lay it out

00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:29,500
lay out what you want and sort of see

00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:31,930
what happens as part of a conversation I

00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:35,550
think you should treat it like a sort of

00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:35,550
opening statement

00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,980
sometimes I also mentioned feels that

00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,600
I'm not interested in buy no there's a

00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:42,460
credit card number or a social security

00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,190
number even though they're not supposed

00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:48,220
to keep those I'll say don't give me

00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:50,250
that and it's sort of I think I think

00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:52,240
they also appreciate that you're

00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:55,540
cognizant there may be things that

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,850
you're going to be negotiating over of

00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:00,580
course I think probably everybody here

00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:04,750
wants a CSV file so ask for it

00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:06,910
specifically one or more and I also

00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:09,790
forgot to specify like I don't want a

00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:11,350
PDF and I don't consider that to be like

00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:13,480
a satisfying answer to this request

00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:17,620
don't give me that and I'll focus on the

00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:20,050
request letter if I haven't gotten the

00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:21,900
documentation I will still ask for it in

00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:23,860
the formal request for the data

00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:27,400
sometimes this happened to a colleague

00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:29,800
of mine recently she was negotiating

00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:32,250
with a state agency she asked for the

00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:35,860
record layouts yes for data dictionaries

00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:39,190
they went through a variety of terms

00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:42,580
she got a variety of denials and then in

00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:46,810
some conversation somebody mentioned the

00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:48,669
extensible properties and lo and behold

00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:50,140
there was a computable data dictionary

00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:52,570
those exactly what she needed for this

00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:54,700
very complex data set that they had said

00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:57,460
it'll be totally obvious like what's in

00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:59,200
the data from the headers like there's

00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:02,260
no way you won't know and of course he

00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:04,390
gets the data and it makes no sense but

00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:06,070
the extensible properties were there so

00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:08,320
sometimes I'll just like to lay out all

00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:10,720
those terms and then also have a

00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:13,960
sentence of descriptors like I want to

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:17,350
know what tables exist what fields exist

00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,970
I take that approach because I think you

00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:21,910
want to use technical language to show

00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:23,530
that you have technical knowledge but

00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:25,090
you also want to make sure that the

00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:26,620
person who reads your request who might

00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:29,440
not have that technical knowledge that

00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:32,520
understands the extent possible what

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:36,400
you're going for and you can sort of

00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:38,830
avoid these conversations that make no

00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:41,280
sense or they don't give you something

00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:43,630
because they don't understand it and

00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,980
then I kind of also put a lot of

00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:47,530
emphasis on like please don't hesitate

00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,380
to contact me like did you get my

00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:50,240
request did you

00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:52,130
my request like who's going to be

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:56,120
handling my requests I think that's

00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:58,730
especially important for data as opposed

00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,470
to other kinds of Records oftentimes

00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:02,030
especially at low at the local level

00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:03,980
there's only really one person who

00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:07,070
handles the data and they don't always

00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:08,510
have a tremendously high level of

00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:10,940
expertise and it's not the only thing

00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:14,090
they're doing so a friend that person

00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:20,060
and always be extremely polite I think

00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:21,860
it really matters so then you get this

00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:25,100
variety of denials I've kind of already

00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:27,140
previewed them but one thing here very

00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:30,050
often is I'm not obligated to create a

00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:31,790
record for you they say you know we we

00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:34,640
just provide records that exist and this

00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:35,900
is especially problematic in data when

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,210
you have an agency that doesn't have

00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:42,110
very much expertise we were talking

00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:45,380
earlier one one strategies I've used in

00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:47,660
the past is you know I I think I could I

00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:49,820
could just write the sequel query for

00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:51,410
you and that'll save you some time and I

00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:53,210
haven't actually gotten opportunity to

00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:56,240
do that although I've gotten close but

00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:58,790
it does um it does kind of crack the nut

00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,570
open sometimes so try it I don't know

00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:04,010
and they they realize that you can do it

00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:09,320
and that is quite embarrassing if they

00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:11,570
can't I kind of referenced this earlier

00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,550
with social security numbers if there's

00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:15,140
if there's information that is

00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:18,280
personally identifiable and that you

00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:21,230
sort of like agree to negotiate a way

00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:23,090
that runs you a lot of good space in

00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:25,070
part of the negotiation so I will quite

00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:26,480
often like start there if you have

00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:29,210
somebody who's just denied you denied

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:33,080
you know I do but if you start to talk

00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:35,180
about what you might give up things can

00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:38,360
open up so I think it's kind of try that

00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:41,000
early at least to open up the

00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:43,160
conversation and not not necessarily

00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,600
negotiate anything away indicator you

00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,430
are willing to do that and you want to

00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:50,180
see the full array of information that's

00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:51,590
included so you understand that what you

00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:53,090
get will not cause you to make an

00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:55,340
inaccurate conclusion in the end like

00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:57,200
these are my research questions I not

00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:59,000
everybody has this approach but I do try

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,520
to be pretty transparent about what I

00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,170
think are important questions that

00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:06,370
in the public interest and I'll bring

00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:09,850
that into a conversation too much work

00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:12,370
again I'll help you like I'll sit by

00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:17,280
your computer all like I'll write your

00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:19,090
queries then back to the trade secret

00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:22,090
copyright we'll talk about that more

00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:25,180
later because we have a potential

00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:27,310
solution that we propose and most

00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:28,780
important I think of all is like don't

00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:30,760
let it go at no a lot of these

00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:32,590
conversations though in many many

00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:35,620
circles is kind of like cascade of

00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:38,070
circles and you'll hear no and it

00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:42,370
doesn't mean no so don't let it mean no

00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:44,170
appeal in Oregon there is a an appeal

00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:46,800
process that doesn't require the courts

00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:50,200
at least in the first round if you're

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:52,150
getting getting data from say the city

00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,150
of Portland than your venue for

00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:57,730
appealing is the DA's office if you're

00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:59,710
asking for data from a state agency then

00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:02,410
your appeal venue is the attorney

00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:04,420
general's office and it's really worth

00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:06,190
checking that out and we make an

00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:10,350
argument quite often related to the

00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:17,760
public interest and and they consider it

00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:20,260
I've had a lot of success that way so

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,730
you'll hear know in various forms and

00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:23,560
some of them especially a first will be

00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:26,950
informal but you want to make sure that

00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:29,770
they cite the law specifically in their

00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:31,870
denial you want it in writing and you

00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:34,480
want to know which statute it is that

00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:36,220
they're referencing if they're talking

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,010
about what they can and can't do and

00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:40,150
what the regulations are remind them

00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:42,040
that's not how the law works I mean

00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:44,590
those aren't appropriate citations

00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:49,360
they're really neat to be a statutory

00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:51,100
reference that they provide I for

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,870
example with the police bureau I think

00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:55,240
you know go to their boss there's a

00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:56,830
political system over over the top

00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,950
people don't like hear that you can't

00:12:56,830 --> 00:13:01,240
get what you want especially if it does

00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:02,920
relate to a question the Public Interest

00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:09,470
try it doesn't always work but I think

00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:12,350
it's worth it so

00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:15,820
I guess I have already mostly heard this

00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:17,960
so I really tried to fill this

00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:20,990
presentation with a lot of resources you

00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:23,000
could go back to you later this book up

00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:24,710
top I found tremendously helpful and one

00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,080
thing especially for the newer

00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:29,000
requesters out there it has a lot of

00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,920
example letters and a lot of negotiating

00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,030
tactics I think the letters especially

00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:37,160
are helpful you can see how different

00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:40,100
people do it so check that out here in

00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,990
Oregon there's also state public records

00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,190
and public meetings manual I think

00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:45,740
there's something similar a lot of

00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:48,860
places enormous amount of resources

00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:50,300
there and the appeal decisions that have

00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,830
been made in many jurisdictions are

00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,240
quite often online or you can request

00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:56,540
those as well and let's give you

00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:58,220
guidance lastly I wanted to especially

00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:02,600
highlight the reporters committee for

00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:05,480
freedom with the press and they have

00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,740
state-by-state guide so not all of you

00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,860
from Oregon and don't wanna hear about

00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:10,940
the city of Portland endlessly but um

00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:14,300
but they do have state-by-state guides

00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:16,700
and it's sort of a in an outline format

00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:20,060
that is the same from state to state and

00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:22,340
part of the the breakouts is electronic

00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:25,070
records and how you know what the case

00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:26,780
law or statutory law is relates that it

00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:35,150
can be quite different from state to

00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:37,010
state so on the subject of change I had

00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:38,720
asked for these record layouts that I

00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:40,280
didn't and and they were cited as trade

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,140
secrets I appeals all the way up to the

00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:46,100
CEO of the company which was based in

00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:48,220
Canada Oh which one of the lines from

00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:50,030
Portland Police is what we we chose a

00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,460
Canadian company because they take

00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:54,020
privacy more seriously and so we can't

00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:56,780
actually join these tables through a

00:14:54,020 --> 00:15:00,650
unique identifier and that was by design

00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:01,670
you can't join these tables so I thought

00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,500
that was I thought that was kind of

00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:06,280
funny and I didn't think that the CEO

00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:08,540
would tell me the same thing but he did

00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:12,170
so the Society of Professional

00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:15,620
Journalists the Oregon chapter put

00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:17,840
together a language for a bill that that

00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:20,570
has is now being considered in the House

00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:22,150
Rules Committee and the idea is that it

00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:24,380
would require when any

00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:27,170
agency in the future goes out to

00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:30,470
contract for database software the

00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:32,780
software would have to export in an open

00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:35,930
format and that the record layouts or

00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:38,870
related documentation would be public

00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:43,160
record without trade secrets or other

00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:46,430
exemptions it was going pretty little

00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:48,350
until this week when when there was a

00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:50,120
hearing and what we heard was the local

00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:54,560
government thought it would massively

00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:58,040
increase the cost of contracts and there

00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:00,770
is a particular software vendor a big

00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:03,140
software vendor that would like to see

00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:04,760
this going forward and they proposed a

00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:07,400
lot of language so part of what I'd like

00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:08,930
to open to the room is you know what is

00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:11,570
the right way to frame that if my

00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:13,970
intention may be our shared intention is

00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:16,640
to make information about what data

00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:19,640
government collects available so that

00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:21,350
requesters can seek that information if

00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:24,830
they have a question that they'd like to

00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:27,410
answer with it how do we best make that

00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:29,750
available I mean this is one idea

00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:31,220
there's there others moving forward but

00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:34,880
I really I think that's a conversation

00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:36,860
we all ought to be having is at least to

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,150
know it exists that really ought to be

00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:40,490
something that's more widely available

00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:42,880
so I'd love to hear from you that's all

00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,880
I got

00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,490
