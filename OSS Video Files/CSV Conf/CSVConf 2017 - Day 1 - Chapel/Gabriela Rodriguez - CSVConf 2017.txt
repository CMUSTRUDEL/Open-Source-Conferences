00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,450
okay we're going to get started with the

00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:11,790
next session welcome to all the new

00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:14,969
people in the room I'm Danielle and I'm

00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:17,369
introducing the sessions in this awesome

00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:19,410
session about cities and datas and next

00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:21,180
we have gaba rodriguez and she's an

00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,010
activist in a hacker who works at the

00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,460
coral project and does consulting around

00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,710
data

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,539
she loves the intersection between media

00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,730
and technology she co-founded a

00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,439
nonprofit called bapa which works with

00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,600
open data and transparency in south

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,329
america she grew up in Uruguay and now

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:43,920
she hangs out with me in Portland so

00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:48,930
GABA thank you hello hi everybody see me

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:51,739
um okay so today I want to talk a little

00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:55,440
about a project that I was involved

00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:58,410
until last year I'm I'm a software

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,170
engineer but I also work with data with

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:05,990
the fur nonprofit on different

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:09,810
governments so I have Mexico City to

00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:11,189
implement a standard on open data so I

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,820
want to talk a little about my

00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:17,130
experience there and also about what is

00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:20,880
the standard let me move it because we

00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,540
really need to settle is why yes still

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,860
okay

00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:29,900
so first what are public contracts so

00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:32,340
I'm something else to disclaimers when

00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:35,579
English is my second language so I'm

00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:39,140
sorry if there's any mistakes and second

00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:41,820
I'm sorry there are no cards so yeah

00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:43,229
what the public contracts so an

00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,270
agreement to perform a particular task

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:48,270
to benefit the community the large that

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:51,030
is financed by government funds the dogs

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:53,909
could be from like building operations

00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,860
or airports like in Mexico City two

00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:59,640
contracts of cleaning services in the

00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:02,280
different organism so those are public

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,890
contracts why it's important to open

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,190
them why why we need the Disick's pay is

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,840
quite related with the top before me

00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:11,370
seems to me because it's one of the

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,129
reasons why we need to

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:17,040
data now in the in the case of public

00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:19,019
contracts is most of the corruption that

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,209
we have in our governments is through

00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:24,180
public contracts so having open data

00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:28,739
makes them transference for transference

00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:30,629
for everybody to use them to to cross

00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:33,120
them with other data to see where there

00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:35,790
could be problems allowed to track the

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,150
tenders in a world allow the government

00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:41,640
to monitor implementation how the public

00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,680
contracts deliver services deliver the

00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,660
delivery better value for money for the

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,390
government and that is a very important

00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:50,930
reason on why to open data around public

00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:54,230
contracts is not just for like the

00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:58,650
companies that are applying to this

00:02:54,230 --> 00:03:00,420
contract the two benefits from where the

00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:02,940
contracts are but also for the

00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:05,400
government to be able to know what they

00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:08,220
are spending money on that usually as

00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,859
she was saying before if these different

00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:13,049
dependencies do not know what the other

00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:16,530
data and other dependencies are about

00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:18,239
and so there's no much information

00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,639
inside the government so opening the

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,700
data makes like the civil society to

00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:25,500
work on that and help the government to

00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:27,959
to the legal better value and of course

00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:31,109
prevent fraud and corruption as the

00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:38,519
first one to reason to open public

00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:40,949
contracts so in around 2013-2014 there

00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:42,419
was a lot of interest on pushing for

00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:44,669
different government's to open in

00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:47,040
contracts so there was a partnership

00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:49,919
that was born that's called the open

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,750
contracting partnership there were like

00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:55,709
policy expert programmers leaders

00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:58,530
containers that try to see how that will

00:03:55,709 --> 00:04:02,099
happen how they can build a standard on

00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:04,650
open data that if there's only about the

00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:06,900
format and meaning of the data but also

00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:09,180
about how to publish it on how a

00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,859
guidance from the beginning because it's

00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,510
not as simple as saying okay open the

00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:14,579
data sometimes the government don't have

00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:16,889
they turn on the contracts or

00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:21,090
everything's in paper like in in the

00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:24,120
case of Mexico so these partnerships

00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:25,720
try to advocate around opening public

00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,039
contra

00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,620
they open public contract through

00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:31,030
disclosure written engagement so that

00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,690
the key systems of money involved are

00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:38,830
spent honestly third and effectively so

00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:41,259
the contracting process so this is in

00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:43,389
general known around the world for all

00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:47,139
the government we have different phases

00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:48,909
on when one con contract you know we

00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:51,039
beginning the planning so when the

00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:54,009
different organs start to think okay

00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:56,590
this is what we need this is the budget

00:04:54,009 --> 00:04:58,569
we have these are the project plans this

00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:00,490
is a market study so there's a lot of

00:04:58,569 --> 00:05:03,039
documents and information relatively

00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:05,830
where the government wants to spend the

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:09,400
money after they have an a specific plan

00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:11,349
they go in and post a tender so they

00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,380
have notices to call the companies to

00:05:11,349 --> 00:05:17,520
say okay these are the tenders that you

00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:19,840
can apply to so in that case there's

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,659
document around tender notices the

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,819
specifications inquiries and then

00:05:22,659 --> 00:05:27,759
there's different processes depending

00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:32,500
mostly on the government's on how they

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:34,930
award that contract now and in that case

00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:37,449
include the tails of award the Peter

00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:40,060
information be the valuation and then

00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:42,849
when there's a decision made about who

00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:45,610
gets the contract then you have to sign

00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:48,370
the contract the signed contract

00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:50,349
amendments or is there some changes

00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:52,210
finally tails and also sometimes

00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:58,020
information about contracts that are

00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:59,949
like that do not expire that that renew

00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,750
automatically there's many many ways

00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:03,819
that the contract could continue now and

00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:05,259
then implementation that is the part

00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:08,050
that mostly the government's don't have

00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:10,000
so much but it's a quite important that

00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:12,969
is about monitoring how that contract

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,150
went through now all the milestones the

00:06:12,969 --> 00:06:19,029
payment and the termination for it at

00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:22,690
appropriate know so from there from that

00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:26,080
process we build what we call open

00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:28,360
contracting data standard that data

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,789
standards as you may or may not know are

00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,889
the rules by which data is described and

00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:35,440
recorded it could be standard

00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:37,419
standardized a format as well as the

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,289
meaning you're saying okay you have to

00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:44,199
publish

00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:46,029
um see you say stones or an API or

00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:48,219
something like that and this is

00:06:46,029 --> 00:06:50,680
information you need for each phase and

00:06:48,219 --> 00:06:52,449
the specific open contracted data

00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,369
standard is a global non-proprietary

00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:56,770
standard structured to reflect the

00:06:54,369 --> 00:07:00,749
complete contracting cycle so it tells

00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:05,949
you how to publish data in each phase

00:07:00,749 --> 00:07:09,460
how periodically to publish the data the

00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:12,069
approach that we had around the standard

00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:15,309
is to publish earlier early and I to

00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:17,919
iterate so for example most of the

00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:20,439
government can publish documents that

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,449
that will be the first part no not

00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:25,899
published a structural data but just a

00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:27,669
document on the contracts and no that

00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:30,550
would be something the first step to

00:07:27,669 --> 00:07:32,860
start publishing data around of the

00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:37,360
contracting then the other approach is

00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:40,479
try to have them to to publish in a JSON

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,909
decision structure and polish data for

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,259
each step of the contracting process

00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:48,039
create a summary record for an overall

00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:49,930
contracting process reuse objects so for

00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:53,080
Mexico we try to get the list of

00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:54,909
organizations and the information like

00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:57,099
meetings milestones different kind of

00:07:54,909 --> 00:08:00,339
information around contracting in

00:07:57,099 --> 00:08:02,469
general then recommended undocumented

00:08:00,339 --> 00:08:04,899
basic intermediate and advanced level

00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:06,519
advanced level so we are trying to

00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:09,219
approach when we try to approach about

00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:12,849
opening contracts we say ok you don't

00:08:09,219 --> 00:08:15,610
need to just do the five stars of open

00:08:12,849 --> 00:08:18,819
data and that we can talk later about

00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:20,860
that but you just publish the basic

00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:23,439
information whatever you have and then

00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:26,409
from there well now try to add this now

00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:30,069
until we have all the levels of what

00:08:26,409 --> 00:08:31,779
people may be use or may need and some

00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:33,279
the other approaches guidance on

00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:36,430
improving data collection and data

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,529
quality now and a growing community of

00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:41,169
users and range of open-source tools

00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:42,669
something very interesting about the

00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:44,680
open contractor data scenario for me

00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:48,579
Elise is quite interesting is it is a

00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:51,040
community effort so and it is work in

00:08:48,579 --> 00:08:51,790
the open so the standard is being

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:57,280
developed in

00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:59,440
have you as whoever can go and see the

00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:01,540
different versions and see what are the

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,730
possible extensions and possible

00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:06,220
features for the next version and this

00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:08,500
is all sealed from the specific

00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,390
implementations to internships in Mexico

00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,910
and Ukraine in Paraguay in different

00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:15,700
places are feeding back to the standard

00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:18,070
on which things they need or not own on

00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:19,780
it or what what things could be good or

00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:23,650
bad about like how it's being

00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:26,110
implemented No so first I'm going to go

00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:27,850
through different phases of how we go

00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:29,470
about implementing in Mexico how it's

00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:31,840
being implemented in general around the

00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:34,600
world now first we do an assessment and

00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:36,610
we talk we ask this questions now with

00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,800
what data systems do we have that hold

00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:40,660
contracting data that is the hardest

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,880
part about the go about implementing

00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:45,040
these because sometimes the information

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,660
for different places are like all over

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,960
the place in different systems so we

00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:53,170
need to find a way to extract all the

00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:55,630
data from different places and unpublish

00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:57,280
it for the case of Mexico the Mexico

00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:59,020
City now because the federal level is

00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,910
more complicated and there's also an

00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:04,030
effort about implementing it at the

00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:06,460
federal level for Mexico City there was

00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:09,370
found a specific organism the

00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:11,890
secretarial finances that holds most of

00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:13,870
the information about contracts so and

00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:15,760
we they have the capacity the technical

00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:19,300
capacity to implement that stand or so

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:21,010
we work with them and from there like we

00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:24,520
change their system to be able to

00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:26,620
publish data the way we were recommended

00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:28,690
now the second question will be which

00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:32,290
data system hold data on each stage of a

00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:33,250
contracting process now that's yeah like

00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:34,840
for example for the case of

00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:37,240
implementation it could be harder it

00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:39,430
could be in some other systems do you

00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,290
hold something else the other question

00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:43,420
is do you hold consistent identifiers

00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:45,970
for each contracting process and for the

00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:47,710
parties to tender and contracts so this

00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:50,230
is an effort that tries to bring public

00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:52,720
contracts around the world so we would

00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:56,220
try to do it have any specific unique

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:59,980
identifiers per contract that is Clovis

00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:02,830
so for Mexico they have the identifiers

00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:05,040
we give like a code when with that code

00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:06,509
they made an identifier and that

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,540
all the contracts that start with that

00:11:06,509 --> 00:11:12,600
code are from Mexico so people could for

00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:16,829
example like journalists or civil

00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:20,040
society could interact with contracts

00:11:16,829 --> 00:11:22,889
from different places and they could

00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,839
understand also how that works now and

00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:26,459
then the last question is what technical

00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:28,410
resources do you have available to help

00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:30,540
in implementation of open contracting

00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:33,120
that is quite important too and in the

00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:35,130
case of Mexico City yeah we have we had

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,190
a team that was quite willing to to help

00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:40,199
with implementation so here is like

00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:41,850
continue with the assessment we were

00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:44,069
right which systems they have for each

00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:46,980
of the stages planning to end their work

00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:49,560
on to implementation we asked the data

00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:52,110
structure for the case of Mexico City

00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:54,360
they had a low transparency law that

00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:56,160
says for whole Mexico now that says

00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,290
every three months they need to publish

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,120
a contract but what we were doing is

00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:01,620
that somebody was going through all the

00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,019
papers and adding to a spreadsheet

00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:05,699
manually every three months all the

00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:08,069
contracts and they were published that

00:12:05,699 --> 00:12:09,930
so there was some information but it was

00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:14,550
not coming automatically from the air

00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:16,199
systems so yeah then we asked if the

00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:18,029
documents are published there will be

00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:19,410
the first recommendation when they start

00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:22,110
implementing

00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:24,209
because that that's the validation of

00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:26,010
what we are seeing in the data now so

00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:28,260
the double files are the data that they

00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:30,449
are publishing is correct then the

00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:34,260
revision history we try to publish like

00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:37,380
like photos of each part you have the

00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:40,589
whole process so we say okay first

00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:42,389
publish a photo of the plan then when it

00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:45,930
goes to tender photos it so you have

00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:48,449
like a control of different history

00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:50,970
revisions of the process and with that

00:12:48,449 --> 00:12:53,370
you can have a better idea how they the

00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:55,019
contract move on and then access

00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:57,870
restriction because many governments

00:12:55,019 --> 00:13:00,449
when they polish data they require login

00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:02,310
for example or an account so what

00:13:00,449 --> 00:13:06,029
recommendation is that when they publish

00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:09,360
data it should have no restrictions on

00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:11,550
access now so the open contract data

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,949
center provides a structured data model

00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:16,220
for computer information about each of

00:13:13,949 --> 00:13:17,490
the states as a contracting process and

00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:20,339
we

00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:22,320
Chaffin schema which describes all the

00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:25,680
field names field definitions and

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:28,050
structures for the day tunnel and then

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,089
when we talk about compliance we talk

00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:30,540
about assessing against that data schema

00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:33,149
No

00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:35,000
so we talked about the seasonal schema

00:13:33,149 --> 00:13:39,240
and also the guide on how to implement

00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,550
implement and publish the standard so

00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,180
this would be okay so we had an

00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:45,839
assessment

00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:48,000
now the next step will be to map data so

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,950
for Mexico we did add we see okay this

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,010
is the recommendation as a standard know

00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:57,690
we have this JSON file with all the

00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:59,279
different stations so the first one we

00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:00,750
feel planning and we send that

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,060
information with a little information

00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:04,680
the second release we send we feel

00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:07,080
tender and we publish that information

00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:10,020
and that's how you start filling it up

00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:12,120
know that JSON file and what we do to be

00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:14,100
able to implement this or to be changed

00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,230
systems or other new system that they

00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:19,200
have about publishing data is that we

00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:21,240
map we say okay the planning is in this

00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:23,040
system is this data that's what it's

00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:26,370
coming from that's how you call it in

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:30,300
Mexico now and try to see rules about

00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:31,500
what's happening around planning or so

00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,230
there's a lot of things are wrong

00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:36,209
mapping that that is the most hard part

00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:38,459
of this process

00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:40,950
then we publish data in machine-readable

00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:42,480
releases and records that will be the

00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:46,980
shades and files with a unique

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:49,260
identifier and then we polish using

00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:51,950
publications under patterns this is what

00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:56,370
I was talking about the five stars so

00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:58,350
there's a kind of quality score now

00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:01,290
about how governments publish later

00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:03,870
so first would be the first star we if

00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:06,660
we give the first one a star and sorry

00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:08,610
if we if they upload basic contracting

00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:10,980
data and documents the web just do that

00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:12,990
so Mexico City already had one star

00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:14,700
because they were doing that we were

00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:18,390
publishing the documents and they were

00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:21,180
publishing manually three stars if they

00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:23,940
provide machine readable data three

00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:26,370
stars if they use a standard four stars

00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:30,000
is they provide an API access to the

00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:31,020
data so people can use that API to to

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,480
get data on

00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:35,490
the fibre start is like they provide

00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:41,070
other kind of data sets that we can

00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:43,710
cross open the contracts with now then

00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:46,800
the next step after the publication and

00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:48,990
define all these these stars is a check

00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,670
the validation of the data we have if

00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:53,180
you go to github or to the open

00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:55,620
contracting data standard ripple

00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:57,390
organizations we have a validator that

00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:00,000
does a technical check on the way the

00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:03,720
data structure and format then we look

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,360
at the conformance um so it checking is

00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:09,980
like what we are publishing and what the

00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:13,170
concept of each terms it is correctly as

00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:17,370
as a standard size now then how complete

00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:20,760
is the information they are sending and

00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:24,810
then if the data fit for purpose or not

00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:26,550
know that Sunday this is something that

00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:28,500
seems to me very interesting about the

00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:32,010
specific standard and the data that is

00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:33,660
like community build this is yes is

00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:38,040
supported by the open contracting

00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:41,580
partnership but it's also like it's also

00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:43,440
built but by all the different civil

00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,940
society organizations and government

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,030
around the world that are trying to

00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:49,890
implement open contracts so you go there

00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:51,770
and you can like in the standard repo

00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:54,330
look at all the issues and all the

00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:56,880
questions that comes from different

00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:59,250
limitations on how which things we need

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,440
to change and with how we can extend

00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:04,740
this this is standard for to make sense

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:07,020
in the different places now and this is

00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:08,700
ad extension so the extension is for

00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:13,200
example I have this standard in the

00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:15,240
version one now and like Mexico says ok

00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,070
we need this for example this the

00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,780
singable contract or some contracts and

00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:21,180
never expire and they renew

00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:24,630
automatically okay that was not in the

00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:27,030
standard in the version 1.0 okay we need

00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:28,770
an extension so they publish it the way

00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:31,140
they want the proposed extension and

00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:33,570
then in the next release of the standard

00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:36,960
we see if that extension goes into the

00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:37,440
core or not the South so that that's how

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,100
it works

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,940
the really history of releasing data in

00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:45,670
Mexico City

00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:48,670
so first yeah this is this would be the

00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:51,130
standard no now we'd go back to Mexico

00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:54,160
so we validated they validated the

00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:56,020
standard in 2014 and was the first city

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,390
to release its full contracting data

00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:01,840
from planning to implementation so now

00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:04,780
they are releasing data already in the

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:09,400
standard there was a big thing about

00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:10,930
this is politics that was very hard so

00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,350
there's a lot of politics about pushing

00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:16,180
it forward to implement the standard

00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:18,910
yeah that happens in all the ones I

00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:20,260
guess start in a small department with

00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:22,150
technical capacity and we need to change

00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:24,490
processes that's something I already

00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:27,190
talked about they have the same capacity

00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:29,110
to implement the standard also they have

00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:31,510
the green integer because it's not just

00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:34,510
to other system and say okay Palace

00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:37,300
later but also the cultural processes

00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:39,370
know how they capture the data know

00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:41,230
which new things they need to come to so

00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:44,200
there was a lot of internal training

00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:45,970
about how two things need to change for

00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:49,330
the people are capturing data and others

00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:51,670
sending it from paper to to the system

00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:53,610
now and we try to involve and we

00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:56,170
recommend to involve the civil society

00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:58,480
from the beginning so we start to doing

00:18:56,170 --> 00:19:01,300
because one important thing about open

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:04,240
data is we need to use why we need to

00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:07,270
see why we need the data what are the

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,930
cases in the case of Mexico people were

00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:13,720
really concerned about the Metro change

00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:15,640
concerned about Airport there were many

00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,350
things that people in Mexico were

00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,180
concerned about so it was important to

00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:21,970
talk with them to see what which kind of

00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:23,920
data they needed now and then the modify

00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:29,140
existing systems to capture needed data

00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:32,410
this is the website that some people

00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:37,420
build from the gala the data that the

00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:40,060
city publish and this has an API and

00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:42,460
also has these illustrations of how the

00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:45,790
different contracts are happening on

00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:48,460
different transactions so and up there

00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:50,470
in the URL you can see the identifiers

00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:52,810
the unique global identifier from

00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:55,410
Oakland contracting for that specific

00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:57,460
contract now

00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:59,590
challenged contracting process

00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:00,850
identifiers it sometimes is this is

00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:03,250
something that you already I think they

00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:05,140
talked a little about already the

00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:07,300
identifiers sometimes are not so easy

00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:08,800
cuz I'm sometimes the systems have

00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:11,350
information here and there so it's hard

00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:14,800
to do much to say and create a unique

00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:17,410
identifier useful data you start with

00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:19,060
this or this organization that has the

00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:22,050
technical capacity and willing to change

00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:26,920
but it's sometimes this data only about

00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:29,350
not very useful so that that was one

00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,850
challenge I want to start in involving

00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:33,340
the civil society all the way it's hard

00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:35,020
because most in Mexico and I guess some

00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:37,540
another places car for the civil society

00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:39,370
to talk with the government pushing to

00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:41,170
open critical erroneous process and

00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:42,880
culture on capturing data on something I

00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:44,080
already talked about other places

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,180
implementing OCDs

00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,280
very interesting if you are if you

00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:51,280
really want to read about open

00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:55,030
contracting is the case of Ukraine and

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:58,330
there was a civil society group that

00:20:55,030 --> 00:21:00,700
started pushing on to open contracts and

00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:02,920
they build this de system called

00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:05,830
Pissarro that is free software and the

00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:09,580
government implements for sorrow in

00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:11,290
their own organism so they now they have

00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:13,750
this website that publish contracts know

00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:15,940
and other interesting places far away to

00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:18,580
that they this is a visualization that

00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:21,450
they did for example there they see what

00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:24,430
are the providers the yellow providers

00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:27,580
that have more get more contracts from

00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:29,590
the government so it's interesting by

00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:32,050
time so if you go to their website you

00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:35,290
can see on all interesting messages

00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:38,160
that's it and those are the links for if

00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:38,160
you're interested about this

00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,370
