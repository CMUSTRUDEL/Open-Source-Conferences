Title: Amanda Ludden- Around the world in 80 data formats: Re-packaging the Harvard Business Review archive
Publication date: 2020-05-28
Playlist: CSVConf 2020
Description: 
	We often evaluate digitally-published content using event-based metrics (clicks, conversions), persisting only snippets of the original content (headlines, tags) rather than full text. At Harvard Business Review, decades of editorial rigor have yielded an archive that's small but rich and modular relative to, e.g., breaking news sites -- and our strategies ought to reflect that. Here, I'll share outcomes and lessons from an initiative to re-package our archive text and metadata -- from XML to data.frames, .RData, CSV, XLS, and JSON -- as an internal data product for editors, analysts, product managers, and others across the organization.

awesome so thanks everyone for tuning in

00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:07,710
my name is Amanda I'm excited to share

00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,030
some work that I led and then developed

00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,090
with my colleagues at the Harvard

00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:13,230
Business Review our data and operations

00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,630
are essentially close source

00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,430
unfortunately but we for this project

00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,890
used a lot of the learnings tools and

00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:24,990
tactics from the open source world so

00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:28,140
I'm excited to share that uh-huh excuse

00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:30,269
me some background about me I have a

00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,340
degree in public relations basically

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:35,489
which will make less sense to you I

00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,170
think the more I talk but that's all to

00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:39,629
say my dated career started sort of

00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,160
after my formal education ended which is

00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:44,040
why I'm really also thankful for a lot

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,230
of the open source resources open data

00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:49,170
and research stuff that really lets you

00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:51,360
kind of learn on the job and so I ended

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,399
up working in public health research for

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,649
a while at the NIH and then I pivoted to

00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,590
industry doing survey and product

00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:01,710
research for public relations for public

00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:05,700
health campaigns and then TV film and

00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:08,280
now digital publishing and HBR I'd love

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,680
to know more about y'all in the chat or

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,170
slack after I think if you've ever

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,850
related to hack job Panda this talk

00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,400
might be up your alley because it's sort

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,650
of our DIY solution to something that

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,729
may have other solutions but this is

00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,380
ours

00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:24,869
and maybe you're here if you're familiar

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,680
with HBR which in which case that's

00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:28,740
awesome

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,340
I'll have some HBR data trivia for you

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:33,750
that you won't find anywhere else

00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:38,270
if you don't familiar with HBR briefly

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:40,380
we are a web and print digital outlets

00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:42,140
dedicated to improving the practice of

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:46,290
management through like really expert

00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:48,810
research content we have a paywall and

00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,630
subscription business model and we

00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,549
release a print magazine six times a

00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:56,369
year and have a pretty big online

00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:59,340
presence at HBR org on most of the

00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:00,750
social media platforms and we have

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,719
several email newsletters and growing

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:06,180
podcast network today I must say talking

00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:09,000
about our articles selling the magazine

00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,550
and on the website you've probably seen

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,420
an article but when I say article I'm

00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,170
talking about sort of all these

00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,060
components do you see

00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:18,010
including the author bio which is

00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,590
usually at the end and then the blue

00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:22,780
sort of highlighted pieces or things

00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:25,090
that we have readily available in our

00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:27,220
web analytics platforms which is what I

00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:30,370
primarily work with but then things like

00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:33,489
the summary and actual body those live

00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:36,730
elsewhere and we we would have to join

00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:39,730
that in separately and here's sort of a

00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:42,069
snippet of the limited view you kind of

00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:43,870
get with web data it's often you know

00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:45,879
you mostly working with the headline and

00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:48,220
events that happen oriented around the

00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:49,989
headline like did they view the page did

00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:53,590
they beer pay wall while on that page

00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:55,959
did they start subscribing what in a

00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,430
visit that included that article so that

00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:58,840
can be kind of limiting depending on

00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:01,780
what kind of question you're trying to

00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,010
answer and as it happens we started

00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,590
getting more questions from our

00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:08,170
colleagues that they came to us as a web

00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,489
data team but it kind of started to feel

00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:11,230
like we needed to know more about the

00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:13,590
content of the article to bring that

00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:16,109
into the fold to better answer questions

00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:18,970
like you know how people are navigating

00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:20,889
the headline doesn't really explain why

00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:22,989
someone may have left the page or maybe

00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:24,310
tell the whole story about maybe they

00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:27,849
clicked an article that had a similar

00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:29,319
title immediately after and the content

00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:31,450
is her brand butter so it kind of made

00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:34,870
sense to want to bring that into the

00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:37,180
fold so I was like great let's just go

00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:39,040
figure out where the sort of raw article

00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:42,400
content lives and write it to the party

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,780
and then we'll get our drawing on as it

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,340
turned out it wasn't that simple with

00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:48,040
our infrastructure and the available

00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:50,560
resources in theory we had access to

00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,209
everything we needed to make that

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,239
pipeline happen but it was more than

00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:57,400
like the time and resources weren't

00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:59,829
gonna be allocated in a timeline at work

00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,419
for us so our team was kind of just

00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:04,870
given the blessing to like do it

00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:06,849
yourself and you know other teams like

00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,319
engineering would try to fill in some

00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:12,099
gaps but there wasn't gonna be sort of a

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,810
dedicated sprint or commitment to sort

00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:16,750
of making this data available in a

00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:18,310
repository that made like professional

00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,199
data engineering sense if that makes

00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:22,180
sense so our team ended up resorting to

00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:24,820
a lot of open-source tools and practices

00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:26,680
and tutorials to kind of package this

00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,370
full article data to make it useful for

00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,479
us

00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:33,190
and for others so until that point the

00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:35,560
ways we know how to get our article

00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:38,199
content was scraping our own site which

00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,910
is not optimal for a lot of reasons the

00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:42,310
web analytics platform which doesn't

00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:44,440
have the full content and then in our

00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:46,570
world every article is also a product

00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,220
because we can sell a print of it so it

00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:50,590
also lives in this product information

00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:55,000
system which is just a really gross

00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:56,860
place no API this kludgy UI that you

00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:02,620
could scrape but it really wasn't worth

00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:04,900
your lifetime of effort doing that so we

00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,370
had to kind of go back to basics and ask

00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,080
yourselves like what even is an article

00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:11,770
what is the purest form of the article

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:14,320
where we can like start from there and

00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:17,560
as it turns out it was XML helpful

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,850
developer helped us crack that I think a

00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,860
lot of people here are probably familiar

00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:23,080
with XML working with like government

00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:25,449
documents or whatever but essentially

00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:28,060
it's a lot like HTML you have tags that

00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:30,280
have a semantic meaning like title or

00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:33,220
author bio and then you have the schema

00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,750
document which is an x SD file which is

00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,539
like the code book for all of those

00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:39,639
entries where you might specify like the

00:05:37,539 --> 00:05:41,560
title should be a string and not a date

00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:43,599
and maybe you want to impose a character

00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,450
limit and you can spell that out and the

00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:48,700
schema document so so we figured that

00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:52,030
out and it turns out behind the scenes

00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:53,580
you know there's this XML and like it an

00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:56,139
editor will write in a text editor

00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:58,599
that'll become XML and then it goes on

00:05:56,139 --> 00:06:00,699
these parallel tracks to our print

00:05:58,599 --> 00:06:03,340
publishing platform so that becomes the

00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:08,440
magazine and then also to our content

00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:10,900
management system for the website so we

00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:13,090
figured that out those great I plan to

00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:15,010
do some cleaning and wrangling to make

00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:16,510
the data sort of tabular for each

00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:19,030
article so each article would become a

00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:22,389
row and all of these xml fields would be

00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:24,400
columns but I also started thinking sort

00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:26,410
of what is the whole data lifecycle of

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,860
our article because we're gonna want to

00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:31,090
use this sort of more downstream and so

00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:33,310
we kind of covered this content

00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:36,460
management silo on the Left again was

00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:37,870
the XML but then once the article kind

00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:40,350
of goes out into the world you know it's

00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:42,030
in print at the store on

00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:43,830
Internet there's a lot that goes on to

00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:45,300
measure it and then analyze it and

00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:48,510
there's all kinds of sort of browser

00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:52,040
data constructs like cookies involved

00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:56,850
and analysts are working with different

00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:59,220
analytics software and maybe doing stuff

00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:02,040
in our Python or Excel so that kind of

00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:03,750
balloons the format's and then the end

00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,430
goal ideally is that you know we're

00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:07,470
taking these insights and making new

00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:09,180
content or features and these things

00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:12,150
probably sit on top of the article so we

00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:13,710
never get baked in or hard-coded and the

00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:15,690
platform's were used for those kinds of

00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:16,410
features we're often serving parts of

00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:19,890
the article

00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:26,460
maybe reformulated or targeted using

00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:28,290
JSON so so we have this XML again and we

00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:30,720
nearly at this end goal of like we want

00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:32,370
to make more data-driven decisions using

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,230
more of the content than we could before

00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:36,810
and then we have to kind of bridge this

00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:38,850
gap and in another world or universe or

00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,320
another company there's more or less a

00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:43,350
straight line you could draw that's like

00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:45,060
proper data engineering but again that's

00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:46,200
not the timeline we were in so we were

00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:49,110
just trying to come up with something

00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:52,370
that was reproducible debuggable and

00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:55,800
kind of could be made widely accessible

00:07:52,370 --> 00:08:01,620
so in our world my solution was making

00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:03,090
our data package that would convert that

00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,350
did the work of turning the XML into

00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:07,080
sort of a table which people are

00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:09,360
familiar with I did a lot of like oral

00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:11,310
history ethnography to figure out what

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,140
all the fields meant and you know what

00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:17,190
was generated by a platform versus a

00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:18,810
human and what the fields meant and I

00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:20,640
built in built that into the

00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:22,290
documentation and offered a lot of

00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,660
export formats for people using

00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:26,820
different tools and then there is sort

00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:29,640
of a phase that I call social elbow

00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:32,490
grease which is socializing the data

00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:34,169
getting in front of people because if

00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:37,229
you build it they will come you have to

00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:39,110
do some stuff and in our case that stuff

00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:41,849
was having a data thon with our team and

00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:43,850
then taking that show on the road and

00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:46,740
our team calls a road show anything

00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:49,380
where we're presenting either at a

00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,750
meeting we host or we show up at other

00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:53,730
teams meetings and say look what we did

00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:56,220
and so that helped kind of get

00:08:53,730 --> 00:09:01,680
more advocacy and enthusiasm around the

00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:04,139
data so to give a sense for the scale

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,959
what we are working with we ended up

00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:08,760
with a sort of our archive I'm comparing

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,980
it here to the New York Times annotated

00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:14,970
corpus which is a common benchmark for

00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:16,649
text analysis I should say we are full

00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:19,110
archive actually goes back to the 1920s

00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:23,370
but we haven't digitized all of that so

00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:26,399
this reflects what is online mostly so

00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:29,010
generally we cover more time we have

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,290
fewer articles or articles are longer

00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:33,660
and more complete with summaries and

00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:35,699
tags and our vocabulary is a lot smaller

00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,930
than the New York Times which makes

00:09:35,699 --> 00:09:41,550
sense because we're more of a niche

00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:43,110
outlet and not covering world news at

00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:45,930
this point I had done a lot of data

00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:48,269
janitor work and I was honestly kind of

00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:49,769
exhausted and I never want to look at

00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:53,130
the data again because it took a lot of

00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:55,709
just almost detective work to figure out

00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:57,180
what was going on and that's how I knew

00:09:55,709 --> 00:10:00,779
it was time to sort of bring in the team

00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:03,029
and get some fresh eyes on it and so

00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:04,529
that brought us to our data thon which

00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:06,240
we did in a really compact format

00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:08,160
compared to what you might be used to

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,920
there's like full day for weekend

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:13,139
hackathons but ours our goal was to just

00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:16,589
dedicate more time than we usually do to

00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:19,410
sort of dig deeply into data figure out

00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:21,180
some QA and and work out any kinks that

00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,920
maybe I missed in the data cleaning step

00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:25,440
and then maybe make something

00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:28,470
interesting you know try to tackle those

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,120
questions that I showed earlier and it

00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:32,069
was great so since people could use

00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,810
whatever tools they wanted Excel Python

00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:37,649
R and in fact we have people doing all

00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:40,980
that one of the interesting products out

00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:43,319
of this format was my colleague Abby she

00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:46,260
made a shiny app that was basically

00:10:43,319 --> 00:10:48,779
Google Trends for our content so you

00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:51,839
could compare terms or engrams in the

00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:54,779
article text and/or the author bio at

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:57,510
the bottom and see how those frequencies

00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:59,610
changed over time so we got to look at

00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:01,860
fun kind of trivial things like you know

00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:04,050
the rise of looper is a brand and our

00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,830
content versus us using it as an

00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:08,560
adjective

00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:10,600
and then looking at how our contributors

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,769
changed over time in terms of how we

00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,630
describe them

00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:15,790
so here kind of looks like there's a

00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:18,490
convergence or balancing of the

00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:20,680
professor author whereas in the past we

00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:22,779
had people fewer people identifying as

00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:26,070
professors and maybe more independent

00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:29,260
authors but now that's sort of converged

00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:31,450
one of the more immediate and

00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:34,180
interesting use cases after we presented

00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:36,970
at one of our road shows Abbie's tool

00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:38,980
was really gin up a lot of excitement

00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:42,220
and someone came up to us it was a

00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:44,470
localization product manager so he was

00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:46,870
like hey I'm working on Spanish machine

00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,220
translation for our articles and I'm

00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:52,180
finding that there's some problematic

00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:55,060
titles where I have to override what the

00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:57,339
machine translation says so in in these

00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:59,829
cases it was sucking up can become kind

00:11:57,339 --> 00:12:03,610
of vulgar if he let Spanish do its thing

00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:06,160
in automatically and then the word cool

00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:09,100
can end up meaning refrigerated or

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,300
interesting in different contexts so he

00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,700
was having to override a lot of these

00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:14,529
and was just kind of catching them as he

00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,600
noticed them but with the tool like

00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:22,060
Abi's he could sort of get ahead of that

00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:25,149
and in fact cool and suck make up a real

00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:26,770
percentage of our articles and sucking I

00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:28,240
guess is maybe more prevalent some of

00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:30,430
our recent stuff although it's a little

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,850
misleading because 20/20 isn't over yet

00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:36,160
so that's not sort of a full denominator

00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:38,829
but I don't think you need me to tell

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:42,570
you that maybe sucking is on the rise

00:12:38,829 --> 00:12:42,570
this year compared to last year

00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:48,250
but what I will tell you is that what we

00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:50,560
learned is that open source tools and

00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:52,060
practices you know concepts like a

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,490
hackathon or just like committing the

00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:57,610
documentation and even the tutorials we

00:12:54,490 --> 00:13:00,310
used to you know build the package up to

00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:02,230
this point helped us sort of rescue what

00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:03,730
was almost closed data within our own

00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:05,260
enterprise

00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:10,269
you know we had these other tools at our

00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:12,100
disposal but not really and making space

00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:14,020
for people to make custom tools allowed

00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:16,570
us to bring more people to the data

00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:17,980
table and that was awesome because I

00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:19,660
think it brought people who weren't

00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:21,660
necessarily data people or

00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:23,830
wasn't a big part of their role on paper

00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:25,180
but it got them interested in able to

00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:27,460
self-service some questions that

00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:29,950
otherwise would end up in our backlog

00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:33,610
and maybe we wouldn't get to it in a

00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:35,440
useful time period for them and another

00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:37,330
thing I love about sort of being of

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,700
these are and stuff like that is that

00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:42,940
you know there are enterprise analytics

00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:44,500
tools but you know those cost money and

00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,970
there's license seats and I've noticed

00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:48,370
like some people don't even nominate

00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:49,600
themselves for access to these tools

00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,830
because they think it's like not in

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,420
their purview but if you're using

00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,950
something free that you can spin up and

00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:55,870
just send a link to and like eliminate a

00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:59,830
lot of that friction I think it opens

00:13:55,870 --> 00:14:02,170
doors for people and we found that the

00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:05,200
static immutable for onboarding and just

00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:07,930
engaging people with what your product

00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,970
or bread and butter is so for us that

00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:12,730
was articles we don't expect people to

00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:15,790
sort of read our whole archive when they

00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:17,800
start and that's not a useful way to get

00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:20,130
to know the product but like a tool like

00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:22,120
Abbie's again is a great way to sort of

00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:24,460
get a sense for how things have changed

00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:27,400
over time and I do want to acknowledge

00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:29,470
that we weren't like totally dead in the

00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:32,650
water we got this far because we had

00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:34,150
experienced our developers and helpful

00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:35,980
and excited colleagues who were able to

00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:39,640
fill in a lot of gaps in our

00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:41,230
organization sorry do want to thank

00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:45,010
those people more specifically my

00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:46,720
colleagues at HBR and also the CSV

00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:49,360
conference organizers and anyone

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,310
presenting and listening today I have an

00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,750
appendix on the slides which you can see

00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:56,200
at the link if you're interested in how

00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:58,810
we ran our data thon both in-person and

00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:01,780
remotely and some of the are links that

00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:03,880
led us here so with that I'm happy to

00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:08,080
answer any questions and thanks everyone

00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:13,330
for your time yeah thank you

00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:16,180
we had a lot of smiles and laughter and

00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:20,800
comments on your sucking is on the route

00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:25,450
this year comment it maybe the quote of

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:26,770
the conference everything seems to be

00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:30,760
sucking a little more this year it's

00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:32,940
true yeah so one question that came up

00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:35,430
in the chat was about

00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,900
so I think you said the code is closed

00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:39,390
is that right or is there a plan to open

00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:42,720
it up eventually or I could probably do

00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:44,550
something with dummy data or we have a

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,920
limited feed that's basically the same

00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:49,590
XML like you can get 10 or 100 articles

00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:51,270
a day through that feed and then I guess

00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:54,600
the process it's the rest of it could be

00:15:51,270 --> 00:16:01,950
open sourced I haven't prepared that but

00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:04,440
I can I could do that yeah it is kind of

00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:05,820
well documented elsewhere and maybe I

00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:09,660
didn't put all those links in the

00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:14,490
appendix but yeah that can the process

00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:18,090
can be open sourced yeah there was also

00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:23,190
the comment that HBR is really known for

00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:25,740
clear concise case studies and awesome

00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:29,970
you just delivered a very clear concise

00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:34,500
case study thank you I didn't even

00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:38,970
register for me very clear case study so

00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:42,050
I didn't put it in the title but uh but

00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:42,050
