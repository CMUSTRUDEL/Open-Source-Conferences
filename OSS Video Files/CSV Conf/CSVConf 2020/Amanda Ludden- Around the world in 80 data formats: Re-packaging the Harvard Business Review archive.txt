Title: Amanda Ludden- Around the world in 80 data formats: Re-packaging the Harvard Business Review archive
Publication date: 2020-05-28
Playlist: CSVConf 2020
Description: 
	We often evaluate digitally-published content using event-based metrics (clicks, conversions), persisting only snippets of the original content (headlines, tags) rather than full text. At Harvard Business Review, decades of editorial rigor have yielded an archive that's small but rich and modular relative to, e.g., breaking news sites -- and our strategies ought to reflect that. Here, I'll share outcomes and lessons from an initiative to re-package our archive text and metadata -- from XML to data.frames, .RData, CSV, XLS, and JSON -- as an internal data product for editors, analysts, product managers, and others across the organization.
