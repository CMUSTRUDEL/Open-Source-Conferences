Title: John Muyskens - Data Journalism in the Anthropocene
Publication date: 2020-05-28
Playlist: CSVConf 2020
Description: 
	From networks of thousands of ground-based sensors to constellations of satellites, a flood of data creates an increasingly clear picture of our impact on Earth. I will share my experiences as a journalist who uses data and visuals to cover climate change and other environmental issues. I will also talk about how we at The Washington Post use (and create) publicly accessible data in our journalism.
