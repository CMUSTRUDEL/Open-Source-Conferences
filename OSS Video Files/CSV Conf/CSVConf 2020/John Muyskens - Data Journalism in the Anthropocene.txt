Title: John Muyskens - Data Journalism in the Anthropocene
Publication date: 2020-05-28
Playlist: CSVConf 2020
Description: 
	From networks of thousands of ground-based sensors to constellations of satellites, a flood of data creates an increasingly clear picture of our impact on Earth. I will share my experiences as a journalist who uses data and visuals to cover climate change and other environmental issues. I will also talk about how we at The Washington Post use (and create) publicly accessible data in our journalism.

hi I'm John my skin's and I'm a

00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:09,690
journalist at the Washington Post I use

00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:13,440
data and graphics to cover climate

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:16,949
change or at least that was true up

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:22,369
until shortly after I learned that my

00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:28,680
talk was accepted to this conference

00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:31,679
just like it's been for a lot of us my

00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:35,160
life has changed a lot in the past

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:37,800
couple months I am very fortunate I

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:43,309
should say my health has been not

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:45,960
impacted I have a job that I can do well

00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:47,670
without endangering my health and that

00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,680
is a real privilege that I know a lot of

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:54,000
people and particularly lot of

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:56,250
journalists don't have right now but it

00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,870
has been all hands on deck covering

00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:06,299
Kovan 19 which has been a bit strange to

00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:07,619
jump into I a much wiser people than I

00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:10,409
have written a lot about the

00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:11,420
intersection of climate change kovat how

00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:13,530
they're similar how they're different

00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:16,860
but it felt silly not to say something

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:19,530
about this it's taking up so much of my

00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:27,689
mental space and all of our mental space

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:30,750
at the moment I think that that in some

00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:34,350
ways it's similar to covering climate

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:37,200
change covering Cova 19 as a beat has

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:42,420
been similar because it is a universal

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,470
story it impacts every era every facet

00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,549
of our lives

00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:51,570
and so almost whatever we were covering

00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:59,119
before we can say some extent how kovat

00:01:51,570 --> 00:02:02,780
19 is impacting it so I chose the

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:05,350
title for my talk before we knew that

00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:08,800
coded 19 was going to be something that

00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:13,160
impacted the entire world is a pandemic

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:16,940
but I think this word is somewhat

00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:22,150
appropriate because it reflects the

00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:25,880
extent to which humans impact our entire

00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:30,110
world it is a proposed name for an era

00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:34,190
of geological time the era in which we

00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:38,120
currently exist and it's a lens that

00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:44,930
focuses on the impact that we have as

00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:48,200
humans so I I think of I think of that

00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:50,390
relating to this idea of the beat

00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:54,349
whether that beat is climate change or

00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:59,330
Cove in nineteen it's it's a lens

00:02:54,349 --> 00:03:03,320
through which we can view everything and

00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:08,980
so I started covering climate change as

00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:13,670
my main beats in late 2018 early 2019

00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:17,920
and what that looks like is making

00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:25,730
charts that look like this both showing

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:30,260
what we are what we are doing to the

00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:32,209
atmosphere I think it's important to

00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:37,160
look at charts like this and recognize

00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:40,130
that talking about the Anthropocene does

00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:43,010
is an oversimplification it's not all

00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:46,730
humans having equal impact on the

00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:49,340
environment but places like the United

00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:52,480
States and other developed countries

00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:56,450
have a hugely disproportionate impact on

00:03:52,480 --> 00:04:01,579
the climate and making charts that show

00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:04,480
the show what the impact of that is this

00:04:01,579 --> 00:04:08,989
was a chart we did earlier this year

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,939
showing how the latest data from 2019

00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:13,930
shows the past five years for the

00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:13,930
hottest on record

00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:18,489
so I've been a data journalist longer

00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,890
than I've been covering climate I

00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:24,850
started at the Washington Post in 2015 I

00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:27,010
joined the Washington Post out of after

00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:30,520
graduating with a computer science

00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:32,710
degree fortunately CC did a great job

00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,880
explaining what data journalism is so I

00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:37,840
don't have to spend too much of my time

00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:39,460
in this talk talking about that but I

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:47,950
remember the Washington Post graphics

00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:51,840
team and we do a lot of data and visual

00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:59,350
journalism not just about climate change

00:04:51,840 --> 00:05:05,980
and so my work has been very much part

00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:07,480
of this this team so a little bit about

00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:10,990
what I do I think it's a little easier

00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:13,930
for me to describe what I do by talking

00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:16,870
about the tools that I use so I do a lot

00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:20,260
of programming that happens in the

00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:22,180
terminal having the text editors for

00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:24,820
that's for front-end web development for

00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:28,870
direct developing interactive charts I

00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:31,630
do a lot of data analysis and

00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:36,540
visualization using our studio I do some

00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:38,890
cartography with QGIS and designing

00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:46,870
putting the final polish on charts and

00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:48,450
maps using Adobe Illustrator so but what

00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:52,840
I'm here to talk to you about today is

00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:56,230
this big series of climate change

00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:59,620
stories we have done over the past 12

00:05:56,230 --> 00:06:02,770
months which we call the 2 degrees

00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:04,630
Celsius series the idea came from our

00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:07,710
climate science reporter Chris Mooney

00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:10,150
who spends a lot of his time reading

00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:14,850
scientific papers and he was seeing a

00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:18,520
lot of papers that were talking about

00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:23,980
places on earth or warming much faster

00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:25,810
than the global average and in

00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,640
we're talking about the weird things

00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:30,160
that were happening in these places

00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:35,260
things that were not necessarily getting

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:42,030
a lot of play in media things that were

00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:44,260
not generally public knowledge sorry

00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:48,430
it's okay yeah we just lost your screen

00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:52,540
share but we can still see you let me

00:06:48,430 --> 00:07:03,340
get that back see that again

00:06:52,540 --> 00:07:05,740
sorry great okay so so Chris how did I

00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:09,070
get to do a series linking all of these

00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:11,050
hotspots ago so he started talking to

00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:14,410
all the climate scientists and trying to

00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:17,800
get a comprehensive picture of where all

00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:20,350
these hotspots are taking place and the

00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:23,620
framing for this series two degrees

00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:27,700
Celsius comes from the language of the

00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:29,800
Paris climate agreement so it's so which

00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:32,320
states that the goal is to quote

00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,400
strengthen the global response to the

00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,350
threat of climate change by keeping

00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,420
global temperature rise this century

00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:40,930
well below two degrees Celsius above

00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:43,600
pre-industrial levels another UN climate

00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:45,730
report adds an important nuance to this

00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:50,070
which is that this two degrees Celsius

00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:53,380
is really a quote defense line not

00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:55,300
necessarily the edge of a cliff where if

00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:59,080
we stay on one side of it we're fine and

00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:00,700
if we go to the other side we're not we

00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:04,440
want to stay as far away from true

00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:09,250
degrees Celsius as possible but it is

00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:13,600
been adopted as a goal that global

00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:16,470
leaders have to for the for the climate

00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:19,720
in general so what do we mean by

00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:22,660
pre-industrial levels well we're talking

00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:27,760
about what the climate was like before

00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:31,900
we started before we started emitting

00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:36,250
large amounts of greenhouse gases before

00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:39,090
this idea of the Anthropocene takes

00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,090
place so

00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:47,800
so as chris was talking to these climate

00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:51,190
scientists I started realizing that a

00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,660
lot of the data they were drawing on was

00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:54,550
publicly available so I started

00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:58,180
downloading these datasets and learning

00:08:54,550 --> 00:09:02,380
how to analyze them and my goal was to

00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:06,010
figure out to better understand how we

00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:10,000
know what the temperature is around the

00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:14,079
globe today and in particular how we

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:20,350
know what it was like in quote-unquote

00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:22,420
pre-industrial times so one way to look

00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:25,230
at this is by looking at where our

00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:29,470
temperature data actually comes from and

00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:32,290
it is comes from these temperature

00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:35,649
stations so Harry Stephens and I made

00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:37,660
this map of all the temperature station

00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:40,089
records we could find the most

00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:44,199
comprehensive data set I've seen comes

00:09:40,089 --> 00:09:45,459
from Berkeley Earth and it is a it is an

00:09:44,199 --> 00:09:47,260
aggregate of a lot of different

00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:50,170
historical climate data sets but it

00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:53,760
forms basically the raw data that goes

00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:56,920
into their climate their their climate

00:09:53,760 --> 00:10:00,910
data their temperature data sets so the

00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:06,370
earliest record in this data set is from

00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:14,649
Berlin in 1701 we start seeing records

00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:16,779
from North American box and 1743 and we

00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:19,630
see some ocean observations actually

00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:21,910
come from the I codes database but these

00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:23,620
are were actually taken by Benjamin

00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:25,899
Franklin on his last transatlantic

00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:30,760
crossing he was trying to study the Gulf

00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:32,860
Stream and so over time we start seeing

00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:37,540
a lot more of these temperature stations

00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:39,910
pop up and by 1850 we start to have

00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:42,329
enough that we can create an accurate

00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:49,060
estimate of the global temperature and

00:10:42,329 --> 00:10:50,680
then over the next century or so we see

00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:54,369
a ton more

00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:57,369
still we should note that it is not at

00:10:54,369 --> 00:11:02,529
all even there's a lot of places that we

00:10:57,369 --> 00:11:04,540
could call data deserts for this and

00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:07,660
another interesting thing that we

00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:10,300
learned is that a lot of this data is

00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,800
not digitized ed Hawkins from the

00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:14,230
University of Reading told us that there

00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,449
are literally billions of observations

00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:17,920
which are still in paper form at various

00:11:16,449 --> 00:11:21,069
archives and libraries all over the

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:24,040
world this is actually an effort that we

00:11:21,069 --> 00:11:27,790
all can get involved with it's volunteer

00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:30,970
there were various crowd-sourced efforts

00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:36,550
like old weather org where you can

00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:39,689
digitize these records yourself so how

00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:43,740
do we actually get to a comprehensive

00:11:39,689 --> 00:11:49,449
look at the data well it comes in these

00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:52,470
grids formats so these temperature

00:11:49,449 --> 00:11:55,300
datasets split up the globe into these

00:11:52,470 --> 00:12:02,319
into these grids their latitude

00:11:55,300 --> 00:12:06,759
longitude based the various climate data

00:12:02,319 --> 00:12:08,379
sets that we used so this is how the

00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:12,220
various climate data sets we use compare

00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:16,540
so NOAA and NASA's data sets start in

00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:18,490
1880 and two of those we use Berkeley

00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:20,879
Earth and Counting and weigh start in

00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:23,470
1850 they have a variety of resolutions

00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:27,279
but for the contiguous United States

00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:29,550
NOAA also provides a much higher

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:40,689
resolution data sets 5 kilometer grid

00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:43,540
but it starts in 1895 the data comes in

00:12:40,689 --> 00:12:48,639
netcdf format stands for network common

00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:50,290
data formats and this format is it's

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,290
possible to work with it with open

00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:56,079
source g'd all tools and QGIS but it's

00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:58,240
little unwieldly NASA actually has a

00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:00,540
tool called panoply that lets you open

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,540
it

00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:05,980
so it makes a little bit easier free

00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:09,589
tool that makes a little easier to open

00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:12,860
and so I want to go over briefly how we

00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:16,459
actually did the data analysis so one

00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:20,240
method we you used was method rolling

00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:25,029
averages these are we've rebase lined

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:28,190
this data relative to 1880 to 1899

00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:30,680
period which we're using to represent

00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:32,660
the pre-industrial period it's not

00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:34,790
necessarily before the Industrial

00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:36,410
Revolution but it's before we cig made

00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:40,459
significant changes to the atmosphere

00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:44,740
and then we're looking at we're looking

00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:44,740
at this data in 5-year average chunks

00:13:44,829 --> 00:13:52,389
and we also looked at using a linear

00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:56,899
regression method it's it's a little

00:13:52,389 --> 00:14:01,329
more simplistic in that we know that

00:13:56,899 --> 00:14:01,329
climate change is not a linear

00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:11,209
phenomenon but we so we use this method

00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:16,279
actually in the United States the data

00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:17,779
analysis was done in our studio and I am

00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:20,350
running out of time so I won't go over

00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:25,130
my exact directory structure we use a

00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:26,870
library called raster which makes it

00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:31,069
pretty easy to work with netcdf files

00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:35,480
and do analysis on them and I used our

00:14:31,069 --> 00:14:39,380
markdown to create analysis reports that

00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:42,980
I was able to give to the other

00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:45,470
journalists who were writing the stories

00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:51,800
and that we shared with our sources to

00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:54,980
get a comment on our analysis so here's

00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:59,230
what we found we found that about when

00:14:54,980 --> 00:15:05,540
we look at the average past five years

00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:08,630
compared to 1880 to 1899 we found that

00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:10,819
approximately 10% of the globe has

00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:12,769
warmed more than 2 degrees Celsius and

00:15:10,819 --> 00:15:13,370
approximately 20% of the globe is were

00:15:12,769 --> 00:15:21,380
more than one

00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:23,600
five degrees Celsius and I'm gonna

00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,820
briefly talk about some of the stories

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:29,630
we found in the data and then I will

00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:31,070
take some questions so I think you had

00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:36,050
some time so it'd be nice to hear the

00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:38,000
stories for sure yeah okay so this was

00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:40,940
the first the first story we did looked

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,820
at the United States and it looked at in

00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:49,160
particularly some areas where winters

00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:51,260
have warmed very quickly we had this

00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:59,779
interactive feature that lets you look

00:15:51,260 --> 00:16:01,580
up your county and the designer Madison

00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:03,440
walls created this amazing tool that

00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:08,029
lets you convert temperatures from

00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:11,529
Fahrenheit to Celsius and this is this

00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:11,529
is what the piece looked like in print

00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:16,700
so for the our first story about the

00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:21,770
world

00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:27,560
I made this animation over time showing

00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:33,700
the map changing and so yeah

00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:40,970
we saw a lot of common stories happening

00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:43,550
so yeah what we found was that people

00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:47,150
are their lives are being upended all

00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:51,070
around the globe we're seeing off the

00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:57,940
coast of Uruguay and Angola fisheries

00:16:51,070 --> 00:17:00,800
changing clams dying in Qatar they're

00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:03,110
starting to actually air-conditioned the

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:07,809
outdoors to make it possible to go

00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:11,110
outside we're also seeing similarly in

00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:13,929
Alaska that oil companies are

00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:17,990
refrigerating the grounds to keep their

00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:20,540
infrastructure from sinking we're also

00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:24,740
the permafrost is buckling underneath

00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:31,160
people's houses and displacing them

00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:33,260
and we even saw this in the in the Alps

00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:38,390
this was a temperature station that we

00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:43,610
found in our global temperature station

00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:48,950
dataset and it's so it's an Austria it

00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:53,950
has been in place since the 1880s seen

00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:56,660
2.1 degrees Celsius of warming and the

00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:59,720
the mountain top it's on is actually

00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:07,190
melting so they have to put these braces

00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:08,990
in place to keep it together so when I

00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:12,410
started this talk or when I proposed

00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:16,220
this talk I thought that we were going

00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:18,860
to have published our data already but

00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:21,910
this is something that kovat 19 got in

00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:29,630
the way of so that will be coming soon

00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:34,330
sorry about that but look for that in

00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:36,830
the near future how much time do I have

00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:40,220
we are officially a couple minutes over

00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:50,210
but that's fine we can just finish up if

00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:55,790
you have any other thoughts yeah so I

00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:59,990
just other than that I wanted to thank a

00:18:55,790 --> 00:19:00,830
couple people were definitely we

00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:04,070
definitely couldn't done this project

00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:10,460
without the public data that we used so

00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:12,110
all the data that was available there

00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:15,559
was some really helpful code examples

00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:18,950
Peter auld house from BuzzFeed has a

00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:21,590
great example using our and the raster

00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:29,300
package to look at nasa's temperature

00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:30,700
data that was hugely helpful so yeah

00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:33,789
[Music]

00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:36,429
yeah me too yes

00:19:33,789 --> 00:19:39,009
there are several questions we can't

00:19:36,429 --> 00:19:40,359
take them over slack or we can maybe

00:19:39,009 --> 00:19:43,720
have one or two now it's up to you

00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:47,679
alright sure okay

00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:48,999
one is well one quick one would be when

00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,159
you do make it public where would you

00:19:48,999 --> 00:19:56,649
make that the data public is there a

00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:59,799
repository you user ID use so we we have

00:19:56,649 --> 00:20:03,850
we make a lot of our data public on

00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:05,830
github so this is one project that I

00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:09,669
worked on their fatal shooting police

00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:17,259
shootings database and so it'll be in a

00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:21,599
it'll be similar to this so so this is

00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:21,599
what we do for a lot of our art projects

00:20:22,769 --> 00:20:29,710
yeah and then another question was about

00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:31,029
the analysis so you said you use our for

00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:35,049
analysis where there are other languages

00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:39,539
that you use as well the the data in aus

00:20:35,049 --> 00:20:42,970
itself was pretty much done in in are

00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:45,729
the some of the visualization was done

00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:47,289
with JavaScript but actually working

00:20:45,729 --> 00:20:53,679
with the temperature data was all done

00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:56,440
in our mmm-hmm okay well I think we

00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,999
should probably stop there we have

00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:02,139
another session that's I think already

00:20:57,999 --> 00:21:06,759
started on the other channel so I would

00:21:02,139 --> 00:21:08,590
just want to say thank you very much we

00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:10,330
all appreciate the work you do I mean

00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:12,039
data journalism in general is hard and

00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:13,899
it's a kind of behind the scenes type

00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:16,419
thing and we appreciate you walking us

00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:21,090
through and thank you for the work that

00:21:16,419 --> 00:21:21,090
