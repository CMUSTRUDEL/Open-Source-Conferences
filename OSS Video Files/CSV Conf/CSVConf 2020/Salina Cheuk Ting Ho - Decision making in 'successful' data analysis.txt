Publication date: 2020-05-28
Playlist: CSVConf 2020
Description: 
	As the tech world continues to abstract away complexities and realities into proxy metrics, data and analysis can present itself as objective and builds a reputation of legitimacy. However, in practice there are many dynamics to data analysis that contribute to the determination of whether an analysis is ‘successful’ or not, many of which exists outside of the data itself. This is why the same regression model can be accepted as ‘successful’ in one context but not in another. Understanding the interplays between data and different factors can help analysts strategize to deliver a ‘successful’ analysis, such as applying design-thinking, storytelling, and empathy techniques. Many discussions within the data community have taken place regarding these techniques and its importance, but few have discuss the ethical impact of such techniques – what are the implications if an analysis crafted through a specific lens is ‘successful’? This talk will go through the various dynamics that contribute to a ‘successful’ analysis, and how intentional decision making at each level of these dynamics is important in data analysis.
