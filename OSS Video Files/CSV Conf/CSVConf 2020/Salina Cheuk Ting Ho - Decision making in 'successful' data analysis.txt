Title: Salina Cheuk Ting Ho - Decision making in 'successful' data analysis
Publication date: 2020-05-28
Playlist: CSVConf 2020
Description: 
	As the tech world continues to abstract away complexities and realities into proxy metrics, data and analysis can present itself as objective and builds a reputation of legitimacy. However, in practice there are many dynamics to data analysis that contribute to the determination of whether an analysis is ‘successful’ or not, many of which exists outside of the data itself. This is why the same regression model can be accepted as ‘successful’ in one context but not in another. Understanding the interplays between data and different factors can help analysts strategize to deliver a ‘successful’ analysis, such as applying design-thinking, storytelling, and empathy techniques. Many discussions within the data community have taken place regarding these techniques and its importance, but few have discuss the ethical impact of such techniques – what are the implications if an analysis crafted through a specific lens is ‘successful’? This talk will go through the various dynamics that contribute to a ‘successful’ analysis, and how intentional decision making at each level of these dynamics is important in data analysis.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,560
/ pink this is like I'm Selena

00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:07,440
and this is actually very frightening

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,599
for me because I'm an otter and I rely

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,309
on nodders Dorota talk so I will be

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,679
keeping an eye on a chat and I'm gonna

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:17,400
assume emojis or the inaud it's a

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,230
virtual conference so so here we go so

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,750
decision-making and successful data

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,480
analysis and why did I put the word

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:27,750
successful in quotation is because I

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,060
wanted to set the stone set the premise

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,920
of the talk in questioning what makes an

00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,170
analysis successful and showing that

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,239
topic a little bit more see I'm totally

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,370
seeing that emojis and I totally get

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,550
that and I'm also gonna pretend all my

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:44,090
jokes are landing so there's that part

00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:46,350
so what mixin and analysis successful

00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:48,420
and one of the things that came into

00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:52,050
mine was actually a Netflix challenge in

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:54,840
2009 Netflix awarded $1,000,000 to the

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:57,120
algorithm that had the most increase in

00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,219
the recommend Adrienne recommendation

00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,910
engine so that was actually a 10%

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:02,129
increase

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:05,159
so they award at $1,000,000 to that

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:06,750
however in production they actually

00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,659
never used it they actually used an

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,159
other algorithm that was only 8.4 3% and

00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,549
they were talking about and in their

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,630
blog post they justified that in saying

00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:18,119
it was it what the height the

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:20,369
engineering cost was too high and it

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:22,140
wasn't really worth the production to

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:24,420
put it into production for that 1.5

00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,130
percent and an other thing I want

00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,270
everyone to keep in mind for the next

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:29,490
stage of the talk is that

00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:31,229
Netflix at that time was also shifting

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,240
their business models so they were going

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:34,920
from rental to streaming which made a

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,820
difference in their decision making in

00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:41,540
terms of what what algorithm to actually

00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:44,159
put in production so on that note then

00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:45,689
what makes that successful which one was

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,420
a successful one-to-one actually put in

00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:51,090
production or the one that has the

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:54,930
actual most accuracy and the answer is

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:57,000
it depends and it depends on the

00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,320
audience it depends on who and one of

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,240
the quote I really like is from Roger

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,219
paying which is a data analysis is

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,820
successful if the audience to which it

00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:07,979
is presented a steps the results so the

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,349
core premise of this is that which it

00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:12,720
means that as the analyst or as the data

00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:13,400
create product creator we're always

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,870
doing some

00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,819
I think for an audience even if it's

00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:19,310
just for ourselves and in order for it

00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:24,500
to be consider successful we need to

00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:26,510
keep that audience in mind and bike and

00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,970
keeping and that kind of follows through

00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:30,829
what earlier this morning Angela and

00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:34,040
Catherine talked about in terms of

00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:35,810
empathy and understanding users needs

00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,540
and really understanding where the

00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:42,430
struggle is and where things are

00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:48,170
I love the emojis so keep them coming oh

00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:50,209
and and so actually there's actually a

00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:52,040
lot of great resources on how to do it

00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:54,319
these are the ones that I took

00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,780
inspiration to the slides will be shared

00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:00,620
later so don't need to take note of

00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:02,480
anything but so I'm actually not here to

00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,829
talk about the how to do it or the what

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,700
of it but I'm actually here to talk

00:03:03,829 --> 00:03:09,859
about the what-ifs the why and what that

00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,510
really means is that I'm here to talk

00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:13,069
about ethics and I want to dive that in

00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:16,310
a little bit I'm gonna try to do that in

00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:18,430
10 minutes or less because I'm not quite

00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:21,049
sure what my time is and how I'm doing

00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:24,500
but let's go into it I know I chose a

00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:26,180
meaty topic for a 20 minute talk and I

00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,190
want to ask what are the implications

00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:30,199
when we really try to design and

00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:32,299
understand a user and cater that and

00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:33,859
filter that lens so that our analysis

00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:36,349
would be successful because as analyst

00:03:33,859 --> 00:03:39,079
we do want to deliver we do want to

00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:41,209
deliver value in that way and what are

00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:42,919
the key thing is that our analytical

00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:44,720
choices throughout the data analysis

00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:46,849
process is actually being influenced by

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,500
that factor either we're doing it

00:03:46,849 --> 00:03:50,840
explicitly and we're aware of it or

00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:53,540
implicitly that we are not aware of it

00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,549
and because when we're talking about the

00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:57,500
audience and it comes to the dynamics

00:03:55,549 --> 00:03:59,000
and data analysis what we're really

00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,040
talking about is people and

00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,680
relationships we're talking about the

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,379
role your role your team's role who your

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,729
audience is is there a trust factor

00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:09,829
between you and your client or your

00:04:07,729 --> 00:04:11,479
stakeholders what kind of relationship

00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:14,030
you have of each other is there

00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:16,010
competing interests what is the culture

00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:18,169
of either your organization or even the

00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:20,269
industry you're in and when you couple

00:04:18,169 --> 00:04:23,029
of that with your internal processes

00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:25,279
that we may or may not be fully aware of

00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:26,729
such as experience or knowledge or

00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:29,189
skills

00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:30,930
our understanding of what the problem

00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:33,479
we're trying to solve and there's

00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:35,189
preference to in terms of both in

00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:38,189
techniques and skills that we're using

00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:41,219
and all these internal factors that's

00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:43,560
going on and they flow throughout this

00:04:41,219 --> 00:04:46,590
entire data analysis process in a way

00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:50,310
that actually drives and affects how we

00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:52,289
make decisions throughout this so it's

00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:55,189
actually a nice segue from the previous

00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:57,270
talk which is we wonder why

00:04:55,189 --> 00:05:00,139
reproducibility is not trivial because

00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:02,520
if the whole process is not trivial and

00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:05,430
so you have to take this really

00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,979
simplified version of the data analysis

00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:09,539
process or cycle and we go through these

00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:11,759
process where we ask these questions and

00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:16,830
we make these decisions throughout this

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:18,419
process and even though it seems that it

00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:20,520
feels like that we are just doing it

00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:22,379
data analysis we grab the data we talk

00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,349
to the people we shape it we form it

00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:27,629
these are all actually peppered with the

00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:30,650
people factor in our internal that

00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:34,740
really impacts up all throughout it and

00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:37,650
and these are influences that drives not

00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:40,379
only what we ask throughout the data

00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:42,319
analysis but how we ask what we ask and

00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:45,479
one of the things that I encourage

00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:47,819
analysts to when they're doing analysis

00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:50,939
to ask themselves to is really think

00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:53,960
about when do you stop your analysis

00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:57,120
when do you think okay I'm done and also

00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,990
why did you stop there and I think

00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,699
that's quite telling

00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:03,149
I personally pushing myself that a lot

00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:04,830
too when I do an analysis and we either

00:06:03,149 --> 00:06:07,319
do this explicitly or implicitly or

00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:09,180
either we know that we're doing it or we

00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:13,439
just don't but it's behind us seen

00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:15,210
somewhere hidden and in the end what

00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,830
what data analysis looks like it's

00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:19,139
actually a road map of our

00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:24,000
decision-making our internal processes

00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:25,860
thank you I love my visuals a couple

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,279
with our understanding of our subjective

00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:30,659
world how we understand our world and

00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:32,939
also our interactions and relationships

00:06:30,659 --> 00:06:34,979
with that and all together forms the

00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:36,639
actual data product the analysis product

00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:39,039
that we are creating

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,629
and if at this point you're wondering

00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,430
okay so what like what's the difference

00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:45,460
between me writing up a report and

00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:48,759
communicating it and the biggest ethical

00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:51,069
concern I'm proposing here is that data

00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:54,069
looks objective and it feels

00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:56,770
authoritative when it is not when in

00:06:54,069 --> 00:06:59,520
fact especially especially when we are

00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:01,990
trying to understand and develop a

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,029
analysis that really delivers value for

00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:06,039
a certain audience the more we do that

00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:08,199
the actually less objective a less

00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:10,210
objective it really is and we're

00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:13,240
actually filtering an analysis and data

00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:15,099
through a very specific lens and we take

00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,860
the subjective process when we actually

00:07:15,099 --> 00:07:19,960
create some kind of product and in the

00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,719
end it's being received and perceives as

00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:25,389
objective there is an attraction there's

00:07:22,719 --> 00:07:28,419
a natural attraction to seeing data in

00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:29,830
its abstracts being abstract away into

00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:31,569
and boiled down to simplicity because

00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:34,509
that's tangible and that's what we can

00:07:31,569 --> 00:07:36,849
measure kind of like our heart rates and

00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:38,620
you know and a Fitbit like does it

00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:41,129
really how does it really affect health

00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:43,419
is this something we're really measuring

00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:48,159
why we're why are we measuring what

00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:50,529
we're measuring and there's this quote

00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:52,419
that Philip wrote feel of a guru wrote

00:07:50,529 --> 00:07:55,029
that technology at present is covert

00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:58,750
philosophy and I want to borrow that and

00:07:55,029 --> 00:08:01,449
say that analysis is covert ideology it

00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:03,039
contains a lot of the analyst and all

00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:05,020
the people involved in terms of their

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,210
belief system their thoughts their

00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:08,860
biases that they may be to an extent

00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:13,089
there's personality too

00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:14,830
and what that means is that as the

00:08:13,089 --> 00:08:16,479
person who creates these NL is this

00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:19,029
these purse people who create these data

00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,620
products even you when you're not

00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:22,599
physically sitting at the table where

00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:25,960
decisions are being made a part of you

00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:31,539
is there in the form of data analysis

00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:33,669
and you are there and the argument that

00:08:31,539 --> 00:08:36,039
you're just an engineer I'm just

00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:38,769
crunching the numbers all these you're

00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:40,899
never really just an engineer or any of

00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:42,880
these roles you're playing because we

00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:45,160
can't separate you from your processes

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,860
and all those decisions you made

00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,960
previously are all embedded into your

00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:53,860
final product

00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:55,480
and this quote objectivity is a subjects

00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:57,910
delusion that observing can be done

00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,040
without him involving objectivity is

00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:03,490
abrogating responsibility hence his

00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:05,230
popularity when we call data even down

00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:06,670
to a data point to a flow below an

00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:11,050
analysis when we try to call it a

00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:13,390
objective or actually do it doing doing

00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:16,300
it the service because especially for

00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:18,580
those who are not familiar with data and

00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,890
not being used used to what data really

00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:22,840
means they really take that for a grain

00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:24,430
of salt and take that as granted and

00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:28,810
being like yeah that that's what the

00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:30,930
numbers are telling me and I'm not here

00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:33,730
to say that we should just stop

00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:35,860
designing I don't think so I think that

00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:38,290
there's importance and understanding and

00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:40,390
delivering value what I'm trying to

00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:42,970
advocate more is have that analytical

00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:47,110
self-awareness that we are doing it we

00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:49,720
are actively being involved in it and we

00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:51,640
shouldn't just and we shouldn't just

00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:54,180
step away and call a call it being like

00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:56,860
oh I'm just punching in the numbers and

00:09:54,180 --> 00:10:00,220
there's actually a second part to his

00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:03,520
statement which is the point is to make

00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:05,260
it openly philosophical and I also think

00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,060
that I also want to borrow this and to

00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:10,630
make the point is to make our decision

00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:12,610
process openly an actual decision

00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:13,930
process as opposed to a subconscious way

00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:15,640
we're like yeah I'm just shifting this

00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:19,900
data idea and I'm filtering those ones

00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:22,510
out and being open to that and as part

00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:24,460
of a call to action really I don't

00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:26,800
really have none I think this is a very

00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:29,980
complex problem I don't have an answer

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,870
to it and what I really wanted to do is

00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:33,340
actually start some kind of open

00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:35,470
discussion in terms of how we address

00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:37,750
this because whether we are aware of it

00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:39,490
or not we like it or not in a minute or

00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:41,980
not these are things behind the scenes

00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:44,380
that happening all around are all around

00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:47,080
in terms of our analysis and being in

00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:49,570
our data role and how do we go about in

00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:53,950
addressing that while delivering value

00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:57,310
and in this book that I read before Mike

00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:59,950
also argued that as data creator or tech

00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:01,810
creators they're the gatekeepers and

00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:04,060
there was they to an extent they're

00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:06,070
responsible to do

00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:09,940
for their products being put out to it

00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:12,630
and I as much as I enjoy the book I had

00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:16,810
a hard time with the term gatekeeper

00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:18,760
because that sentiment implies power but

00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:20,709
like that I have power over someone at

00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,720
the analyst and some kind of us versus

00:11:20,709 --> 00:11:24,790
them mentality like we're here to stop

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:28,180
that out of gate when in fact I think

00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:29,829
all the stakeholders should stay every

00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:31,750
it's a collaborative effort and it

00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:33,940
requires everyone at the table to be

00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:37,149
involved in that process so I'm not sure

00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:39,130
if gatekeeper is the best way to it's

00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:40,480
the best way to address that so what I'm

00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:43,060
trying to advocate more is

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,550
intentionality and inclusivity by

00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:47,709
intentionality I mean really being

00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:49,630
intentional and involving people to be

00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:51,160
the intentional that what we're doing is

00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:52,959
the trade off what we're doing as a

00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,910
physician when they're making every

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,470
field data point that's filter out is or

00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:59,860
there's a reason for that and document

00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:03,790
in that Stewart's a good one too yeah

00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:07,209
and inclusive pity in a sense that get

00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:09,220
as many people as you can at the table

00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:11,050
to talk about this as a check and

00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:13,089
balance with our thoughts and our

00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:14,740
processes that because everyone has a

00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:16,390
different relationship with people and

00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:19,329
their role in their world and their

00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:22,480
understanding so I really think openness

00:12:19,329 --> 00:12:24,550
and inclusivity is what what really is

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,110
going to drive that and and it's going

00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:29,680
to be challenging because the more

00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:32,860
difference there are the more we can of

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:35,770
course my dog barks now - ha ha

00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:38,079
and and and I lost track of my thought

00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:41,290
there you go

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:43,899
and what I wanted to say is and not to

00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:46,510
be super meta but but I am also

00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:49,209
influenced by so many so many wonderful

00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:51,190
people in the data community as well as

00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:53,079
my in my personal life and I would like

00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:55,209
to give him thank you a shadow for all

00:12:53,079 --> 00:12:57,130
that all of them because they clearly

00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:58,630
influenced how I was I'm thinking this

00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:03,430
problem and it's not just something out

00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:06,730
of my out of my brain and this is me

00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:12,380
feel free to ask questions here in the

00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:15,530
slack or Twitter and that is it

00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:16,640
I want to clap for myself because I

00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:24,470
heard someone say big round the clock

00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:25,940
that I'm awkward that way so oh we do

00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:29,540
have a little bit of time for questions

00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:33,260
so I'll open up the floor if anyone is

00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:37,370
keen on asking Selina any questions

00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:39,290
about her talk life in general and I

00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:40,610
kept thinking about Gabrielle's talk as

00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:42,650
I was there in Section four I really

00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:44,240
highly recommend for those who missed

00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:46,670
out on that to revisit that in the

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,410
cultural meaning of programming language

00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:50,330
because I think there's a bit of that

00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:53,150
playing you wrote in how we choose what

00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:56,240
language and how we kind of how that

00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:59,300
impacts throughout it again it's not

00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,280
like I have a clear answer for it but I

00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:03,770
do think that that's a really worthwhile

00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:11,450
topic to really bring into awareness to

00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:13,600
discuss some good feedback there thank

00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,600
