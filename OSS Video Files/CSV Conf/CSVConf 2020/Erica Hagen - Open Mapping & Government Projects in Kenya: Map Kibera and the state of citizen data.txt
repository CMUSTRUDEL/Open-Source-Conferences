Title: Erica Hagen - Open Mapping & Government Projects in Kenya: Map Kibera and the state of citizen data
Publication date: 2020-05-28
Playlist: CSVConf 2020
Description: 
	Citizens in rural Kenya are collecting data and field mapping projects they've helped to choose through a local government participatory budgeting process. This talk will share how Map Kibera and GroundTruth Initiative recently used OpenStreetMap and ODK/Kobo to give citizens the tools to collect not only locations and data on projects, but also provide their opinion and assessment of the completion status and quality. Doing this jointly with local county governments has unearthed some major data management challenges. Systems are being set up new for governments created only 10 years ago by a new constitution, and flashy tech is mixed with messy paper records, creating a difficult data environment. However, it's also an opportunity for open data and citizen involvement in transparent governance. I will get into the details of the current policy, politics, and geospatial data environment in Kenya with a focus on how citizens have been included and excluded from the process to date and how we see things moving forward.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,629
all right so this is gonna be quite

00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:11,670
different but um hopefully you'll find

00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:13,710
it also interesting another way yeah so

00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:16,650
my name is Erica Hagen I'll be talking

00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:20,010
about open mapping and government

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:25,500
projects in Kenya in the state of

00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:27,689
citizen data so this picture is a

00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,269
participatory budgeting meeting in rural

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:31,710
Kenya and so I'll be referencing that a

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:34,170
little bit later but first I'm going to

00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:38,160
give some background on what is map

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:41,850
Kabira so this is a aerial imagery

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:45,960
satellite imagery of Kibera and kuvira's

00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:47,960
a slum area in Nairobi in Kenya and the

00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,739
area you're looking at is around

00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:53,910
estimated two and a half square

00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:59,570
kilometers and also estimated quarter of

00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:59,570
a million residents so extremely tightly

00:00:59,629 --> 00:01:09,930
habited area and in 2009 it was what you

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,939
might call a blank spot on the map this

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:15,180
is OpenStreetMap so most of my work

00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:18,270
centers in some way around OpenStreetMap

00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:22,950
which is also known as wikipedia of maps

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:24,930
in case you're not familiar with it so

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,030
anyone can edit this world map and it

00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:30,509
was also a blank spot on any publicly

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:34,159
available map including the somewhat

00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:36,750
less complete early Google Maps and

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:40,650
basically anything so you just couldn't

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:43,820
find it on maps so that's when my

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:48,119
partner and I went to Nairobi and

00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:50,850
trained 13 youth that lived there to use

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:53,310
Open Street Map tool set to put Kibera

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:56,310
on the map so this is the fast-forward

00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,560
version of what is kind of a

00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,399
complication

00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,890
usually could be a whole presentation

00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:06,360
but I want to get to the part about the

00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:10,770
participating so the youth that we

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:13,630
recruited to be trained we basically

00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:14,770
didn't necessarily give them we

00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,630
know if people would be really

00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:19,030
interested in using technology to create

00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:21,310
a map and creat it on the Internet

00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:23,470
but as it turned out we did get a lot of

00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:26,980
interest especially by young people who

00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:29,850
are excited to learn anything technical

00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:33,420
really is including using a computer

00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:35,950
which they mostly did not know how to do

00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:38,020
so these are the kinds of things we

00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:40,000
mapped and that initial coverage is

00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:42,130
pretty much just whatever they felt was

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,620
important in their community to put on

00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:47,490
the map that they could kind of see no

00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:51,450
private data this is an open data source

00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:54,550
a lot of really interesting things that

00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:59,050
we would not have been able to find or

00:02:54,550 --> 00:03:01,120
notice so this kind of mapping I I love

00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:03,970
this kind of informal settlements in

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,010
general they're very they're kind of

00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,720
naturally difficult to get any data

00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:09,490
about but there's always somebody

00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:13,360
wanting to get dete about it Kabira is

00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:16,960
extremely well researched but as someone

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,970
mentioned it earlier talked I think it

00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,400
was Emily's keynote there's a lot of

00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:25,000
extractive kind of data so it's a lot of

00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:27,550
researchers coming in and taking maybe

00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,430
pretty intensive data collection and

00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:36,490
then not coming back to present any

00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:39,160
results or any data back this is a map

00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:40,840
produced zooming in a little more

00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,530
recently there's been some tracing

00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:46,690
that's what those boxes are tracing of

00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:51,640
some of the shacks but mostly we did

00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:58,690
points just to reference that then we

00:03:51,640 --> 00:04:00,910
also created a media basically a YouTube

00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:02,800
channel and a local media house let's

00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:05,470
turned into B so this was sort of

00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:08,500
citizen journalism this was also a way

00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:10,660
to bring stories more to life that were

00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:13,120
coming out from the mapping we always

00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:18,820
had this idea of I guess data journalism

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:21,250
in a way and this is just another

00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:23,770
example of what we've done locally there

00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:26,050
mostly in Kibera is map a lot of schools

00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:27,430
we have this open schools Kenya project

00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:30,220
that's been ongoing for

00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:31,889
a few years now and a few different

00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:34,810
informal settlements mapping

00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:37,509
particularly these small what you might

00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:39,970
call informal schools or alternative

00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:42,660
schools non-governmental schools lots of

00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:45,370
data about that what each school offers

00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:47,470
and this is done in collaboration with

00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:49,090
the schools this is the kind of school I

00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:52,509
mean having made they have a wide

00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:56,590
variety of appearance but there's many

00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:59,500
of them and we always focus on giving

00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:01,870
data back so kind of right to

00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,610
information I would say so this is a

00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:06,340
teacher on the Left receiving a print

00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:09,160
map of that schools data collection

00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:12,910
which she took part in and this is Lucy

00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:14,620
one of our team on the Rights who was

00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:19,539
one of our original 13 actually and

00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:22,150
still works for the organization so but

00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:24,509
what about place like this so we worked

00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:26,620
a lot in urban areas where things like I

00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:29,110
mean it mobile phones were not

00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,970
necessarily ubiquitous it at first but

00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:33,039
over time they have become so and the

00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:35,169
Internet has become more easily accessed

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:39,099
on such phones there's a lot of

00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:42,220
awareness of what technology can do if

00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:46,870
not a lot of access to education about

00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:49,810
it but awareness and we were asked to

00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:54,120
work on mapping in some rural areas of

00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:57,009
Kenya recently and the reason was that

00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:00,070
first of all there had been 47 counties

00:05:57,009 --> 00:06:01,599
created I think it was 2010 when the new

00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:05,919
constitution was passed to kind of

00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:08,080
devolve governance to local authorities

00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:11,110
in Kenya so they created these new kind

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,970
of entities counties which were given a

00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:15,520
lot of power which previously had been

00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:18,610
very centralized in the national

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,590
government especially budgets so the

00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:22,720
World Bank had started working with some

00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:25,449
pilot counties around five I think at

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,509
the time to train those County officials

00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:33,130
to do participatory budgeting this was

00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:35,320
very experimental as well and so this is

00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:37,539
for example a meeting you know sitting

00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:41,180
in the village or in the countryside

00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:42,949
near your village discussing the budget

00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:46,550
he's like what do you want that County

00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:50,240
budget to be spent on which is kind of

00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:52,400
an amazing an ambitious thing to do and

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,100
then passing those priorities up so that

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,030
had been going on and projects had been

00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:58,970
created but they had not necessarily

00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:00,770
been documented and definitely hadn't

00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:03,139
been mapped so we were called in to try

00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:05,600
to do some kind of data gathering or

00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:07,789
create some kind of map because it was

00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,350
found that during those meetings people

00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:10,639
would be kind of maybe drawing on the

00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:13,880
ground or trying to figure out what was

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:19,009
where and there was just not this she

00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:21,949
was spatial data so we did we used Cobo

00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:23,930
this is Cobo toolbox to create which is

00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:29,509
basically a way to interface with open

00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:32,360
data kit and that was our mechanism to

00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:35,990
create this kind of extensive survey of

00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:38,060
the projects that have been budgeted for

00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:40,789
example on the right on the left is a

00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:44,030
school then on the right is a water

00:07:40,789 --> 00:07:46,220
point on the bottom is a boda boda shed

00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:50,870
it's just a cover for that place where

00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:52,820
they would provide motorcycle taxis and

00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,680
in the beginning so our approach is

00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:59,650
always to involve citizens India

00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:03,770
together and both the gathering the

00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:04,280
editing the deciding what to do with the

00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:06,530
data

00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:10,659
you know like making use of it that

00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:10,659
whole kind of process but in this case

00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:17,750
yeah in this case we were we were let's

00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:20,449
see we started with some government

00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:22,430
officials who were used to the projects

00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:23,930
being primarily for them and with them

00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:26,030
and they weren't really sure how to do

00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:28,130
this kind of citizen like what were we

00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:30,889
gonna do with the citizens or how are we

00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:32,810
gonna work with them if they were young

00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:35,659
people they needed transportation

00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:37,070
there's always costs involved so in the

00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:39,289
beginning we ended up with some

00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:41,209
government folks trying sort of trying

00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:43,099
to do the mapping with their with their

00:08:41,209 --> 00:08:44,450
phones and with the app themselves and

00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:46,130
they were wading through the river there

00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:48,620
trying to access these projects so the

00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:50,839
projects are extremly spread out hard to

00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:53,720
access but you know we need to visit

00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:54,750
every single project so I think after

00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,280
this they

00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:59,370
came more open to the practicalities of

00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:01,680
working with communities directly and

00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:03,770
with youth in in those communities the

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,200
way that Matt camara was kind of our

00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:09,270
approach this is also them doing some

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,520
editing so they also edit the data into

00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:16,080
OpenStreetMap after collecting it in

00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:21,030
Kobo so we got a little more progress

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:24,690
towards you know having local youth do a

00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:28,140
lot of the mapping at that point so this

00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:33,030
is in a place called West Cocotte it's

00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:36,600
very remote or it's very far from from

00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:39,780
Nairobi and some of these young people

00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:44,490
using the phones to start to gather that

00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:47,010
data so it wasn't just about mapping

00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:47,880
okay this is your five-minute warning

00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:49,890
okay

00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,840
this it wasn't just about mapping the

00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:54,960
locations of the projects but also

00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:56,640
gathering feedback so because they

00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:00,450
wanted like a photo of the project or we

00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:02,430
were able to put that up there was an

00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:05,790
opportunity for there to be a comment on

00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:08,940
the quality and the progress status so

00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:10,620
the that youth mapper living in the same

00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:13,380
ward with the project would be able to

00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:17,010
actually put a comment as to how it was

00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:19,050
going so for example here's a few of the

00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:22,470
projects I have one over here that was

00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:23,790
observed excellent poor poor just to

00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:26,400
give you some examples most of them were

00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:29,010
adequate or excellent some were

00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,839
completed some were not and then here we

00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:35,250
actually also got access to the budget

00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:37,589
so this is a I mean Kenya signs on so a

00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:39,480
lot of open government data principals

00:10:37,589 --> 00:10:41,370
it's not necessarily easy to get that

00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,620
but including open budgets things like

00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:45,780
that so some counties would were

00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:48,330
actually forthcoming just this this one

00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:51,870
of the three that we worked with and so

00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:54,060
we produced kind of a website here to

00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:56,040
show with all of the projects but we're

00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:58,050
also always about like how do we get to

00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:01,230
these people that don't go on the

00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:04,600
internet we like to paint maps on walls

00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:06,460
this is actually the whole print map

00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,140
meet the permettez next I think yeah

00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:10,420
this is the print map that we designed

00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:13,000
based on that data and we actually had

00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,740
somebody paint it each one on different

00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,080
walls in those locations they could see

00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:21,130
like where they're essentially where

00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:23,020
their government tax money is going in

00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:26,590
their actual community or where it's

00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:28,180
supposed to be going and here's a PB

00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:30,370
meeting where they were using that

00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:31,950
printed map to kind of identify like

00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:34,810
what's been done it's kind of catch up

00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:36,520
so basically like a community M&E system

00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:40,030
almost this is a more urban

00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:41,800
participatory budgeting meeting um so

00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:43,360
just really quick so a lot of challenges

00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,750
come up when working with governments

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,910
and EDA data literacy technical literacy

00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:50,680
geo data in particular in these counties

00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:53,310
is seen as kind of a separate thing and

00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:56,290
they were starting up all these GIS labs

00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:58,270
but separate from saying I meani office

00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:01,750
so these two things needed to be

00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:03,400
connected but so the way that data was

00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:06,760
conceptualized is what we were kind of

00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:09,130
trying to have some influence over more

00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:12,220
integration there's a lot of competition

00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:14,740
to fun different things in each county

00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:16,510
so the different ministry is within each

00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:19,720
county might be pulled in different

00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:23,170
directions by projects that should be

00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,760
coordinated and citizens being not

00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:26,530
really part of the government and

00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,730
citizens are really seen as distinct you

00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:29,890
know civil society is this other thing

00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:32,140
so there's not really procurement

00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:33,910
structures even to bring in like if they

00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:36,250
need to have a stipend like a young

00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:39,450
person in the rural area doing all day

00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:41,860
traipsing around gathering this data um

00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:43,450
you know paying for their own food and

00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:46,870
transport they really can't even afford

00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:48,490
that so and also while we were working

00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:49,840
there was budget crisis so the counties

00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:52,570
weren't really receiving the money from

00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:55,420
central government so there's a lot of

00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:59,320
ins and outs of how we ended up having

00:12:55,420 --> 00:13:01,480
to work with different departments and

00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:04,080
different kinds of datasets that we were

00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:07,270
provided and cleaning it all up kind of

00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:08,620
which I would would like to get into I

00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:11,860
don't know if I really have any more

00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:14,380
time or early on questions period or

00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:16,760
should I talk a little more to talk a

00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:18,880
little more we have five minutes left

00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:22,160
there are no questions at the moment so

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,900
what please chime in with a question and

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,440
meanwhile I'll just say a little more

00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:28,670
about that

00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:30,710
so essentially like you know getting I

00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:35,210
guess many of you might have worked with

00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:37,100
government data but in rural Kenya the

00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:38,720
government data it might be you know

00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,160
somebody might have a spreadsheet but

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,560
somebody else might have a paper list

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:46,040
and it's like you know you're trying to

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,870
kind of match what the finance

00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,310
department is giving you these are the

00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:51,620
projects that were budgeted in the

00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:52,760
participatory budgeting but then each

00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,080
department is responsible for

00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:57,610
implementing so be like the health

00:13:54,080 --> 00:14:00,310
department or the school's department or

00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:03,460
lands it's kind of Planning Department

00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:05,780
infrastructure projects so it's very

00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:09,980
hard to kind of harmonize I mean there's

00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:11,630
a need to harmonize all of that can you

00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:13,870
please say how the Geo data's looked at

00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:16,130
a separate okay so that's a question

00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:18,500
well well we were there there was this

00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:21,200
kind of idea that GIS labs were

00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:23,540
important and it was kind of coming down

00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:26,540
from national government policies and

00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:29,900
then funders will come in like UN type

00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:32,000
funders international aid organizations

00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,930
so once so we showed up at one County

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,640
meeting and suddenly there was like a

00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:37,220
sign on the door that was like GIS lab

00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,090
they're like oh okay we didn't know this

00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:40,970
was happening

00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:44,750
so it's like but they were already and

00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:47,150
many officers and sort of theta that was

00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:49,940
non gia referenced in that government

00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:52,130
office so then they kind of bring in you

00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:54,050
know they basically a GIS lab to them

00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:57,020
consists of several computers and maybe

00:14:54,050 --> 00:15:00,830
a really big printer that no one knows

00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:03,080
how to use and people that you know a

00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:06,230
couple of young very young kind of fresh

00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:09,400
graduates that had studied GIS but not

00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:12,440
really studied much more than GIS so

00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:15,340
that's that was kind of like then how

00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:18,590
does that integrate with these existing

00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:21,320
data concepts you know it's kind of like

00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:23,780
maps would be seen as like well we just

00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:27,010
need to make a map not as like a type of

00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:31,580
data that happens to have coordinates

00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:33,440
associated to it how does the community

00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:36,830
feel about having their data out in the

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:43,160
open this is an interesting oh so I saw

00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:44,960
your talk so in Kibera we found we were

00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,610
asked that a lot in the beginning but

00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:49,279
people that we were working with

00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:52,010
primarily these youth and organizations

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:55,370
maybe that were our partners they were

00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:58,300
really keen on having visibility so we

00:15:55,370 --> 00:16:01,490
kind of worked from a model of like

00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:03,589
visibility being a way towards power as

00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:04,700
opposed to maybe what it looks like in

00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:06,440
the Amazon so it's an interesting

00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:11,540
contrast because already being in the

00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:13,550
center of Nairobi you are kind of

00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:15,279
visible but invisible I don't know if

00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:19,130
that makes sense but you're just not

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:22,210
prominently there's no sort of power to

00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:25,190
being off the map in a place that's very

00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:27,950
like it's the central hub of economy so

00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:30,620
not being there to people that that we

00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:32,390
worked with and to pretty much haven't

00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:35,870
got a lot of pushback on this from

00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:39,010
anyone in Kibera it was more of them

00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:41,870
like who's actually telling our story so

00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:45,620
there's pushback to people that come to

00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:47,540
the informal settlements with you know a

00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:50,300
desire to like a lot of photography

00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:51,710
things filming people don't like

00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,780
outsiders coming in doing photography

00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:59,510
and filming there's an idea that people

00:16:53,780 --> 00:17:01,910
can come in and like use people for

00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:04,250
their own benefit somehow and sort of

00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:06,560
take from people but having but being

00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:09,290
present on kind of a map that has been

00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:11,360
created locally or having video on

00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:15,230
YouTube that's been created locally so

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:16,670
it has that legitimacy from like okay

00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:19,339
we're from here and we're creating it

00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:22,910
that has been more of an empower

00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:24,500
empowering thing for people I are at

00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:26,540
least that's the feedback that I've had

00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,330
that's interesting for me to sort of

00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:32,690
flip that around to think about the the

00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:36,290
power that can be in you know keeping

00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:38,690
data private of course we're not working

00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:41,090
we've never done household that

00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:42,830
thing so it's a little bit different

00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:46,460
than some other exercises that might

00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:51,440
happen but yeah happy to talk about that

00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:53,330
war Erica thank you you thank you so

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,549
much but talk it was really interesting

00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:57,379
and a lot of things that felt very

00:17:55,549 --> 00:17:59,330
familiar to to work that I've done as

00:17:57,379 --> 00:18:02,539
well I thought it was like really

00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:05,000
interesting really valuable um we need

00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:06,500
to move on but I think Rita would like

00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,529
to continue the conversation in slack

00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:12,169
and also Lori McNeil has a question

00:18:09,529 --> 00:18:14,929
which will sir will make sure is copied

00:18:12,169 --> 00:18:19,960
and will go up in the Q&A channel in

00:18:14,929 --> 00:18:19,960
slack so thank you very much everybody

00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:24,549
