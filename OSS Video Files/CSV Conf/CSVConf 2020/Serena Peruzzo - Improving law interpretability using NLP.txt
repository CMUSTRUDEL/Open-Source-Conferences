Title: Serena Peruzzo - Improving law interpretability using NLP
Publication date: 2020-05-28
Playlist: CSVConf 2020
Description: 
	Laws define how people may or may not behave in society, but are often hard to interpret and inaccessible to the public. Data Scientists from Bardess, in collaboration with a research group from the Government of Ontario, have investigated how NLP can be applied to understand linguistic patterns in legislative texts and extract information that is meaningful for the public. The methodology developed provides us with a framework for representing legal texts that can be used to simplify the way information in the law is accessed and, at the same time, inform legislators on how to write more clear and accessible legislation by highlighting parts of the law that are particularly hard to interpret.
