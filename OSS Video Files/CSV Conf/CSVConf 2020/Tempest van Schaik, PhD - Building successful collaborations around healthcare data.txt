Title: Tempest van Schaik, PhD - Building successful collaborations around healthcare data
Publication date: 2020-05-28
Playlist: CSVConf 2020
Description: 
	Besides a few high-profile machine learning for health breakthroughs, what is the state of real-word data science for health, and why do so few algorithms make it into production? We’ll explore the rich variety of health data that exists, how to avoid common pitfalls with it, ways to make the most positive impact with health data, and the culture of different stakeholders who work with data. We’ll consider this topic with reference to Project Fizzyo, which aims to improve the lives of children with cystic fibrosis, using data from custom respiratory devices which are used during physiotherapy.
