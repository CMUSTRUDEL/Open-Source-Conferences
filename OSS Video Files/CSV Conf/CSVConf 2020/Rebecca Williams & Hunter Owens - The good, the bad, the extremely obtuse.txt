Title: Rebecca Williams & Hunter Owens - The good, the bad, the extremely obtuse
Publication date: 2020-05-28
Playlist: CSVConf 2020
Description: 
	A survey of government (open) data regulations and how to successfully build accountability programs in government

You've heard of GDPR, but are you aware of how recent legislation by Congress and California may affect your beat? This session will bring together two experts in government data management to discuss the impacts of recent  legislation, including: the Foundations for Evidence-based Policymaking Act, the Geospatial Data Act, the Grant Reporting Efficiency and Agreements Transparency Act, and the California Consumer Privacy Law. They will discuss how this legislation affects access to data, tracking down data, formats of data, and other nuances of the governmental data making process. They may also speculate wildly on how future legislation could impact government data management.

all right can everybody see it looks

00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:08,550
like it yes go ahead and get started

00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,759
there you go perfect

00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:14,160
yep all right hello everybody I am

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,730
hunter Owens one of our two to Co

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,500
presenters today I currently work for

00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:22,230
the city of Los Angeles is a programmer

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:25,289
analyst for which is a very bureaucratic

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,910
way of saying I helped an technical lead

00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:30,359
for the citywide data science and

00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:33,239
predictive analytics team hi everyone

00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,770
I'm the other part of this double axe my

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:36,840
name is Rebecca Williams I currently

00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,300
work for the White House Office of

00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,059
Management and Budget in the office of

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:50,760
the chief information officer as a

00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:53,370
policy analyst alright so just talk the

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,530
good the bad the extremely obtuse a

00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,570
survey of government open data

00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,039
regulations and how to successfully

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,550
build accountability of programs in

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,170
government so we're gonna start with a

00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,280
little bit of a double act here where

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,380
we're going to go through some of these

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,490
open data policies and hacks that we

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,460
have been involved in the implementation

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:14,159
with are intimately familiar with and

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:17,880
sort of give you the theory and the

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,530
practice so Rebecca do you want to pitch

00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,320
the foundations for evidence-based

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,330
policymaking Act Hunter I would love to

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,729
the foundations for evidence-based

00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:29,009
policymaking Act is basically three laws

00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:32,610
in one that solve all of our federal

00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:35,130
data problems the first title goes over

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:37,920
using evidence and evaluation practices

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:41,700
at scale in government the second title

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,530
codifies the open data policy of 2013

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,009
and the third title adds a little bit

00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:49,850
more teeth to the Sipsey program

00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:52,170
allowing a little or six year program

00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:55,350
confidential information and statistical

00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,969
efficiency Act which was originally

00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:59,820
introduced in the e-government Act of

00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:01,860
2002 but let's not get into that but it

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,610
adds more to it including a presumption

00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,689
of accessibility so in theory

00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:10,349
statistical units can start accessing

00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:11,450
other government data in in silos more

00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:13,040
efficiently and easily

00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:15,860
and very securely extremely

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,769
confidentially and secure for the best

00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:20,180
statistical insights it also adds chief

00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:23,450
data officer and chief data officer

00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:25,760
counsel it adds evaluation officer

00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:27,830
statistical officials it adds like a

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:33,980
whole suite of folks to do the work and

00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:40,879
a lot of science and evidence-based open

00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:42,709
access space sounds great but you're

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,769
evaluating things in an inherently

00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:47,900
political environment what's good what's

00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:50,780
bad depends on who the political actors

00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:52,430
obviously also didn't you promise me the

00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:54,440
last time you passed a bill that all the

00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:56,989
data would be open isn't it supposed to

00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,849
be open now and like you have all these

00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:00,709
chief data officer x' but like are they

00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:01,910
funded do they have power do they have

00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:06,370
authority to go into their different

00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:11,660
agencies and get various data sets I'm a

00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:14,209
little concerned Rebecca hmm tell me

00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:15,440
well let me pitch a local government

00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:18,260
example where we're doing real

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:21,170
innovation work executive director 3

00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:23,720
tells every city department to do three

00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:26,799
things open all the data in a

00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:30,889
machine-readable format and appoint a

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:33,410
open data coordinator to push data out

00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:35,709
to a centralized data repository in the

00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:35,709
city

00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:48,940
Rebecca Loos I lost my double act

00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:04,220
did we lose your audio Rebecca oh yeah

00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:14,660
we lost her audio maybe she turns up her

00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:16,400
video we can get back in just sent her a

00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:18,140
message all right this is always fun

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,959
this is gonna be much better in person

00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:26,990
as you can see yeah I'm just getting

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:29,270
into it you two are on a roll yeah and I

00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:32,690
really shouldn't say anything about so

00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:35,660
I'm gonna kind of pause here momentarily

00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:37,310
but kind of go into Rebecca is trying to

00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:40,669
get back but going into executive

00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:42,560
director three and sort of where it

00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:46,610
stands it's very similar most cities

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:49,669
have an executive directory an executive

00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:52,100
directive or a open data policy that

00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:55,070
they've passed like this that basically

00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:57,370
says open up the city's data put it on a

00:04:55,070 --> 00:05:00,890
data portal and make it machine readable

00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:02,479
but they're pretty sparse I we have the

00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:07,610
presentation in the community and I will

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:10,550
post the link to post the link to it in

00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:14,320
the chat so you can actually read it but

00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:21,919
it's actually only about a page deep and

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:25,430
in practice we have somehow we have

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:27,320
somehow ended up with three open data

00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:28,820
portals with differing amounts of data

00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,680
quality and there's really nothing about

00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:32,780
how to update the data how to keep it at

00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,970
standardize and what data qualifies as

00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,979
open or not and how it intercepts with

00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:42,710
the California Public Records Act which

00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:44,780
is our local Oya type law all right so

00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:49,010
that's executive directive three in

00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:51,830
practice we're gonna get Rebecca back at

00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:54,409
some point I hope so yeah just race I

00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:56,090
just read by today on to the screen so

00:05:54,409 --> 00:06:02,150
she should be a Tony because I

00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:05,330
shortly so get ready to jump back in

00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:05,900
yeah jumping with the data act yeah I'm

00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:09,979
ready

00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:12,470
sorry no problem alright I went full

00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:15,919
Jekyll and Hyde on my own open data

00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:17,750
policy and got to tell everybody about

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:21,350
how we have three open data portals for

00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:23,360
one city sure so data Act data Act in

00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:26,120
theory data Act was the first open data

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:30,530
law ever passed in the United States it

00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:32,600
is going to revolutionize how we follow

00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:34,550
the money for federal spending you can

00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,380
start seeing exactly how tax dollars are

00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:42,200
spent where it goes and what the

00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:47,660
consequences of that that spending okay

00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:49,220
so wait what's the unit of spending like

00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:50,510
every dollar has to get to accounting

00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:53,690
forward you've like the entire economy

00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:55,699
in this thing don't you have all these

00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:58,550
like crazy sub contracts in the federal

00:06:55,699 --> 00:07:01,010
government and like you're only

00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:03,169
capturing one step of where spending is

00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:07,910
going I really like the focus on one

00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:09,979
particular program but and like I data

00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:12,229
set but like it seems like you're only

00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:18,250
really scratching the surface of federal

00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:20,840
spending alright let me take you this so

00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:22,220
we did open data at a local level a

00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,440
bunch of different jurisdictions partner

00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:25,700
publishing data but when really we need

00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,220
to think about it as a state wide

00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:32,419
enterprise like an enterprise assets

00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:33,830
catalog so SB 272 passed about four

00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:37,550
sessions ago at the state legislative

00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:38,660
level by Bob Hertzberg mandates that as

00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:41,120
part of the California Public Records

00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:43,280
Act every jurisdiction in California

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,650
from the state of California and on to

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,470
the multi Miguel water district has to

00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:50,419
maintain Enterprise Asset Systems

00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:55,310
catalog of every single thing that

00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:57,440
completes collects data on our residents

00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:59,960
all your enterprise systems who the

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,690
vendor is for it and publish it and make

00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,700
it available through the CPRA process so

00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:09,349
let me tell you this catalog give us all

00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:09,830
all of our data problems did it the aclu

00:08:09,349 --> 00:08:12,590
and a

00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:15,290
to ngos get together to try to find all

00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:16,370
the missing inventories because no one

00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:17,930
there were all these missing

00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:20,660
jurisdictions that never did the

00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:22,010
inventory activity and what it does

00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:24,980
anyone use these inventories for

00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:28,130
anything the ones that we're done I mean

00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:29,270
we kind of just publish them but you

00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:32,900
know I guess they're supposed to be part

00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:40,190
of enterprise governance but okay

00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:44,180
all right okay um okay here's another

00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:47,390
specific one geospatial data act think

00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:49,490
of all of the waste that is going on

00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:51,530
when we are recreating maps in the

00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:53,510
federal government there's all these GIS

00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:54,800
coordinates different agencies are

00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:57,260
collecting them they're making the same

00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:00,080
map in different ways the geospatial

00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:01,460
data act is going to reduce all that

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,500
duplication and it's going to

00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:05,000
standardize geospatial data across the

00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,430
federal governments you'll save money

00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,010
we'll have more accurate and

00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:15,200
standardized map information it's

00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:19,160
perfect all right all right like what's

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:21,260
so special about spatial data like did

00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,910
you even include a natural national

00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,410
address database in there and who's

00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,940
responsible for it and the governing

00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:29,330
agency and how everybody's supposed to

00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:30,860
use it didn't even specify specific data

00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:34,760
sets that might be crucial for this like

00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:36,740
flood zones seems overly broad still all

00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,980
right let me tell you about how we're

00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:42,350
solving problems for our constituents

00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:45,920
California consumer Privacy Act tells

00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:48,500
you three simple things one consumers

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,480
own the data that they create to they

00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,220
can see what data is collected by them

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,070
by requesting it of any company of a

00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:58,930
certain size and three we have opt-in

00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:58,930
prohibitions against the sale of data

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,480
that sounds good

00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:07,100
why are we amending it already and how

00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:10,730
people are having a hard time bringing

00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:12,290
suit under under it like the first class

00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:14,090
action just happened like how this is

00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:19,070
actually improving people's everyday

00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:23,510
privacy in California all right so that

00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:25,519
was our survey and we kind of want it to

00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:27,290
this around the question of how do you

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,550
successfully build accountability

00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:30,050
programs in government like there's been

00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:32,660
this promise that open data will bring

00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:34,579
accountability and hopefully through the

00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:42,230
survey you can see that the answer to

00:10:34,579 --> 00:10:44,029
that question is a big maybe so a thing

00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:46,850
I say a lot and I think we're ready says

00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:49,699
a lot is a good open data policy is not

00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:53,480
about data by simply opening up the data

00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:56,449
you will not achieve better outcomes so

00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,940
if for sort of things in a checklist on

00:10:56,449 --> 00:11:00,560
how to finish up an open data policy so

00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:04,760
the first thing you need to start with

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,899
is values what are your principles what

00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,519
are your leadership what is your buy-in

00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:09,380
what is the culture and what is the

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,199
political driver of the situation like

00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:15,889
do not start open data is not inherently

00:11:12,199 --> 00:11:17,510
neutral policy is a paper and these

00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:19,070
values need to figure out what

00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:21,680
operations and funding can be allocated

00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:23,839
what is the accountability problem and

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:27,649
what constituency is this policies

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:31,459
values going to serve as they always as

00:11:27,649 --> 00:11:33,649
to pull a tweet from Forest Greg it's

00:11:31,459 --> 00:11:35,240
curious that easily accessible

00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:38,089
government data it never quite has the

00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:39,920
information that you want so without a

00:11:38,089 --> 00:11:46,699
set of values and a theory of change

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:50,000
your policy will inherently fit yeah so

00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:51,980
not only do you need the values built-in

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,110
have people to actually want to do it

00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:56,720
but you need to and be able to

00:11:54,110 --> 00:12:00,920
operationalize it so this fundamentally

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:02,660
becomes a problem with where legislators

00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:07,250
don't connect with folks on the ground

00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:09,740
doing the work and also is a problem due

00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:12,680
to legislative technical in expertise

00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:16,160
but essentially a lot of these these fix

00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:19,190
all the data laws are incredibly hard to

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:21,860
operationalize in reality so one of the

00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:24,019
the ways that we've seen things be

00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:26,810
easier to operationalize is if the scope

00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:31,130
is reduced hunter can you can you do the

00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:32,990
next slide yes this is this is the open

00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:35,120
data aesthetic this is if you actually

00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:36,510
want something to work these are two

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,770
examples the

00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:39,540
hand side is from data act

00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:44,610
implementation and the right hand side

00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:46,230
is from a USAID agency specific open

00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:48,650
data policy where they built it into

00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:52,080
their procurement and data management

00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:53,940
items but basically saying do everything

00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,850
to all data sounds nice but if it's not

00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:59,400
built in to how you actually manage

00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:01,230
things it's incredibly difficult to do

00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,030
and if you scope something at all

00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:08,820
spatial information it's incredibly

00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:11,460
difficult to do all right then you need

00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:13,410
an actual use case you need to find a

00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:17,040
constituency constituents or

00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:20,700
efficiencies and levers of power in

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:22,860
which you will achieve the outcomes that

00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,900
you want and remember your policy should

00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:27,420
always be tied to outcomes rather than

00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:29,400
specific data sets a good example of

00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:33,110
this from California is the open and

00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:36,330
transparent Water Act a B 1755

00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:39,240
California as you may know suffering

00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:41,100
from a drought for many years although

00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,400
last year we finally left her out but

00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:46,470
this bill dates back it turns out we had

00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:51,450
no idea where the water was going in

00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:54,150
California so a B 1755 sets up a council

00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:57,090
of stakeholders to make sure that every

00:13:54,150 --> 00:14:00,510
ounce of water is tracked at the water

00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:02,280
aggregator level and is they had to

00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:03,900
agree upon a data standard for all of

00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:07,500
them to report their data into this is

00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:09,570
similar to the USA spending data act and

00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:16,170
then they set up a series of challenges

00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:19,470
to identify individuals and team base to

00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:22,020
figure out where all of our water is

00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:25,110
going and identify what solutions might

00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:27,600
be possible part of the publication of

00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:30,200
this data led to significant changes in

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:33,540
the state's water policy and localities

00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:35,520
it turns out Sacramento was using way

00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:38,510
more water than almost any other city in

00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:40,590
the almost any city in the state

00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:43,590
unsurprisingly that was because a lot of

00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:45,060
there a lot of residents in Sacramento

00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:47,280
did not have to have a water meter they

00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:49,650
paid a flat fee so when we standardize

00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,560
the data and we're able to compare how

00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,999
much

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,430
water is being used as part of this

00:14:51,999 --> 00:14:56,290
water data challenge which is truly

00:14:54,430 --> 00:15:01,899
another piece of government innovation

00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:04,060
aesthetics we were able to you saw

00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:06,389
actually changes at the water agency

00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:09,189
level Sacramento County Water Agency

00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:12,129
reflected by this state law so it had a

00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:14,649
really clean story of this data will be

00:15:12,129 --> 00:15:19,209
opened up standardized and they then

00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:21,339
analyzed to change how the state uses a

00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:23,559
very specific and precious resource for

00:15:21,339 --> 00:15:25,149
us which is water and a keep thing I

00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:27,009
want to for those of you who were ever

00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:30,519
enter government from a private sector

00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:32,920
context efficiency is not an inherent

00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:35,439
value of government in any private

00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,999
sector organization being more efficient

00:15:35,439 --> 00:15:39,639
means you make more money that does not

00:15:36,999 --> 00:15:41,170
necessarily act as a lever for change in

00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:45,579
government like the way you'd expect it

00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:47,829
to all right the last thing you need to

00:15:45,579 --> 00:15:50,829
make sure that any of these policies

00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:52,779
work you have values you have operations

00:15:50,829 --> 00:15:55,629
you have use cases the last thing is

00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:59,019
checks and balances so various oversight

00:15:55,629 --> 00:16:01,480
mechanisms monitoring the games our

00:15:59,019 --> 00:16:03,819
return on investment if you want to be

00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,769
economic about it and also having

00:16:03,819 --> 00:16:08,350
adjudication processes if there's some

00:16:05,769 --> 00:16:09,819
conflict where it could go where the

00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:13,649
other you need to have a next step on

00:16:09,819 --> 00:16:13,649
that so next slide hunter

00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:18,879
thanks um so in terms of various

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:22,089
oversight mechanisms the more the better

00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:24,519
and the more flavors the better so some

00:16:22,089 --> 00:16:26,079
examples would be you can have NGOs like

00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:27,670
the sunlight foundation used to follow

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,649
up on the open data policy for the

00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:32,379
federal government you can have

00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:35,679
government oversight mechanisms like Gao

00:16:32,379 --> 00:16:38,439
or inspectors general I you can have

00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:40,779
adjudication processes like the CC PA

00:16:38,439 --> 00:16:43,000
has or like Privacy Act and FOIA where

00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:45,279
you follow up and some a judge actually

00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:49,420
says yes you could have that you cannot

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:52,209
have that and on top of sort of these

00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:54,730
these folks measuring from the outside

00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:57,189
making sure that government itself is

00:16:54,730 --> 00:17:00,040
showing dashboards government loves

00:16:57,189 --> 00:17:02,649
dashboards showing progress making sure

00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,850
that someone is following up something

00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:04,899
that I've seen in the federal space a

00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:07,360
lot is

00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:09,009
law will get passed and then that member

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,499
of Congress will no longer be in

00:17:09,009 --> 00:17:14,049
Congress and no one follows up on it so

00:17:11,499 --> 00:17:16,449
even if constituents cared about it if

00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:19,240
that Congress member is no longer there

00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:20,860
it just sort of falls by the wayside and

00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:24,579
it then becomes not a priority for the

00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:28,320
executive branch to do either so those

00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:30,389
are things you need go yeah 100 this is

00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:32,639
this is how to build a successful

00:17:30,389 --> 00:17:35,649
accountability program in government

00:17:32,639 --> 00:17:40,840
both recognize deeply about the subject

00:17:35,649 --> 00:17:45,279
I think we are about out of time

00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:47,019
well I think we will okay I think we can

00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:50,080
probably take one question so I'm taking

00:17:47,019 --> 00:17:51,879
the top how do you balance the question

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,529
on values and partisanship how do you

00:17:51,879 --> 00:17:57,159
start the values conversation while

00:17:53,529 --> 00:18:04,269
staying away from partisanship us start

00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:05,980
Rebecca woo there's like a couple ways

00:18:04,269 --> 00:18:10,179
to play it one I think some of these

00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:14,409
values are there more deeply embedded

00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:17,950
cultural norms then they are partisan

00:18:14,409 --> 00:18:20,919
issues a lot of the time but another way

00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:23,470
to handle partisan issues is at least

00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:25,059
for a lot of the open access issues

00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:28,179
which is what I've primarily worked on

00:18:25,059 --> 00:18:28,929
in d.c both parties are into it for

00:18:28,179 --> 00:18:30,730
different reasons

00:18:28,929 --> 00:18:36,509
so you just sort of figure out what

00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:40,570
those reasons are but yeah I think I

00:18:36,509 --> 00:18:43,330
think a lot of the the values are more

00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:47,320
deeply embedded in sort of government

00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:52,019
workforce or the way folks think about

00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:54,490
risk and they have less to do with party

00:18:52,019 --> 00:18:56,559
yeah I think that's true but I also

00:18:54,490 --> 00:19:01,450
think one of the points I want to make

00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:03,249
is you can't and you have to figure out

00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:06,129
how to compromise on how to build a

00:19:03,249 --> 00:19:08,679
coalition and how to actually get these

00:19:06,129 --> 00:19:10,629
things passed in a way again just

00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:12,039
passing the bill as Rebecca said you

00:19:10,629 --> 00:19:14,139
know the person leaves Congress or

00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:16,059
obviously we have tons of legislature

00:19:14,139 --> 00:19:17,320
and council member turnover and there's

00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:17,860
a lot of ways a lot of these things

00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,049
become

00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:23,650
paper tigers if you want to build

00:19:20,049 --> 00:19:25,240
something lasting I think you do

00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:27,820
actually have to build good electoral

00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,110
coalition's about this again 1755 is a

00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:32,620
good example which is the open

00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:35,370
transparent water data Act you may think

00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:40,000
that you know you're gonna pit

00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:41,980
environmentalist types versus you know

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,530
Central Valley farmers but it turns out

00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:46,660
like having detailed information about

00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:49,290
water costs is something that is very

00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:50,400
appealing to both environmentalists and

00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:52,480
[Music]

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,429
rent you know sort of Rangers who

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,880
typically line up on other side for the

00:19:54,429 --> 00:19:59,140
issue so I think you need to frame you

00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,940
know if you're trying to think how do i

00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:02,890
thread the needle here you need to think

00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:04,929
about what will make your policy

00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:08,380
appealing to many constituencies and

00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:11,260
compromise with that rather than sort of

00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:14,970
saying this is about this is value

00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:17,559
positive you actually need to sell it

00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:20,650
yeah thank you very much for the

00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:23,230
presentation and I actually want to also

00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:25,720
thank you for trying to do something so

00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:28,840
interactive and fun and debate format

00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:31,990
virtually it's like we try very very

00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:34,630
ambitious so um we tried we should have

00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:37,059
practiced it couple of times no I think

00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:39,120
it was it was great there it is such a

00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:41,830
crazy maze of legislation and so you

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:44,500
maybe the technical problems are part of

00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:47,020
also the that illustrative of the

00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:50,710
craziness of the whole process as well

00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:53,230
so yeah one comment that did come in was

00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:55,510
about posting your slides so I just

00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:56,740
remind you and other speakers that you

00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:58,299
know we want to make sure that all the

00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:00,220
slides are posted to the note oh and

00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:01,450
people were looking for the links that

00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:03,669
were on your slides so I think there's a

00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:04,929
lot of follow what people can do on the

00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:07,390
way you're exploring the different

00:21:04,929 --> 00:21:08,559
legislation maze so thank you very much

00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:12,960
we really appreciate it

00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,960
