Description: 
	A survey of government (open) data regulations and how to successfully build accountability programs in government

You've heard of GDPR, but are you aware of how recent legislation by Congress and California may affect your beat? This session will bring together two experts in government data management to discuss the impacts of recent  legislation, including: the Foundations for Evidence-based Policymaking Act, the Geospatial Data Act, the Grant Reporting Efficiency and Agreements Transparency Act, and the California Consumer Privacy Law. They will discuss how this legislation affects access to data, tracking down data, formats of data, and other nuances of the governmental data making process. They may also speculate wildly on how future legislation could impact government data management.
