Title: Soila Kenya - Error 404: Data Archival from a journalist's perspective
Publication date: 2020-05-28
Playlist: CSVConf 2020
Description: 
	Have you ever read an awesome interactive article online from your favourite news source and clicked on a link that landed you on an error 404 page? Or a now-deleted tweet? In all the rage of data journalism, one thing that needs to be put at the forefront is the necessity of archiving data used within these news stories for posterity. Decades from now, we should still have full access to these stories in the way they were originally meant to be consumed. This talk will cover a few tips data journalists can start using NOW to ensure the links they use to give more context to their stories will live on.

cool thank you um yeah I hope you guys

00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:12,120
got your llama selfies in I did it's

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:16,260
kind of hard being the session after the

00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,970
llamas but I think I'll manage welcome

00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,880
everyone to the session thanks for

00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:22,830
joining me and the other speakers

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,410
throughout the conference and thanks to

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:28,500
the organizers for making everything so

00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,869
smooth and so fun and so interesting my

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,420
session as you can see is about data

00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:38,000
archival specifically when it comes to

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,000
data journalism so let's jump in

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:45,629
that's me on screen twice I'm a

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:47,700
journalist a freelance journalist from

00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:51,449
Nairobi Kenya which by the way it's

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:54,680
about 10 p.m. here so dedication I've

00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:57,960
been to only one other CSV conference

00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:59,609
the one last year but I guess coming

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,420
this year makes me bitter and I guess

00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:05,640
and so I've been a data generally

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,130
specifically for about two years I was

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,960
with the organization code for Africa

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:12,689
for those of you know them that was my

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:16,070
entrance into the wonderful world of

00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:19,080
data journalism so just to begin I'll

00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:22,350
start with the question of what is data

00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:25,140
journalism obviously from the word

00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:28,470
itself the obvious thing would be to say

00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:32,909
that data journalism is just theta plus

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:35,250
journalism which is fine but a more

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:38,610
accurate or more in-depth look into it

00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:42,329
is the combination of journalists

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:43,799
ability to story tell because at the end

00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:46,290
of the day that's what journalists do

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:49,259
they're storytellers and their so-called

00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:53,460
news for news combined with this super

00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:56,790
large range of information that is now

00:01:53,460 --> 00:02:00,570
available to us through the web through

00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:02,880
the digital landscape if you give data

00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,320
to each type of profession they'll do

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,320
something different with it and I think

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:11,629
for journalists this is what makes data

00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,629
journalism a separate view

00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,370
and so that though you know data

00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:19,680
journalism has been around for a while

00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:22,890
now for those of you who attended CC

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,110
ways talked yesterday her keynote speech

00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:27,840
yesterday it was very interesting

00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,820
she delve deep into lots of the things

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:34,020
that are going on in the world of data

00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:35,520
journalism and a lot of that stuff for

00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,920
journalists a lot of this stuff that

00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,510
that's so exciting for us has been you

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,850
know the scraping and gathering of

00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:45,000
information they analysis the

00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:47,120
visualizations the news apps you know

00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,700
what have you there have been lots of

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,290
you know steps forward in that field and

00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:56,280
there continue to be more and more

00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:59,400
creative ways to use data journalism to

00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:03,060
tell interesting stories but one thing

00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:06,150
that journalists are not good at is sort

00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:08,670
of taking a break after story to just

00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:11,010
look back and think about what they've

00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:14,850
done and what should be done with with

00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:16,620
that we're always looking to go on to

00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:19,050
the next thing

00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,840
the next story the next breaking news

00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:24,390
journalism kind of has its competitive

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,610
side and so it's always about who can

00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:28,620
get the story first or who can tell the

00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:33,000
best story or who can get the best angle

00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:36,660
and that leaves the question of data

00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:42,090
archive woe to that journalistic stories

00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:44,340
as a big question mark and quote that I

00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:46,170
was not able to find the the original

00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,590
person who said it but was popularized

00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:51,630
by Philippe Graham is that journalism is

00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:55,650
the first draft rough draft of history

00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:57,120
which is said a lot in the journalism

00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,520
realm

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:04,440
maybe with this being self-centered but

00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:07,770
I think there is some truth to that this

00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:09,300
is a good time to experience that in the

00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:11,820
you know the time of the coupe in

00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:14,910
nineteen ever since December and the

00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:18,209
first story is that coming out and you

00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:21,060
know even til now as the numbers keeping

00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:23,280
monitored keeping talks about keep

00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,380
finding new angles finding new things

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,130
finding new ways the world is changing

00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,200
and

00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:32,240
this is fast being documented by

00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:36,000
journalists so for the researchers

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:39,180
writers the novelists in the future who

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,660
write about this time a lot of them will

00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:45,270
find themselves looking back to the new

00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:47,310
stories that were eaten by journalists

00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:51,240
during this time and so that means it's

00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:54,000
really important to you know archive our

00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,280
things or make sure that future

00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,180
generations no matter what technology

00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:03,480
exists then can still have access to the

00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:06,180
you know the wonderful data stresses are

00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:08,100
being released every day just the way we

00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:13,650
have access to newspapers that were

00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:15,900
published you know 100 years ago so in

00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:17,670
terms of looking at data stories

00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,680
journalists have their own ways to go

00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:21,780
about telling their stories that's what

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,540
they could add but when it comes to

00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:26,010
thinking about archival it should be

00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:28,140
something that starts about from the

00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:31,320
very beginning and something that should

00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:34,020
be in the conscious mind of everyone

00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:36,660
from the editors and the news publishers

00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,860
to the journalists themselves it should

00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,930
be something they're thinking about from

00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,730
the beginning and so the first thing of

00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:46,020
course is that there needs to be that

00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:48,660
care given to the archival process most

00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:53,460
news organizations if not all use

00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:56,310
content management systems and so data

00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:58,290
data stories especially the very dynamic

00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:01,380
ones the ones that have interactive

00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:04,080
graphs and photos and videos and all

00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:06,540
sorts of you know fun things are not

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,360
able to be archived the way traditional

00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:12,900
media is the way texts can be archived

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,030
or even video and audio can be archived

00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,920
so the first thing is that within the

00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:19,320
newsroom itself because even freelancers

00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:21,650
like myself do have to you know deal

00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:25,200
with newsrooms so the newsroom itself

00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:27,180
needs to be very aware that even when

00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:30,150
they go to step through the steps of

00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:32,010
making news apps or using other tools to

00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:36,510
write its histories they need to have

00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:39,150
that in mind and then another thing to

00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:39,870
think about is or rather the first thing

00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,580
after that

00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,380
think about is the archiving of the

00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:46,199
whole data story you know the whole

00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:49,530
thing in all its elements so whether

00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:52,500
it's you know a combination of the text

00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:55,470
plus maps plus graphs plus you know

00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:59,070
interactive other interactive data

00:06:55,470 --> 00:07:02,820
visualizations to photos to you know

00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:05,430
video and audio the whole thing as a

00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:08,910
package it needs to be thought out how

00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:11,610
the whole thing can be archived and then

00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:13,380
the last thing or you know what I see as

00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:15,389
the last thing is the links within the

00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:18,500
story so I'm sure you have all had

00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:21,419
experiences of reading a new story and

00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:24,780
it's really something you're enjoying

00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:27,750
and the the writer the journalist has

00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:29,820
referred to a study by the UN or just

00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:32,039
another link that's not on the websites

00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:34,830
of the new story and you click on the

00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:36,990
link and you know it's blank or like you

00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:40,650
don't get access to it because it's been

00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:42,210
moved or something else and I think

00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:46,250
that's something that we're more and

00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:49,169
more dealing with because in the past

00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:51,330
what news organizations do a lot

00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:53,280
especially the traditional ones once

00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:55,860
they moved online is that they would

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,530
never link anything outside of their

00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:00,450
news website so even though they mention

00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:02,820
our study they will never link that

00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:05,190
study all they will do the most they do

00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:07,130
is link to another story within their

00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:10,229
website because I guess they need those

00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:12,599
attention rates on their websites but

00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:14,729
what data journalism what data

00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:17,070
journalism has brought about is the

00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:20,460
willingness to share information and be

00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:22,349
open about wave got in your data or wave

00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:24,919
good you've gotten some of the things

00:08:22,349 --> 00:08:27,720
that you're using within your story and

00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:29,970
now that has brought in the issue of

00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,700
archive all of those links so I think

00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:34,200
that would be the last thing so as I

00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:38,969
said the first step is just thinking

00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:42,120
about the future and what what you want

00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:45,089
to achieve how you want to be able to

00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:47,100
preserve what you've written what you've

00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:49,530
worked on not only for future

00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:52,560
generations who would want to know what

00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:54,080
was going on in the world in 2020 but

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,540
also just for you

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,610
personal portfolio as a journalist

00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,870
because journalists I mean we move

00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:04,200
around we work with different

00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:06,720
organizations for freelancers like

00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,060
myself we have bylines in all sorts of

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,710
different news organizations so that's

00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:13,230
something that needs to be thought about

00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:16,410
because you know news organizations may

00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:18,510
shut down may be merged with others and

00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:20,820
so there needs to be some thought put

00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:25,170
into how to preserve some of these some

00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:28,170
of the stories we write so the first

00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:29,970
thing is scaling down and when these

00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:33,570
stories are written especially the ones

00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:35,430
it's a very dynamic something that can

00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:37,140
be thought about at the top level that

00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:42,060
is at the level of the publishers and

00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:45,120
the editors is how to preserve at least

00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:48,870
a simple HTML version or just a static

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:51,480
page of the DITA story some of these

00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:55,050
stories are correct they include lots of

00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,580
different elements but one option which

00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:59,040
is not the favorite option at all

00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:01,920
because it loses quite a bit but just in

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:06,750
terms of thinking about the options it

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:09,840
is on the table that perhaps a few

00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:12,180
months after the story goes live of you

00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,920
know after traffic has been driven down

00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,710
and people have seen the story quite a

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:20,580
bit maybe six to six months down the

00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:24,330
line the option may arise to just

00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:28,230
preserve the HTM a simple HTML of the

00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:30,710
data story this is because there's CMS's

00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:34,830
that we use currently are incapable of

00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:38,490
archiving data stories as Nyoka as they

00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:41,880
are with all the elements it's something

00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:45,330
new and so the technology I guess is not

00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:49,350
yet there but another thing is also the

00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:53,730
fact that we do use other apps as well

00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:56,220
to write data stories so some of you may

00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:59,190
be familiar with shorthand shorthand is

00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:01,260
a it's a news app basically that's like

00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:02,910
WordPress but for data stories because

00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,980
you can add in so many different

00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:06,279
elements you can add in your own HTML

00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,709
and CSS

00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:10,720
and you know it looks like it looks very

00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:13,209
pretty because you can you know put

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,910
photos and videos and move things and

00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:17,800
have you know the text leading into the

00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:19,629
photo you can have the photo in the

00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:23,949
background you can do so many things and

00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:25,779
such apps are being used by news

00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:27,850
organizations from very small ends to

00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:30,040
very big ones and so the question is

00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:31,480
what if shorthand goes under what

00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,749
happens to all those stories that were

00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:36,730
published through through the app and so

00:11:34,749 --> 00:11:40,809
scaling down is just one of the options

00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:43,689
that exists another one is the large

00:11:40,809 --> 00:11:46,660
commercial libraries and archives that

00:11:43,689 --> 00:11:51,399
already exist and are already being used

00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:54,129
for traditional archiving especially

00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:57,879
when it comes to newspapers and for some

00:11:54,129 --> 00:12:01,499
also digital normal digital histories

00:11:57,879 --> 00:12:05,410
and these include you know ProQuest

00:12:01,499 --> 00:12:10,839
LexisNexis and they're like this is

00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:13,660
something that is also needs to be

00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:15,550
rethought because especially if your

00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:18,069
news organization is not already on a

00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:21,879
web archiving platform bringing up some

00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:24,550
of these commercial libraries might be a

00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:27,269
bit of a tough thing to do within a

00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:30,550
newsroom newsrooms are notoriously very

00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:33,970
tight fisted with funds understandably

00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:35,589
especially in this age where is they're

00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:40,000
still trying to rethink their business

00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:41,709
models and so you know cooking up

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,949
themselves to all these other things

00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:46,839
they would see it as some who's

00:12:43,949 --> 00:12:49,389
experienced the newsroom vibe they'd see

00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:51,579
it is just another extra thing that you

00:12:49,389 --> 00:12:53,199
don't need to worry about now especially

00:12:51,579 --> 00:12:56,170
if you're just a journalist you know

00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:57,790
that the way they see it is that you

00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:00,129
should just focus on telling your next

00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:01,689
story and leave all the high-level

00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:03,970
thinking to the editors and the

00:13:01,689 --> 00:13:05,439
publishers and the owners and so

00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:07,480
bringing up some of these things would

00:13:05,439 --> 00:13:09,370
be really hard but it is something that

00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,499
can at least start being thought about

00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:14,379
or being put on the table or being

00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:18,250
forwarded in terms of you know ideas on

00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:20,050
how to ensure all aspects of the news

00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:23,740
stories that are being told

00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:28,149
within any given newsroom are you know

00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:31,600
reserved for posterity the last two

00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:34,180
methods are some of my favorite because

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:37,240
they put the power back into the

00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:39,810
journalist hands and especially because

00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:43,600
generalist like thinking a lot about

00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:47,529
some of these things especially those

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,480
who are you know I mean I guess I it's

00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:51,370
all of us were always going to the next

00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,290
story and thinking of the next thing but

00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:55,600
especially those with in newsrooms who

00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:58,660
have it a bit harder and have editors on

00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:01,800
their back constantly these are a bits

00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:07,930
you know quick methods so the first is

00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:10,360
taking video taking videos of their news

00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:13,240
stories so I'll just escape from the

00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:16,720
presentation mode and I think we're all

00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:20,140
familiar with this site of seeing video

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,209
game gameplay on YouTube or wherever

00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:25,329
this is just I just found a random

00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:30,420
minecraft gameplay and this is what I'm

00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:30,420
talking about so we can borrow this same

00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:36,790
aspect from the from gamers and use it

00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:39,730
to preserve our story so if you could

00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:42,670
just it's like taking a screen cap of

00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:45,279
your data story as you scroll through

00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:47,980
the different elements of what it can do

00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:51,610
so for example if you have something

00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:53,649
that has an interactive graph you can

00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:57,270
you know scroll through click around

00:14:53,649 --> 00:15:02,440
click on it as it's being recorded and

00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:04,930
you know be able to preserve that on any

00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:07,899
for yourself for your own you know you

00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:10,060
know portfolio and employment history

00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:13,329
and also for future generations because

00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:16,350
as the maybe different technologies come

00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:21,120
around you just need to update the video

00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:25,449
quality or whatever and still have that

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:29,459
in your archives somewhere also the news

00:15:25,449 --> 00:15:30,680
organizations themselves are able to

00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:32,810
okay

00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,940
videos at least because videos is

00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:36,800
something we've had for a while so even

00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:38,149
the news organizations could benefit

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,880
because then they are able to at least

00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:42,649
archive videos before we figured out a

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:47,410
way to archive data stories as they

00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:50,529
exist so that's one way another way is

00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:55,339
archiving links which I mentioned before

00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:57,529
so as I mentioned we've probably all had

00:15:55,339 --> 00:15:59,990
the experience of going through a news

00:15:57,529 --> 00:16:03,890
story and seeing as you can see on my

00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:07,580
screen it's a Twitter link and embed

00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:10,430
from Twitter and I'm sure you've all had

00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:12,050
the experience of either this is just a

00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:14,180
broken link and it says something like

00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:17,240
the media does not exist anymore or

00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:19,550
something of the sort or even if he says

00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,649
are no more link within the article and

00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:26,060
then you click on it and it it's you

00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:27,980
know no longer existing an option this

00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:31,220
is a story I did a while ago an option

00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:38,330
that exists is using applications such

00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:41,089
as archive dot is to preserve links so

00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:42,800
this works for everything but in my case

00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:46,610
since I wanted to preserve our tweet I

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:50,450
used the tweet but you can imagine that

00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:53,060
the Kenya Met department deletes this

00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:54,500
tweet so if I'd still up but what if

00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:57,650
they delete it or they delete the

00:16:54,500 --> 00:17:00,320
account or Twitter doesn't exist anymore

00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:02,450
this actually preserves the tweet and

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,540
the discourse that went on underneath

00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:07,309
the tweet as well so I think that's

00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:10,429
super neat it's super easy

00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:12,709
it's puts the power back into the

00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:16,640
journalists hands now that we've said

00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:19,360
adding links on our stories that lead to

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:25,179
other people's work

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:28,730
yep so that's all I had for today

00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:31,340
that's the selfie huh as a selfie I got

00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:34,700
with one of the llamas literally like a

00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:37,640
few minutes before they talked but those

00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:40,520
are my contacts there's my email I'm on

00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:44,150
Twitter's at Tyler underscore Kenya and

00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:44,670
then I think the presentation is on the

00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:47,130
website

00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:50,100
on the CSV conference website but there

00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:54,809
it is as well in case you want to jump

00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:56,640
in yeah yeah thank you very much yes so

00:17:54,809 --> 00:17:58,320
um there was a lot of great chatter in

00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,420
that and the chat will move some of that

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,220
over to slack but would be good for you

00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:05,880
to take a look at that too one question

00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:08,010
was just um this idea of recording a

00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,890
story as it's happening kind of like the

00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:13,200
Minecraft you know recording there were

00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:15,240
a couple comments about that other good

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,750
examples of that happening in journalism

00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:20,250
I mean your example is minecraft which i

00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:22,140
think is an awesome idea but are there

00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:24,540
are good examples that you know if maybe

00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:27,570
you can put those in slacker I think

00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:28,950
I'll put them on slack yeah yeah yeah

00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:30,630
cuz it's a great idea and I there was

00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:31,290
several people who had said I hadn't

00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:35,790
even thought about it

00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:37,350
I mean it's a yeah and I I hear about my

00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:40,740
nieces and nephews watching these videos

00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:43,620
of people playing video games and my

00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:44,970
other family members say oh that sounds

00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,470
so ridiculous and I think to myself

00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:48,929
actually it sounds so interesting I

00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:50,490
would love to watch so yeah so the thing

00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:54,059
goes with journalism so it's a great

00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:58,340
idea mm-hmm okay we're gonna move on to

00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:58,340
