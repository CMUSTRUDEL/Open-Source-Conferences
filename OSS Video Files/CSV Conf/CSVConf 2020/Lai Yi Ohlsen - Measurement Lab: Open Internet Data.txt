Title: Lai Yi Ohlsen - Measurement Lab: Open Internet Data
Publication date: 2020-05-28
Playlist: CSVConf 2020
Description: 
	Measurement Lab (M-Lab) is the largest open internet measurement platform in the world, hosting internet-scale measurement experiments and releasing all data into the public domain (CC0). We are an open source project with contributors from civil society organizations, educational institutions, and private sector companies, and are a fiscally sponsored project of Code for Science & Society. Our mission is to Measure the Internet, save the data, and make it universally accessible and useful. M-Lab works to advance network research and empowers the public with useful information about broadband and mobile connections by maintaining a scalable, global platform for conducting internet measurements, and by supporting an ecosystem of external partners and users around the world interested in using the resulting open data. Our users are researchers, activists, analysts, journalists, experiment developers, hosting providers, regulators, municipalities, and every day consumers. M-Lab works to enhance internet transparency, and help to promote and sustain a healthy, innovative internet by supporting our users in their research and data analyses, developing and publicizing new use cases for our datasets, forming collaborative partnerships, and building open source measurement tools. Last year we introduced our platform and data to csvconf; this year we would like to introduce the project to those who are new to the community as well as dive deeper into our open source alternative for on-premise measurement devices that contribute to our public data set. We would also like to share our community engagement methodology, in hopes of starting a discussion around how to best make data open through accessibility and usability.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,990
so yeah thank you for having me my name

00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:08,280
is Louie Olsen I am the project director

00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:11,160
of measurement lab yeah I can't say I've

00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,320
ever talked to 850 people from my

00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,109
apartment before so this is great I'm

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,990
specifically excited for this conference

00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:20,490
because I feel like most of the people

00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,470
that we talk to you our internet

00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:25,470
researchers and broadband policy and

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,869
advocates advocacy groups and we learned

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:31,590
a lot from them but there are actually a

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:34,530
few few open Internet projects open

00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:37,800
Internet performance measurement

00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:40,140
projects and so it's really great to be

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,200
talking with folks who understand the

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,870
challenges of running an open project

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,180
and so my goal for today really is just

00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,489
to describe measurement lab enough and

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,930
our data enough so that you can get

00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:54,059
enough of an understanding to help

00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:58,859
understand us understand our challenges

00:00:54,059 --> 00:01:01,260
and engage in follow ups afterwards so I

00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:03,180
will start by just our agenda for today

00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,790
I'm just going to ask the question what

00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,939
is my data when we say I'm live data

00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:11,070
what is that and what is M lab is a

00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:13,290
question that goes with that I'll touch

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:16,020
on how to access the data and then get

00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:18,869
into some of the challenges and I'll

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,759
also talk to those throughout and yeah

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:23,189
the idea here is that hopefully I can

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,990
follow up with the folks here about how

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:27,940
you all are approaching these questions

00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,620
of running an open project

00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:31,150
so the question is you know the first

00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:33,130
question that we get is like what is my

00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:35,620
data what can I do with it when you say

00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:37,690
open Internet performance measurements

00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:39,850
what does that mean and I think a way to

00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:43,240
answer that is actually by starting with

00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:45,070
the question what is EMA itself so I'll

00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,350
start we can a good place to start with

00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:50,890
that is talking about the project's

00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:53,440
mission our mission is to measure the

00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:56,310
Internet save the data and make it

00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:58,420
universally accessible and useful

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,820
already we get into some of the nuance

00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:02,890
here because there are so many ways to

00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,630
measure the Internet you can imagine

00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:06,970
that the Internet is a complex network

00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:10,360
of networks we know this and so when you

00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:13,000
add measurement into it there it only

00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:16,150
increases the complexity in terms of

00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,390
understanding it and measuring it from

00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:21,370
different vantage points etc so there

00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:24,070
are many ways to do this and lab does

00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:26,740
not necessarily claim to do all of them

00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:30,400
but we do have principles that help

00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:34,480
guide the decisions that we make and are

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:37,440
what we advocate for as well and these

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:40,360
principles are ones of open

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,760
user-contributed and longitudinal data

00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,080
so we'll break that down I mean with

00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,690
this first one I'm a little bit

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,640
preaching to the choir right but open

00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:50,290
data we think is really important

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,950
specifically within internet performance

00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:55,180
research because when there are

00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:57,160
decisions being made that affect

00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:00,430
consumers Internet we believe that the

00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:02,800
source of that research and the analysis

00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:05,769
that goes into those decisions should

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,260
come from an open source and open data

00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:10,680
source where everyone can see the

00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:14,890
numbers that were used to calculate the

00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:18,670
that the other numbers right so open is

00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:20,739
part of our methodology we have open

00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:24,130
data and all our code is open source and

00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:26,050
we'll talk more about that sorry I'm in

00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:28,840
New York and New York is somehow still

00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:30,130
out even though it's in quarantine if

00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:36,170
you heard all the background noise a

00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:40,319
little bit all good things we also

00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:43,440
strongly support and are also in our own

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:47,310
data use user contributed data so the

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:51,470
idea here is that by users contributing

00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:54,150
the measurements of their internet it's

00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:56,280
representing the consumer perspective so

00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,440
there are many valid ways to measure the

00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,900
internet that are not user contributed

00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,459
but we believe that at least some of

00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,110
them should represent the consumers

00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:08,010
perspective when making decisions that

00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:09,750
affect them and the last part is also

00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:11,970
probably preaching to the choir here but

00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:14,549
we we do believe in longitudinal data

00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:17,070
being important and that it's important

00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:18,690
to understand that the Internet is going

00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:21,750
to be different from one second to the

00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:24,479
next right so it's to make any sort of

00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,490
decision about it you kind of need to be

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,100
able to understand it over time and how

00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:31,310
it's changed from one day to another one

00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:34,020
months to another and it's and so on so

00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:37,370
measurements of the Internet are only so

00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:39,540
useful in isolation the the real

00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:42,270
analysis can start happening when it's

00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:45,990
looking at it as a longitudinal data set

00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:47,430
so these are the kind of core tenants of

00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:51,780
how we think about our measurement

00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:53,729
methodology and everything that when you

00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:58,650
talk about em lab everything will follow

00:04:53,729 --> 00:05:01,080
these kind of guiding posts but you know

00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:02,580
what is in lab is still the question and

00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,220
the six components that I'll talk

00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:07,650
through are here the first of which is

00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:10,080
it's the team of people we are a

00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:12,000
fiscally sponsored project of code for

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,440
science and society which I believe is

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,370
an organizer of this conference as well

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:20,039
and we are we've been there for about a

00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:23,070
year amongst other open data and science

00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:24,780
projects myself our program management

00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:28,350
and community lead and our platform

00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:30,180
engineers or all staffed there we also

00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:32,630
have had a number of contributors over

00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:35,520
the year kind of most prominently years

00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:37,770
most prominently for instance planetlab

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,470
new america's open technology institute

00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:42,750
and several others google is a current

00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:45,349
contributor and they support the project

00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:48,270
by contributing a number of

00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:49,910
infrastructure support also internet

00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:52,130
performance research and

00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:54,050
a small team of software engineers that

00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:56,660
helps us fight open source code for the

00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:59,540
for the platform in pipelines so our

00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:04,460
team is made up of both code for science

00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:06,370
and Google's team members the next part

00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:10,970
of mm to get into kind of the what is a

00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:12,860
question is it's useful I think to go

00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:15,830
back to kind of our origin story to

00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:17,690
understand the problem that I'm lab is

00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:20,440
really trying to solve for was

00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:24,860
originally trying to solve and still is

00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:27,500
back in the old days in 2008 Vint Cerf

00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:30,020
started this conversation around you

00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,430
know what is really missing in Internet

00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:35,000
performance research what are the

00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:37,190
resources that you don't have you

00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,080
meaning internet researchers that you

00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:41,390
would like to have to be able to

00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:45,130
complete the experiments that would give

00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:47,060
us better information about the Internet

00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:49,520
the the

00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:52,760
widely shared answer was that there was

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,440
a lack of widely deployed professionally

00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,570
maintained servers with enough

00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,760
connectivity that could support the

00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:01,100
experiments that researchers wanted to

00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:03,530
run so you can imagine that it's

00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:07,240
actually quite the Internet is big so

00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:10,100
it's difficult to get a good sized

00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:13,340
infrastructure to be able to get enough

00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:16,250
to get a valuable amount of information

00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:18,440
from different vantage points so that is

00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:21,680
what the M lab platform is trying to

00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:23,960
solve so we do this by hosting our

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,720
servers and what we call off net to your

00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:30,250
one data centers by often that we mean

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:33,560
it's where ISPs or it's in ISPs that

00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:36,590
primarily host content versus accessing

00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:40,070
or per might by vs. primarily connecting

00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:42,020
to individual people and so if you can

00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:43,730
imagine it's kind of the the nodes that

00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,560
connect the nodes and that's where we

00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:47,720
host our servers so the idea here is

00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,940
that we're getting the most relevant

00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:52,610
path to the consumer from consumer to

00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:56,300
content and we host our servers in about

00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:58,700
500 plus or sorry 130 plus locations and

00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:01,220
we have a little over 500 of them and

00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:03,230
again this is to be able to provide a

00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:06,920
resource to researchers where

00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:08,330
can host experiments that get a wide

00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:11,360
breadth of information about the

00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:13,490
internet versus just small little

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,440
portions here and there it's easier to

00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:21,800
collect at a large scale than to try and

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:24,410
join all these tinier datasets so the

00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,870
platform on these servers like I said

00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:30,800
this was so that experimenters could

00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:32,030
host experiments and we currently host

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,770
about three of them and I'll show them

00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:36,800
in a minute but all of these experiments

00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:39,590
are reviewed by our experiment review

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,280
committee and they're mostly composed by

00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:45,770
the academic research communities

00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:48,280
currently we host NDT which we'll talk a

00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:50,570
bit more about later as this test is

00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:53,300
currently maintained by the end lab team

00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:56,450
we also maintain a test called I'm sorry

00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:59,600
host a test called - which measures the

00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:02,390
quality of video streams and then also

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,570
we he which measures the differential

00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:08,240
treatment of applications by ISPs and so

00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:10,700
these two tests all these tests are

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,920
examples of ones that were proposed to

00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:16,220
our committee approved and then we host

00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:18,290
them on our platform there are you know

00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:20,210
various requirements of how this happens

00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:22,010
but the most prominent one gets into

00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:24,230
what we talked about with our principles

00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:29,060
is that in that they're required to be

00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:30,890
open so again with this idea that the

00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:33,770
not only the data needs to be open but

00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:35,770
the code that produces the tests that

00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:38,480
produced the data also need to be open

00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:40,250
and we and we enforce the Spy requiring

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,000
that the test run and an open source

00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:46,130
docker container on all of our servers

00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,690
it's interesting because what happens

00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:49,310
here is they're essentially what we're

00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:52,130
talking about is providing not only an

00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:56,020
open data set but an open platform as a

00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:59,900
resource and so there are parts to that

00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:01,130
platform that affect the results of the

00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:04,730
tests and there are parts of the test

00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:07,640
itself and the methodology that it uses

00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:10,810
that affect the results itself so it's

00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:13,850
we one of the challenges that we face as

00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:15,800
to making distinguish making

00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:17,079
distinctions between the two between the

00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,310
platform and that's

00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:21,110
themselves and I'm curious if there are

00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:23,959
other open infrastructure projects here

00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:25,600
and how how you handle that

00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:27,949
in the way that these tests the

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:32,690
experiments are run is that you know the

00:10:27,949 --> 00:10:34,880
EM lab platform hosts the server side of

00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:37,100
the tests and the client and people

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,949
develop clients to run tests against

00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:41,209
these servers so this is where the user

00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:44,389
contributed perspective comes in where

00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:46,279
users can develop clients and also run

00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:48,199
tests with those clients that then test

00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:51,949
against all of those servers that we

00:10:48,199 --> 00:10:53,300
that we run anyone can develop a client

00:10:51,949 --> 00:10:55,519
and this is where we get into our open

00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:58,339
principles again it's important to us

00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:01,130
that anybody can do so one of the

00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:03,440
versions that people are that have been

00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:06,620
developed is if you google how fast is

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:11,240
my internet you get NDT which is what we

00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:13,130
refer to as our speed test from there

00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,509
all of the tests that are run produced

00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:16,699
data and that data goes through our

00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:19,490
pipeline and is archived in a public

00:11:16,699 --> 00:11:21,649
Google Cloud Storage archive the idea

00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:24,170
here is that we collect it all and it's

00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:27,259
all public and you can access it if you

00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:29,720
want to we will say though that is a lot

00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:33,800
of data and very few people want the raw

00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:35,689
data so we put it into bigquery and this

00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,959
is actually how most people interact

00:11:35,689 --> 00:11:40,550
with our data as three big I'm sorry

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,470
went through and loved

00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:45,199
most people know if I'm lab as our data

00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:50,540
set and they know that through accessing

00:11:45,199 --> 00:11:52,910
it and bigquery this is getting back to

00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:54,709
our origin story we're trying to answer

00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:56,449
this question researchers were saying

00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:59,029
and even if we did have this platform

00:11:56,449 --> 00:12:01,009
there's going to be so much data and

00:11:59,029 --> 00:12:04,040
there's no real way to share it with one

00:12:01,009 --> 00:12:05,569
another and so this is what our second

00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:08,060
answer our second part of our origin

00:12:05,569 --> 00:12:09,620
story our answer to that is by putting

00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:12,949
the and for all the data into bigquery

00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:16,100
which is a distributed database provided

00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:19,339
by Google that allows researchers to

00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:21,259
access all the data in one place we also

00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:22,810
provide visualizations but I will say

00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:25,270
that that is a

00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:26,670
under construction and we are actually

00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:29,080
looking for a data visualization

00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:33,070
contractor so if you're interested

00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:35,230
please let me know these slides all

00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:40,000
probably power through a bit but British

00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:43,240
gets into the nuance between the testing

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,950
methodology of the tests that we run and

00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,080
then the platform methodology and how

00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:49,840
they're kind of different and so when

00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:53,530
people talk about my lab data it's it

00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:54,760
can be useful to try and define which

00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:56,080
one they're talking about are they

00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:59,290
talking about the platform or are they

00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:01,030
talking about the test itself also if

00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:03,970
you have interacted with emmab data or

00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:05,710
if you do it's likely that by nature of

00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:08,080
it being the only thing currently hosted

00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:09,970
in bigquery as well as being our

00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,640
longest-standing test and also the fact

00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:16,090
that we maintain it when people say and

00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:19,090
DT it's often used interchangeably with

00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:21,730
M lab but they're actually a little bit

00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:23,920
separatist in that NDT is a host a test

00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:26,350
that we have hosts and again I'd love to

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,030
talk to anyone else hosting up an

00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:29,830
infrastructure that's used as a resource

00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:31,930
and how you kind of maintain that

00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:37,050
balance between what the resource is and

00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:41,350
what the usage of that resource does and

00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:44,650
then the last thing on our data is just

00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:46,840
getting back to this idea that one test

00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:48,910
is only going to be so useful but when

00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:51,250
we put all of the tests together and a

00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:53,290
data set you can start to see trends of

00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:55,500
Internet performance at a large scale

00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:58,690
and this is really the value of the data

00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:01,540
NDT just like any test what is only as

00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:03,400
useful as you know the one test but when

00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:06,550
you start to put it together with other

00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:08,320
tests you can start to see trends based

00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:10,690
on different factors and that's really

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,540
where the kind of magic of the test or

00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:15,670
the of the measurement happens when you

00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:18,730
combine the two so when you when you are

00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:21,820
able to put NDT a lot of tests like NDT

00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:24,550
or any other test on a scale as our

00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:26,560
platform allows then that's really where

00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:30,010
you start to see the interesting

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,600
information and we see this by you know

00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:33,700
we've had we get something like three

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,440
million and DT measurements per day and

00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:38,740
we have close to two billion rows of

00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:42,160
data in our table as of 2020 so it's

00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:45,220
it's massive and it's all public and I

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,959
think I'm talking to people who

00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:50,190
understand that that's really important

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:52,870
because it's in it even if you want to

00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:54,730
use this this information is really good

00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:57,009
at kind of showing you a zoomed out view

00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:59,379
and then as being able to ask better

00:14:57,009 --> 00:15:01,360
questions about where you should zoom in

00:14:59,379 --> 00:15:04,089
so it's we think that it's important to

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,740
start big and then go smaller especially

00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:09,009
when you're talking about something as

00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:14,230
complex and increasingly changing as the

00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:18,790
internet the other way that we engage

00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:21,149
with our community and through open

00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:24,009
source code is by creating tools that

00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:26,110
are able to drill down more

00:15:24,009 --> 00:15:29,439
geographically so at the default level

00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:32,439
we only go down to the IP level which is

00:15:29,439 --> 00:15:33,910
about County if there are some times

00:15:32,439 --> 00:15:36,220
where researchers want to be able to

00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:38,860
drill down and say no but like what

00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:40,660
households are able to access the

00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:43,569
Internet at a certain way and so we have

00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:45,610
a suite of tools that are designed to be

00:15:43,569 --> 00:15:48,880
able to provide that information but

00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:52,209
also in a privacy sensitive way and so

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,380
these are the tools here and I won't go

00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:55,300
through them all but they're all

00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:57,910
designed in this way of saying here's

00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:00,509
the public data set here's how you can

00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:05,170
get more information about your specific

00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:07,120
location and then a lot of the work

00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:08,889
though aside from running the platform

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,040
in the pipeline and hosting the data set

00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:14,259
is engaging with our community our

00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,610
community is what makes our data does

00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:18,160
that last part of our mission which is

00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:20,829
making it universally accessible and

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:24,579
useful and so engaging with researchers

00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:27,540
on how the to best use the information

00:16:24,579 --> 00:16:29,800
that we provide also collaborating with

00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:34,089
experiments or researchers that would

00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:35,740
like to propose experiments there's a an

00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:37,420
interesting thing that happens to where

00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:41,019
I'm sure a lot of people actually have

00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:42,519
this here where everyone who uses your

00:16:41,019 --> 00:16:44,230
data is coming from a different level of

00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:46,959
technical expertise of different

00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:48,399
interests of different points of

00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,209
publication where they'd like to use

00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,579
information

00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:55,720
so there's that fun dance of trying to

00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:59,619
understand what meeting everyone where

00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:02,249
they're at while still maintaining the

00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:05,529
standards that I'm lap would like to see

00:17:02,249 --> 00:17:08,890
I also we try to say to that like

00:17:05,529 --> 00:17:12,100
everything I presented is and love at

00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:13,870
this present time and we are very open

00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:16,449
to collaboration and I think that's one

00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:18,039
of the great parts about running an open

00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:21,490
project is that you always are looking

00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:23,049
for feedback on how to improve your

00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:26,939
measurements and expand or not

00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:29,919
measurements but data and expand it to

00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:33,669
be useful to more people and act as a

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:36,700
public resource I have slides here about

00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:38,320
how to access the data but I mean I

00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:40,539
think the slides are uploaded so I'll

00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,159
just and if not all upload them right as

00:17:40,539 --> 00:17:45,730
a research for later if you'd like to

00:17:42,159 --> 00:17:48,909
look into how to access our data and

00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:50,590
this was really the whole point that I

00:17:48,909 --> 00:17:52,179
wanted to get to is just to reference

00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:55,029
some of the challenges that I'd love to

00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:57,789
speak with you all about and follow up I

00:17:55,029 --> 00:18:00,700
think it's interesting like there's this

00:17:57,789 --> 00:18:03,250
kind of thing where if it's one of them

00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:05,380
is that if our doubt is free to access

00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,820
so you can access it I didn't even say

00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:09,429
that yet but it is free and you just

00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:11,049
have to sign up for a discuss list which

00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:12,220
we can get you access to bigquery and I

00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:13,899
think sometimes there's kind of a

00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:16,659
speculation of like how good can it be

00:18:13,899 --> 00:18:18,340
if it's free and so if anyone else

00:18:16,659 --> 00:18:20,500
experiences that but let me talk about

00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:22,390
that there's of course this tension

00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,789
always with an open data set where

00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:26,230
you're collecting you want the

00:18:24,789 --> 00:18:28,059
information to be public but you also

00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:30,640
want to do so in a privacy sensitive way

00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:32,620
clearly there's technical nuances to

00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,980
that with internet performance data but

00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:38,039
just would love to talk to anyone who is

00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:41,230
also addressing that and the last one

00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:44,740
that I wonder about for folks here is

00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:46,659
the kind of challenge of running what we

00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:49,830
consider and want to consider as a

00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:52,029
public resource while still maintaining

00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:54,970
governance that reflects the the

00:18:52,029 --> 00:18:56,679
principles that we'd like to uphold and

00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:59,440
so making that balance of a community

00:18:56,679 --> 00:19:01,750
govern project will also have a

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:05,259
your own principles that you're in

00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:08,230
supportive that is my thank you for

00:19:05,259 --> 00:19:12,039
having me and follow-up please reach out

00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:15,850
to my email or I am on Twitter

00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:18,009
sometimes thanks everyone yeah thank you

00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:19,870
I mean those last three points there and

00:19:18,009 --> 00:19:21,460
we're definitely the things people were

00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:24,279
bringing up in the chat and in the

00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:27,370
questions around so I think that's

00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:28,720
exactly the types of challenges and

00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:31,389
opportunities that your project brings

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,830
up so yeah thank you very much

00:19:31,389 --> 00:19:35,350
we don't have time for questions because

00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:37,720
we do have to move over to the keynote

00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:41,470
but thank you again for the presentation

00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:43,240
and we'll post the questions over into

00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:45,820
slack and so please respond to those and

00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:48,820
anybody who has questions for Laie

00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:50,080
please go over there and ask them within

00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:54,059
the Q&A Channel

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,059
