Title: Philip Ashlock - The State of Open Government Data Infrastructure
Publication date: 2020-05-28
Playlist: CSVConf 2020
Description: 
	This talk provides an overview of the current state of open government data infrastructure and the broader ecosystem from the perspective of Data.gov and the implementation of open data laws in the United States. This will cover the widespread use of the W3C DCAT metadata standard across all Federal agencies as well as widespread use by state and local governments. This same metadata also helps generate the Schema.org variant of the specification with fuels listings on general purpose platforms like Google Dataset Search. The European Union has been updating their DCAT Application Profile with the recent development of DCAT 2.0 and the US Government will be revising its DCAT specification to meet updated requirements in the new comprehensive open data law ("Evidence Act") with public input on GitHub. This talk will provide an overview of the current state of this infrastructure and ecosystem and ponder how other metadata standards including CSVW, Tabular Data Packages, DSPL, and SDMX fit into the mix as well as how we can better leverage CSVs and tabular data tools and capabilities within platforms like Data.gov and other CKAN-based data catalogs. Since this talk should be in the midst of the public comment period for revising our USG-focused profile of DCAT, it will also be a good opportunity to solicit comments and public participation in the update to the metadata specification used across all government agencies. The current legacy version of this can be found at https://resources.data.gov/schemas/dcat-us/v1.1/
