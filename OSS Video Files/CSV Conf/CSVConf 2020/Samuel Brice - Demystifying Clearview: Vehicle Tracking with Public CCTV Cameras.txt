Publication date: 2020-06-26
Playlist: CSVConf 2020
Description: 
	Recently, the New York Times published an article about Clearview AI - the secretive company that might end privacy as we know it. Using a database of billions of images scrapped from websites such as Facebook, and Instagram Clearview can track and identify anyone with a web presence. The tool is actively being used by police agencies around the country and many citizens are concerned about its potential for abuse.

My talks goes into detail explaining how Clearview's system works by demonstrating a similar system for tracking and identifying cars using public CCTV cameras. I will cover the steps of implementing such a pipeline from collecting training data, to building a neural net model, to tracking the movements of a car in time and space.

Lastly I will cover the implications of such a capability on privacy as well as what can be done to protect our privacy today.
