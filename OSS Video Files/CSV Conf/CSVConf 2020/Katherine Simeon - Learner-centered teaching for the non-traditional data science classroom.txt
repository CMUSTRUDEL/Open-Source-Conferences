Title: Katherine Simeon - Learner-centered teaching for the non-traditional data science classroom
Publication date: 2020-05-28
Playlist: CSVConf 2020
Description: 
	There is considerable variability in how individuals learn computing skills. While many formal courses, both online and in-person, are available to learners, typical methods of learning are acquiring knowledge on-the-job and participating in short-term workshops. While these non-traditional contexts are highly successful, instructors are challenged to capitalize on a limited amount of time and resources, while catering to learners of different backgrounds and experience levels. In this talk, we will discuss how pedagogic research can be applied to computing & programming education in non-traditional settings (e.g., corporate training, 1-day workshops, and one-on-one mentorship). Specifically, we will explore how to modify established learning formats in order to address specific needs of learners. Finally, we will outline best practices to facilitate a collaborative and inclusive learning environment that can motivate both instructors and learners.
