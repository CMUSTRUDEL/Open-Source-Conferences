Title: Katherine Simeon - Learner-centered teaching for the non-traditional data science classroom
Publication date: 2020-05-28
Playlist: CSVConf 2020
Description: 
	There is considerable variability in how individuals learn computing skills. While many formal courses, both online and in-person, are available to learners, typical methods of learning are acquiring knowledge on-the-job and participating in short-term workshops. While these non-traditional contexts are highly successful, instructors are challenged to capitalize on a limited amount of time and resources, while catering to learners of different backgrounds and experience levels. In this talk, we will discuss how pedagogic research can be applied to computing & programming education in non-traditional settings (e.g., corporate training, 1-day workshops, and one-on-one mentorship). Specifically, we will explore how to modify established learning formats in order to address specific needs of learners. Finally, we will outline best practices to facilitate a collaborative and inclusive learning environment that can motivate both instructors and learners.

perfect hi everyone good morning I want

00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,570
to start with a really quick

00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:13,200
introduction I'm Katherine um this is a

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:15,630
photo of me with my lovely co-authors da

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,760
Das and Angela Lee of Genentech and

00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,859
University of Chicago respectively I'm

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,480
really excited to speak to you on behalf

00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,970
of these amazing people to talk about

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,529
learning learning some learner centered

00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:29,189
teaching for the non traditional data

00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:31,320
science classroom so I want to start by

00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:32,640
setting up some contests let's say that

00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,250
I'm teaching a class on data

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,340
visualization in our so we want learners

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:40,980
to write out this code this beautiful

00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:45,059
code on the left and then seamlessly

00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:46,590
plot our beautiful data in our however

00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:48,450
there's more to this process right

00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,090
before any plotting happens we need to

00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,550
actually load this data file into our we

00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:56,129
need to then clean it and then maybe we

00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,930
can start plotting and visualizing but

00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:59,670
even if learners have familiarity with

00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,789
this process there can still be speed

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:05,519
bumps we might encounter errors every

00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:06,869
step of the way to the point where we

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,119
don't even get to the exciting part of

00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:11,909
what we're trying to do and this happens

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,950
to me a lot as an instructor so as

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:16,290
instructors we have to juggle a lot of

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,659
things when we're teaching first we need

00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,950
to establish our learning goals figure

00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:21,600
out what we want our learners to

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:25,080
accomplish in the time that we have

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,119
together and this is best informed by

00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,030
understanding our learners understanding

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:33,780
what motivates learners to learn about a

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:35,909
specific topic as well as knowing their

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,100
prior experience and expectations about

00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:40,740
computing and data more generally and

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,409
how this might relate to their approach

00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,270
to learning and problem solving

00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:47,390
therefore our goals and what we know

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,170
about our learners have a bi-directional

00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:51,000
relationship where these learning

00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:54,060
objectives and our knowledge of our

00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,799
learners inform each other and this

00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,780
relationship is present in all learning

00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,770
contexts so today I'm going to talk

00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,240
about how this works in the

00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,829
non-traditional classroom where this

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,460
relationship is so important that

00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:08,300
sometimes overlooked so my objectives

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,379
for today are to identify different

00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:13,920
non-traditional data science classrooms

00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:15,270
I want to also consider how learning

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,220
are informed by learners in the

00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:19,620
non-traditional classroom and then also

00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,660
talked about some best practices for

00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:25,170
teaching data science skills to a

00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:27,840
diverse audience of learners so here's a

00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:30,150
really quick roadmap on the course where

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,440
each stop of the way corresponds to each

00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,540
of our objectives

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,790
well I define what a non-traditional

00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,350
classroom is well think about our goals

00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,490
and how they're informed by our learners

00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:41,370
and then we'll consider different

00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:43,260
practices from pedagogical research in a

00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,180
formal classroom that can be applied to

00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,760
the non-traditional settings that I want

00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:50,640
to talk about so let's get started so

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,709
first I want to start by defining what a

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,890
non-traditional classroom is what do I

00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:58,680
mean when I say this phrase I kind of

00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:01,610
I'm going to cheat by starting to talk

00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,959
about what a traditional classroom is so

00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:06,780
for the purposes of today we're going to

00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:09,390
consider a non-traditional class not a

00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,950
non-traditional one so be a formal long

00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,750
term course what you might consider the

00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:15,480
traditional semester long class that you

00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:17,280
take in college or high school we

00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,410
consider this to be an environment that

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,540
holds learners accountable for engaging

00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:24,780
with course material through assignments

00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:26,450
grades and whatnot other assessments so

00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,260
then what does this mean for

00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:30,510
non-traditional what do we mean by

00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,950
non-traditional for the purposes of this

00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:35,130
talk this literally just means

00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:39,780
everything else any learning environment

00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:42,030
that isn't what I just described so we

00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:45,120
have this opportunity to make every

00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:47,010
environment a classroom so we have this

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,829
spectrum of learning and learning

00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:53,250
environments from the traditional course

00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:55,320
that I just described to you to how we

00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:58,049
learn through our everyday experiences

00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:01,320
experience alerting and there are many

00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:02,910
opportunities that land in between for

00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,070
instance it could be a structured

00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:08,850
short-term workshop or training like

00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:11,790
those offered by software carpentry it

00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:14,549
could be an online learning material

00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:16,380
that you peruse at your own pace it

00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:18,479
could also be less formal structures

00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:20,310
such as peer learning formats where

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,710
peers or colleagues share their skills

00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:24,520
and mentor each other an example of this

00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:27,340
might be a local meetup

00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:29,740
and then finally we learn so much from

00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:31,360
experience so many data scientists

00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:33,099
people I just consider experts and

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,169
superstars they say that they learn by

00:04:33,099 --> 00:04:37,240
doing and this is perhaps their favorite

00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:39,629
way of learning and I can't help but

00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,629
agree

00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:45,729
so why dive into the non-traditional

00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:47,080
classroom why embrace this spectrum and

00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:49,090
think about these different learning

00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:52,270
environments that we have there are so

00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:53,889
many different advantages first of all

00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:56,440
the best way to sharpen your skillset is

00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:59,470
to teach teaching is a wonderful way to

00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:01,419
engage with course concepts or just

00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:03,940
material or anything in a different way

00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:06,120
it can help build your expertise in a

00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:07,840
specific subject or skill set

00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,449
non-traditional means that we can be

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,220
particularly flexible our teaching isn't

00:05:10,449 --> 00:05:14,470
a degree program that needs to meet

00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,759
accreditation requirements we can be

00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:18,520
creative with how we disseminate

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,110
knowledge this is also just a great way

00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:23,080
to create a learning community where we

00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:25,060
can all learn from each other of course

00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,250
with every advantage there's some

00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:28,930
challenges um teachers say that there's

00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,580
never enough time in their semester or

00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,560
year-long courses to do everything they

00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,180
want to do and this is maybe even more

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,020
so the case in a non-traditional

00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,180
environment

00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:39,159
we're also limited with what we can ask

00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:42,009
learners to do beyond our face-to-face

00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:43,900
interactions with them finally learners

00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:46,090
can be coming from different disciplines

00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,740
different experiences or assumptions

00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:49,810
about the topic that we're going to talk

00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:52,599
about and this can impact their approach

00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:55,300
to learning so we don't always take the

00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:57,279
time to get to know these things about

00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,319
our learners but it's always really

00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:02,949
important for setting our learning goals

00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:07,210
and objectives so on that note what are

00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:09,159
our learning objectives first let's make

00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:11,710
have an operational definition of what

00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:13,750
learning objectives are learning

00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:15,699
objectives are a statement and specific

00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:17,770
and measurable terms of the intellectual

00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:20,050
skills and abilities of student will

00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:22,840
develop in a given course this is a very

00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:25,050
formal definition very textbook like but

00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:27,250
it's very applicable to a

00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:28,479
non-traditional learning context through

00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,880
learning objectives we get to

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,830
communicate to both anyone who's in an

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,539
instructional role as well as a learning

00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:36,759
role in our context and that's really

00:06:34,539 --> 00:06:38,090
really important so our steps for

00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:41,060
formulating a learning

00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:42,889
give you we should consider these two

00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,510
different questions especially in the

00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:46,370
non-traditional context who are our

00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:49,340
learners and what are our logistical

00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:52,639
constraints so first we want our

00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:54,169
objectives to be learner centered and so

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,730
learning objectives communicate the

00:06:54,169 --> 00:06:57,650
goals and purpose of our teaching

00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:59,960
context to everyone and we want to

00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:02,510
tailor our goals to the learners in our

00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,610
classroom whatever that for me whatever

00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:06,620
form that classroom may take so it's

00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:08,660
helpful to ask these questions about our

00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:11,180
learners first what are the learners

00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:13,070
backgrounds and interests what is their

00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,990
previous experience with the topic and

00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:18,200
then also why are they interested in

00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:20,930
learning so by answering these questions

00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:24,169
we can determine what topics that we

00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:27,410
want to prioritize to learn about during

00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:29,060
our non-traditional context we also can

00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:31,430
think about what are the relevant use

00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:34,250
cases and examples that we can use to

00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:36,650
help others learn so is there a data set

00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:39,500
that's particularly relevant or a use

00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:41,690
case that we can zoom in on when we work

00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,870
together on different data techniques

00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:46,220
that can help motivate learners

00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:49,010
additionally answering these questions

00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:51,260
and determining who our learners are can

00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:53,150
impact how we communicate with others in

00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,919
our learning environment different

00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:57,860
learners have different motivations for

00:07:54,919 --> 00:07:59,660
learning the same things so how do you

00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:01,100
explain things in the rationale for

00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:03,050
learning them to those who are super

00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:05,120
interested in it and for those who don't

00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:07,250
see an immediate application by

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,110
understanding our learners better we can

00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:11,389
put on different hats when communicating

00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,620
to better understand where our learners

00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:15,460
are coming from and where other

00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:19,160
instructors are coming from as well as

00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:20,000
an instructor we feel limited in time

00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,560
and resources

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,050
especially in our non-traditional

00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,650
classrooms so we do need to consider our

00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:29,720
logistical constraints when we goal set

00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:32,000
so as a result our learning objectives

00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:34,010
need to be smart and by smart I mean

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,680
specific measurable achievable relevant

00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:38,719
and transparent by being smart we're

00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:41,029
creating these pertinent experiences

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,039
that are attainable given our time and

00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:44,959
logistical constraints so we want our

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:48,680
learning objectives to be particularly

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:51,860
specific achievable relevant and we want

00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:54,860
students to understand how these

00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:56,570
characteristics play into the learning

00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:59,899
environment that we're in making it

00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:01,700
transparent so for example given the

00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:04,190
time constraints in a week-long course

00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:06,140
we might ask learners to generate a

00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:07,850
script for a scatter plot so our

00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:10,279
learning objective might be write a

00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:13,130
script that loads a CSV file and creates

00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:16,180
a scatter plot our so in a week long we

00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:18,649
can ask them to generate new material in

00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:20,540
contrast if we only have two hours with

00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:22,610
our students we might just be equipping

00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:25,399
them with the skills to get started so

00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:27,440
maybe for a two hour tutorial my

00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:29,089
objective might be identify the parts of

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,950
a script that create a scatter plot and

00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:32,959
are and these are important

00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:34,790
considerations to create flexible

00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:39,380
objectives for our different learning

00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:42,380
environments and learners so on that

00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:45,079
note once we have our goal set and our

00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:48,709
learning objectives articulated what do

00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:52,760
we do now so a couple things that I

00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:54,500
suggest that hopefully we and the

00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:58,430
educator here can take away from this

00:09:54,500 --> 00:10:01,430
talk is establishing a feedback practice

00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:05,209
cycle and equip learners for continued

00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:07,339
learning and practice so first of all we

00:10:05,209 --> 00:10:10,820
want to establish this feedback practice

00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:12,949
cycle what do I mean by this generally

00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,390
we don't have that much time in our

00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:16,399
learning environment so all

00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:18,620
opportunities for practice need to be

00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:21,350
maximally informative and relevant to

00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:23,690
the learning objectives and so that

00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:26,290
means that everything both practice and

00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:28,579
feedback must be goal driven

00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:30,140
specifically what we practice is

00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:32,839
directed by our learning goals and

00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:35,300
objectives and in order for feedback to

00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:37,880
be constructive it needs to be informed

00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:43,220
by our goals and provide future

00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:46,279
directions for later practice so for

00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:48,949
example if we're thinking back to our

00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:50,930
learning objective identify the parts of

00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:55,160
a script that create a scatterplot and

00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:59,060
are instead of asking our learners to

00:10:55,160 --> 00:11:01,399
write out this whole chunk of code I

00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:03,050
might only ask them to zoom in on

00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:04,490
specific pieces of the scripts that

00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:05,120
directly relates to the learning

00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:07,220
objective

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,800
and modify these change these and see

00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:11,870
what happens so kind of making sure that

00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,910
it's a little bit more targeted given

00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:17,170
the time that we have and given the

00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:22,070
context that we're in five minutes

00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:24,710
awesome thank you when we give

00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:26,900
informative feedback we're emphasizing

00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:30,860
the process and not the kind of product

00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:32,600
so we're discussing and highlighting

00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:35,420
steps and double-checks that are useful

00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:38,089
for future practice and we're working as

00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:39,950
partners with fellow learners we're

00:11:38,089 --> 00:11:41,750
asking about their process for learning

00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:44,150
and problem-solving we're understanding

00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:46,070
where they they're coming from and then

00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:48,650
this can inform the feedback that you

00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:51,080
give in turn and that's a really useful

00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:52,670
thing to have is this great flowing

00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:56,230
conversation where we're understanding

00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:56,230
processes on both sides

00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:02,060
finally we're connecting feedback with

00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:05,779
our personal learning experiences as

00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:07,820
prior and present learners we want to

00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:10,459
show empathy by referring to our

00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:11,870
connections with a learning process by

00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:13,700
discussing your personal train of

00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,839
thought or workflow when coming across

00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,760
an error a mistake

00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:18,500
you're showing learners that there are

00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,510
speed bumps and that's normal there are

00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:23,300
mistakes and that's normal and it's

00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:25,459
there's no right answer necessarily and

00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:28,010
that's totally okay and part of the

00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:29,570
process so a non-traditional classroom

00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:31,310
just has more room for this

00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:32,779
collaboration and partnership where

00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:37,190
everyone's a learner and where we can

00:12:32,779 --> 00:12:39,830
all grow from each other so finally

00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:42,470
thinking about how to equip our learners

00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:44,540
for continued learning when we have a

00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:46,250
learning environment we wanted to have

00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:48,440
we wanted to have this effect where

00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:50,990
we're encouraging everyone there to

00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:53,810
continue working on it outside and

00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:58,339
beyond your face-to-face interactions

00:12:53,810 --> 00:13:00,440
with them so on that note we want to

00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:02,750
intrude introduce learners to open

00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,640
source resources for further learning so

00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:07,010
the best resources are the ones that are

00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:09,709
vetted by our trusted peers so you

00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:11,480
become a trusted resource that can give

00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:15,440
them the scoop and the pro tips and the

00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:18,320
best places to look but also you should

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:21,170
model how you use these resources

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,660
other show others how there are

00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:26,540
different ways that you troubleshoot

00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:27,950
think about how you pull up certain help

00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,600
documentation how you've conducted

00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:32,210
Google search when you don't know what's

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,520
going on by sharing ideas and best

00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:37,880
practices and commiserating together

00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:39,500
we're able to build a community to keep

00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:43,040
learning and practicing with each other

00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:45,560
so it's important to point out these

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,660
resources show how you use them take

00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,920
advantage of the local resources that

00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,110
might be around through a meet-up

00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:54,440
through our Lee's and the carpentry x'

00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:56,960
which is the way that my co-authors and

00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,200
i all met and if there aren't any of

00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:01,310
these available to you your

00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,290
non-traditional learning context is a

00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:05,930
really perfect platform and segue to

00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:07,640
creating one so creating a space for

00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:09,110
people to learn together whether that's

00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,840
online or in person

00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:13,760
I think the non-traditional classroom

00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:16,850
context is a really great catalyst for

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,860
that and this is also just a great segue

00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:22,850
into Angela's talk which is coming up

00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:26,600
next so some takeaways that I want to

00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:28,520
impart with you before I finish is first

00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,350
of all the non-traditional classroom is

00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,880
this amazing opportunity to explore

00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:34,940
creative methods for learning and to

00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:36,440
build this amazing community however all

00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:38,930
learning communities should have goals

00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:41,480
that are centered around the learners to

00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:44,390
create these achievable and relevant

00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:47,450
ways to learn and facilitate our

00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:49,640
learning together and then we should

00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:51,170
equip learners for future practice by

00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:54,440
building these learning communities and

00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:56,000
having them continue what the

00:14:54,440 --> 00:15:01,040
non-traditional classroom context is

00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,750
started and on that note here are all

00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,630
those takeaways and I just want to say

00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:07,520
thank you and you can find me on any of

00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:09,410
these platforms as well as on the slack

00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:12,100
Channel I'm happy to talk to you in

00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:14,570
person and offline thank you so much

00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:19,100
thank you so much Catherine that was

00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:22,280
fantastic it looks like we have time for

00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:23,990
at least one question so in the Q&A it

00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:26,030
says for feedback do you prefer live

00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:30,530
feedback or feedback at the end of the

00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:31,470
lesson slash session that's a really

00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:34,170
good question

00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:37,440
I think it really depends on your

00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:41,370
context in the vein of having good

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,900
collaboration and having having a

00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:45,510
partnership with the learners that are

00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:48,300
in your context having it be a

00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:51,720
continuous loop or somewhere where it's

00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:53,570
more intermixed as opposed to just at

00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,190
the end I think might work a lot better

00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:58,740
but it really depends I think that there

00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:00,720
are places where and are even learners

00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,970
who want the full picture before they

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:06,450
ask questions and others who are itchy

00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:08,820
to ask before they before everything's

00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:12,510
done so I think it's there's no

00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:15,740
one-size-fits-all to that thank you

00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:15,740
