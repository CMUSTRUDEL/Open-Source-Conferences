Title: Mateusz Kuzak - Growing and Supporting Open and Inclusive Research Software Culture
Publication date: 2020-05-28
Playlist: CSVConf 2020
Description: 
	Research Software Engineering combines an intricate understanding of research with expertise in programming and software engineering. Making the process of contribution and participation in research software projects more inclusive and welcoming for a diverse audience will lead to the software better for all researchers. The complexity and domain specificity of research software poses unique challenges for community building and external contributions. How can we help researchers and Research Software Engineers  make their projects more inclusive for the users and contributors with different backgrounds? I hope to share some insight I gained working with different communities in the open science, research and data spaces, from global movements like the Carpentries and Mozilla Open Leaders, to local hacky hours, study groups and Reprohacks. I wish to discuss and explore with the community some of the practices that I think are transferable into the research software community and can help lower the barriers for contribution.

okay um hello

00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,480
uh my name is matosh kultak i'm a

00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,080
community manager at the netherlands

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,639
science center and at the science center

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,759
we work with researchers

00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,960
and we develop research software to help

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,400
them

00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,960
move forward their research that

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,519
requires some more expertise in

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,240
research software development data

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,640
handling

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,039
efficient data computing and over the

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,760
past years we have developed over the

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,120
100 research software packages we have

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,559
published over 100

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:39,040
lists of software packages and but we do

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,879
realize we actually don't have that many

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,879
contributions from the outside of the

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,559
projects and not many users from the

00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,160
outside of the project

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,239
we collaborate closely with the

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,600
researchers that we already know

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,039
that we work in the projects but

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,039
there is not much interaction with the

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,039
outside and that's something that we

00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:01,039
would really like to change

00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:04,479
and i will be talking about it today

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,840
and this is uh my perspective is

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,600
how can we improve it for research

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,640
software but actually the things that i

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,159
will be talking about

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,760
i think can apply to other software

00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,600
it can also apply to other things not

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,439
only research software but some things

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,880
in the research culture and how do we

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,439
perform research and how do we

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,439
collaborate

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:27,439
so uh why open and inclusive

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,600
and i think first of all i think it's

00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:33,040
the right way to do it

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:36,159
but also being more pragmatic um

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,200
we want to attract more diverse group of

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,920
contributors

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,119
and we also want to have more diverse

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,119
group of users and

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:50,560
people who work with our software

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,560
and so

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,280
i've been thinking about how we can

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,079
improve it and i've i've been lucky

00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,600
enough to be

00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,960
involved in a lot of uh amazing projects

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,479
in past years

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,880
uh and i want to give some um

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,239
summary or like lessons learned from my

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,840
interactions in

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,280
with those projects communities

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,599
initiatives

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,959
what i have learned from what i really

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,879
appreciate

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,879
about what they're doing and how that

00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,879
can be applies to improving the

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,200
to making research software community

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,000
and software community collaborative

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,319
communities

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,239
more inclusive more open and leading to

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,879
my more diverse

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,879
communities

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,920
so first of all we do

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,720
always like we start with encouraging uh

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,720
open

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,120
uh rest open software open source

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,160
software uh but this is definitely not

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,840
enough uh and i think we're

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,000
we're all getting better in developing

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,040
research software and being being

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,400
more open using open platforms

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:59,840
and the more projects

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,680
adhere to standards they provide

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,680
very good readme files they provide

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,480
contributing guidelines

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,680
they also implement code of conduct

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,840
there are more and more

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,440
resources available how to do it we can

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,080
learn from each other

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,640
and this is very important we for

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,640
example

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,000
on github you can now see you can go to

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,159
the insights

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,040
tab and you can learn how your project

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,959
is doing

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,120
does it adhere to standards community

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,640
standards which are there

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,120
and how you can improve those things if

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,080
you're missing something

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,799
you can learn how how can you add this

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,440
information

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:38,239
how can you help your contributors

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,640
interacting with your project

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,400
and there are also projects like chaos

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,760
which develops the metrics that measure

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,319
community

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,799
activity contributions contributions and

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,640
help

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,640
of your community

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,239
and i think like this is really the the

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,319
step

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,840
in the good direction because you needed

00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,480
at the same time i realize

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,159
uh in the work i'm doing that this is

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,239
really not enough this is

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,000
the the passive way it's there if people

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,319
find your project they will see it

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,360
but it does not necessarily mean that if

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,480
they see

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,200
a beautiful very well written readme

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,239
file

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,160
in your project that that's enough to

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:19,440
for them to join the project and feel

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,400
comfortable and feel

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,440
invited to join the project so what can

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,720
we do better

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,400
uh i think we can be more proactive in

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,240
what you're doing and

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:35,440
with attracting and interacting with

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,759
potential contributors um and one

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,440
one way of doing it is participating in

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,240
sprints

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,040
and i have some examples uh not every

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,560
sprint is

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:49,280
equal i have some good examples

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,400
but springs in general are very good way

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,400
to pitch your project

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,240
to make it more visible but also to

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,000
infect others with your passion for your

00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,199
software for the for the project that

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,320
you're working on

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,919
and and also just for

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,440
let's like starting this human

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:08,320
interaction which i think is

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,080
it's very important um we shouldn't be

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,280
forgetting about it

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,919
um so good examples are uh by a

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,039
hackathon

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,639
european edition there's also japanese

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,560
edition that i haven't participated in

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,919
so i cannot say anything about it

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,600
uh last year i have participated in

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,800
bioinformatics open source conference

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,360
call fest

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,360
which stands for collaborative festival

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,240
uh e-life innovation sprint and in the

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,400
past years

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,000
i also contribute contributed and

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,280
collaborated

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,840
in the mozilla grover sprint um so these

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,320
are the

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,919
the examples of the sprints that uh

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,240
allow you to submit your project

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,840
and then you can find contributors to

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,960
your project

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,400
and work with them and there are also

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,199
other uh

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,280
similar uh events i think the nice

00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,000
example is the touring way which is

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,479
uh about the touring way book which is

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,400
uh

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,479
the guys to open and representable

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,560
research and so i have to give the shout

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:09,680
out to malvika who's in the audience

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,039
somewhere there uh if you have if you

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,680
don't know about it you should check it

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,639
out

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,319
uh the touring by book dash that's the

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,199
sprint that i have participated

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,800
earlier this year uh was focused on

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,400
helping people to contribute to the

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,120
during way and even though this was

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,360
about

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,479
um the product project itself the during

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,000
way project

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:32,319
uh it really was about helping

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,520
new contributors bring their own ideas

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,560
into the project

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:40,240
and developing those ideas and and then

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:42,160
becoming part of the community

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,960
and of course you can organize your own

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:48,720
sprint um

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,160
so um before you

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,840
join the sprint i think it's very

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,000
important that you think about

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,919
uh what are the different ways that uh

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,759
people can contribute to your project

00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,840
uh what are the different skills and

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,880
expertise that you're looking for

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:06,000
and being able to describe it and

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,479
to be able to attract the the people who

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,720
can

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:14,479
uh contribute to the project but also um

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,479
you want to be able to

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,440
accommodate people with different

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,680
backgrounds and with different expertise

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,560
uh so you you want to be able to support

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,240
them in that if

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,840
there might be contributors that not

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,560
necessarily use github or they don't

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,560
know git

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,560
how do they still are valuable

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,440
contributors how are we going to support

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,360
them

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,199
but also people have different styles of

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,560
work and you have to think about in

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,680
advance

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,400
how to support this how maybe there are

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,080
people who

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,240
are not they're not comfortable

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,000
working in in large spaces with a lot of

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,960
people with a lot of noise

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,520
and you can talk to the organizers maybe

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,520
there's a

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,440
silent room that you can they can work

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,800
in or maybe you can bring the headphones

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,879
and

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,479
provide the headphones so that they can

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,199
uh work in the way that they

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,759
feel comfortable in because uh there we

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,319
all have

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:09,120
our different styles of work and that

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,120
should be supported

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:16,080
and also i think it's important that the

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,919
event organizers also think about it and

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,879
the events that i haven't participated

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,000
in they really

00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:26,000
emphasize this and they make the project

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,919
uh owners think about it in advance

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,639
how they're going to accommodate

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,639
contributors

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,880
the next step when you find the

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:37,519
contributors to your project

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,200
uh is doing the onboarding process on

00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,640
board them into your project

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,120
and i think it's very important not to

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:47,040
forget how important it is the

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:49,279
the human interaction and uh that

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,959
the best documentation and that the best

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,680
processes will not

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,320
uh replace that so think about how you

00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,680
can

00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,720
uh contribute how we can on

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:03,200
onboard your contributors uh because

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,800
uh most likely contributing to your

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,000
project is much more complicated than

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,279
you think it is

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,880
and so you can learn with them what are

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,279
the barriers to contribute to your

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,279
projects what what are their experiences

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,120
and how you can adapt the processes to

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,760
make it easier

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,200
um and one example is from the

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:25,600
carpentries community

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,600
the maintenance onboarding project

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:37,360
so the you can so

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:41,519
the next step is supporting uh and

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:43,920
helping the community grow and that's

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,839
you can do it with the uh into like

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,480
increasing the opportunities to interact

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,720
of interactions with community and with

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,640
the project leads and

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,480
you can organize community calls um

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,320
and through those calls you can meet and

00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,839
get to know your contributors which is

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,560
very important

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,320
you can learn about their challenges

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,079
working with the project

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:10,720
um and

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:12,000
also you you will again learn how about

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,040
how they work

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,160
and uh i have two examples of that one

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,600
is the carpenter's

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,959
discussion sessions uh so i have been

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,640
involved for a few years now in the

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,079
carpentries but actually

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,079
through the discussion sessions there

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,839
are kind of community calls organized by

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:31,519
the carpenters back then it was

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:35,040
the software carpentry uh organization

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:37,600
and through participating in those

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,720
uh calls i have became the part of the

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,760
community i learned

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,240
more about uh what the community is

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,240
doing

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,959
what are the projects how i can

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,880
contribute to them

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,240
and that's helped me grow within this

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,240
community

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,640
and and then the recent example is the

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,079
touring way collaboration cafe

00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,839
and i also mentioned it here because

00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,440
this is a great example of

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,959
learning how people are working and

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,959
helping people

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,000
finding their way in the project so the

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,120
the touring way

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,399
malvika and christie who are leading the

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,399
project

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,600
are organizing regular online meetings

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,760
where you can come in

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,120
you can say hello you can discuss

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,600
potential contributions

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,240
contributions to the project and you can

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,399
also

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,519
collaborate working during so it can be

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,079
a working

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,800
working session when you can work either

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,279
from the

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,720
from people from the project or with

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,920
other contributors

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,480
on something that you would like to

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,040
contribute um so i really like that

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,760
because

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,800
i've been recently joining those calls a

00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,800
few times

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,720
when i think about something that i

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,160
might have i think that i can have that

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,800
i can contribute

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,440
i can join in the call i can discuss it

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,640
uh

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:52,959
and see how that my contributions can

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:57,839
fit in and also how we can make it more

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,839
usable within the project

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,519
and then that can be actually extended

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:07,360
into the more structured mentoring

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:10,079
program and mentoring is very important

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,480
to help your community grow to explore

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:15,760
the opportunities within the project

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,959
um and mentoring can be or

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,880
organized through the community calls

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:23,519
but i think it's also

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,440
worth considering more structured

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,800
mentoring with the mentoring teams

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:32,240
with mentors pairing mentors and mentees

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:34,160
and and it also helps the

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,920
the participants to adopt the growth

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,760
mindset

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,519
everyone is learning in those projects

00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,440
it's the contributors are learning the

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,959
experts are learning the project pi's

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,959
are

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:53,040
learning there and it also helps with

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:56,560
fighting the imposter syndrome

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:59,360
okay so how this is a lot of things

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,079
and this this requires a lot of skills

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,639
and

00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,160
so and and very often the people who

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,160
developed pressure software

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,279
are researchers who have been trained to

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,120
work in the wet lab

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,519
or they have trained to analyze data but

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,959
they

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,880
have not necessarily been trained in

00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,120
working with the communities with

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:22,000
building

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,279
communities managing them uh and

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,200
interacting with people

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:28,720
and leading them so i wanted to give a

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,760
shout out to two projects

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,240
that have are still running and

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,880
one is open life sciences and the other

00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,480
one is e-life innovation leaders

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,600
and they they provide mentoring and

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:44,639
training of on open science

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,320
related topics and i think what

00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,760
so i've been participating in this

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,440
program and

00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:54,399
my takeaway is that that's equally

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,320
important that the

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,600
the expertise that is provided and the

00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,720
learning experience

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,120
it's equally important as

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,519
gaining the connection with other

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:09,440
participants with other mentors

00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:11,120
with other mentees and with mentors and

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,199
so i think that that's one of the ways

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:16,800
to approach

00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:19,040
this that's how we can learn um

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,839
and one last thing we have to remember

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,079
is a journey

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,519
so we have to embrace the growth mindset

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,120
we have to keep learning

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,040
and we're not necessarily going to get

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,279
it right from the beginning

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,560
but we can improve and we should keep

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,240
the conversations because

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,000
if we want to improve we have to talk to

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,120
our contributors or potential

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,600
contributors

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:41,199
and learn about what is their experience

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,360
and also the technology is not

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,519
everything it's there for to help us

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,079
uh but we it cannot replace the human

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:50,800
interactions

00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,519
okay thank you and if you have any

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,440
questions

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,000
feel free to ask yeah so thank you for

00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,560
that i

00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,160
we do have a few questions and um just

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,800
for those that are joining um

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,639
we also have a slack channel a slack

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:08,720
workplace that's available and there

00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:10,800
is a slack channel set up for csv

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,720
q a and so matthias will be available

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,519
there to continue the discussion after

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,800
this

00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,320
yes yeah so if you if if you haven't

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,839
already signed up for that slack channel

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,320
please go and do that now and

00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,320
then you'll be able to communicate with

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,839
all the speakers throughout the event

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,040
um so yeah so i think some of the

00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,760
questions that were coming in were

00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,160
really about

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,680
learning more um regarding some of the

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,399
initiatives because it's like i mean one

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,800
of the great things about the

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,880
presentation is how you're leveraging

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,800
other initiatives like the carpentries

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:42,320
or the turing institute

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:44,480
um or e-life's uh sprints

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,920
um and really just trying to figure out

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,959
more i think one one big

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:51,680
theme was um just learning more about

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,639
sprint-based work uh like book sprints

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,680
or

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:58,000
book dash these types of things

00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,519
i'm familiar with the book sprints model

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,160
and the book sprints organization but

00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,279
maybe you want to just

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,639
explain a little bit more about how

00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,040
people could learn more about that

00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,040
process

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:11,440
about how to run those or yeah

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:18,320
yes i don't have a good uh

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:19,680
yeah so i think you should talk to

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,759
people who organize those

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,279
those events so you can talk for example

00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,880
amit sang who is also there in the

00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,639
audience and on slack

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,560
who organized the e-life sprint last

00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,279
year and she organized the sprint this

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,040
year

00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:34,399
uh talked to maldika who organized the

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:36,320
book dash um

00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,320
i think that it's a steep learning curve

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,079
to organize yourself this print

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,399
uh but you can start small you can you

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,920
can organize uh i mean the the

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,480
sprints most of the sprints that i

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,360
mentioned are like multi-project sprints

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,199
but you can

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,880
start with something uh around your

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,920
project that's probably what you will be

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,040
interested in

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,720
yeah um in the first place so

00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,320
it doesn't have to be big you can you

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,880
can organize a small

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,959
event you can even start with with like

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,480
a informal cafe event where we even

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,039
invite people to come

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,640
and discuss the project and see how

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:11,520
people can contribute

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,360
although no we cannot meet in a cafe uh

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,919
for now but maybe you can organize

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:18,959
online meetings

00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:21,199
yeah and i think put a link in the chat

00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,400
