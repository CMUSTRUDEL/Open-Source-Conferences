Title: Mateusz Kuzak - Growing and Supporting Open and Inclusive Research Software Culture
Publication date: 2020-05-28
Playlist: CSVConf 2020
Description: 
	Research Software Engineering combines an intricate understanding of research with expertise in programming and software engineering. Making the process of contribution and participation in research software projects more inclusive and welcoming for a diverse audience will lead to the software better for all researchers. The complexity and domain specificity of research software poses unique challenges for community building and external contributions. How can we help researchers and Research Software Engineers  make their projects more inclusive for the users and contributors with different backgrounds? I hope to share some insight I gained working with different communities in the open science, research and data spaces, from global movements like the Carpentries and Mozilla Open Leaders, to local hacky hours, study groups and Reprohacks. I wish to discuss and explore with the community some of the practices that I think are transferable into the research software community and can help lower the barriers for contribution.
