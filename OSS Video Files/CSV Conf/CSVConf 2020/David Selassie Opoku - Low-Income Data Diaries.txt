Title: David Selassie Opoku - Low-Income Data Diaries
Publication date: 2020-05-28
Playlist: CSVConf 2020
Description: 
	How would you communicate a data visualisation through radio or remotely teach data journalism to a team of freelance journalists with access to 1GB RAM laptops and spotty internet? How does a civic technologist without access to a credit card get access to cloud services for her community contracts monitoring app? How do you explain the importance of data privacy to a community of farmers who could not complete basic school. [Hopefully in 2020], most people will not deny the transformative power of data literacy in the digital age. Whether you’re a journalist, a business owner, a government official, an activist, a researcher or a student, knowing how to access the right data, transform them into information and leverage its insights for decision-making and action has become a life skill. Take a journey with me as we travel to and alongside several data community members working in low-income context and hear  experiences of how their “low-tech” (LOW-TECHnical knowledge and LOW-TECHnological tools/resources) contexts, are elevating and challenging gaps in the current data community and driving opportunities to rethink and shape how the data community can make data skills and tools accessible to more.

thanks John thanks everyone welcome to

00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:09,599
day two of she has become friends it's

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,490
exciting to be back here and really

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,630
inspired by all that is good happen

00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:18,359
since yesterday I am going to be talking

00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:21,420
about low income data diets and my name

00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,430
is David Selassie Opoku and that key

00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:27,180
thing I'll be exploring is how low tech

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:31,349
data experiences can inspire accessible

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:38,040
data skills until design so a little bit

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:42,120
about myself I call myself a data

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:44,129
plumber and what I really entails is I

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,980
think about my role as helping

00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:48,719
organizations individuals communities to

00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:52,980
figure out how they can use data for for

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:56,370
the hour to make the right decisions if

00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,239
we can go to the next slide in case you

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,510
don't know what I look like

00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:05,909
yes a very blurry picture half of my

00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:09,049
face in darkness but my work since 2014

00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:11,640
has been working with civic tech

00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:14,549
entrepreneurs to civil society

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:18,360
organizations journalists governments

00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:20,939
all across different countries and over

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,890
five continents I do have a background

00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:23,970
in biology and computer science but one

00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,700
of the things I learned really quickly

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,500
was despite all the power that data and

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,079
technology can build the people actually

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,700
needed that to deliver the work that

00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:35,520
matters to society we're not able to

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,590
access that so shifted my efforts to see

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,020
what it would take to unlock these

00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:42,990
skills for these reformers and what they

00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:45,540
do as you can see some past affiliations

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:48,299
this with a tech incubator the school of

00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,350
data open knowledge foundation and open

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:50,729
contracts and partnership have

00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:58,380
contributed to a lot of these

00:01:50,729 --> 00:02:01,820
experiences I will be talking about go

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:04,340
to the next slide one so

00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:07,400
take the world today being that we real

00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:09,080
world we have people or stakeholders are

00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,850
trying to make decision so that's the

00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,310
the aerobats towards the bottom left

00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:15,590
bottle bottom right and there's this

00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:18,230
complex set of steps that you have to go

00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:21,080
through in order to get to that but we

00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:22,730
do agree that data is valuable data is a

00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,990
key resource some people use the term

00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:26,270
data is the new oil

00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:29,600
I do not prefer that I tend to say data

00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:32,300
is actually oxygen because it can be a

00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:38,630
limited resource but it's essential to

00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:42,620
the way we go about doing things so if

00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:44,690
then if data is oxygen in the digital

00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:47,900
age in order to thrive in the digital in

00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:51,410
the Information Age then what role can

00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:53,390
we play for performers that are actually

00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:56,440
doing things that can have a significant

00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:56,440
impact on society

00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:06,769
so my naive approach or my thought is we

00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:10,180
need to then move from a data chip

00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:14,540
Society pun intended to one in which

00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:18,310
data enables action and that's what I

00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:26,660
set up to do starting out from 24 14 and

00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:32,720
my young and adventurous on path data

00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:34,700
literacy so what is data literacy there

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,290
are several definitions but thinking

00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:43,130
about literacy it's the ability to read

00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:44,780
to write to be able to access I'll be

00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:47,480
comfortable with the resources you need

00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:49,970
to go out around working with data using

00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:58,030
data and that's what in the next slide

00:03:49,970 --> 00:04:00,640
that is captured a little bit so this is

00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:02,650
very good report that was done by the

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,450
Center for humanitarian data and I had

00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:07,650
encouraged most of you to check it out

00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:09,490
and they did a survey of different

00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:11,590
humanitarians of people who work in the

00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:13,600
field and this is one of the definitions

00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,830
that they came up with and some of the

00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,500
insight that they learned but I think

00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,859
there's a good summary of what what that

00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:22,660
is

00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:24,190
looks like so data literacy we need two

00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:26,290
things we need data skills and we need

00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:28,419
data tools we are gonna mix all these

00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:30,850
things up and then we'll get literate

00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:33,400
reformers or people working in the data

00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:35,410
space the other stakeholders and we will

00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:43,390
solve the challenge of the digital age

00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:45,970
so that was my thinking next slide the

00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:47,860
way I came to encounter how data

00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:50,830
illiteracy was being done was that we

00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,540
were trying to move stakeholders from

00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:54,640
where they were in terms of their skills

00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,979
and the tools to a point where they

00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,990
could access the skills that existed or

00:04:56,979 --> 00:05:04,300
the tools that existed for them to

00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:05,560
become do deliveries delivery so when it

00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,890
comes to data skills it's about

00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,510
upskilling so what does that until

00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:12,970
examples be maybe we're a data

00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:14,740
stakeholders given skills that allow her

00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:17,770
to access existing data literacy

00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:20,140
paradigms so for example teaching a

00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:24,970
generalist how to scrape a PDF with

00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:27,880
tabula when it comes to tools I call

00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:30,160
that app tooling where you try to get a

00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:33,250
stakeholder or encourage them or support

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,500
them to access existing data tools so an

00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,840
example could be requiring a Civic

00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,520
technologists to sign up for a bank card

00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,880
or a bank account in order to access

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:47,310
cloud services the advanced features or

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,310
even the core features of cloud services

00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,600
so in just a summary if we look at data

00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:54,400
stakeholders on one end and then you

00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,039
look at their data skills and the data

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,930
tools that they need what the current

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,300
approach or the traditional approach

00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:03,400
which I call data literacy 1.0 is trying

00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,750
to do is trying to get them to move from

00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,650
where they are to where the data skills

00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,650
and vehicles are

00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:18,799
come on so what happens when this way of

00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:25,969
going about a delivery see means look

00:06:18,799 --> 00:06:28,969
low-tech reality so here are some dice

00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:31,519
that have come up with that capture some

00:06:28,969 --> 00:06:34,819
of the experiences that I did not expect

00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:36,739
in doing this so did I this week we ran

00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:39,619
a data journalism training for 30 radio

00:06:36,739 --> 00:06:41,359
journalists all as well until we got to

00:06:39,619 --> 00:06:43,519
the end of the data visualization module

00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:44,979
and one participant asked me how would

00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:51,709
you communicate a data visualization

00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:53,599
through radio next dear dear diary my

00:06:51,709 --> 00:06:55,729
team has been working with a US city

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,709
mayor's office to implement the open

00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:59,989
contracts and data standard to improve

00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:01,789
public contracts in significant

00:06:59,989 --> 00:07:04,219
technical effort is required to kick

00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:06,110
this off which the mayor's office does

00:07:04,219 --> 00:07:09,019
not have the personnel and the budget

00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:10,819
for how do we demonstrate the full

00:07:09,019 --> 00:07:17,599
potential the OCDs with these

00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:19,219
constraints the idatd ie we are about to

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,929
kick off at three months virtual data

00:07:19,219 --> 00:07:23,119
journalism training for six freelance

00:07:20,929 --> 00:07:25,339
journalists my goal for today's call was

00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:28,149
to agree on the dates the curriculum I'd

00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:30,860
like to design I quickly learned that

00:07:28,149 --> 00:07:33,499
you can see all these bunch of things in

00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:35,209
terms of not having the right computers

00:07:33,499 --> 00:07:37,129
to be able to actually access the tools

00:07:35,209 --> 00:07:38,869
and the skills that we want to not

00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:40,879
having the right setup and even being

00:07:38,869 --> 00:07:42,379
worried about what time do we spend in

00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:44,779
an amount of money double use and if

00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:49,009
they were involved in this training for

00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:50,809
too long another one at today's

00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:52,579
introduction to data science meetup only

00:07:50,809 --> 00:07:54,949
five out of the 30 participants were

00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:56,869
able to use the Amazon Web Services or

00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:59,389
Google cloud platform option for their

00:07:56,869 --> 00:08:02,089
model deployments the rest did not have

00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:03,919
a bank card to create a cloud accounts

00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:06,139
how do we increase access to such

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:11,299
critical data resources was for such

00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:13,789
participants and then finally their data

00:08:11,299 --> 00:08:15,349
diary the first day of this today was

00:08:13,789 --> 00:08:17,569
the first day of the training our plan

00:08:15,349 --> 00:08:19,309
was to learn how to use filters formulas

00:08:17,569 --> 00:08:22,129
and eventually pivot tables for data

00:08:19,309 --> 00:08:24,139
analysis yeah what what we ended up

00:08:22,129 --> 00:08:26,629
doing for six out of the

00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:28,099
learning how to install software find

00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:33,800
files and windows and navigate

00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:35,569
spreadsheets interfaces so as you can

00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,729
see I discovered that the traditional

00:08:35,569 --> 00:08:40,879
data literacy approaches did not work

00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:42,759
and these low-income context or low tech

00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:44,360
context and their number of these

00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:45,949
reasons for this

00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,810
I can't capture everything but there are

00:08:45,949 --> 00:08:49,939
historic and current income constraints

00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:52,519
that limits the ability of stakeholders

00:08:49,939 --> 00:08:54,050
in low-income contexts to access the

00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:56,540
current resources and the way we

00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:59,300
approach things and then also there is

00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:01,790
this promise of long term benefits you

00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:03,649
can gain from data literacy and it's

00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:05,540
worth investing the resources and the

00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:10,060
time to get there and that may not

00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:10,060
always work for people in these contexts

00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:15,529
so what are some of the gaps that

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,120
low-income context presents and what I

00:09:15,529 --> 00:09:19,310
learned from from being in these

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,810
contexts and there are two that I call

00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:22,550
low-tech but I wanted to break down what

00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,439
a low-tech is standing for so there's

00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:27,220
they're low technical data skills or

00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:29,839
knowledge which has different axe

00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:32,149
aspects little under experience or

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,500
exposure to non smart food operating

00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:35,870
system what do I mean by that some

00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:39,709
people actually have never used a

00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:41,629
Windows Linux or iOS computers so

00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:43,730
getting used to that interface is a

00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:45,559
challenge before you start training low

00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:48,980
English proficiency or even other

00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:53,149
popular Western languages are challenged

00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:55,069
and no programming background that's

00:09:53,149 --> 00:09:58,250
just a few examples of the low technical

00:09:55,069 --> 00:09:59,750
data skills or knowledge and then

00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,459
there's another dimension which is low

00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,439
access to technological tools or

00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:07,459
processes to be able to build these data

00:10:03,439 --> 00:10:08,809
skills so examples could be no formal

00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:10,279
bank account to access some of these

00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:12,170
resources because they require sometimes

00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:13,699
you just sign up for an account another

00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:18,769
credit card limited Internet

00:10:13,699 --> 00:10:22,850
connectivity slow computing device or

00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:26,540
not at all or manual data processes and

00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:32,959
systems as we saw in the city leaders

00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:35,029
office so these are not edge cases and

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:37,680
the reason why I say that is that there

00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:41,519
can be a perception that oh this is for

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:43,319
places in either and the African context

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,980
or in the Latin American context or in

00:10:43,319 --> 00:10:50,009
specific areas where there's a

00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:55,319
low-income Society but this can actually

00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:57,329
exist in high-income areas too so the

00:10:55,319 --> 00:10:59,100
point I wanted to make low-tech context

00:10:57,329 --> 00:11:02,790
do not only exist in low-income

00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:04,470
countries and it can happen as a result

00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:07,379
of limited access to high computing

00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:08,970
power due to emergencies there is the

00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:10,319
current nineteen padme that's left

00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:11,910
people working from home they may not

00:11:10,319 --> 00:11:14,999
have as much access to computer

00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:16,980
resources that they had before limited

00:11:14,999 --> 00:11:18,899
budgets due to prioritization for other

00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,730
goals and they reduce access to

00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:21,149
high-tech tools because of increased

00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,689
demand

00:11:21,149 --> 00:11:26,429
so these low-tech contests can become

00:11:23,689 --> 00:11:32,429
significant or applicable in event

00:11:26,429 --> 00:11:34,199
high-income countries in areas so the

00:11:32,429 --> 00:11:35,939
thing I learned quickly was our current

00:11:34,199 --> 00:11:37,920
approach to data literacy education is

00:11:35,939 --> 00:11:42,269
largely inaccessible to a large

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:44,220
population of data stakeholders and they

00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:47,670
tend to function in a limited context

00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:51,899
and with limited resources so what do we

00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:55,740
do about this can we have a new data

00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:57,779
literacy approach that will pay

00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:00,449
attention to low-tech contexts and I

00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:03,600
believe that there is some benefit that

00:12:00,449 --> 00:12:08,309
low-tech context presents to the way we

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:12,019
go about data literacy it can lead to

00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:12,019
increase access to more data stable this

00:12:13,069 --> 00:12:20,220
there can be increase in contextual

00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:22,019
innovation and affordability increased

00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,850
resilience and simplicity the fact that

00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:26,519
you have to simplify the way you deliver

00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:32,549
skills and tools means that they become

00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:35,220
much more resilient and also simple so

00:12:32,549 --> 00:12:37,019
this was the thing that we realized

00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,509
though I realized throughout the years

00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:41,759
and have been adapting my approach

00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:43,980
testing it out to see how we can get

00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:45,540
much closer to later stakeholders and

00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,129
where they are with their skills so here

00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:49,049
are some quick lessons and thoughts so

00:12:47,129 --> 00:12:50,549
again this is the same thing that I

00:12:49,049 --> 00:12:51,630
showed before where we have data

00:12:50,549 --> 00:12:53,790
stakeholders and deed

00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:58,460
skills and the data tools on extreme

00:12:53,790 --> 00:13:01,500
ends can we develop a data literacy

00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:04,170
approach or framework in which we now

00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:10,200
move these tools and skills to the data

00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:13,050
stakeholders or we can develop an

00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,250
approach that gets them started but we

00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:23,700
also meets them halfway

00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:25,890
so that can also be a hybrid approach so

00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:29,190
what have I been doing as I'm learning

00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:31,530
these things we've had to adapt our data

00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:35,190
literacy approach is to maximize long

00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:39,090
term success it's not about me so learn

00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:41,850
that quickly in some ways include basic

00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:43,890
skills so providing additional basic

00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:48,060
modules around introduction to computers

00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:51,770
the web spreadsheets as part of training

00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:51,770
modules that people can have access to

00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:57,330
prepare for slow hot new internet at all

00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:58,920
so why not produce that we've been

00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:02,220
testing out we'll have a computer that

00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:04,650
we can turn into a local area network so

00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:07,830
that it can broadcast significant files

00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:10,860
and not rely on the external Internet

00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:12,840
and also creates a docker image or file

00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:15,210
that has all the required software and

00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,800
then show people how to just install

00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:18,450
that once and then they don't have to be

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,940
installing Java and other things in

00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:23,130
order to use specific software access

00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:25,260
competencies so have pre training

00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:26,780
surveys and quizzes to be able to know

00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,830
if people actually add a level of

00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:31,440
competency you need them to be in order

00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:35,750
to deliver the skills that they need to

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:38,850
to move forward and then plan for

00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:40,590
longevity so embed data supports

00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:43,680
particularly what we see in as media

00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:46,710
houses and CEOs CSO's despite them even

00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,180
being in trainings when they go to the

00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:50,220
immediate houses they are not able to

00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:52,770
leverage on the skills right away so

00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:55,680
embed data supports that can actually

00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:57,750
get them going over time and then also

00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,460
check in on participants or people

00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:01,140
you've trained it's easy to have a one

00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:03,420
or two day training and then forget and

00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:05,590
write reports about how people have

00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:07,210
become data journalists but it's

00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:10,770
much more important to check in and see

00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:10,770
how much progress they've made over time

00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:16,180
so I take inspiration from other

00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:18,970
industries and other spaces so this is a

00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:24,460
company in Ghana called X technologies

00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:26,380
and they designed and created sign said

00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:29,830
that was aimed at solving the problem of

00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:32,050
under-resourced science classrooms it's

00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:34,390
about not more than twenty dollars for

00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:36,370
such as Einstein said that has almost

00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:39,070
all the equipment's you need to run a

00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:40,720
science lab for each student and the

00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:43,480
amazing thing about it because it's so

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,070
resilient and robust and affordable they

00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,200
actually also have a partnership or

00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:52,210
contract with 500 schools in the UK to

00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:55,920
supply this to them and then finally

00:15:52,210 --> 00:16:01,210
another company zip line it's a medical

00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:04,300
delivery drone company and they tested

00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:06,190
out their model in Rhonda and Donna on

00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:10,030
how to deliver critical life-saving

00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:14,260
medical essentials to hospitals that

00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:16,600
were not accessible and beefed build

00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:19,390
this out in such a way that now even the

00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,160
u.s. in this time of coating 19 was to

00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:23,860
use their services because there are

00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:27,010
some people in rural areas who cannot

00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:30,130
come to hospitals because they are high

00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:32,970
areas of potential infection and so this

00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:35,590
showing this that low-income low tech

00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:38,500
experiences can teach us about how we

00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:42,250
can build much more accessible much more

00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:44,410
robust and resilient approaches to data

00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:47,020
literacy and hopefully make the space

00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:50,770
much more accessible and get to that

00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:54,310
point of empowering data stakeholders as

00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:56,980
we want I just want to give a quick

00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:58,420
shout out to some organizations that

00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,520
have been part of this journey school of

00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:01,960
data open knowledge foundation open

00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,670
contracts and partnerships and obviously

00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:07,480
the carbon trees all of them doing great

00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:09,100
work around building that new way of

00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,750
data literacy and we're all still

00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,130
learning I'm still learning there are

00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:14,260
also some tools that are out there right

00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:17,070
input on here so everything from open

00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:19,150
data care to Cobo - box - giving cargo

00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:21,610
that makes

00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:23,560
learning courses and without requiring

00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:25,600
credit cards or you signing up with a

00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,950
bank accounts all these are making it

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,250
much easier for us to get to data

00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:33,130
stakeholders and with that I will pause

00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:35,260
so the last slide just leaving the

00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:36,550
question how so how would you

00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:40,360
communicate sadita additional ization

00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:41,470
through radio yeah yeah it's great these

00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:45,010
are great questions and really

00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:48,100
appreciate you bringing the discussion

00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:52,000
of how we communicate data data literacy

00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:53,800
like bringing it in such an illustrative

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,470
way that brings this discussion of like

00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:58,930
and completely destroying the rubric of

00:17:56,470 --> 00:18:00,250
like the skills training and the you

00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:01,810
know and the the people have to have

00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:04,510
that power dynamic of accessibility

00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:06,820
really breaking that down so thank you

00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:12,150
very much we did have a couple questions

00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:16,660
but we're out of time so I am going to

00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:19,300
transition over to the next speakers and

00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:23,380
for those that weren't here last week

00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:26,140
sorry yesterday last week for those that

00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:27,760
weren't here last yesterday what we'll

00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:30,430
be doing is we'll take these questions

00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,230
that we've received while we were

00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:35,200
listening to David we'll put them over

00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:39,040
in slack and there is a channel in slack

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:42,370
that's the CSB 5qa

00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:44,410
and David will be available to respond

00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:45,850
to them in slack so if you'd like to

00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:49,060
talk to him through slack or if you'd

00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:51,070
like to pose more questions head on over

00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:54,730
to slack so thank you very much David

00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:57,210
and I'm going to move over now to Emmie

00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:57,210
