Title: Lisa Federer & Maryam Zaringhalam - Data and Code for Reproducible Research
Publication date: 2020-05-28
Playlist: CSVConf 2020
Description: 
	The National Library of Medicine held two workshops in 2019 in which National Institutes of Health researchers attempted to reproduce the results of published bioinformatics paper that stated they made their data and code publicly available. Not a single one of the ten teams over two workshops could fully reproduce the results of the paper. Despite the teamsâ€™ inability to reproduce the results, the workshops provided valuable insights into where researchers are falling short in sharing and documenting their data and code. This talk will discuss some of the issues that contributed to the irreproducibility of these papers to provide a better understanding of how researchers can ensure that their science is transparent and reproducible.

great um well I am Mariam Zarin who I am

00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:11,700
and I am really excited to talk to you

00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:14,580
all about a reproducibility workshop

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:18,840
that we hosted at the National Library

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:21,029
of Medicine where Lisa Federer who is a

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:27,060
tiny box in the corner of your screen

00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:29,609
now and I currently work and so the idea

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:33,000
for this reproducibility workshop came

00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:36,860
from sort of a personal experience in my

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,739
graduate career and so before I came to

00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:43,469
NLM I was getting my PhD in molecular

00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:46,410
biology and bioinformatics and during

00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:49,700
the course of that I had the unusual

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:52,860
privilege of being scooped five times

00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:55,770
which i think is some sort of record but

00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:58,410
it did give me this really nifty

00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,480
opportunity to do a sort of meta

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:03,390
analysis across the papers that had

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,210
scooped me to see how well their results

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:09,000
actually agreed with one another and by

00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:13,110
undertaking that process I actually got

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,110
to learn a lot about bioinformatics

00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:18,869
about data analysis and also data

00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:21,390
sharing and reuse sort of digging into

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:23,880
their data and their code and so when I

00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:26,159
came to National Library of Medicine I

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:31,439
thought wouldn't it be great if we could

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:34,970
try to to have intramural researchers

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:39,439
across NIH engage in a similar sort of

00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:41,700
experiment I'm trying to reproduce

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,460
papers from the bioinformatics

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:48,799
literature and it seems like I have lost

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,799
Lisa and the slides

00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:58,920
all right let's wait for a few seconds

00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:01,710
and yeah the slides are in super

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,170
necessary for this for this part of the

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:07,530
Chuck so I can I can just find up there

00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:11,190
more decorative so I can keep going

00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:15,150
along until Lisa is able to reconnect

00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:18,420
and so the idea was to host a

00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:22,140
reproducibility workshop at NIH to try

00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:24,269
to understand what can researchers learn

00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:26,819
by actually trying to engage in the

00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:31,680
process of reproducing a published and

00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:34,610
piece of literature and so the goal of

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:39,950
this workshop was sort of threefold

00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:42,950
first we wanted to help researchers

00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:45,720
develop an understanding for the tools

00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:49,590
tools that might facilitate reproducible

00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:52,980
research along with NLM data resources

00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:56,190
for bioinformatics the second goal was

00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:58,500
to help them develop an understanding of

00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:01,980
how to incorporate these tools into

00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:05,040
their own research practices and finally

00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:07,590
with all of that we wanted to give them

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,349
a path towards some sort of deliberate

00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:13,139
deliverable in the form of an executable

00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:16,440
notebook or a publication where they

00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:22,200
documented the process of of trying to

00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:25,889
undergo this replication during the

00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:29,609
course of the workshop and we also had a

00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:31,889
sort of sneaky goal for ourselves of

00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:34,799
trying to as we put together this

00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:36,510
workshop think through what a curriculum

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,549
might actually look like around

00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:41,579
reproducibility so how can we think

00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:44,209
about developing a hands-on curricula to

00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:47,910
teach reproducible research practices

00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:50,129
how are researchers actually approaching

00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:52,049
reproducibility so over the course of

00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:55,739
this three-day workshop we got to see

00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:59,090
how researchers were trying to undertake

00:03:55,739 --> 00:04:00,950
a reproduction and then

00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:03,080
we also wanted to identify some

00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:06,069
low-hanging fruit that might help us

00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:11,120
promote reproducible research practices

00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:13,540
both while researchers are sort of in

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,890
the process of doing their work and then

00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:17,479
once they've published their work how

00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:22,960
can they publish it in such a way that

00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:29,449
it is maximally reproducible and Lisa

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:33,430
still seems to not be back yet her

00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:36,830
computer's frozen okay that's right

00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:41,150
okay so I'll tell you now about the

00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:44,780
structure of our workshop um so it took

00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:46,729
place over three days and we ran two

00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:52,250
iterations of the workshop one in the

00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:54,250
spring of 2019 and then one later in the

00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:57,880
fall so there's a three-day workshop

00:04:54,250 --> 00:05:00,440
where we selected 25 intramural NIH

00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:04,490
researchers so researchers who work on

00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:06,979
NIH s campus and we put them into five

00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:09,620
teams of five to reproduce a

00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:12,910
bioinformatics paper making sure that

00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:18,370
the underlying data were available in an

00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:23,479
NLM hosted repository so GenBank

00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:28,520
SRA and a few others on the first day of

00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:31,340
the workshop we had a an opening sort of

00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:33,320
keynote lecture giving a primer on open

00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:35,599
science and reproducibility trying to

00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:38,270
really motivate set up the motivations

00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:41,120
for for this workshop and then we had

00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:43,700
three 30-minute tutorials on executable

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,669
notebooks specifically looking at

00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:49,389
Jupiter notebooks version control

00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:52,370
looking at git and github and

00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:55,310
containerization looking at docker and

00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:57,410
then on the second and third days the

00:05:55,310 --> 00:06:02,139
teams worked in their groups and a sort

00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:04,669
of codeathon style working to reproduce

00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:09,349
the results of those bioinformatics

00:06:04,669 --> 00:06:11,450
papers and at the end of the workshop we

00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:12,529
had them share out whatever it was that

00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:14,449
they were actually

00:06:12,529 --> 00:06:21,139
able to reproduce Oh perfect this is

00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:22,789
perfect timing I I'm gonna try and share

00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:24,669
my screen so you can have the slides

00:06:22,789 --> 00:06:30,079
hopefully this won't Fester

00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:31,759
we're about to be on five six okay so at

00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:34,419
the end of the workshop we had them

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,799
share what they were able to actually

00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:40,219
reproduce what were some roadblocks that

00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:43,009
they experienced and to help us sort of

00:06:40,219 --> 00:06:45,559
learn how to chart a path forward around

00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:48,589
around more reproducible research

00:06:45,559 --> 00:06:50,539
practices and so now I'm gonna turn it

00:06:48,589 --> 00:06:53,889
over to Lisa to share some of the

00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:56,269
takeaways that came from that share out

00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:59,269
all right

00:06:56,269 --> 00:07:00,889
so hi I'm Lisa Federer I'm the NLM data

00:06:59,269 --> 00:07:02,389
science and open science librarian and

00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:05,179
as you can tell I have a not very good

00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:07,249
internet connection at home so I think

00:07:05,179 --> 00:07:09,829
one of the really most striking

00:07:07,249 --> 00:07:11,569
takeaways was that out of all of the

00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:13,759
papers that we looked at over the two

00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:16,219
workshops not a single team was able to

00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,419
successfully reproduce a paper and you

00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:19,849
know we're talking about people who are

00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:22,069
NIH scientists you know very

00:07:19,849 --> 00:07:23,479
accomplished people who if if this could

00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:26,329
be reproduced you would expect that they

00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:27,679
could reproduce it people had you know

00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:28,819
sort of term pieces that they could

00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:31,749
reproduce like maybe they could

00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:34,699
reproduce a particular figure or

00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:37,159
reproduce a finding but with like

00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:38,839
different data but in terms of actually

00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:40,849
going through the papers and reproducing

00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:44,299
them none of the teams were able to do

00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:48,409
so and looking at why they were not able

00:07:44,299 --> 00:07:50,089
to do so was informative about some of

00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:52,579
the the challenges to reproducibility

00:07:50,089 --> 00:07:53,749
and really looking at all of this I

00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:55,699
think we found very much that

00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:58,549
reproducibility is not trivial there's

00:07:55,699 --> 00:08:01,699
quite a lot that has to go into a paper

00:07:58,549 --> 00:08:04,609
and preparation for that to ensure that

00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:07,519
a paper is truly reproducible one of the

00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:10,579
issues that we ran into quite a lot was

00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:13,639
missing underlying data so maybe only

00:08:10,579 --> 00:08:16,999
part of the data was there or the data

00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:18,709
was not where it said it was for

00:08:16,999 --> 00:08:21,050
whatever reason despite the fact that

00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:23,490
these papers were supposed to have their

00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:26,069
data available the

00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:28,130
the workshop participants were not able

00:08:26,069 --> 00:08:31,350
to get to it for one reason or another

00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:33,300
another issue was missing software and

00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:36,089
tools some of the papers did a good job

00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:39,209
of documenting what software they used

00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:41,159
to do their analysis others would say

00:08:39,209 --> 00:08:44,700
things like we use an in-house script

00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:48,180
and they didn't share that code so it

00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:50,399
would be difficult to to reproduce that

00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,839
analysis unless you were able to you

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,870
know sort of reverse-engineer the code

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,240
and write it yourself other times even

00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:59,490
when they did note the software and

00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,950
tools that they used the description

00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:04,560
that they gave of that software was not

00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:07,560
adequate to allow someone to reproduce

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,870
the the analysis so for example they

00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,820
might say that they used Python a

00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:14,300
specific package but they don't give the

00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,300
version

00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:28,680
all right we now know Internet is

00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:31,710
horrible I guess I can I can take over

00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:35,720
from there and if you're looking at your

00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:39,510
slides I'll continue from there so

00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:42,360
another another issue that folks had was

00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:44,760
that they noted that some of the

00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:48,660
workflows were in an inadequately

00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:51,480
described or difficult to follow so they

00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:55,560
didn't necessarily make note of oh is

00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:59,040
Lisa back no I'm okay

00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:01,440
so they didn't necessarily make note of

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,980
you know what data were supposed to go

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,840
in we're in the analysis pipeline and so

00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:10,500
people were sort of trying to figure out

00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:14,310
you know map a software and tools to

00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:16,680
what they thought maybe a data set might

00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:20,700
be used for and so they were sort of

00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:23,370
left trying to trying to reverse

00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:28,610
engineer without really a great without

00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:40,860
really a great map so if you could go to

00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:47,400
slide 9 tell anyone okay slide back back

00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:50,340
one uh yeah back and back another and

00:10:47,400 --> 00:11:02,060
back another um there we go

00:10:50,340 --> 00:11:04,470
no forward there the issues that

00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:08,820
researchers had working on these on

00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:11,220
these reproductions um so a bit of

00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:15,060
low-hanging fruit is just having better

00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:16,680
minimum standards and for peer review so

00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:19,260
peer reviewers could actually check to

00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:22,230
make sure that underlying raw data are

00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:25,320
actually made readily available and that

00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:27,420
when date when a paper says that data

00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,810
are available in the supplement that the

00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:33,940
supplement is actually there

00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:36,400
they can also look out for making sure

00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:39,610
that all software and tools actually

00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:42,820
detail the appropriate version so that

00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:44,650
when researchers are trying to sort of

00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:47,290
recreate the the computational

00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:49,570
environment they have they're not you

00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:52,600
know sort of taking random guests random

00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:54,550
shots in the dark and then also making

00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,770
sure that the underlying analysis tools

00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:58,779
are made readily available so that

00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:01,210
people aren't having to do a whole bunch

00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:02,770
of reverse engineering work and sort of

00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:05,020
keeping their fingers crossed that they

00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:09,720
did what the original researchers

00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:09,720
actually did and so next slide please

00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:15,550
at least do you want to yeah I think I'm

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,320
back I like I halfway talk through this

00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:21,250
slide before realizing that I wasn't

00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:23,230
connected anymore so one of the things

00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:25,060
that we found was that there's not a

00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:26,529
single definition of reproducibility and

00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:28,900
there's a lot of different ways to

00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:31,810
interpret that one of the things that

00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:33,310
some groups ran into was looking at raw

00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:35,260
versus processed data there was one

00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:37,990
group that I think like got a whole day

00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:39,820
and a half in to their analysis the

00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:41,980
reproduction before they realized that

00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:43,270
they were using the raw data when they

00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,740
thought they were using the processed

00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:48,220
data and of course now the dog is going

00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:50,709
to start to bark this is delightful so

00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:52,510
understanding what you're using and you

00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:54,400
know deciding whether what's more

00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:57,940
valuable to share that raw or that

00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:59,470
process data the idea of reusing scripts

00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:01,330
versus re-engineering them it's

00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:03,640
obviously easier if somebody has already

00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:06,220
written a script to just reuse what

00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,420
they've written but in some cases you

00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,890
know that was not an option for these

00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,480
teams because those scripts weren't

00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:13,630
shared and so they had to reengineer

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,540
them there's also the question of like

00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:18,640
recreating the computing environment and

00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:20,589
what is a close enough environment so

00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:24,279
you're never probably gonna actually

00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:25,810
have the exact same computing setup as

00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:28,480
the the group when they originally ran

00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:30,240
the analysis but what is an environment

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,650
that's close enough and what are some

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,990
you know potential solutions that we can

00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:37,209
use to that things like containers to

00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:39,880
get a little bit closer to the original

00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:42,400
computing environment to increase the

00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:44,019
possibility of reproducing the paper and

00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:47,439
then

00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:49,329
we also you know ran into the the issue

00:13:47,439 --> 00:13:50,259
of like what what is sort of the bar for

00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:52,689
reproducibility

00:13:50,259 --> 00:13:54,759
I I said that you know one of the teams

00:13:52,689 --> 00:13:56,980
was able to regenerate the figures at

00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:59,110
least even though they couldn't get the

00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:01,449
whole paper and other teams were able to

00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:03,819
regenerate the general conclusions even

00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:05,369
if it wasn't through the same route so

00:14:03,819 --> 00:14:15,639
so what are we really talking about here

00:14:05,369 --> 00:14:18,879
next slide so I think what we found is

00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:20,709
that clarity and community consensus

00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:24,459
around expectations for reproducibility

00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:28,149
could go a long way as Merriam probably

00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:30,790
said while I was kicked off you know we

00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:32,350
found that there was a lot that could be

00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:34,540
done in the peer review process that

00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:36,369
would solve some of these problems or at

00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:38,529
least help authors to understand what

00:14:36,369 --> 00:14:40,600
they need to include and and potentially

00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:47,049
flag some of those things early on in

00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:48,970
the process next another thing that I

00:14:47,049 --> 00:14:53,079
think we found really interesting was

00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:54,519
that there was actually like some pretty

00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:56,410
open communication between the original

00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:58,959
authors and the teams that were trying

00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:00,730
to reproduce the papers there were a

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,920
couple of teams that did reach out to

00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:04,389
the corresponding authors for data or if

00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:07,569
they had you know questions about the

00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:10,149
methods and authors in in several cases

00:15:07,569 --> 00:15:12,850
responded within hours even there was

00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:15,339
someone who is I think in London and you

00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:17,350
know they were able to respond even even

00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:20,470
though it was like night time there so I

00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:22,720
think what that tells us is that it's

00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:24,610
it's not the result of bad faith that

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,129
people you know don't want to make their

00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:29,230
work reproducible it's just that in many

00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:31,660
cases I think people don't quite know

00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:34,209
how so having some of these guidelines

00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:35,499
and having some of this you know

00:15:34,209 --> 00:15:35,829
oversight and peer review could help

00:15:35,499 --> 00:15:45,040
with that

00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:47,379
next so that concludes our talk thank

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:52,350
you for bearing with my internet

00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:56,980
challenges and well and their thanks

00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:59,800
thank you so much to the both of you

00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:03,550
I think we might have a time for a

00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:05,350
question so I'm gonna go with the first

00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:07,930
one which is what kinds of guidance did

00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:12,850
you provide the two teams for choosing a

00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:17,199
paper to reproduce so that's a question

00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:21,810
and I actually was the one who found the

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:25,420
papers to reproduce so I did that by

00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:28,839
making sure that data were made

00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:31,540
available in one of NLM's repositories

00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:34,389
and I did that just by searching the

00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:36,910
paper for a GenBank accession number or

00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:38,889
an SRA accession number and there were a

00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:40,870
few other repositories that I also

00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:43,870
looked out for and then making sure that

00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:45,850
they were actually bioinformatics papers

00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:49,120
that they wouldn't have to you know go

00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:50,620
and do what wet lab work since that

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,660
certainly isn't feasible in a three-day

00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:54,610
period and then I sort of scanned

00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:56,320
through the papers to make sure that it

00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:59,170
looked like something that was feasible

00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,329
to at least make some headway and

00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:05,530
reproduce saying I'm in the span of

00:17:01,329 --> 00:17:08,110
three days and even you know barring

00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:10,270
those checks it turned out that they

00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:14,319
were not so trivial to reproduce after

00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:16,919
all well thank you so thank you so much

00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,919
