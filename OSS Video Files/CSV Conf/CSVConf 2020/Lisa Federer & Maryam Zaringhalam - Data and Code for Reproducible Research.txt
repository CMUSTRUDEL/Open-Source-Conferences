Title: Lisa Federer & Maryam Zaringhalam - Data and Code for Reproducible Research
Publication date: 2020-05-28
Playlist: CSVConf 2020
Description: 
	The National Library of Medicine held two workshops in 2019 in which National Institutes of Health researchers attempted to reproduce the results of published bioinformatics paper that stated they made their data and code publicly available. Not a single one of the ten teams over two workshops could fully reproduce the results of the paper. Despite the teamsâ€™ inability to reproduce the results, the workshops provided valuable insights into where researchers are falling short in sharing and documenting their data and code. This talk will discuss some of the issues that contributed to the irreproducibility of these papers to provide a better understanding of how researchers can ensure that their science is transparent and reproducible.
