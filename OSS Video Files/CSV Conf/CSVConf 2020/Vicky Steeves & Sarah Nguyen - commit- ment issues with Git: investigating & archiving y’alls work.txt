Title: Vicky Steeves & Sarah Nguyen - commit- ment issues with Git: investigating & archiving y’alls work
Publication date: 2020-05-28
Playlist: CSVConf 2020
Description: 
	Git and platforms like GitLab and GitHub have revolutionized how people track and share their work. This reality brings librarians to an interesting crossroad as they move to understand, inventory, archive, and preserve source code and its contextual ephemera, such as commit messages, merge requests, and issue discussions. This talk from a project team of research scientists and librarians will share how Git breaks barriers and promotes open research and scholarship, as well as identify ways it can be archived for the long-term citation and reproducibility. Part environmental scan, part behavioral study, we will discuss the ins-and-outs of a researcher’s Git hosting platform experience and digital preservation tools that can be creatively used in Git preservation efforts.
