Title: Vicky Steeves & Sarah Nguyen - commit- ment issues with Git: investigating & archiving y’alls work
Publication date: 2020-05-28
Playlist: CSVConf 2020
Description: 
	Git and platforms like GitLab and GitHub have revolutionized how people track and share their work. This reality brings librarians to an interesting crossroad as they move to understand, inventory, archive, and preserve source code and its contextual ephemera, such as commit messages, merge requests, and issue discussions. This talk from a project team of research scientists and librarians will share how Git breaks barriers and promotes open research and scholarship, as well as identify ways it can be archived for the long-term citation and reproducibility. Part environmental scan, part behavioral study, we will discuss the ins-and-outs of a researcher’s Git hosting platform experience and digital preservation tools that can be creatively used in Git preservation efforts.

all right thanks so much Elaine for that

00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:05,910
introduction she said I'm Vicki Steves

00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:08,099
the librarian for research data

00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,800
management and reproducibility at New

00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:12,660
York University I'm joined by Sarah

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,599
nuyen who is a research scientist also

00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,130
at NYU our third team member on this

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,650
project and if you've Milliken is in the

00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:22,560
chat so be sure to give a nice hello

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:25,220
there so to start us off we're gonna be

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,010
talking about Ice Age and yes the

00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,150
acronym doesn't match the pronunciation

00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:33,570
but that's just the way it goes

00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:35,850
I page is an Alfred P Sloan funded

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:39,450
project that looks at basically two

00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:42,390
streams of work to try and help with

00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:45,149
saving all of y'all's work that is in

00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:48,180
the get data format on hosting platforms

00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:50,160
so those two streams of work include a

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,770
behavioral study around how folks in

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,320
academia are using it and get hosting

00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,989
platforms which Sarah will talk about

00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,840
way more in depth the second stream of

00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:02,910
work focuses on evaluating how those

00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,150
materials are currently being archiving

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:08,790
archived and how we can assist in aid

00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:12,210
and where the gaps are and where we can

00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:15,000
move forward as a community so the goal

00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:16,530
of this project in a nutshell is to make

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,150
sure the wonderful work that you all are

00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:23,130
doing producing great get repos and the

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,530
context that adds to its me things such

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:28,200
as issue threats PR discussions wiki's

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,869
can go from this really highly active

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,939
collaborative state to a state where

00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:36,360
they are stable sizeable and under

00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:38,729
professional preservation so here are

00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,380
the three of us pictured but I also

00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:41,939
wanted to just mention this work would

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,340
not be possible without our amazing

00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:46,259
colleagues in NYU libraries digital

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,140
library technology services which is our

00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:51,090
digital preservation unit and before I

00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,920
get too ahead of myself I'm most of you

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,770
all at CSV are probably familiar but

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,909
before we go into some more depth I want

00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,719
to make sure everyone has the same

00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:02,310
baseline understanding of what git is

00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:05,700
get is basically a revision control

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,619
system it's a command-line tool the

00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,020
point of gifts and other revision

00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:12,989
control systems is to be able to compare

00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,800
restore and merge changes to our plain

00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:16,740
text material

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,500
like code so using git facilitates

00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:21,930
collaboration transparency obviously

00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:25,530
something CSV and us care a lot about

00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:26,790
which is awesome so we love good there

00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,530
are also these things that we're calling

00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:30,150
get hosting platforms there are

00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:32,730
literally platforms on the web where

00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:35,130
people either host a copy or host a copy

00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:37,230
of their git repositories they add some

00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:39,240
features on top that enable wider spread

00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:41,340
collaboration as well so the most

00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,440
popular is github followed by a lot--but

00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,450
bucket and SourceForge so we're focusing

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,760
on those but as you can see from this

00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:50,010
very small screenshot from Wikipedia

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,510
there are a lot more I especially want

00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,730
to give a shout out to source Hut which

00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:57,810
look is a has this really cool sort of

00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:59,220
non this cooperative model for hosting

00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:03,420
platform that looks really interesting

00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:05,520
so check out source head and since this

00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,630
project has scholarly in the title and

00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,060
we're gonna be saying things like

00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:10,980
scholarly ephemera to denote parts of a

00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,270
repository we want to say if I thought

00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,700
we should show you some concrete

00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:17,910
examples of what exactly we mean by

00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:20,340
scholarly get usage so there are some of

00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:22,530
the perhaps more obvious ones like using

00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:25,440
github to publish data and code as

00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:26,640
supplementary materials to a paper but

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,140
there are also some really interesting

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:33,450
uses how yeh it was in the yeni group if

00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,830
you cut his presentation yesterday and I

00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:37,110
gave a shout out to this bio archive

00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:39,540
preprint it's my favorite one it details

00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:42,450
really in-depth how they went from a

00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:45,030
manual Quality Assurance procedure for

00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:46,739
their for their lab for their data to an

00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:51,000
automated one you think it hub and

00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:53,160
Travis so using this hosting platform

00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,980
just meant to do software engineering to

00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:59,459
do automatic QA QC on data is a really

00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:00,870
awesome scholarly usage but even there

00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:02,700
are whole journals that run on top of

00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:05,220
github infrastructure such as the

00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:08,040
Journal of open source software jaws and

00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:11,430
then the Journal of open open

00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,989
educational it's Jose and they conduct

00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:15,360
peer review and the entire publishing

00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:17,340
workflow on on github so these are some

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,820
of what we mean when we say scholarly

00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:22,979
get usage and the extent to which this

00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,680
is present in get hosting platforms is

00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:27,690
pretty big Sarah is going to talk a

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,360
little bit about

00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:32,100
some of this scoping in-depth but I

00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,520
really love this background piece that

00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:38,130
comes from hassle bring at all I highly

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:41,880
recommend you all read the preprint they

00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:43,850
basically identified 5000 repositories

00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,380
that host research software specifically

00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:48,780
they do that by looking at github itself

00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:51,780
but then also citations of repositories

00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:53,670
in ACM digital library and archive they

00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:56,220
found the most we're in life science the

00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:58,140
next we're in general science and then

00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,180
the third were unpublished or archives

00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:04,290
which is like backups so these are some

00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:07,740
really interesting scoping of the extent

00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:10,020
that this material is present so then

00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:12,870
the problem we want to solve is there's

00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:16,290
all this really interesting tooling

00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:19,140
going on around using it so many

00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:21,000
different platforms this source code by

00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:23,820
itself is really valuable but it's also

00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,790
contextualized by the scholarly ephemera

00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:29,010
around it like issue discussions and no

00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:31,710
current project captures both the source

00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:34,700
code and that ephemera so we want to be

00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:38,370
able to get everything together

00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:41,370
my emoji and my elephant in the room

00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:42,990
which did not actually show up my dad is

00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:44,669
github archiving program which you may

00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:46,410
or may not have heard about not gonna

00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:48,030
say a lot about it because David

00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,680
Rosenthal's blog post there that I

00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:52,680
linked at the bottom says everything you

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,300
need to say but I will also just

00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,100
highlight that none of these projects

00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,930
are really solving the problem that we

00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:01,350
want to solve in that keeping the code

00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:04,350
together with this scholarly ephemera to

00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:05,870
everyone's benefit so I'm gonna pass it

00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:12,360
off to Sarah who's going to talk about

00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:18,000
the gap analysis hi everyone this is

00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:20,190
Sarah can you hear me okay okay so as

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,470
we've said my name is Sarah nyan and I

00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:25,110
am the research scientist focusing on

00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:29,690
git on the behavioral side of git and

00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:33,320
get hosting platforms next slide please

00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:35,280
so um throughout my research I've

00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,539
basically phased it out into five

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,360
different parts starting with a

00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:42,360
literature review of just anyone who has

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,840
mentioned get github gitlab bitbucket in

00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:48,060
their papers or in their studies and

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,340
then we go into systematic review a

00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:52,890
focus group broad survey and user

00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:55,020
experience interviews i'm going to be

00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:57,420
focusing most of the today's talk on our

00:06:55,020 --> 00:07:00,200
broad survey as that's something that

00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:03,630
we've had some preliminary data to share

00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:06,210
but if we go to the next slide I can

00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:08,520
share with you basically the research

00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:10,470
questions that we're focusing on as we

00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,810
do the when we started off with the

00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:15,690
literature review which is basically

00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:17,790
just seeing how scholars use get and get

00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:20,340
hosting platforms as a toolkit to carry

00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:23,520
out their specific use cases which is

00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:26,340
pretty similar to programmers and anyone

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,600
else that uses git but if specifically

00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,220
we're trying to just make sure that we

00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,170
can serve as librarians and archivists

00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:34,230
those people who are doing things that

00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:36,240
are research and education based and

00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:39,000
then we also in the end want to be able

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,530
to teach people who have experienced git

00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,050
but have not yet been able to fully

00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:45,060
incorporate it into their workflow how

00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:46,260
do we better introduce this topic to

00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,580
them and how do we better make it so

00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:50,250
they can bake it into their workflow

00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:52,950
process so feel free to check out our

00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:54,930
blog that we've been updating as we just

00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:56,460
go through different types of papers and

00:07:54,930 --> 00:08:00,900
just a summary of all of those looks

00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:03,300
like please so just listening to

00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:05,220
yesterday's talk it seems pretty it was

00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:08,220
awesome just to see other people who are

00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:10,920
also just studying how people can use

00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:13,380
get and make science and just research

00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:15,330
an information more open so it's very

00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:18,600
similar to how many developers already

00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:20,820
use it but we did pinpoint these get

00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,320
experiences specifically how scholars

00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,540
use them through the literature review

00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,310
and obviously that's version control

00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:28,680
because that is what git is based off of

00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:31,290
but community and collaboration was a

00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:34,169
huge one just like as hosting platforms

00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:35,460
our social coding platforms method

00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:38,700
tracking we see those through lab

00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:40,050
notebooks education get all in all of

00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:43,110
those different hosting platforms have a

00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:45,570
classroom setting data processing

00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:48,180
reproducibility publishing publishing is

00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:51,800
a huge one so these are all specific

00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:54,339
buckets into what we call scholarly used

00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:57,019
cases and if we go to the next slide

00:08:54,339 --> 00:08:59,269
this is just a paper that we want to

00:08:57,019 --> 00:09:01,519
highlight because it recently came out

00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:03,200
just this past week and it was written

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,880
by a graduate student on just how they

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,730
overcame barriers using open source

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,470
software and they also reference to get

00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:13,100
and get hosting platforms as a main

00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:15,730
point of use as they used open source

00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:18,860
software and collaborated with their

00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:21,290
peers so I highly recommend you check

00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:24,829
that out so if you go to the next slide

00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:28,310
I'm gonna give you some examples of just

00:09:24,829 --> 00:09:31,070
very relevant use cases of how scholars

00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:33,019
and researchers are using it so many you

00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,760
might know that Johns Hopkins University

00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:36,350
Center for systems and science and

00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,870
engineering came out with this awesome

00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:42,470
dashboard based off of ESRI I'm just

00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:45,529
showing the spread of Koba 19 so they

00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:47,570
are actually posting their data on

00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:50,269
github and their visuals are being fed

00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:52,670
into on ESRI so they're connecting the

00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:55,610
two platforms together and you can see

00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:58,339
there's about more than 1,200

00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:00,680
but those are not being preserved in a

00:09:58,339 --> 00:10:02,300
specific way yes get is a decentralized

00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,339
way where each person can take the

00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,810
source code but these types of

00:10:04,339 --> 00:10:07,579
conversations that are happening on

00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:10,180
issues and pull requests are what we're

00:10:07,579 --> 00:10:13,160
interested in because that kind of just

00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:15,230
plays into the scholarly workflow of

00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:18,770
peer review and collaboration

00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:20,860
so that's just one repository next slide

00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,860
please

00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:25,520
this next github repository is another

00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,010
one that I'd like to highlight because

00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,270
it is also very relevant to kovin 19

00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:31,459
some of you might have seen some

00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:35,449
discussion happening on the interwebs

00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:37,820
last week about how this code base that

00:10:35,449 --> 00:10:40,279
was basically saying that this type of

00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:42,829
modeling could show and reveal some

00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:46,370
information on how to reduce Kobe 19

00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:48,620
mortality and this mmm it was basically

00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:49,940
taken down and also retracted even

00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:53,089
though it was just a preprint of a

00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:55,640
report but in this issue which was

00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:57,949
closed there was a long discussion of

00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:00,140
how they're testing and there was many

00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:02,510
bugs which no one is a perfect coder but

00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:04,040
it's just so important to be able to see

00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:04,790
this type of discussion happening

00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,090
through

00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:10,460
out these types of data and modeling and

00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:12,110
scripts and code which isn't currently

00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:15,140
being saved in many of the platforms

00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:19,070
that we're looking at to go to the next

00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:20,210
slide so after the literature review of

00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:22,670
just looking at what people how people

00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:24,740
are using it through conversing through

00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:27,410
issues I'm interested in going through a

00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:30,230
systematic review basically seeing how

00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:34,310
all published papers how have they been

00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:36,020
referencing URLs and to get hosting

00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:38,300
platforms and get it within their

00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:42,440
workflow so this would just be a large

00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:43,700
harvest of articles and metadata I'm not

00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,650
gonna go too much into that because this

00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:49,960
is this space is still a work in

00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:49,960
progress next slide please

00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:56,150
so phase 2 of the research is a focus

00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,760
group which is also in progress right

00:11:56,150 --> 00:12:02,510
now we've been interviewing small groups

00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:04,580
of 3 to 6 researchers students anyone

00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:07,250
who is what we could call a minimal user

00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:10,400
so someone who has been exposed to

00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:12,350
understanding or just has seen the world

00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,480
of get but has not yet been able to

00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:16,550
incorporate it into their workflow and

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,650
we're mostly interested in this because

00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:19,970
a lot of people will be found are

00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:22,460
enthusiastic about version control

00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:26,060
systems and get being a very popular one

00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:27,020
for exposure is something that they get

00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:29,180
excited about once they're in the

00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:31,340
classroom but it's they tend not to

00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:33,410
bring it over into their daily workflow

00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:35,120
so within these focus groups we want to

00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:37,310
understand what is that bottleneck what

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,870
is that threshold where they just cannot

00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:41,390
enter that door open up that door to

00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:43,970
include getting to their workflow so

00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:47,000
we're excited to see how that is

00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:49,160
incorporated one tweet that we'd like to

00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,990
highlight is from Christy Whitaker

00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,300
Kirstie Whitaker from the Allen in

00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:55,910
touring Institute and she was basically

00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:57,560
talking about how her experience of

00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:59,990
teaching someone a pole request which is

00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,820
kind of a foundation to using git and

00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:03,920
sharing code of source code with each

00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:05,990
other but if you can't even get over

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,820
this one barrier of a pull request how

00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:09,440
are you supposed to even incorporate it

00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,930
into your larger workflow with all of

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,340
the other different types of commands so

00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:15,410
this is something that we're interested

00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:16,460
in of just making tools and a toolkit

00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:18,830
for people to understand

00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:22,310
and then part three of the research is a

00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:24,170
survey which we hope you all can

00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:25,610
participate in and share with your

00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:28,580
colleagues

00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:31,100
this our target population are any

00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:32,630
scholars and users who use get across

00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,580
all disciplines and statuses whether

00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:37,160
you're a minimal user or an advanced

00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:39,500
user and we just want to get in a

00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:42,590
wide-ranging comparable census of just

00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:44,750
how you were introduced to get how you

00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:47,360
learned it who taught you do you teach

00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:49,280
it what's your daily use behavior this

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,370
survey takes less than 10 minutes so I

00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:54,710
hope you're able to participate and so

00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:58,400
we can get your feedback five minutes

00:13:54,710 --> 00:14:02,390
five minutes I'm just slow at clicking

00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:04,190
at multiple-choice buttons so some

00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:06,560
preliminary findings within this survey

00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:08,060
again mr. kasha stone is telling you

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,580
please participate and share widely if

00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:12,050
you have time one of the first questions

00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:14,320
that we do ask is when did you first

00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:17,260
start using a version control system and

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,640
this is just a nice time series

00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:21,260
obviously this is a very small

00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,700
population right now as we just

00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:25,880
obviously only recently put out the

00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:28,490
survey but I'm excited to see any sort

00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:31,130
of trends of the year that someone has

00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:33,500
picked up git or version control system

00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:35,930
and what major events have happened

00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:38,750
around that we can see a spike happened

00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:40,940
in 2005 when get was born I can't say

00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:44,300
that's clearly correlated but that is

00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:46,700
something that is interesting to me it

00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:49,420
was also interesting just to see that in

00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:52,210
1990 we haven't had anyone who has

00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:56,510
adopted a version control system

00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:58,130
immediately after 1994 or earlier and

00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:00,050
then it'll be interesting to see when

00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:01,700
funding agencies start mandating data

00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:04,310
and source code be made openly available

00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:06,500
will there be an actual spike in there a

00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:09,770
few years afterwards we do see this in

00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:12,440
2015 which I haven't been able to find

00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:15,500
it a notable event timeline for that

00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:17,720
year but if anyone has experienced

00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:20,990
anything or remembers from their memory

00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,760
would be great to hear that next slide

00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:26,330
please

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:28,460
another preliminary finding is we do ask

00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:30,170
people what version control system did

00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:33,260
you start out using and what version

00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:34,579
12 systems you use now because as you we

00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,899
all know we're all interested and

00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:38,149
curious about learning about different

00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:39,529
technology so just because you started

00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:41,450
with it doesn't actually mean that

00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:45,709
you'll stick with it if you learn

00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:48,500
material or SVN which has been pretty

00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:52,040
rare to be honest obviously just because

00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:53,510
many places have been not supporting

00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,779
other types of version control systems

00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:59,209
but it'll be interesting to see in the

00:15:56,779 --> 00:16:01,459
other category other people had

00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:02,630
participants had submitted that they use

00:16:01,459 --> 00:16:06,620
Microsoft sourcesafe

00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:08,449
perforce fossil darks so there's a lot

00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:11,750
of different version control systems

00:16:08,449 --> 00:16:12,500
that people actually do still use and

00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:15,019
exciting

00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,910
so why did you first enter the world of

00:16:15,019 --> 00:16:18,709
get in version control I like this

00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:20,720
question just because it's kind of like

00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:25,070
your motivation or intention to version

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:27,800
control obvious factors that we just

00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:29,810
need a version control system in our

00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,519
focus group something interesting is all

00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:35,630
of our focus group attendees who are

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:37,399
minimal users they had stated that this

00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:39,860
they heard that I would get a job get

00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:42,019
them a job in the future which for right

00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:46,730
now we see that not very people have

00:16:42,019 --> 00:16:48,769
responded to that other types of reasons

00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:51,589
on why people have entered the world of

00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:54,230
get in version control is that their

00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:56,120
workplace was requiring the use of it or

00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:59,209
it was required for a web development

00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,829
course that they took someone said that

00:16:59,209 --> 00:17:02,240
they needed to back up their code which

00:17:00,829 --> 00:17:03,680
is really interesting to us just because

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,650
we are looking at the preservation

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,419
aspect of it for long term use others

00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:11,510
wanted to replicate the code on multiple

00:17:08,419 --> 00:17:13,970
computers better documentation for

00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:14,900
complex projects which is awesome also

00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:17,689
something that we're really excited

00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:20,600
about just because we do see this type

00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:23,620
of version control system as a wage so

00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:27,260
that we can't have code and open science

00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:30,380
someone also said that it was superior

00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:34,970
to SVN which I find is funny so this

00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:37,940
next one is Sarah kind of maybe for the

00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:40,010
sake of time we'll run through this look

00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:43,150
quicker so I can do the final overview

00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:44,800
oh yeah so let's just skip ahead to part

00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:46,630
basically we have quite a few of fun

00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:49,270
writing findings but if we skip ahead to

00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:51,220
part four which is basically the closing

00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:52,930
of understanding the behaviour behind

00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,790
get is we're going to be doing user

00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:56,680
experience interviews so we hope to be

00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:59,410
able to take some more one-on-one time

00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:01,210
with participants to understand how you

00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:03,160
actually use good and now I'll pass it

00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:05,080
to Vicki so we can wrap it up and the

00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,490
last question of the survey does ask if

00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,320
you want to participate in this so we

00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:10,450
hope you will I'm just gonna really

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,270
briefly go over part of Genevieve's

00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:15,010
project started the project so obviously

00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:17,980
she's available to answer questions this

00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:21,130
is her beautiful bunny oh she and she

00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:23,410
did basically a huge environmental scan

00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:27,220
in parallel to the work Sarah's been

00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:29,470
doing looking at four key areas of the

00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:32,620
ways that people are capturing and

00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:34,330
preserving source code and ephemera so

00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:36,280
I'll go through them briefly so web

00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:38,050
archiving which is the use of crawlers

00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:40,210
or similar software to capture and

00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:43,150
preserve a look and feel of content on

00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:45,550
the web so projects of interest I'll

00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:48,910
talk a little bit about later archive it

00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:51,100
web recorder and memento tracer we're

00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:53,440
also interested in self archiving which

00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:55,900
hopefully a lot of you have done a

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,740
you're familiar with so note oh this is

00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:03,070
looking at the motivations of depositing

00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:05,230
code into general like senato subject

00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:07,900
like GenBank or institutional

00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:11,980
repositories so what are the motivations

00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:14,470
between for where people choose to put

00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:16,330
their codes put their code what makes

00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:18,300
one platform more attractive than the

00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:20,980
other whereas the feature parity

00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:24,640
questions like that we're also

00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:27,340
interested in the use of api's indexers

00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,470
to automatically capture this code so

00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:32,530
obviously software heritage is the big

00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:36,970
one in this space where they have public

00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:38,890
copies of many public repos a across

00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:40,600
multiple gate hosting platforms

00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:42,190
including sunsetted platforms like

00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,920
google code they have all the open

00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:46,450
material google code so they're

00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,040
capturing the source code and then there

00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:49,929
are projects like gh archive and gh

00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:52,690
torrent that are capturing the ephemeral

00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:54,429
using github API and then there's a

00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:56,380
really awesome project Sarah which

00:19:54,429 --> 00:19:59,380
allows it's a mix of

00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:01,570
maduk capture and self deposit where i

00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:04,090
basically make a copy to an institutions

00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:05,950
get lab and then some metadata is put

00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:09,250
into an institutional repository for

00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:10,810
greater discovery so very cool and then

00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:14,170
obviously the last piece of software

00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:17,140
preservation which is around sort of the

00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:20,260
best practices in curating and making

00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:22,560
accessible for the long term source code

00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:25,450
but also compiled binaries in those

00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:27,100
ephemeral some projects of interest

00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:28,990
include obviously software preservation

00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:31,180
network which is a member based

00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:32,590
organization similar to the data

00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:35,140
curation network which is also member

00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:38,050
based I'm really interested in drawing

00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:40,660
the line between spin and dcn especially

00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:42,520
because dcn produces really excellent

00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:45,580
primers on writing code for data

00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:47,710
curators but also of interest are the UK

00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:49,450
and US research software sustainability

00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:51,670
Institute's which for front open

00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:56,200
reproducible sustainable practices for

00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:58,290
research software all the ways that we

00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:02,410
do some testing we're gonna do more

00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:08,290
here's all of our info talk to us thank

00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:12,070
you sorry sir because air will be

00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:13,870
available on slack if you are more keen

00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:15,850
and would like to know more thank you so

00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:18,040
much for your talk it was very

00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:19,690
insightful and you explained it in new

00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,500
way that I've never heard of before and

00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:23,910
now I get it

00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,910
