Title: Wesley Teal - More than manuscripts: Transforming special collections into ornithological data
Publication date: 2020-05-28
Playlist: CSVConf 2020
Description: 
	In 2016, the Iowa State University Library was awarded a CLIR grant to digitize several ornithological collections that were part of our special collections to create avIAn: Avian Archive of Iowa Online. What made this project unique was that in addition to creating a fairly traditional digital collection, we would also build a data set out of rare bird sighting documentation, transforming an inaccessible paper archive into online data for anyone to use. This talk will give an overview of how a team of library staff without ornithological expertise tackled the task of building a public data set.
