Title: Wesley Teal - More than manuscripts: Transforming special collections into ornithological data
Publication date: 2020-05-28
Playlist: CSVConf 2020
Description: 
	In 2016, the Iowa State University Library was awarded a CLIR grant to digitize several ornithological collections that were part of our special collections to create avIAn: Avian Archive of Iowa Online. What made this project unique was that in addition to creating a fairly traditional digital collection, we would also build a data set out of rare bird sighting documentation, transforming an inaccessible paper archive into online data for anyone to use. This talk will give an overview of how a team of library staff without ornithological expertise tackled the task of building a public data set.

right hello everybody thanks for joining

00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,950
me for more than manuscripts

00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,230
transforming Special Collections

00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,730
materials into ornithological data I

00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:12,150
also wanted to give a quick thanks to

00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,440
the CSV con fordman site organizers for

00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,540
putting this conference together and

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,880
transitioning it so well to a virtual

00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,560
conference it's my name is Wesley teal

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,109
I'm a metadata librarian at Iowa State

00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,170
University my pronouns are he/him and

00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:28,170
I'm presenting from the ancestral lands

00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,820
of the bikochu or Iowa nation ceded to

00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,780
the United States by the Meskwaki and

00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:35,280
Sauk Nations in the treaty of 1842 so

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,610
today I'll be talking about the avian

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:42,210
archives of Iowa online or avian free

00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:43,829
short on house part of digitizing and

00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,750
describing items for several physical

00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:48,329
collections library staff built an

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:54,660
ornithological data set from historical

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:56,090
manuscripts so what is avian it's a

00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,710
digital collection of approximately

00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:01,530
10,000 ornithological primary records

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,930
selected from 8 physical collections the

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,460
items in the collection cover a wide

00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,010
variety of bruiting related materials

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:12,420
from all the way from as far back as

00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:14,010
1819 to 2011 these collections include a

00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,939
large amount of sighting documentation

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:19,110
as well as photographs lantern slides

00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:21,210
correspondence administrative records

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:25,170
for various Iowa birding organizations

00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:28,340
and more the picture here on the slide

00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:32,280
shows the landing page for avian li b

00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:33,930
dot IA state ID u it's a custom web

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,840
portal designed by library staff and

00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:39,950
Iowa State's web development team and

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,950
implemented by the web development team

00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:45,210
so I'm going to give a little bit of the

00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,090
project overview avian was made possible

00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:50,250
by a digitizing hidden collections grant

00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:54,920
from the Council on library information

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:57,899
resources awarded in 2016 clear provided

00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,490
one hundred and eighty eight thousand

00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,979
eight hundred twenty-five dollars for a

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:04,439
24 month project with the library for

00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:08,340
providing a matching amount and so

00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:09,660
between June of 2017 in June of 2019 26

00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,569
university employees worked on the

00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,620
project to varying degrees including two

00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:15,900
staff Newbery's

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,220
specifically for the project and

00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:22,629
additionally five student employees took

00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:24,640
part so here's the full list of

00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:25,810
everybody who worked on the project as

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,790
you can see our work dependent on

00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:31,299
collaboration between four library

00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:33,519
departments and one university IT unit

00:02:31,299 --> 00:02:35,049
I'll be tweeting a lot of us I don't

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,049
think we had any background in

00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:39,370
bird-watching work ornithology at all so

00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:44,230
the project proved to be quite a

00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:47,739
learning experience and is this dad it

00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:49,870
was kind of the big question we were

00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:51,639
coming into because one of the unique

00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:54,040
aspects of this project compared to

00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:55,989
earlier ones is that we plan to convert

00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:59,139
some of the collections material into

00:02:55,989 --> 00:03:01,030
scientific data one of the physical

00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:04,450
collections we digitized the Iowa

00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:06,040
ornithologist Union papers included

00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:09,870
roughly two thousand and five hundred

00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:13,079
well-documented rare bird occurrences

00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:15,340
and so I've got a picture of the meme of

00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:17,859
person point I got a thing in this case

00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:24,400
a rare occurrence documentation form and

00:03:17,859 --> 00:03:26,109
asking it's this data so pictured on

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,680
this slide is a fairly typical Rea bird

00:03:26,109 --> 00:03:31,930
documentation form detailing the

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,879
occurrence of a Roseate Spoonbill at the

00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:38,650
bouncy Wildlife Area in Fremont County

00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:41,260
Iowa the form includes species specimen

00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:42,940
count location and habitat data as well

00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:45,160
as the name of the person recording the

00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:46,959
occurrence additionally the form and

00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:50,049
many others included information on bird

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,970
behavior markings weather conditions and

00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:54,430
under references used to identify a

00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:56,680
species we had what looked like data

00:03:54,430 --> 00:04:00,010
detailing more than two thousand rare

00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:04,000
bird occurrences including on 194

00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:06,459
different species and 670 unique

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,769
locations across Iowa and in bordering

00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:12,280
states mostly Nebraska or Illinois along

00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:14,620
the river liveries there and these

00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:18,909
occurrences took place between 1975 in

00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:21,700
1999 so now the question we had became

00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:23,380
how best to convert the information in

00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:26,969
these documents in the data that was

00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,969
useful for another logical research

00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:31,960
after evaluating the documents in

00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:34,690
researching scientific data standards

00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:37,030
the project team decided to use Darwin

00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:39,090
core and most of this work was done by

00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:42,520
previous librarians and staff

00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:43,810
particularly Paloma Graziano Picardo who

00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,220
was working on the project before I

00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:49,180
joined it I kind of joined partway

00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:54,240
through the darwin core if you're not

00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:56,500
familiar with it is a scientific term

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,030
standard glossary of terms and tended to

00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:04,330
facilitate the sharing of information

00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:05,770
about biological diversity and seems to

00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:09,550
be pretty widely used from what I can

00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:11,170
understand so picture here as part of a

00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:15,370
spreadsheet created by a poem who I

00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:18,340
mentioned when while working out what I

00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:20,200
Darwin field Darwin core fields we could

00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:27,850
populate from the collections rare bird

00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:29,380
documents so after identifying how to

00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:30,970
convert the information in the rain bird

00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:32,590
documents in the Darwin core the next

00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:34,200
step was entering that information that

00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:36,940
into the digital collections database

00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,770
this work was handled by metadata team

00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:41,260
with a Peter Sutton who was hired for

00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:43,990
the project predominantly handling the

00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:45,640
rare bird documents during the data

00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:48,070
entry stage we encountered various

00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:50,560
complications some of the handwritten

00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:53,650
documents prepared to decipher than

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,510
others even more cryptic so were some of

00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:57,520
the shorthand birders used for various

00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:58,540
field guides that they consulted have

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,540
been trying to confirm a bird's

00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:04,750
identification it took us a while to

00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:06,940
learn that citations like Autobahn meant

00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:09,400
the Audubon Society field guide to North

00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:11,800
American birds eastern region and not

00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,540
the western region nor the Audubon

00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,520
Society master guide to birding which

00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:20,320
was also used but was usually shortened

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:21,760
to Audubon master in addition to

00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,800
including data from the documents the

00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,510
avian website included metadata about

00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,360
the digital objects including title

00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:30,340
description digitization methods and so

00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,800
on that are not part of the objects

00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:34,600
scientific data and pictured here you

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,090
can see on one side the original

00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,870
documentation form for Roseate Spoonbill

00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:43,470
sighting and part of the metadata

00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:50,280
and how that was displayed on the avian

00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:52,710
website so once we had the data in our

00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,570
databases we still had to export it and

00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:56,970
separate the scientific data out from

00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:58,080
the digital collection metadata it's a

00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:00,180
picture here is a portion of a

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,610
spreadsheet I made working off Palomas

00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:05,340
earlier work detailing what fields in

00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:09,360
our database mapped to what fields and

00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:13,530
that Darwin core along with various

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,240
notes for the export Aaron Anderson the

00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:16,830
projects manager and co-principal

00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,570
investigator and I worked with the web

00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:20,640
development team to export the data as

00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:23,070
Darwin core and after nearly two years

00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,990
of work we finally had our scientific

00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:29,370
data set

00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:31,890
well almost we still needed to publish

00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:34,230
it our plan was and is to add our data

00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:36,720
to G pif the global biodiversity

00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:38,610
information facility by publishing a

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,890
through vert met while we were working

00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:43,650
with written it became clear that our

00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:45,540
data needed some further clean up some

00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:47,280
of this was due to our relative and

00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:49,530
experience with Garvin core leaving us

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,930
to populate various fields with invalid

00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:55,290
values or omitting some values required

00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:57,000
by Virtanen or GPI F some issues were

00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:58,740
artifacts of the export process we had a

00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,410
lot of stress and my colons littering

00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:03,030
different fields and there were some

00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:06,240
additional issues passed by messy data

00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:08,910
particularly Geographic data there were

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,980
a few Darwin core fields that had two

00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:16,260
locations usually because the birder

00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:18,180
listed a sighting as being between two

00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:22,860
locations and that really wrecked the

00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:25,200
export process um so pictured here is

00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:27,540
part of the spreadsheet that shows kind

00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:31,680
of two versions of the field the

00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:32,910
original export on the left that just

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,220
came out of the database and on the

00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:37,230
right two columns showing how we've

00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:40,550
changed in collaboration with fruit net

00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:45,320
so you can see that we dropped the

00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:47,280
prefix from all the field names and

00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,020
altered a lot of the values either

00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,600
correcting them inserting them and even

00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:54,720
adding new fields

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,430
such as catalog number and establishment

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,100
means fields and this is just part of it

00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:01,079
those changes throughout we have sixty

00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:06,750
to seventy some fields by the end of the

00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:08,310
process that we've populated so there's

00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:10,290
still some remaining to work to do

00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:12,509
before we can finally publish our data

00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:13,829
the data is most of the way of being

00:09:12,509 --> 00:09:15,000
ready but there are still about twenty

00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:17,459
records as shown in the spreadsheet

00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,850
image here that still need to be cleaned

00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:20,160
up

00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:23,699
each of these had two locations listed

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:30,720
in the database which like I said wreak

00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:32,250
havoc and so I'm still part of the way I

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,870
still need to make the time to get

00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:37,560
through and clean those up and once

00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:39,690
that's done I'll be able to send the

00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,370
data back convert net they can take a

00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:43,259
look at it see if there's anything else

00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:46,440
that needs to be cleaned up and then

00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:48,779
hopefully we'll get it published but the

00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,920
it is actually sort of available right

00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:54,420
now it's just an account a more raw form

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:57,569
so that you can download it from the

00:09:54,420 --> 00:10:01,620
even websites data page at avian li BIA

00:09:57,569 --> 00:10:03,209
state dot edu slash data and that's

00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,620
pictured here the project metadata

00:10:03,209 --> 00:10:06,540
contains not only the rare bird

00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,949
occurrence data but also the metadata

00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,949
for the entire collection for every

00:10:07,949 --> 00:10:13,439
object we've got in the collection the

00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:16,800
what website also has a read-only API

00:10:13,439 --> 00:10:19,769
which allows for exploration of the

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,199
collections data and metadata and a more

00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:23,910
web scraping way if that's kind of how

00:10:22,199 --> 00:10:29,790
you'd rather look at it than uh than in

00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:31,319
a spreadsheet and there's also some data

00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:33,779
in the collection that's yet to be

00:10:31,319 --> 00:10:36,180
uncovered so for any intrepid dead

00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:37,439
explorers we've got a lot of stuff

00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:40,139
that's still locked away in the

00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:42,029
digitized documents among the

00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:43,529
low-hanging fruit is a set of species

00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:45,990
occurrence tables like the one pictured

00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:49,430
here for an Eastern Bluebird that were

00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:51,959
compiled by the Iowa ornithologist Union

00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:56,209
that just have like all the sightings be

00:10:51,959 --> 00:11:00,899
usually from about 1970 something to

00:10:56,209 --> 00:11:02,850
sometime in the eighties there's also

00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:04,810
other rare bird occurrences dating back

00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:09,930
as early as 1819

00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:16,029
that generally lack it's much detail so

00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:18,160
they might not have a full location or

00:11:16,029 --> 00:11:20,020
something they're just not detailed

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,670
enough for us to create a full diamond

00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:25,360
core record from so we didn't do that

00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:27,850
but they might still have information of

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:32,140
value to researchers this is your

00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:33,550
five-minute warning thank you for those

00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:35,440
willing to dig deeper the collection

00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:37,360
contention could be potentially come for

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,580
a variety of historical data including

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,760
weather and habitat data migration

00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:45,850
patterns population sizes varied

00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:47,460
behavior observations and so on the

00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:50,440
collections also got a copious amount of

00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:53,440
letters field reports it's even got a

00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:55,839
few different journals about birding

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,400
just personal journals and researchers

00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,740
could use those to study the social

00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,060
networks of birders in Iowa and the ties

00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:04,150
they have to the larger birding

00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:05,710
community as well and finally for those

00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:09,180
of you who are wondering what a Roseate

00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:13,360
Spoonbill looks like here's a picture

00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:19,270
it's a interesting looking bird and now

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:26,170
I'm happy to take any questions thank

00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:28,990
you very much that Wesley absolutely so

00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:30,730
we do have definitely have time for two

00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:35,140
or perhaps three questions if anybody

00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:37,560
has anything they would like to ask

00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,560
Christy

00:12:52,600 --> 00:13:01,550
and if not as as with everything else

00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:04,550
that please feel free to have a think

00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:07,250
about it and ask some questions later

00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:09,530
and we'll share them in slack to make

00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:11,870
sure was the as the opportunity to come

00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:13,760
back and ask answer them whereas Lee

00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:16,370
we can either end here or if you've got

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,320
some last things comments observations

00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:20,530
you would like to make there's a few

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:26,120
minutes left

00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:28,880
yeah I think I think here's fine oh we

00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:38,570
have Mariana says she has a question and

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:40,040
I apologize for missing that oh yes we

00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:43,580
have approached local birding groups

00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:45,950
about their interest in nevada we work

00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:47,510
well not so much me aaron that i

00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,590
mentioned earlier and anderson worked

00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:50,030
pretty closely with the iowa

00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:54,640
ornithologist union with their current

00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:57,620
team on a lot of this we had a sort of a

00:13:54,640 --> 00:14:00,400
public launch and gala back when you

00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:04,280
know you could have public events and

00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:05,270
had a lot of pet and by them allowed

00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:08,120
folks from different burning

00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:11,420
organizations so yeah we've reached out

00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:13,400
to our local groups to really keep them

00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:15,760
involved and make this agree source for

00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,760
