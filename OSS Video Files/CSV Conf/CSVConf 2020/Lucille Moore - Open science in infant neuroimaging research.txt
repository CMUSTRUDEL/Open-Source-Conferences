Title: Lucille Moore - Open science in infant neuroimaging research

Playlist: CSVConf 2020
Description: 
	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has allowed scientists to investigate brain circuitry underlying healthy and maladaptive behavior. As such, it is an essential tool for advancing understanding of brain systems underlying psychiatric disorders. Because fMRI is costly and time-consuming, sharing data and tools in this space is critical for driving forward scientific discovery. However, the field is still developing rigorous standards for not only data sharing, but also quality control in image processing and analysis. Standardization issues are magnified in infant fMRI, which presents unique challenges for processing and analysis due to substantial differences in image properties compared to adults. Infant fMRI is vital for research aimed at supporting healthy brain development and preventing the onset of psychiatric disorders. My talk will highlight burgeoning open science fMRI initiatives that will be vital to drive the field forward, including my groupâ€™s pending release of an existing state of the art imaging pipeline modified for infant processing. We are employing this pipeline in a clinical trial aimed at reducing the effects of early adversity on developing brain systems implicated in psychiatric disorders. Such efforts are critical for expanding the impact of neuroimaging in clinical- and policy-level efforts to support healthy brain development.
