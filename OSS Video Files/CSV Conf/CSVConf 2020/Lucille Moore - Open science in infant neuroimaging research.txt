Title: Lucille Moore - Open science in infant neuroimaging research
Publication date: 2020-05-28
Playlist: CSVConf 2020
Description: 
	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has allowed scientists to investigate brain circuitry underlying healthy and maladaptive behavior. As such, it is an essential tool for advancing understanding of brain systems underlying psychiatric disorders. Because fMRI is costly and time-consuming, sharing data and tools in this space is critical for driving forward scientific discovery. However, the field is still developing rigorous standards for not only data sharing, but also quality control in image processing and analysis. Standardization issues are magnified in infant fMRI, which presents unique challenges for processing and analysis due to substantial differences in image properties compared to adults. Infant fMRI is vital for research aimed at supporting healthy brain development and preventing the onset of psychiatric disorders. My talk will highlight burgeoning open science fMRI initiatives that will be vital to drive the field forward, including my groupâ€™s pending release of an existing state of the art imaging pipeline modified for infant processing. We are employing this pipeline in a clinical trial aimed at reducing the effects of early adversity on developing brain systems implicated in psychiatric disorders. Such efforts are critical for expanding the impact of neuroimaging in clinical- and policy-level efforts to support healthy brain development.

	00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:04,920
okay hi my name is Lucy Moore and I'm a

00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:07,350
post doctoral scholar in the

00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:11,219
developmental cognition and neuroimaging

00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:13,320
lab in Portland Oregon and today I'm

00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:15,210
going to be talking about open science

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,000
in infant neuroimaging and the

00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,740
initiatives undertaken by my lab to push

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,539
forward open science practices within

00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:30,480
our field let me just check on something

00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:34,020
okay so I just want to introduce myself

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,030
a little first I received my PhD early

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,570
last year using mice as a model organism

00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:41,930
to study the auditory brainstem and this

00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,040
involved long hours of sitting at an

00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:46,469
electrophysiology rig and trying to

00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,450
tease apart the organization of local

00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:52,440
circuits by recording from individual

00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:54,989
neurons and after experiencing how time

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,809
and resource of intensive biological

00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:59,969
research is I began to think about

00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:02,010
whether the data being produced from

00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:03,510
this kind of work is being maximally

00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:08,010
utilized to drive forward our

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:10,290
understanding this is when I became

00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,000
involved in open science because this

00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,580
community doesn't shy away from asking

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,350
these really difficult questions about

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:21,210
the archaic structures and practices

00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:23,220
within academia and by doing this work

00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,979
to challenge these structures we can not

00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,780
only make our science better that but as

00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:31,229
many others from this conference have

00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:33,570
pointed out for this time we can build

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:35,490
our communities to be more inclusive and

00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:39,180
equitable which is really important to

00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:41,130
me so with these values in mind I got

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,799
involved in neuroimaging because this

00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:46,079
research has more direct impact on human

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,060
health and society so I currently work

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,670
with doctors Alice Graham and Damian

00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,070
fair who both work hard to integrate

00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:56,219
open science collaboration and social

00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:58,649
justice into their work and in my

00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:01,140
current role I no longer focus on data

00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:05,030
collection but rather analysis and

00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,030
building tools for image processing

00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:11,879
functional magnetic resonance imaging is

00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,330
a safe non-invasive means of examining

00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:14,820
brain

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:17,760
function it measures changes in blood

00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:20,370
flow associated with neural signaling so

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,050
it has good spatial resolution for

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,120
capturing activation in different

00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:28,140
regions of the brain compared to other

00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:30,600
techniques and it's been the primary

00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,970
tool used in neuroscience to identify

00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,460
alterations in brain function underlying

00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:42,090
different mental disorders leading to a

00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:44,790
lot of really great research so in the

00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:47,160
decal lab we use fMRI and infants

00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,870
because if we can study the neuro

00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,240
development of brain circuitry

00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,850
underlying mental health issues then we

00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,620
can clinically intervene early on to

00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:59,430
prevent the circuitry from forming in

00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:01,890
the first place because fetal and infant

00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:04,770
brain development is so rapid this

00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:06,420
period of extreme plasticity makes the

00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:11,459
brain vulnerable to negative

00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:14,250
environmental factors so for example we

00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:16,410
know that the effect of high maternal

00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:18,720
stress on fetal brain development is

00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:20,850
associated with a higher risk of the

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,030
child develop developing a mental

00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:26,850
disorder later in life and in our

00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:29,130
current clinical trial were testing the

00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:31,950
effect of a cognitive behavioral therapy

00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:35,400
based on mindfulness to reduce stressful

00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:37,470
pregnant people pregnant people are

00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,640
often hesitant to take medication to

00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:40,890
help with their stress and depression

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,769
during pregnancy because of the

00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:46,200
increased risk of birth defects and this

00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:48,360
specific therapy has the strongest

00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,670
evidence base for effectively reducing

00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,910
stress and the risk of developing

00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:56,130
postpartum depression so we expect for

00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:58,590
this intervention to Fossey the foster

00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:00,390
healthy brain development and mental

00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:05,580
health outcomes in the children via

00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:09,000
reduce stress on the mother and fMRI

00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:11,130
will give us some indication as to how

00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,150
the intervention impacts brain circuitry

00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:17,250
during development so that we can be

00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:19,019
maximally informed about the success as

00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:21,739
well as the mechanism of the

00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,739
intervention

00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:28,160
but unfortunately there are pretty

00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:30,770
significant challenges to this type of

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,840
research because our field has a general

00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:36,020
lack of established standards for

00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,700
processing and analysis to the extent

00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:40,730
that we basically had to build our own

00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:42,760
image processing pipeline because the

00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:48,520
available tools either didn't work or

00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:50,930
produce really variable outputs and this

00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:54,050
general lack of standardization is

00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:56,419
concerning because like other fields of

00:04:54,050 --> 00:05:00,160
science neuroimaging has come under fire

00:04:56,419 --> 00:05:02,389
for serious issues with reproducibility

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,520
preeminent researchers in the field are

00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:07,210
trying to tackle this issue head-on

00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:11,210
for instance here is an article from

00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:12,950
2017 published by a cohort from Stanford

00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:16,100
who is a leader in the field of

00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:18,229
cognitive neuroscience and in this paper

00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:21,790
he outlines several sources of non

00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:24,440
reproducibility specific to our field in

00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:26,510
our lab we've been trying to heavily

00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,430
incorporate open science into our

00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:30,169
research practices so that we can feel

00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:32,780
confident that our results and

00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:38,750
conclusions of our clinical trial are

00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:39,890
robust and reproducible so for the

00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:42,080
remainder of the talk I'll be

00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:44,419
highlighting some sources of bias and

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,630
variability in infant neuroimaging

00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:50,479
regarding data processing and analytical

00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:54,520
workflows and how we've tried to address

00:05:50,479 --> 00:06:00,050
each of these issues using open science

00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:02,270
and these practices include organizing

00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:05,169
our infant data to follow a new data

00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:08,180
Saturn data standard called bids

00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:10,070
adapting the standard adult pipeline to

00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,850
work with a diversity of infant data

00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:14,990
sets and releasing this on github and

00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:17,990
finally collaborating with a new

00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:20,600
standard open source fMRI pipeline

00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:25,820
called fMRI prep to integrate our

00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:29,450
infant's specific processing methods in

00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:31,280
terms of MRI data itself the biggest

00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:33,180
issue is the lack of standard file

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:37,780
formatting and organized

00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:39,729
so first there's a large variability in

00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:42,120
just the raw data depending on what type

00:06:39,729 --> 00:06:45,639
of scanner was used to collect it and

00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,740
then before the raw scan data can go

00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:50,050
through an image processing pipeline it

00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,669
has to be converted to something the

00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:54,250
pipeline you're using can actually

00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:56,220
recognize so several groups have

00:06:54,250 --> 00:07:00,300
basically just created their own file

00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:02,949
formats to work with their own pipelines

00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:05,500
so this makes stats sharing very

00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:07,629
difficult and causes mistakes and data

00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:11,949
handling by collaborators as you can

00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:13,539
imagine and that data sharing is a

00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:15,879
hugely important part of neuroimaging

00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:17,830
because data collection is very time

00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:20,530
consuming expensive technically

00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:23,409
challenging and requires a large amount

00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:27,219
of resources and not to mention access

00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:28,840
to imaging course so for instance even

00:07:27,219 --> 00:07:31,169
though we are one of the main labs that

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,810
do infant neuroimaging in the world

00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:40,240
about half the datasets I work with were

00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:42,639
collected by collaborators so to address

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,789
this issue the decal lab has adapted our

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:48,969
infant MRI data to conform to the brain

00:07:45,789 --> 00:07:50,800
imaging data structure or bids and this

00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:54,279
is a new data standard introduced in

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,289
2016 that will make it possible for data

00:07:54,279 --> 00:08:03,039
to be easily shared and understood

00:07:56,289 --> 00:08:04,719
between groups and again this new

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,629
standard has been introduced by some of

00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:11,080
the biggest people in the field and

00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:13,419
figure one from this paper just shows a

00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:16,560
snapshot of how the raw MRI data is

00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:19,210
converted into open file formats with

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:24,340
logical folder structure and human

00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:26,620
readable file names so bids enables

00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:30,940
standardization and reproducibility in

00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:33,279
many ways it helps with data reusability

00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:36,039
because it stores information about how

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:39,010
data was processed both in the file name

00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:40,839
itself as well as in the metadata so

00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:43,599
it's easy to reference and understand

00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:46,470
how data work process or analyzed if you

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,470
want to go back to it

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,589
it makes status sharing easier because

00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:53,170
it provides standardization

00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:55,660
documentation so that collaborators can

00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:59,560
easily understand the data organization

00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:02,560
and be able to use it correctly and

00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:05,199
finally study helps us study

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,449
reproducibility because it streamlines

00:09:05,199 --> 00:09:10,540
the process to replicate study results

00:09:07,449 --> 00:09:17,199
and write analysis pipelines that can be

00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:18,970
used across different datasets okay

00:09:17,199 --> 00:09:22,120
another huge source of non

00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:24,339
reproducibility in our field is the lack

00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,649
of a standard robust image processing

00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:32,230
pipeline specifically designed for

00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:34,839
infants here is a schematic of what the

00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:39,100
fMRI prep image processing pipeline

00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:41,439
looks like image processing is necessary

00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:44,310
to remove non-biological sources of

00:09:41,439 --> 00:09:47,860
noise correct for image distortion

00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:49,839
introduced by the scanner and put

00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,550
subject data all into the same

00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,769
coordinate space so that we can actually

00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:58,300
make comparisons across the population

00:09:53,769 --> 00:10:00,430
and in order to do these things as you

00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:02,620
can see from this figure processing

00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:12,490
pipelines are very complex and require

00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:15,070
multiple steps the human connect I don't

00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:16,930
project funded creation of a standard

00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:20,350
image missing pipeline that was released

00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:22,720
in 2013 but there are a few problems

00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:24,760
with this pipeline one is that it was

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,580
written in bash which isn't assigned for

00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:30,220
complex workflows so it takes about 24

00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:32,140
hours to process a subject and if the

00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:35,950
pipeline fails you have to restart it

00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:39,670
from the beginning of a stage instead of

00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:42,279
wherever the pipeline left off and most

00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:44,350
importantly the pipeline was written to

00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:50,740
work for adult data and doesn't

00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:53,860
accommodate infant data at all we call

00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:55,750
babies aliens because babies their

00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:58,630
brains are just weird and the data is

00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:00,970
really hard to work with for instance

00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:04,060
the data typically has really poor image

00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:06,790
contrast compared to adults and there

00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:09,810
are typically a lot of motion artifacts

00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:12,850
since subjects are supposed to be hold

00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:16,060
pretty much perfectly skin is still in

00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:19,570
the scanner and babies of course you

00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:21,640
know don't take direction so the

00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:23,490
inherently messy data makes image

00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:26,529
processing very challenging and

00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:33,850
introduces more variability into study

00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:35,980
results one part of the adult pipeline

00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:37,990
that we had to rebuild was brain

00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:40,270
segmentation which is supposed to be

00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:43,779
delineate different subcortical any

00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:45,910
cortical structures so if you look at

00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:48,370
the image on the left the red and black

00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:51,640
lines are supposed to delineate cortical

00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:53,470
grey and white matter so this red line

00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,630
should basically be following the

00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:58,110
outline of the brain within the skull

00:11:55,630 --> 00:12:00,640
and it totally misses the mark

00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:04,690
particularly in the superior parietal

00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:06,250
area so we rebuilt the part of the

00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:08,380
pipeline that handles brain and

00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:10,630
segmentation and now the red line

00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:15,779
outlines the brain pretty perfectly as

00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:24,420
you can see on the right five minutes

00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:24,420
thanks so I helped build this feature

00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:32,769
the brain segmentation it's a double

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:34,449
infant data and we use this Python

00:12:32,769 --> 00:12:36,220
toolkit called me pipe that is

00:12:34,449 --> 00:12:39,819
specifically built for image processing

00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:41,829
pipelines so new pipe interfaces with

00:12:39,819 --> 00:12:43,629
many image processing software's

00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:46,470
required in these pipelines and

00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:49,060
officially manages the complex workflow

00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:51,910
so with our modifications they see

00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:54,579
people pipeline can not only process

00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:57,459
infant and adult data but it also uses

00:12:54,579 --> 00:12:58,899
the open source tools specifically

00:12:57,459 --> 00:13:05,019
designed to handle neuroimaging

00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:07,540
pipelines our group released our

00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:09,490
pipeline on github as a bits app which

00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:12,089
is a portable neural imaging pipeline

00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:14,410
that understands its data sets and

00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:16,660
because the pipeline is containerized

00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:19,480
using docker the version controlled

00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:22,470
massively improves reproducibility of

00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,470
pipeline outputs

00:13:23,129 --> 00:13:27,100
okay so to the last point the issue

00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,779
still remains that there are too many

00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:32,379
groups using different pipelines of

00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:35,199
variable quality so as they stay in the

00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:37,420
recent paper published on the fMRI prep

00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:39,309
pipeline despite the wealth of

00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:41,199
accessible software and multiple

00:13:39,309 --> 00:13:44,019
attempts to outline best practices for

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:46,209
pre-processing the large variety of data

00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:48,670
acquisition protocols has led to the use

00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:53,769
of ad hoc pipeline it's customized for

00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:56,589
nearly every study fMRI prep is an open

00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:58,629
source standard for image imaging

00:13:56,589 --> 00:14:00,819
pipelines and it was developed by some

00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:04,779
of the top cognitive neuroscientists

00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:06,939
from Stanford who I mentioned earlier it

00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:09,129
basically has the same overall steps as

00:14:06,939 --> 00:14:12,309
the HCP pipeline but it's written in

00:14:09,129 --> 00:14:15,399
Python it uses workflow managers like

00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:17,439
knee pipe and it integrates a variety of

00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:20,350
processing options tested for

00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:24,939
reproducibility so that it can work

00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:26,889
across multiple datasets so we're

00:14:24,939 --> 00:14:29,740
currently collaborating with them to

00:14:26,889 --> 00:14:32,050
integrate our infant specific processing

00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:34,870
methods so that someday you'll be able

00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:39,750
to use this single interface to process

00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:39,750
and analyze any type of fMRI data

00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:45,950
the open science frameworks adopted by

00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:49,020
our lab are sexual not only for our

00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:51,120
analysis to even work but also to assure

00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:55,620
reproducibility and our study results

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:58,220
and ultimately this leads to effectively

00:14:55,620 --> 00:15:01,310
informing medical practice and policy to

00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:04,020
foster healthy brain development and

00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:07,080
this is really important in relation to

00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:08,910
our clinical trial because although the

00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:12,450
official recommendation from the US

00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:14,700
Preventive Services Task Force is to use

00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:16,710
therapeutic interventions in pregnant

00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:19,980
women considered at risk for developing

00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:22,200
depression there currently isn't a lot

00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:28,350
of infrastructure to actually support

00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:30,860
this intervention so with that thank you

00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:33,900
so much to my team our collaborators and

00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:36,120
funding sources and especially to my

00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:39,330
mentors Alice Brown Damian fair and err

00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:42,480
pesco and finally thank you to the

00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:44,070
conference organizers for thinking on

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:49,260
their feet and putting in so much effort

00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:54,800
to put on a great conference and here

00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:58,250
are my ways you can contact me thank you

00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,250
