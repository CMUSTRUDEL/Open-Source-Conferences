Description: 
	How does one find the most suitable peer reviewers for a research manuscript? Journal editors face this challenge every dayâ€“ many resolves to choose based on their own networks and past experience. This introduces biases in the peer-review process. In this talk, we share our journey on building PeerScout, an open-source machine learning solution. We will explore the challenges we are facing with analysing data and research papers, and what we learnt working with the editorial and wider communities.
