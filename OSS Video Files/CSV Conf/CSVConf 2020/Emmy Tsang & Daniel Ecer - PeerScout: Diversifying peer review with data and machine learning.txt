Title: Emmy Tsang & Daniel Ecer - PeerScout: Diversifying peer review with data and machine learning
Publication date: 2020-05-28
Playlist: CSVConf 2020
Description: 
	How does one find the most suitable peer reviewers for a research manuscript? Journal editors face this challenge every dayâ€“ many resolves to choose based on their own networks and past experience. This introduces biases in the peer-review process. In this talk, we share our journey on building PeerScout, an open-source machine learning solution. We will explore the challenges we are facing with analysing data and research papers, and what we learnt working with the editorial and wider communities.

or to all the wonderful since we can't

00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:11,250
organizers and for for making this

00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,500
possible in the current situation and to

00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:16,320
all of you for joining us this morning

00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:19,199
afternoon evening depending on where you

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,710
are yeah I just want to briefly

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:25,019
introduce myself my name is Emmy I'm the

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:28,439
innovation community manager at Elife

00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:31,140
and where we have today with us as well

00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:35,370
Daniel who is a data scientist working

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:38,579
with Eli as well so today we're hoping

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:41,370
to introduce a scout which is a project

00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:44,309
that leverages data technology and

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:47,820
community engagement to improve a

00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:49,260
process called peer review so we're

00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,089
hoping to share some of our latest

00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,269
progress but more importantly perhaps

00:00:51,089 --> 00:00:56,070
it's to share a bit of what we've

00:00:54,269 --> 00:00:59,640
learned in that process and also to get

00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:04,440
your feedback and input on how you know

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:07,080
we could proceed so yeah just to tell

00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:10,740
you a bit about Eli as well so we are a

00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:14,340
nonprofit organization we started by

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:16,140
scientists for scientists this is sort

00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,780
of our mission on our office wall our

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,120
mission is to help scientists accelerate

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,400
discovery by operating a platform for

00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,440
research communication that encourages

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,820
and promotes the most responsible

00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:31,860
behaviors in science so a lot of the

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,770
work that we do is to innovate an

00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:37,110
experiment with technology and to work

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:41,070
with the research community to achieve

00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:43,230
this mission we are also known for

00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,840
publishing a fully online and open

00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:47,370
access journal in the life sciences so

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,030
that's sort of what I see as our

00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:56,850
playground for these technological

00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:59,190
innovation and experiments so yeah what

00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:01,560
what is a scientific journal for is very

00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:03,330
sort of easy private into into this

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,570
topic what is it what does the journal

00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:08,729
do so the way we see a journal helps

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:10,709
researchers communicate the output of

00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:15,410
their work to other researchers and to

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:17,220
the public so this is a very brief

00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:19,470
simplified diagram with

00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:23,010
the science publishing process currently

00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:24,390
looks like so researchers conduct

00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,190
research and then they write up their

00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:30,000
experimental hypothesis results

00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:31,890
conclusions into a manuscript they

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,930
submit this manuscript to a journal the

00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:36,630
journal help carry out this process

00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:38,400
called peer review where they recruit

00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:42,030
other scientists to help review that

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,980
manuscript the reviewers may decide to

00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:46,110
reject the manuscript or they will offer

00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,940
some comments to the manuscripts authors

00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,650
who will then revise the manuscripts by

00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,690
through considering their reviewers

00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,430
comments once they're all happy the

00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:55,380
manuscript gets published in the journal

00:02:53,430 --> 00:03:00,660
and communicates it to the wider

00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:02,340
research community and public so that

00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:05,640
hopefully all sounded pretty

00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:08,390
straightforward but actually peer review

00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:12,030
is rather a bit more complex in in

00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:14,790
reality most of the time research

00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:18,660
articles are about an extremely specific

00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:20,760
question and field in science and so it

00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:23,430
also often uses like a specific set of

00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,590
techniques and people that can review a

00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,900
manuscript then has to be experts in

00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:31,530
that field in order to be able to assess

00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:33,060
it effectively and review it so this is

00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,950
more or less what happens in the first

00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:38,310
place of peer review ie life so let's

00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:41,100
say we received a new manuscript on a

00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:45,060
computational model for modeling the

00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:46,920
corona virus pandemic so our editorial

00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:49,230
team will look at this and assign it to

00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:52,709
a senior editor who has expertise maybe

00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:54,030
in biology the senior editor then has to

00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:56,700
pick a reviewing editor with the

00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:59,269
relevant expertise to help advise on

00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:03,030
whether or not to accept or reject the

00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:04,500
to review the manuscript if they decide

00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,690
to review it then the reviewing editor

00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,790
nominates some further referees maybe

00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:12,780
one specialize in viruses and the mother

00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:15,390
one modeling and one pandemics to review

00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,820
that paper so you can see that it's

00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:19,650
basically a day-to-day sort of challenge

00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,900
and publishing it's how do you find the

00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:24,360
most suitable candidates to handle and

00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,430
review that paper for this process and

00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,940
alive at the moment we have over 60

00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,630
senior editors and 500 review editors

00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,580
this

00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:35,280
or has to happen we want this to happen

00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:37,440
relatively quickly so we sort of have a

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,870
promise to say we are reviewing times

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,880
often under two months in total so this

00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:43,800
is all operating and their time

00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,290
constraint and finally because all our

00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,630
editors and referees are practicing

00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:50,820
scientists so they're all busy they may

00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:53,400
be handling ten other papers and so we

00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:56,460
have to be able to build the system that

00:04:53,400 --> 00:05:00,030
allows them to find people who have the

00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:02,990
right availability expertise in time so

00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:06,300
you can see how this becomes a problem

00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:08,160
without without a solution a technical

00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,490
solution to help them editors end up

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,410
usually asking people they know and as

00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:15,750
you can probably imagine this leads to

00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:21,110
biases and editors and reviewers in

00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:24,660
terms of geography and career stages so

00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:27,390
why is this all a problem so there's

00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:30,180
this study by Maria tile that looked at

00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:33,060
over 23,000 submissions to eli's between

00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:35,820
twenty twelve to seventeen and found

00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,650
that the gatekeepers so the editors and

00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,870
peer reviewers tend to favor many

00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:42,990
scripts from authors off the same gender

00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:45,900
and from the same country this means

00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:48,810
that if let's say our editors and

00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:51,180
Revere's pools are mostly composed of

00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:53,250
men from the US the manuscript we review

00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:57,150
and publish are also more likely to be

00:05:53,250 --> 00:06:00,240
written by men in the US as Elife

00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:02,460
we want to make peer-review more diverse

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,980
and fair we want to encourage this by

00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:09,120
making it easy for editors to pick a

00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:11,760
more diverse pool of people so rather

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,950
than from their own memories or networks

00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:16,080
and the second thing is we want to

00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:18,450
introduce more underrepresented

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,030
communities of researchers into this

00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:24,060
reviewing system for example early

00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:26,570
career researchers so that we could make

00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:29,760
sure that the work that we publish our

00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:32,820
representative and from you know all

00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:35,040
parts of the research community so this

00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:37,560
is our motivation for building peer

00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:39,900
scout so now I'll hand over to Daniel

00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:43,860
who will explain the concept and

00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:44,580
execution in a bit more detail right I'm

00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,080
not going to talk

00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,820
throw they too with every call please

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,310
God and we already mentioned the

00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:52,980
different stages that are part of our V

00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:55,650
process so let's fold it on the last of

00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:57,180
those stages imagine a manuscript was

00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:00,780
submitted which meant towards the first

00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:02,370
stages the energy of opener we the

00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:06,330
ravine editor who is tasked with

00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:08,190
assigning external breeze so we are

00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:10,860
looking for a domain expert who would be

00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:12,990
able to review the paper so assuming we

00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:14,490
don't already knows somebody and that's

00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:16,830
also something we don't want to rely on

00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:19,500
you could try to find a person who is an

00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:21,240
author or review of a similar paper and

00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,210
this in century what what we're trying

00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,530
to automate here by using topic modeling

00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:27,630
we are covering some records

00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:30,660
similarities cover and use that rank to

00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:34,590
potential views so let's try to use a

00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:36,660
tool in this version of peace guard

00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:38,190
there's a network child on the left and

00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,740
it's more detailed results on the right

00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:42,540
and to feel ourselves good enough you

00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:46,230
might even see the numbers in the

00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:48,150
circuits those numbers represent the

00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:51,660
similarity score of the profiles in

00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:54,090
related manuscripts in the different

00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:57,300
types of reveal profiles also a colored

00:07:54,090 --> 00:08:01,260
color coded with red representing your

00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:04,830
career views in between for forums and

00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:07,680
looking more closely on the right we can

00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:09,930
see other useful stats January would

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,150
prefer more responsive reviews like Amy

00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:15,360
mentioned we you won't have quick

00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:18,420
reviews and at the same time we are

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,070
aiming not to overburden reviews that

00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:23,580
also highlights their expertise it's not

00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:25,410
not the only factor to consider in the

00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:28,110
list every other result in the early

00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:31,410
career via and that is to encourage the

00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:34,790
use of them and so editors have no

00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:41,610
excuse that they are not aware of them

00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:43,200
so what did our editor think let's say

00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:46,260
we are not done yet

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,540
up until now we worked with the

00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,790
editorial team and we then encouraged

00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:54,120
editors to use the tool and give us

00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:56,010
feedback but at the same time comparing

00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,410
it with another product code or via

00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:01,440
connect which is also offering earlier

00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:02,750
commendations the feedback wasn't as

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,740
glamorous as we had talked

00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:07,230
apart from needing to improve the

00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:09,540
recommendations do you think odds

00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:11,250
pointed to two users wanting more

00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,050
information that would help them to

00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:20,430
better understand why person was

00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:23,040
recommended so our conclusion was that

00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:24,900
we are trying to too much everyone's we

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,510
gave the editors a new tool to use and

00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,740
they may already entrusted yet at the

00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:31,800
same time we were trying to change

00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:35,730
behavior by encouraging to use early

00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:38,280
career views for our next iteration we

00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:40,110
need to focus on three points first we

00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:42,210
need a more objective measure of the

00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:43,920
recommendations we can then better

00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:46,470
evaluate different algorithms and choose

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,510
the one that works best secondly we need

00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:50,820
to find a way to better show to the

00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:52,050
editors the information they need to

00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,060
help them judge whether or

00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:56,630
accommodations appropriate especially

00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:59,010
for people they are not familiar with

00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:01,530
and finally we still want to encourage

00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:02,820
editors to teach our reviewers what we

00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:09,360
might need to find a better way of doing

00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:11,030
that so far our second iteration the

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,170
workflow looks very similar to the first

00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:15,030
the main difference is that we are

00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:17,190
explicitly extracting keywords and key

00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:20,070
phrases which had to make the algorithm

00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:22,620
more explaining the scores calculated

00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:24,630
for the ranking we can also identify the

00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:27,210
most relevant keywords and by showing

00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:28,440
that to the user are we hoping that it

00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:30,570
is better at explaining the

00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,830
recommendations to the user allowing

00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:37,830
them to judge whether the

00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:41,640
recommendations useful okay onto the

00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:43,830
evaluation that was our first point the

00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,810
time this time our initial focus on the

00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:47,760
senior editor recommendation rather than

00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:50,760
reviewers we would be looking for

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,230
expanded in the future so we follow it

00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,480
being the algorithm based on actual

00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:56,580
assignments that means how where the

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,950
recommended editor match to then

00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:00,570
assigned editor there's no guarantee

00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:02,550
though that the assigned editor was

00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:04,200
indeed the best match but let me mention

00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:07,470
there may be buyers or there may be

00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:09,100
other reasons well it's the best poxy

00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:11,960
that we have

00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:14,000
the chart is showing four measures all

00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:16,520
of them range between zero and one where

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,100
highest better starting from the right

00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:20,840
the record three major tells us whether

00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,360
the actuary sign editor did appear

00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:25,430
within the first three recommendations

00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,630
for recorder two would be the same but

00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:29,570
concerning the first two recommendations

00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:32,690
only and recall at one only looks at the

00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:34,250
very first recommendation the end ECG

00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:35,810
measure provides a way of judging the

00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,610
recommendation as a single score

00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:41,600
there's particularly useful in comparing

00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:44,030
others as a point of reference a child

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,920
also includes a random woman fortunately

00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:48,680
though the other was doing better than

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,900
that this note Reuters was an objective

00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,280
measure of the recommendations this

00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:54,740
clearly still some room for improvement

00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:56,360
but it's a start apart from the summary

00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:58,430
we can also identify recommendations

00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:05,870
there are more in need of improvements

00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:07,610
and think of ways to achieve that and

00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:09,500
this is how the new prototype looks like

00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:12,470
these are would select the manuscript

00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:14,810
editors would get ranked accordingly

00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:16,610
here we go meter this court said but is

00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:19,460
now showing the most relevant matching

00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:21,710
keywords on the right in this example

00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:23,270
the I wasn't things that synopsis is the

00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:26,000
most relevant keyword for the first

00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:28,610
editor whereas it's ten trait for the

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,190
second editor the user can state that

00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:32,780
then still decide which one seems more

00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:34,940
relevant to the submitted manuscripts

00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:37,970
but hopefully they then don't need to

00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:45,430
use a separate web search to do that so

00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:48,740
with that anyway Jamie thanks Daniel so

00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:51,110
yeah it's just a sort of few things

00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:52,940
there was a very quick tour of sort of

00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:56,480
what we've done so far what we've tried

00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:59,570
and I hope that you know that was good

00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:02,810
information about the tool and the

00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:04,430
algorithm but I want to focus a bit more

00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:07,160
on sort of what we've learnt in this

00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:08,780
process the first thing is that we can

00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:11,180
build you know the most sophisticated

00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:13,760
machine learning models and user

00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:15,890
interfaces but if we can't get the users

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,960
to trust and use them then there's very

00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:20,150
little point and to build this trust we

00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:22,750
really need to spend time to understand

00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:24,760
the users needs and behavior

00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:27,160
for this we're super grateful for the

00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:30,130
support of our editorial community in

00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,630
you know a agreeing and embarking on

00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:34,090
this mission together and driving this

00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:35,710
project forward most of the work of

00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:37,690
communicating with our editors and

00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:40,390
getting their feedback is done by Maria

00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:42,210
whose photos here on the slide and who

00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:45,730
is our journal development editor and

00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:48,550
members of the Eli product team this

00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:50,950
sort of frequent communication and user

00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:53,080
testing and feedback allowed us to get

00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:55,720
very quick continuous feedback from our

00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:59,680
users so that we could learn improve and

00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:02,710
iterate very quickly we also learn from

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:05,380
that version one that Daniel showed you

00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:07,330
that is probably a good idea to try and

00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:09,160
isolate and design tests for the

00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:12,490
individual aspects that the tool is

00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:14,920
trying to change so separating the

00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:18,730
algorithmic performance from you know

00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:21,820
the drive to change our behavior and

00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:26,340
this this separation allows us to better

00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:30,010
focus and prioritize our to development

00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:32,320
moving on what we see many possibilities

00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:34,660
both in improving the performance and

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,990
increasing the number of use cases for

00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:41,080
the tool so we're looking at concept

00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:45,400
extraction possibly as a way to improve

00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:50,020
the algorithms performance we're also

00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:52,480
hoping to build users editors and

00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:55,420
referees profiles using other data

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:58,750
sources so for example papers a

00:14:55,420 --> 00:15:00,700
researchers had authored this will allow

00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:02,650
us not only to build profile through our

00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:05,200
existing editors and reviewers on the

00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:08,080
system but theoretically any researchers

00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,970
who's ever authored a paper and then

00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:13,060
finally we want to see if we can turn

00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:16,800
this around and generate ranked lists

00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:19,270
using peer Scout to recommend papers to

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:24,960
editors and reviewers to choose to

00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:27,340
handle and review so yeah hopefully with

00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:29,950
continuous feedback from our and support

00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:33,220
from our community and all of you we'd

00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:35,440
be able to continue to pursue better

00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:40,180
more diversity and

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:42,610
is in this peer-review process oops just

00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:46,240
want to say a quick thank you for being

00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:48,220
here and to specifically to Maria and

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,560
the editorial team and Eli's second

00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:54,780
product all of our editors and early

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:59,470
career reviewer community to allow us to

00:15:54,780 --> 00:16:01,510
drive this forward together and yeah if

00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:04,330
you want to stay updated on some of our

00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:08,140
very exciting initiatives that are

00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:10,030
upcoming please visit one of the you

00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:11,950
know four links that we have on there on

00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:14,500
the right there and yeah thanks very

00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:16,960
much for joining us and we'd be happy to

00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,540
take questions if there's time thank you

00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:22,030
yeah thank you I think we have time for

00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:25,570
one question and I was looking at the

00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:27,940
chat and I know many people are

00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:29,410
wondering you know all journals have to

00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:31,060
deal especially journals that scale have

00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:35,170
to deal with this kind of issue around

00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:36,880
reviews and so there are other

00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:39,010
initiatives in the community like pub

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:42,450
buns that have been trying to tackle

00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:44,110
this and so you got into some of the

00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:46,540
differentiations and what you're trying

00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:49,120
to do that's different from others like

00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:50,350
you know attack playing bias and maybe

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,620
can you just talk a little bit more

00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:55,330
about if you know of other initiatives

00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:58,120
out there that are crossed journal or

00:16:55,330 --> 00:17:00,340
similar initiatives is there is there

00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:03,040
something that differentiates or in your

00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:06,130
mind is is a trend in that kind of

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:12,880
reviewer matching world dino do we want

00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:27,910
to take this one week I think you're

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:29,410
still rated okay sorry yeah one one

00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:33,070
consideration is whether it's open

00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:36,760
source so I believe the the one from pub

00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:39,220
ones is not maybe one so that's that's

00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:41,290
big in bear and also maybe that like the

00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:44,110
last point that M erased like that we

00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:45,760
can turn it around like to to actually

00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:48,340
wide it was to choose a paper that

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,160
that's appropriate that's especially I

00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:53,000
only want us

00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:56,390
very useful and we can like like maybe

00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,810
add some some positive bias which may be

00:17:56,390 --> 00:18:02,180
more difficult to like using existing

00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:03,950
tool that's especially if it's closed

00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:06,320
source and and maybe the other thing is

00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:09,110
that it's not just expertise but it's

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,720
like how many papers do they handle and

00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:13,700
other stats there may want to be so easy

00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,320
to integrate in another tool but if

00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:18,970
there's another open source tools and

00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:21,590
definitely would be interested too right

00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:23,450
yeah I know it said it's really hard I

00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:27,440
used to work at plus and it's like it's

00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:28,610
an impossible issue to tackle so

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,170
especially when you try to bring in

00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:31,820
these ideas of bias so I think it's

00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:34,010
really congratulate you on trying to

00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:36,110
tackle this and and experiment with it

00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:38,030
so okay I think we're all out of time

00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:44,000
thank you very much we're gonna move on
