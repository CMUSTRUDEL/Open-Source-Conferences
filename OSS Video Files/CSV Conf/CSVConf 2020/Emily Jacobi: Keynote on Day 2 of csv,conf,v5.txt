who's put this on I'm gonna go ahead and

00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:12,120
share my screen let's see here we go all

00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:15,330
right so see okay so yeah today I want

00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,800
to talk about data solidarity which is a

00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:19,080
phrase we've been tossing around a

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,879
digital democracy and I'm particularly

00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,200
excited to talk about with all of you

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,780
because I think you're gonna have a lot

00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,360
of insight into how you may already be

00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,720
practicing this in your

00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:32,960
in your experiences and how we can do

00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:35,510
our own like version of it better but

00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,820
before I want to do I want to begin with

00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:40,520
something that is really important to me

00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:42,890
which is to ground this in place so of

00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:45,770
course we're all here digitally right

00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:47,810
now but I really want to start with

00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:52,820
where we are

00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:56,000
so for me if we were actually in person

00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:57,260
together I actually live in DC I would

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,670
want to begin with a land

00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:04,250
acknowledgement so DC is traditionally

00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:07,970
the territory of knock-knock kachunk and

00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:09,560
it's got away people and because we work

00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:12,100
with indigenous people we feel like it's

00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:15,010
so important to acknowledge the original

00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:17,150
tenders of the land and though

00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:20,090
colonization has had a brutal impact

00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:21,410
that has displaced people who still

00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:24,260
would acknowledge that where we're

00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:25,250
starting from so for you you know people

00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,870
are calling it from all sorts of

00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:29,030
different places you might be indigenous

00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:30,680
to the land that you're on right now or

00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:33,290
you might be a settler you might be a

00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,340
visitor you might be a migrant but if

00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:36,950
you could take a minute to think about

00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,900
where you are and let's just have a

00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:40,760
moment of silence to acknowledge all the

00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:49,910
traditional peoples who have maintained

00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:50,420
this beautiful planet for so long all

00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:53,030
right

00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:55,310
and I included this link to native lands

00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:58,310
if you are not familiar with where you

00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:59,840
are or even places you might go this is

00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:04,480
a great resource for finding out who

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:07,250
native peoples are to that territory so

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,980
also talking about where we are right

00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:11,569
now I want to talk about where we are

00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:14,150
emotionally and I'd love if everybody

00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:16,970
could take a minute to just send an

00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:19,130
emoji or a few quick words of where you

00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:20,989
are and how you're doing I think there's

00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:23,690
been a lot of excitement on the slack

00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:26,000
and everything for how people are doing

00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:28,430
right now which is great but I have to

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,350
be honest with you I felt like I

00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:33,320
couldn't show up as my full authentic

00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:36,139
self today if I didn't say that it's

00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:40,370
been a really hard week for me for the

00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:42,110
past 24 hours I guess 36 hours my family

00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:44,090
was wrestling with whether or not to

00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:47,780
take my grandmother who's 98 years old

00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:48,590
out of the assisted care living facility

00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,840
where she is

00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:55,100
and whether or not to move her in with

00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:57,950
my parents she lives in Indiana where my

00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:01,669
parents also live it's just traditional

00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:04,370
land of the Miami people's and and there

00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:09,350
was just a coronavirus related death at

00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:10,669
her sister care facility and we don't

00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:13,520
got something that I'm working out with

00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:15,100
my family I'm sure all of you have your

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,350
own difficulties and challenges

00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:20,660
especially right now I've you know it's

00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:22,820
been awesome to see Danielle with her

00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:25,220
kids showing up for the hello intros

00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:26,750
yesterday I think there's you know just

00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:29,690
so much that we're all dealing with and

00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:31,400
it struck me that how can I talk about

00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:33,229
data solidarity if we're not

00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,600
acknowledging all the different things

00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:36,950
that are going on in our lives that we

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,390
carry with us you know into our

00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:40,010
professional settings and our work

00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:43,820
settings and especially right now as

00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:44,840
those lines are still blurred yeah I

00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:47,720
just really wanted to start by

00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:49,880
acknowledging that and for those who may

00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,380
be a plan to show up at this conference

00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,900
and haven't been able to because of the

00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:55,760
things they're dealing with just naming

00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:58,780
all of that so thank you for also

00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:01,640
sharing some of your feelings right now

00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:04,279
yeah and please keep it going and thank

00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:06,649
you okay

00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:10,429
so the next thing I want to talk about

00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:11,089
Oh where'd he did that is what brought

00:06:10,429 --> 00:06:12,619
you here

00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:13,909
now why are you here if we were here

00:06:12,619 --> 00:06:15,499
together that would be the question I'd

00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:17,779
want to be asking all of you you know

00:06:15,499 --> 00:06:20,329
for you you know maybe it was a work

00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:21,919
requirement to come or maybe this just

00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:24,079
aligns with you know the work that

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,299
you're doing but what is the deeper

00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:28,279
reason that brings you here maybe it's a

00:06:26,299 --> 00:06:30,319
commitment to wanting to share

00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:33,139
information and new ways maybe it's you

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,449
know struggles that you had as a younger

00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:36,769
person or that you've noticed in your

00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:38,389
community you know maybe it's something

00:06:36,769 --> 00:06:41,899
you're fighting for that you want to see

00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:43,219
happen better like like medical

00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:46,219
information be better shared or

00:06:43,219 --> 00:06:47,839
something so again I won't be able to

00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:49,999
read them all but I love if people could

00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:52,909
post a few of your reasons for being

00:06:49,999 --> 00:06:56,079
here in the chat like I like people that

00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:59,409
is such a great answer

00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:03,379
keep them coming would love to see more

00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:05,959
so for me what brought me here actually

00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:08,779
started quite a while ago when I was

00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:10,969
much younger ironically I'm currently

00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:13,789
growing out my bangs because why not

00:07:10,969 --> 00:07:15,769
during coronavirus when I can't leave

00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:17,509
the house and I think the last time I

00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:18,649
was growing up my beings when I was when

00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:20,059
I was 13 years old

00:07:18,649 --> 00:07:24,169
so I'm transported back to that awkward

00:07:20,059 --> 00:07:26,389
state as Jonathan shared in my bio I was

00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:27,499
a youth journalist when I was in Middle

00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:29,479
School in high school as part of an

00:07:27,499 --> 00:07:33,319
amazing program that was dedicated to

00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:35,629
teaching young people how to how to tell

00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:37,639
young people's stories through the field

00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:40,069
of journalism and so it's been cool

00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:42,289
within this community to be connected to

00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:43,999
so many journalists because I haven't

00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:46,699
identified as a journalist in a long

00:07:43,999 --> 00:07:51,319
time but this was this photo was when I

00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:53,269
was 13 years old and I was through my

00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:57,229
youth journalism program we've received

00:07:53,269 --> 00:07:59,409
visas to travel to Cuba so this is my

00:07:57,229 --> 00:08:01,909
hometown newspaper Indianapolis Star

00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:04,729
reporting on the team of us who were

00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:07,039
going into to Cuba to interview young

00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:09,559
people we were hoping to interview Fidel

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,419
Castro that didn't happen but we did get

00:08:09,559 --> 00:08:13,639
to hear him give a speech and most

00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:17,720
importantly I had my eyes completely

00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:19,490
opened up to so what was happening and

00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,170
island nation of Cuba which is you know

00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:24,380
one of the United States closest

00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:26,510
neighbors but for many United States

00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:29,690
citizens was at the time and continues

00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:32,719
to be really inaccessible due to due to

00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:35,690
embargoes and you know just the

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:38,599
hostility between our political in our

00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:41,090
political governments but what I really

00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:44,540
learned in Cuba more than anything was

00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:45,890
how the situation in Cuba and some of

00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:48,050
the challenges that young people were

00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:51,140
facing there was linked to policies that

00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:54,230
my government was enforcing and so that

00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:56,120
taught me an early age to try to think

00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:58,580
about you know all the ways in which

00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,260
stories connect us and the ways in which

00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,700
human beings I think share similar

00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:05,270
experiences but the way that government

00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:09,850
and policies and boundaries can cause

00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:14,000
cart come cause hardships so

00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:16,070
fast-forward about ten years later a

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,650
little bit longer I was doing research

00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:21,950
in Southeast Asia with a group that I

00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:24,740
had kind of been in University with and

00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:27,860
we were researching the situation for

00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:30,830
for young people along the Myanmar

00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:33,200
Thailand border so refugees Burmese

00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:36,589
refugees and refugees with different

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,940
various ethnic identity groups and we

00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:40,100
were just trying to understand what the

00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:42,380
situations was for them as refugees and

00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:45,050
migrant workers and in our research we

00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:47,510
came across a correlation between

00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:49,880
internet access and political engagement

00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:51,320
and that for me was honestly the moment

00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,170
that started me on a path towards

00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:57,470
becoming a technologist because though

00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:59,540
this aspect of internet access seems so

00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:01,430
important and so critical to them and

00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:03,500
they talked about how you know they

00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:05,839
would walk on this young woman Julian

00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,550
she would walk an hour and a half in

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,530
order to get to the internet cafe in

00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,910
order to communicate with her family

00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:13,910
members who were in a different refugee

00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:15,650
camp and so just this critical you know

00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:17,330
the ability to access information and

00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:19,190
communicate with their loved ones was so

00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:21,980
critical is sort of me thinking about

00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:23,810
technology and over the next couple of

00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:26,930
years I did research with a couple other

00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:29,660
people on the ways in which grassroots

00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:31,850
organizations in Southeast Asia we're

00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:34,399
starting to use technology

00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:36,889
to to work on human rights issues so

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,240
some of them were starting to map human

00:10:36,889 --> 00:10:41,209
rights violations that were happening

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,829
inside me and mark Burma and they were

00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:47,079
just trying to share information in

00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:49,459
various ways and then in fall 2007

00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:52,550
September there was what was been

00:10:49,459 --> 00:10:55,850
referred to as a saffron uprising which

00:10:52,550 --> 00:11:00,170
is where ordinary citizens inside

00:10:55,850 --> 00:11:02,059
Myanmar Burma were fighting against fuel

00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:04,910
price increased by the government which

00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:07,490
was a military regime and they were

00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:09,769
really just arguing for the basic safety

00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:11,749
and health of people and because we had

00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:13,189
a lot of contacts inside the country we

00:11:11,749 --> 00:11:16,670
knew the ways in which they were using

00:11:13,189 --> 00:11:18,350
mobile phones and Internet access to

00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:20,029
share information and we were actually

00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:22,639
getting messages from inside the country

00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:25,699
of what was happening that saffron

00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:30,619
uprising was halted effectively by the

00:11:25,699 --> 00:11:32,329
government not by not not solely by

00:11:30,619 --> 00:11:35,720
violence there was a violent crackdown

00:11:32,329 --> 00:11:37,339
on the protesters there but they

00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,799
actually ended up turning off the

00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:42,730
internet and cell phones for five full

00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:44,959
days and this was in 2007

00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:47,089
since then other governments have done

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:50,410
the same a movies actually right now in

00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:55,249
Kashmir I believe it's the longest going

00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:58,220
full internet shutdown which has you

00:11:55,249 --> 00:11:59,449
know been that has been happening while

00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:02,420
there have been violent repressions

00:11:59,449 --> 00:12:04,819
against people inside inside Kashmir but

00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:09,619
so in that moment for 2007 for me it was

00:12:04,819 --> 00:12:12,589
a total aha moment of the power that

00:12:09,619 --> 00:12:14,240
governments have when when they can shut

00:12:12,589 --> 00:12:16,309
down technologies and the need to have

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,079
technologies that aren't dependent on

00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:20,449
government control and that unable

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:23,119
people to actually get the information

00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:25,309
out in ways that they need to without

00:12:23,119 --> 00:12:29,240
that kind of interference so that was

00:12:25,309 --> 00:12:34,540
really what led to to me co-founding

00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:38,149
digital democracy and an exploring what

00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:40,639
how technology itself is a powerful tool

00:12:38,149 --> 00:12:43,699
and information is a powerful tool and

00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,990
the ways in which the people who are the

00:12:43,699 --> 00:12:47,060
most marginalized

00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:49,310
and the most oppressed how they can

00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:52,940
leverage that as a tool to fight against

00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:54,410
the power except E and we know that that

00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:56,060
entrenched powers are always going to

00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:59,990
try to protect their interests in any

00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:03,290
way possible so when we start to subvert

00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:05,210
do the the power and and make sure that

00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:07,730
people who are most marginalized have

00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:09,170
access to it and can actually share

00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:12,020
their own information and control the

00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:13,670
owner information that that is how we

00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:16,490
believe that a lot of positive change

00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:20,440
can happen so that's been our focus for

00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:23,090
a long time at digital democracy and as

00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,800
Jonathan said in my bio our mission is

00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:27,290
really just to work in solidarity with

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:30,650
marginalized groups to use technology to

00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:32,030
defend their rights and that looks a lot

00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:33,830
of different ways and we've worked in a

00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:35,450
lot of different places but the work

00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:38,380
that I want to talk about today has been

00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:41,000
primarily in the Amazon rainforest and

00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,620
with indigenous peoples with whom we've

00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:48,740
been working for over seven years

00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:50,240
on a variety of issues so at digital

00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:52,220
democracy you know our day to day work

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,780
is really comprised of two things one

00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:56,030
we're working directly with local

00:13:53,780 --> 00:14:00,050
communities here these are a couple of

00:13:56,030 --> 00:14:02,750
community monitors from from the local

00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:05,540
group called ayka or America hurry they

00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:09,110
are an indigenous light organization

00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:10,790
that co-manages natural reserve the

00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:13,190
community of reserve and southern Peru

00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:15,620
the Amara khari communal reserve and

00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:19,910
here you see them actually taking a

00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:21,800
picture of a mining site near near the

00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:23,810
reserve and they're documenting all

00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,970
these threats like mining and illegal

00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:28,730
logging in order to protect their

00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:30,080
territory and we work directly with

00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:33,530
these groups to help them incorporate

00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:36,130
technology in a holistic way into into

00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:41,150
their work to protect their territories

00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:43,340
and then we also as a result and this is

00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:45,710
really harkens back I'm going to be

00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:48,260
referencing rudos talk an hour ago quite

00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:50,240
a bit you know birudo at the Amazon

00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:52,280
conservation team is doing very aligned

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:56,030
work and we've been longtime friends and

00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:57,980
allies and so similar to Rudo we saw

00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:58,760
there in our work with local partners

00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,920
we've seen

00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:03,889
such a gap app that a lot of the tools

00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:06,410
that that are built for commercial

00:15:03,889 --> 00:15:08,510
reasons or just even for you know the

00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:10,459
situation here in the United States for

00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:12,230
example where there's a you know not not

00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:14,930
complete internet access but certainly

00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:16,699
more internet access in the Amazon a lot

00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:20,089
of those tools just don't work for local

00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:21,589
partners needs in Amazon and so we the

00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:23,750
second area of our work and this

00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:26,589
becoming an even bigger area is to

00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:34,760
co-create tools with our local partners

00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:37,040
nope I just accidentally I see sorry I

00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:41,959
mean slightly different form when I'm

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:46,850
used to so I'm just okay so here's a you

00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:48,649
use the map of some of our partners

00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:49,670
across the Amazon these are different

00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:52,790
indigenous groups that we've been

00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:54,139
working with some for over a decade many

00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:56,089
others in the past few years but I

00:15:54,139 --> 00:15:57,889
wanted to give you a sense there's no

00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:59,959
groups pictured in Brazil on this map

00:15:57,889 --> 00:16:01,579
that we are in relation and starting to

00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:06,910
work with quite a few work groups in

00:16:01,579 --> 00:16:06,910
Brazil as well oh gosh I did it again

00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:16,220
thanks for bearing with me so the bulk

00:16:14,899 --> 00:16:18,440
of what I want to talk about is really

00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:20,269
the story of a tool that we've been

00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:23,029
building called Matt Baio and I'm gonna

00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:24,290
tell it first through telling a story of

00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:27,560
one of our partners the lor Ronnie

00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:32,029
people and how we can Co built this tool

00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:35,810
together so this is my friend amante she

00:16:32,029 --> 00:16:38,720
is a leader of the Huaorani people who

00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:42,709
are who live in what is now the eastern

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:45,260
part of the Ecuadorian Amazon and the

00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:47,300
Huaorani have lived on their territory

00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:50,360
and for thousands upon thousands of

00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:52,480
years and have very effectively fought

00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:56,300
against many different ways of invasion

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:59,300
you know early on Incas later on the

00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:02,060
Spanish conquistadors later on raw

00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:05,329
rubber plantations you know the list

00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:07,130
goes on and on but they have been in

00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:09,709
contact with the outside world really

00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:12,490
only since late the 1980s or so when

00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:15,160
American missionaries actually came in

00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:17,080
and during that first wave of contact

00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,060
we've been talking a lot about it lately

00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:21,580
because what's happening right now with

00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:23,440
coronavirus is bringing up a lot of the

00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:26,460
memories of that first wave of contacts

00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:29,410
because when the missionaries came in

00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:34,000
thousands of war --any people died from

00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:35,110
from common illnesses and and we've one

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,210
of the things that the warranty have

00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:39,640
done is you know map some of the areas

00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:43,240
where they you know where they lost the

00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:46,060
most people but you know in recent years

00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:47,650
the Huaorani have you know been able to

00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:51,310
maintain a lot of their traditional ways

00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:53,770
of live life even amidst kind of contact

00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:57,460
with the outside world and they came to

00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:59,290
us in 2015 through through a couple of

00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:01,420
our partner organizations a group of

00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:02,890
Alianza sable which is an alliance of

00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:05,050
four different indigenous nationalities

00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:07,120
in Ecuador including the more ani as

00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:10,330
well as Amazon frontlines who are an

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:12,670
amazing NGO in Ecuador that's working

00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:15,460
directly with indigenous groups to to

00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:17,440
build indigenous power and they asked us

00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,700
to help them with a mapping process and

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,400
the mapping process we do is very

00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:23,770
similar to the one Rudo described which

00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:26,170
is we start with paper so here we're

00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:28,390
here in Oman States actually leading a

00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:31,720
group of women in the village of name of

00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:34,300
Bari to do some some base level mapping

00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,790
and you can see this is another village

00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:38,980
this is from the village of a carro

00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:41,020
where they we started with just two but

00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:43,060
your blocks sheets but by the end of the

00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:45,010
initial paper mapping exercise they had

00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:47,140
eight butcher blocks sheets put together

00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:48,760
and just to give you a sense of how

00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:51,730
detailed their knowledge is of their

00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:53,920
community the you know the village

00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:56,380
itself took up about this much it's hard

00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:58,210
to see I made kind of screen about this

00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:00,190
much of a paper it wasn't that big but

00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:02,020
their deep knowledge of all the rivers

00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:04,270
and streams you know they just wanted to

00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:06,190
keep going out and out so we start with

00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:07,960
paper maps because that's very

00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:11,980
accessible it means that everybody can

00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:14,200
get involved and then they would go out

00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:16,330
and at the time they were using GPS

00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,430
handhelds to go out and document places

00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:20,140
often with elders and they would do oral

00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:23,770
history interviews again similar to

00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:26,110
rudos work with elders of of you know

00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:26,260
the different things and sites that they

00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:28,780
were

00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:30,460
documenting and then they would come

00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:32,980
back and this is this is kind of the

00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:36,190
part that we were really excited about

00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:37,930
is we were building at the time the

00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:40,870
earlier version of what we now call Matt

00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:43,690
Bayeux desktop which is a desktop based

00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:45,790
application that our partners had on

00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:48,190
their on their computers were able to

00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:50,050
take into the field and then in real

00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:52,270
time they would actually soak them up to

00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:54,370
your projector project against the wall

00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:56,260
and have the whole community get to be

00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:59,020
part of the process of digitizing the

00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:01,330
data that they had collected and and be

00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:03,580
able to put in wow taro they're you know

00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:05,230
their own language all of the details

00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:08,170
about what was going on and so Matt

00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:09,370
Bayeux is a tool that we've built we

00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:10,240
originally built up on top of

00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:12,790
OpenStreetMaps

00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,490
ID editor but instead of the backend

00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:17,170
being the open Street global Street Map

00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:19,060
global database which of course is

00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:22,150
online they have an offline version

00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:24,970
that's just theirs and so we built it so

00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:27,160
that it's offline first so as you can

00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:29,410
see here this is Jorge who was a member

00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,910
of the boron II mapping team talking

00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:32,560
with an elder and they were able to look

00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:34,420
at the map together and really you know

00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:37,510
be involved in that not just the paper

00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:39,220
process but the digital process so

00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:41,440
here's a close-up of one of the

00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:48,150
communities that they Matt Damon taro

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:51,220
and then here are just a few of the

00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:53,200
dozens and dozens of icons that they

00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:54,580
created over time and this process was

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,440
it was a really cool process where the

00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:58,060
communities would you know first have a

00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,560
physical brainstorm of what about what

00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:02,020
are the things we want to document and

00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:04,240
then they would kind of categorize those

00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:05,950
and then they would do drawings of these

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,110
and then they worked with an Ecuadorian

00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:12,990
Quito based designer to turn them into

00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:15,370
digital icons that they could put in and

00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:17,050
so these maps you know were really

00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:19,450
forced first and foremost created for

00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:21,430
the communities themselves and they were

00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:25,750
sharing them amongst their communities

00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:28,360
and then two years ago the government

00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:30,160
announced this is a map of the

00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,840
ecuadorian amazon with the you know the

00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:34,960
yellow centered on Huaorani territory

00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:37,330
the government announced a sale of a lot

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,760
of new oil blocks including block 22

00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:42,130
which is right here and the

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,990
western part of irani territory and

00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:46,990
block 22 is actually where we had been

00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:49,210
doing that mapping so name on parades

00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:52,150
avatar al carro some of these villages I

00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:53,470
mentioned were all Earl in block 22 and

00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:56,140
the government announced that they were

00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:59,169
going to to be leasing these blocks for

00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:01,390
sale and they were basing it off of you

00:21:59,169 --> 00:22:03,880
know consultations that they claimed to

00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:07,840
have done with with local communities

00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:09,610
the problem is that you know when they

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,500
did those consultations they really just

00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:12,700
flew in talked to a couple people said

00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,929
we want to you know help you build

00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:17,200
schools we want to help you build

00:22:13,929 --> 00:22:19,570
hospitals and then can you sign this and

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,580
a couple people signed it out sign that

00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:23,799
but there really wasn't you know any

00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:25,390
actual full consultation process and

00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:29,409
most people had no idea what they were

00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:31,450
agreeing to so the Huaorani launched

00:22:29,409 --> 00:22:32,799
they they lost your campaign to fight

00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,539
against that this is actually a

00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:37,169
screenshot from a map we helped them

00:22:34,539 --> 00:22:40,059
build a map story which I'll link to

00:22:37,169 --> 00:22:42,610
later which tells the whole story of

00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:46,210
their fight against oil and the threats

00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:49,570
that the oil posed for them and then

00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:52,030
they also launched an online version of

00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:53,470
their map and they this was again from

00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:56,760
the same map story that we helped them

00:22:53,470 --> 00:23:00,490
build that really tells the story of why

00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:02,799
they're their territory is so threatened

00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:05,530
by oil and why they're resisting oil

00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:07,090
drilling on their territory one of the

00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:08,620
things that they told us in the early

00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:10,929
stages that has just always stuck with

00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:13,510
me is we want to create a map full of

00:23:10,929 --> 00:23:15,909
things that don't have a price so they

00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:17,380
saw the way in which oil drilling has

00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:19,150
come in to neighboring communities and

00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:21,240
just devastated the local environment

00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:24,070
it's made people dependent on outside

00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:25,929
food and water you know it's it's

00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:28,120
stopped them from being able to hunt and

00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:30,010
fish and it's force them into a

00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,030
dependency on the national government

00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:33,730
that the war on e

00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:36,460
otherwise don't have so we launched this

00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:39,039
campaign and the like the advocacy side

00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:40,900
went along with the legal side and the

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:43,870
legal strategy has been really critical

00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:47,350
and here you see in the monta who was in

00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:50,980
that first picture I shared of you know

00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:52,870
of the the mapping the mapping workshop

00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:54,669
and here she is

00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:58,179
one of the lead plaintiffs in the legal

00:23:54,669 --> 00:24:00,429
case and the case was first heard by the

00:23:58,179 --> 00:24:02,200
local courts and then it was and then it

00:24:00,429 --> 00:24:05,650
went on to the national level and each

00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:07,720
time the ecuadorian government ruled and

00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:10,350
in the war on 'is favor and said that

00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:12,970
the the ecuadorian government had indeed

00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:15,309
violated their rights to free prior and

00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:16,870
informed consent so free prior and

00:24:15,309 --> 00:24:20,770
informed consent being a really critical

00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:23,289
piece of a kind of indigenous the UN

00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:25,539
declaration of indigenous rights and it

00:24:23,289 --> 00:24:27,880
enabled them to to have the oil block

00:24:25,539 --> 00:24:30,520
removed from their territory so and in

00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:33,880
effect that court case meant that 1/2

00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:36,250
1/2 million acres of the Huaorani

00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:38,649
you know ecuadorian amazon has been

00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:41,409
protected and now we're working with

00:24:38,649 --> 00:24:44,500
those same partners to work on a larger

00:24:41,409 --> 00:24:46,450
project around all the other territories

00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:49,029
that were also up for sale in the oil

00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:51,760
block which as you can see is seven

00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:53,890
million acres that those are now also

00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:57,940
being questioned as to the legality of

00:24:53,890 --> 00:25:00,610
them so that was really exciting to see

00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:02,919
and you know matt Baio was just a really

00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:05,140
a tool in the background that that

00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:07,899
enabled you know this community to

00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:09,309
create their own map and in doing so not

00:25:07,899 --> 00:25:11,440
only have tools that they could use in

00:25:09,309 --> 00:25:13,480
court to argue why you know their

00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:16,600
territory would be so threatened by oil

00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:19,000
but also enabled them to actually just

00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:20,799
build up shared unity that that they

00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
talked a lot and that we debriefed about

00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,380
the whole process and in fact a lot

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,140
about how the mapping process for them

00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:27,669
felt critical to them and building the

00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:31,390
consensus they needed to to fight

00:25:27,669 --> 00:25:33,880
against the oil when it was announced so

00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:36,669
here's another story this is a alexandre

00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:39,399
who's one of the members of the guardia

00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:43,860
which is like a local patrol of the

00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:43,860
Kofun people in Siegen going and

00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:50,470
they also remember Alianza Sabo and we

00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:52,300
started working with them about the

00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:54,520
Ronnie mapping process we really used

00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:57,310
the handheld GPS in the desktop

00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:58,930
application but for that process we we

00:25:57,310 --> 00:26:00,280
were starting to see and with many of

00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:03,010
our different partners the need for a

00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:04,300
better mobile phone application Rooter

00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:06,370
actually mentioned some of the tools

00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:09,490
that we've used in the past like open

00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:11,290
open data kit and others and you know

00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:13,570
there's a lot of tools out there that

00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:17,050
are designed to help collect data

00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:20,860
offline but there are very few tools

00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:23,200
we've found that take that data

00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:26,440
collection and turn it into locally

00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:28,570
empowered data management so you know a

00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:30,940
lot of times when people are when

00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:33,550
whether it's indigenous people you know

00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:35,410
whether it's rural villagers you know

00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:37,180
maybe for an academic study when people

00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:39,910
are kind of conscripted to help collect

00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:42,760
data it often feels actually like a very

00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:43,840
extractive process because I mean I've

00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,340
talked to people in so many different

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,320
places who have been part of data

00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:49,000
collection efforts where they've maybe

00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,860
been trained on how to use a phone and

00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,720
go out and ask questions and gather

00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:55,450
information and then they never see that

00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,850
data again and that for us is deeply

00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:59,770
problematic so the idea behind map Bay

00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:01,930
of mobile is not only that it would be

00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:03,280
easy to collect data in the field you

00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:05,380
know in these remote areas without

00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:08,230
internet but that they could also then

00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:09,640
manage the information themselves so we

00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:13,750
worked with Alexandra and hair community

00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:18,280
and we built this tool this is a

00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:19,480
screenshot of the kind of GPS view you

00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,310
can see some of the different points

00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,920
they've been taken along the way and you

00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:26,590
are kind of just you know very visual

00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:28,960
and simple to do you press this orange

00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:32,860
button to take to take a picture or

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:36,060
sorry to take to take a GPS point little

00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:36,060
gosh I did it again

00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:45,610
usually go make some of the tech

00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:47,920
mistakes but this new system for me and

00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:50,770
then so you press that first button and

00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:53,500
then you are able to choose you know

00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:55,540
different these are we have permission

00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,590
to share these images of some of the

00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,640
different icons that they've been

00:27:56,590 --> 00:28:02,110
collecting and

00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:07,320
single-a like trees like different kinds

00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:24,390
of palms you know ants and so on or and

00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:28,090
we'll just go back sorry um Wow

00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:30,820
so you can also take you can also switch

00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:32,470
to camera view up here or you can look

00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:34,299
at all of the items you've collected

00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:35,410
here I don't have a whole lot of

00:28:34,299 --> 00:28:36,880
screenshots on this because I didn't

00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:39,190
want to get too technical in this but if

00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,840
you do want to learn more you can go to

00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:43,030
our website I think redirect she already

00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:47,350
posted the map Bayeux link and you can

00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:50,740
see a lot more images of this and then

00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:52,630
this is just actually a short video this

00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:55,630
that one of my colleagues took while in

00:28:52,630 --> 00:29:01,030
The Hague of how you can how you can use

00:28:55,630 --> 00:29:02,740
um Matt Bayeux very easily so you can

00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:04,960
see the different kinds of categories

00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:07,090
you know we work with partners to create

00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:10,030
their own categories or their standards

00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:11,919
as people can download you can enter in

00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:15,220
information it's also designed that you

00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:16,570
don't have to enter information so

00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,370
sometimes you know somebody just needs

00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:20,260
to really quickly take a picture that's

00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:21,880
connected to GPS points and get out of

00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:24,400
there if it's a dangerous situation for

00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:26,950
example and so we've built in a lot of

00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:28,929
flexibility to that to how Matt Bayeux

00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:31,840
works so that it can meet different

00:29:28,929 --> 00:29:35,799
different needs as well as different

00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:37,150
like permissions and privacy controls so

00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:39,760
here's another picture

00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:42,400
some of Alexandra's colleagues from the

00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:45,280
lysene include Cordia and the patrol out

00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:49,929
doing doing a mapping project

00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:53,040
so what map you multiple does is allows

00:29:49,929 --> 00:29:56,080
for both taking baseline map information

00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:57,760
like you know sacred sites or where

00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,860
different rivers are where community

00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,740
sites are where plants and animals are

00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:05,559
but it also allows for tracking ongoing

00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:07,929
monitoring information so we're an oil

00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:09,580
spill maybe has happened or illegal

00:30:07,929 --> 00:30:11,230
logging or mining and so we're working

00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:12,520
with partners

00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:16,450
in many different places who are working

00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:18,370
across many different examples right now

00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:21,340
it's being used by over 150 different

00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:24,490
frontline defenders who are representing

00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:28,570
like 7,000 people in total and they're

00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:31,030
monitoring and mapping territory a size

00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:34,330
about four million hectares which is

00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:36,070
close to 10 million acres of indigenous

00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:39,970
territory right now it's primarily being

00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:42,870
used in the Amazon but we are starting

00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:45,130
to work it's being used as well in

00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:46,240
conceptual America and we're starting to

00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:48,220
work with some groups in Southeast Asia

00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,820
who are translating it into different

00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:53,140
languages so I'll get into in a minute

00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:55,570
so our vision for it really is that

00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:59,169
because we built it to be offline first

00:30:55,570 --> 00:31:01,179
and to to be used and adapted to

00:30:59,169 --> 00:31:02,679
different use cases our vision is to you

00:31:01,179 --> 00:31:05,290
know continue making available to people

00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:06,910
anywhere who might need it and if you

00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:08,290
have any you know potential case study

00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:09,700
ideas or groups that you think might

00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:10,860
want to use it we'd love to hear about

00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:14,530
that

00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:16,390
so all that kind of brings me to the

00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:18,669
topic of our talk which is around data

00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:20,410
solidarity again I don't even know if

00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:22,030
that's a phrase that works I'm just kind

00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:26,010
of trying it out and I really would

00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:28,660
welcome the feedback on that but for me

00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:31,450
solidarity is really around recognizing

00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:34,150
that we're all interconnected and you

00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:37,150
know power imbalances exist systems of

00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:39,850
oppression exist all too well and yet

00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:42,370
when we start to recognize that we're

00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:45,010
all interconnected and that we all stand

00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:47,230
to benefit from supporting one each of

00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:49,470
one another then we can start to act I

00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:51,820
think in solidarity with each other and

00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:53,770
for us you know there's a few different

00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:56,140
ways we do that and I really was trying

00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:57,940
to think of how do I share this in a way

00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:00,820
that can be relevant you know my like on

00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:03,130
the surface doing indigenous mapping in

00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:05,350
remote parts the Amazon may seem really

00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:06,970
different than running a library and on

00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:09,160
the other hand I think there are so many

00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:11,770
similarities because we're all working

00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:15,160
you know to try to benefit the common

00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:18,429
good we're working around issues of how

00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:19,870
do we address different imbalances and

00:32:18,429 --> 00:32:23,440
try to you know make things better with

00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:25,090
information and data we share so yeah

00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,370
really I'm really interested in like

00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:31,450
what aspects of things we've learned can

00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:34,029
be relevant to so you so one things we

00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:38,499
we've become really clear on is that we

00:32:34,029 --> 00:32:41,340
think we are oh my gosh I'm just seeing

00:32:38,499 --> 00:32:49,210
the the comment about the system glitch

00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:51,820
okay thank you so we have realized I'll

00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:52,570
admit when I first started digital

00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:55,269
democracy

00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:56,889
I thought that maybe technology was just

00:32:55,269 --> 00:32:59,710
neutral and it's all about how people

00:32:56,889 --> 00:33:01,450
use it and you know there's lots of kind

00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:05,230
of sayings like that in the United

00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:07,179
States about different things and like

00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:09,639
for example if I think if somewhat

00:33:07,179 --> 00:33:11,440
famous one is well it's not gonna kill

00:33:09,639 --> 00:33:14,529
people it's people who kill people and

00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:16,720
you know technically that's true and yet

00:33:14,529 --> 00:33:19,929
also the things that we build are imbued

00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:23,409
with different values and so often I

00:33:19,929 --> 00:33:25,299
mean for too much of human history the

00:33:23,409 --> 00:33:27,369
people who have the most power have

00:33:25,299 --> 00:33:31,360
claimed to be neutral and a claim to be

00:33:27,369 --> 00:33:34,179
objective and have you use that kind of

00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,889
veil of objectivity to actually enforce

00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:39,610
a lot of terrible policies that I've

00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:41,169
heard many many people and so we became

00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:44,139
as we started building our own

00:33:41,169 --> 00:33:46,629
technology we realized that we really

00:33:44,139 --> 00:33:48,100
needed to name our values and then we

00:33:46,629 --> 00:33:49,809
needed to constantly check if the

00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:52,299
decisions we were making were in line

00:33:49,809 --> 00:33:55,299
with those values because especially in

00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:58,720
an era when so much technology is built

00:33:55,299 --> 00:34:00,610
by for-profit companies and not only

00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,879
for-profit but that you know are built

00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:06,730
into a system based on you know return

00:34:03,879 --> 00:34:11,020
of capital to venture capitalists and

00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:13,720
and are built into you know a system

00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:15,849
where like for many for many of this

00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:18,220
like social media tools that we use you

00:34:15,849 --> 00:34:20,020
know our our information our attention

00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:22,089
is actually the product and that's being

00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:27,099
monetized but often in such an invisible

00:34:22,089 --> 00:34:28,389
wave so for us we felt like we felt like

00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:29,980
it was really important to name our

00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:31,629
values and lead with those and I think

00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:34,179
it's something that you know everybody

00:34:31,629 --> 00:34:36,429
working with data and information

00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:38,210
technology should be doing so some of

00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:41,359
our values

00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:43,270
all right I get this right so first

00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:44,929
self-determination and autonomy

00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:47,569
especially because we're working with

00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:51,470
indigenous peoples so critical to make

00:34:47,569 --> 00:34:53,540
sure that they are able to make

00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:55,369
decisions for themselves so with our

00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:58,040
technology work we're trying to reduce

00:34:55,369 --> 00:35:00,710
dependency on outsiders we're trying to

00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:03,109
be sure that they're able to actually

00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:06,740
control their own information and choose

00:35:03,109 --> 00:35:08,990
you know how and when it's shared next

00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:10,490
is accessibility you know this is

00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:11,329
obviously critical and you know

00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:13,069
something we've already been talking

00:35:11,329 --> 00:35:15,200
about so much these past few days at

00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:17,780
this conference but all the different

00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:20,390
ways in which accessibility matters so

00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:21,619
looking at you know especially with

00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:24,200
indigenous peoples we're working a lot

00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:26,480
of different languages also around you

00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,670
know just understanding you know what

00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,740
what to me brought up in the visual way

00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:32,210
I was might be you know really obvious

00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:33,800
it's gonna be different to somebody from

00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:38,720
a different culture so how do how are we

00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:40,250
testing and kind of working with with

00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:43,450
our partners to design things that

00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:46,940
really work for them from the get-go

00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:49,280
next is collaboration you know

00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:52,790
everything we do is a partnership and I

00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:54,200
think I think the funding model of so

00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:56,380
many things I was thinking about this

00:35:54,200 --> 00:36:00,260
with the C C's comment yesterday around

00:35:56,380 --> 00:36:01,549
you know how journalists how there's

00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:03,470
collaboration on the tech within

00:36:01,549 --> 00:36:05,000
journalism but competition elsewhere and

00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:09,049
I think that's not so dissimilar

00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:11,960
probably from NGOs and from from

00:36:09,049 --> 00:36:13,760
academia and I I think at least in the

00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:16,460
NGO sector I really want to change that

00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:18,710
I think that the more we collaborate the

00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:21,319
better you know we're not we have the

00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:23,000
benefit of we're not working for just a

00:36:21,319 --> 00:36:25,490
financial bottom line we're working for

00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,099
a human bottom line so the more we

00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:30,559
actually are collaborating and sharing

00:36:27,099 --> 00:36:32,599
sharing our work and sharing sharing our

00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:36,020
approaches I think the greater impact we

00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:37,339
can have and then finally our final

00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:39,319
value that was kind of one of our

00:36:37,339 --> 00:36:42,609
guiding stars is just the integration of

00:36:39,319 --> 00:36:44,960
social and environmental justice and in

00:36:42,609 --> 00:36:46,670
again in the NGO sector I think there's

00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,799
so much push to kind of separate those

00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:50,480
two things out as though you know what

00:36:48,799 --> 00:36:51,710
happens to people over here and what

00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,690
happens to the environment over here

00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,950
are really separate things but we

00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:58,040
believe that those just cannot be

00:36:54,950 --> 00:37:00,020
separated and especially today in an era

00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:02,240
of you know with the threats of you know

00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:03,589
changing climate and everything else we

00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,380
really have to look at those things as

00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:08,359
linked and you know we're not gonna be

00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:09,800
doing anything good for the environment

00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:16,700
if we're harming indigenous peoples

00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:18,230
along the way and vice versa so yeah you

00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:20,810
know based on that I wanted to talk

00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:21,800
about some of the ideas of like some of

00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:24,230
the ideas that we've been working on

00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:27,080
that might apply to the broader CSV

00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:29,960
community and I'm excited to see you

00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:31,940
know your thoughts and and please feel

00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:35,540
free to like add to the chat as well and

00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:37,369
communicate afterward but one thing

00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:40,190
we've been really talking about a lot is

00:37:37,369 --> 00:37:42,920
local first so Ruda was talking about

00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:45,770
offline first and how critical that is

00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:47,599
so for us local first means not only

00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:51,260
that things are built to work offline

00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:54,170
first from the get-go but also that all

00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:56,720
the data can be stored locally and that

00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:57,890
information can all be can all be shared

00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,450
there and so we've we've written a

00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:02,240
written a blog post about this would

00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:06,200
love to get your thoughts on it but for

00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:08,030
us if things work offline and then can

00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:10,580
go online then we know that they can

00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:15,589
reach everybody so that's again about

00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:17,720
the kind of accessibility issue second

00:38:15,589 --> 00:38:21,170
we think a lot about community owned

00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:22,670
data and not necessarily open by default

00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:24,290
and I know a lot of folks in this

00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:27,109
community are doing really important

00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:28,250
work around open data and I think that's

00:38:27,109 --> 00:38:30,950
so critical when we think about

00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:32,810
governments when we think about oil

00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:34,369
companies we think about mining

00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:38,150
companies you know basically anywhere

00:38:34,369 --> 00:38:40,280
where the power is held you know like

00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:42,950
where there are power imbalances I think

00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:45,200
opening up data is is really important

00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:47,390
because often it's through closed

00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,710
datasets that that insurance power

00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:52,690
interests are able to maintain those

00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:56,290
interests and are able to you know

00:38:52,690 --> 00:39:00,260
really continue harming people but

00:38:56,290 --> 00:39:02,270
sometimes I think it's also important to

00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:04,700
understand again around power imbalances

00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:05,870
for indigenous peoples you know

00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:08,480
sometimes

00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:10,390
opening data can be the worst option for

00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:13,820
them you know one example that really

00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:18,970
sticks with me is during the fight over

00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:24,470
the Dakota access pipeline in 2016 the

00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:26,600
the the tribe put in a information to

00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:28,070
the local government office about where

00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,360
some sacred sites were because they

00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:31,670
wanted to make sure those sites were

00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:33,620
protected from the pipeline that was

00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:35,690
coming through and that day and of

00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:37,460
course this was in the time when there

00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:41,630
were many you know so many nonviolent

00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:43,040
protesters who come to come to the the

00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:44,720
camp and we're trying to you know

00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,760
support the tribes sovereignty around

00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:50,600
preventing the the pipeline from coming

00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:53,540
through the the pipeline company jumped

00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:55,100
ahead in their construction process so

00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:56,870
the the information was filed with the

00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:59,000
local government on a Friday the

00:39:56,870 --> 00:40:00,830
following day on a Saturday morning the

00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,740
pipeline company jumped ahead 20 miles

00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:05,330
in order to to actually start

00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:08,480
construction exactly where these sacred

00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:10,520
sites were because they would rather pay

00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:13,340
the fine for you know for violating that

00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:16,010
then have them being halted from from

00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:17,780
building the pipeline and you know

00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:19,100
there's there's many examples like that

00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:21,710
of ways in which you know really

00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:24,140
important sensitive information from

00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:26,480
indigenous communities has been if it's

00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:28,940
shared has then been leaked and turned

00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:31,580
against them so so for us we talk a lot

00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:33,200
about community owned data because

00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:35,150
sometimes open isn't the right answer

00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,860
especially when you know we were doing

00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:41,300
with the marginalized communities and

00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:42,440
sensitive information and then you know

00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:44,330
I've already kind of mentioned this but

00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:46,430
Co designing and code building from the

00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:48,260
beginning and just seeing so many

00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:50,450
examples in our work around the world of

00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:52,760
really well intentioned projects that

00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:55,850
have been built from far away and then

00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:57,140
brought to a community and you know the

00:40:55,850 --> 00:41:00,170
good all the good intentions in the

00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:02,150
world don't matter if people aren't kind

00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:04,700
of you know listened to from the get-go

00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:06,470
and I think that it really especially

00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:08,390
when we think about the resources it

00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:10,550
takes to build new projects and to and

00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:13,970
to deal with you know new data projects

00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:15,770
you know having things come from the

00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:18,190
local community is always the best

00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:18,190
practice

00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:24,750
and then finally taking a stance and I

00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:26,310
think that you know there's something

00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:29,910
weird we've been talking about with with

00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:31,800
just naming our values and you know

00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:32,970
maybe it feels a little risky like maybe

00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,380
we're gonna get something wrong maybe

00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:35,790
we're gonna realize some of the things

00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:37,650
we're doing aren't in line with our

00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:39,870
values but we think it's really

00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:41,340
important to to take a stance and to

00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:43,500
name what we're going for and what we're

00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:46,290
working for because it helps us like

00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:47,460
learn in the open helps us find the

00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:50,010
people though that were meant to

00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:54,530
collaborate with and and hopefully helps

00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:57,630
all of our work be better so that I

00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:59,310
believe is just about what I wanted to

00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:00,720
say um somebody didn't get involved and

00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:02,670
I'll post these links and slack as well

00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,380
um if you want to get involved in

00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:06,780
contributing to our code we would love

00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:08,160
that we have lots of different you know

00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:10,620
ways to get involved and lots of

00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:13,380
different repositories you can you can

00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:17,820
get contribute to especially if you know

00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:20,910
react native which is a the kind of core

00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:22,890
tool we've used to to enable our our

00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:25,260
apps to work across different platforms

00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:27,180
and then we also been doing a lot around

00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:29,550
translation I meant to include a slide

00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:31,860
of all the different language languages

00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:33,360
and Maffeo is being translated into but

00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:34,770
you are welcome to contribute if you

00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:37,290
click on those links you'll see some of

00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:41,280
the languages so that's being translated

00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:44,190
into and and then I'll also include our

00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:48,510
public slack link in this chat and in

00:42:44,190 --> 00:43:00,090
slack and I think I'm good to go for

00:42:48,510 --> 00:43:02,460
questions Thank You Emily I think we

00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:04,830
have plenty of time for questions so I

00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:08,880
hope that people won't add their

00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:12,180
questions to the chat or the ask a

00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:14,130
question feature additionally I just

00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:16,560
wanted to say while we kind of wait for

00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:19,560
questions come in a little bit say thank

00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:22,500
you very much for you know your your

00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:26,100
your you know address and the way you

00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:28,100
started the keynote at least I'll speak

00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:30,700
for myself

00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:33,400
really

00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:36,130
and mindset they received the the topic

00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:41,380
that you were discussing it's a it was a

00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:44,079
very appropriate setting and Martin

00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:48,160
frame to receive this really important

00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:49,720
discussion so with that I want to move

00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:52,030
to the questions that I see in the

00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:58,630
questions and the first one I want to

00:43:52,030 --> 00:44:00,790
ask is from @foo bits and can you share

00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:02,800
with us how much funding time and

00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:05,980
personnel it took to build the app and

00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:10,720
the ecosystem yeah that's a great

00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:13,180
question um it's hard to say because if

00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:15,030
we built that I don't know what what the

00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:17,770
amount would be if we built just the app

00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:20,619
because in a way we couldn't have ever

00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:22,930
built just the app because it I oh I

00:44:20,619 --> 00:44:25,869
think we would have built a pretty you

00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:27,609
know like not very useful app if we had

00:44:25,869 --> 00:44:31,690
just built it I'm separate from the work

00:44:27,609 --> 00:44:34,180
we're doing with our partners um I will

00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:39,359
say it's been it's we started building

00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:39,359
the early prototypes of Mateo in

00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:47,710
2014-2015 so it's been you know five or

00:44:42,849 --> 00:44:49,329
six years we've had we've building off I

00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:52,300
should have mentioned this earlier um

00:44:49,329 --> 00:44:55,000
again it's been a hard day for me and

00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:57,099
something nothing my most coherent self

00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,599
which hopefully just gives permission to

00:44:57,099 --> 00:45:02,170
all of us and not always be our most

00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:03,670
coherent selves we have been we've built

00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:05,829
up a lot of open source tools that we've

00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:08,260
been building off of like that project

00:45:05,829 --> 00:45:11,260
which is running a lot of the kind of

00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:15,099
the running the core scripts underneath

00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:16,900
and which Mateo is is built as a

00:45:15,099 --> 00:45:22,329
distributed app with them peer-to-peer

00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:23,920
sharing so we have had two to three

00:45:22,329 --> 00:45:28,089
people working on the the core

00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:31,839
technology for the past three years I I

00:45:28,089 --> 00:45:33,910
guess I'd say probably if we're thinking

00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:36,220
just about the technology up until now

00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:40,750
it's probably around half million

00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:42,310
dollars to build but it wasn't just like

00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:44,220
Matt Bayeux Mobile and Matt Bayeux

00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:47,910
desktop that we've built

00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:49,680
that it's also our our technology team

00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:52,740
also does a lot of kind of customization

00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:55,710
of different tools for our partners so

00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:58,619
yeah I'd say five or six years half a

00:45:55,710 --> 00:46:01,619
million dollars um two to three people

00:45:58,619 --> 00:46:04,800
over but like depending on the time

00:46:01,619 --> 00:46:06,270
period over that time but it's actually

00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,640
been so much more than that like we have

00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:10,619
a whole program team that you know art

00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,970
are kind of constantly in contact with

00:46:10,619 --> 00:46:13,170
our partners and doing the trainings and

00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:15,869
workshops that have been formed a

00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:18,200
process but the core the core technology

00:46:15,869 --> 00:46:22,830
that's that's my best guess answer

00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:26,930
figure answer another question from the

00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:30,030
the the chat

00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:34,770
how is co-creation work being affected

00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:36,290
by the pandemic yeah um well first I'll

00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:39,210
just say indigenous people are being

00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:43,770
deeply affected by the pandemic and if

00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:46,980
you have if you have extra capacity to

00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:49,500
give I'll also post a couple links to

00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:52,260
some some fundraisers that they're going

00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:54,180
on and it people are being deeply

00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:57,060
affected and all travel of course has

00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:59,520
halted internationally but even within

00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:01,650
countries so early on a lot of our

00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:03,599
partners had to make a decision whether

00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:04,740
they were gonna go you know back into

00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:06,390
their territories if they have

00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:08,460
territories where you know that they

00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:10,170
have control over many people have

00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:13,500
retreated into their territories and for

00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:16,950
those who still have you know food

00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:18,810
sovereignty and like clean water they're

00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:21,630
doing okay and they're able to just kind

00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:23,880
of shut away for a while for communities

00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:28,830
that have been affected by oil drilling

00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:30,690
and by logging and mining they are often

00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:33,750
dependent on outsider you know outside

00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:36,030
access for clean water for food for

00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:37,830
everything and so we're seeing

00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:40,080
coronavirus hitting a lot of those

00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:42,330
communities and even our partners that

00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:45,800
are based in country like in Peru and

00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:48,720
Ecuador are able to travel right now so

00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:50,700
we are certainly a lot of our things are

00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:52,200
on hold we I want to my colleagues was

00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:53,910
supposed to be in Peru right now doing a

00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,359
two-week workshop um that has been put

00:47:53,910 --> 00:47:56,940
on hold

00:47:54,359 --> 00:47:58,380
however many of our partners that are

00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:01,080
dealing with the most

00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:03,750
Red's like the mining and logging they

00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:05,520
are based in like border communities

00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:06,960
where they have internet access so we've

00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:09,030
been able to stay in communication with

00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:11,310
them and we're doing some adjustments

00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:13,590
like map a Oh allows for exporting data

00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:15,900
through like whatsapp or other you know

00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:17,850
apps on your phone and so some of the

00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:19,140
people who are kind of separated by each

00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:22,070
other physically are still able to

00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:26,040
communicate if they have minimal access

00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:28,770
over you know over over basic cell phone

00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:31,800
connections so our to-do list is

00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:33,540
actually so long that we even if we have

00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:35,400
no contact with our partners you know

00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:37,260
they've already given us enough things

00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:40,020
to do that we would probably keep busy

00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:41,580
for the next half a year um so we're

00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:43,290
just kind of playing it by ear and we're

00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:46,440
doing we're doing some more webinars now

00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:48,060
for for kind of intermediary partners to

00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:51,060
get them trained up in Matt Bayeux so

00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:52,770
that once you know once travel

00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:54,480
domestically is able to happen again

00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:57,120
that they can go and do more trainings

00:48:54,480 --> 00:49:05,070
in in remote areas that currently you

00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:07,860
can't visit so I will put in the chat it

00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:10,770
looks like people are really engaging

00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:15,000
with the concept and putting links in

00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:17,190
and from another question from the chat

00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:20,720
and I think it was to the general tribe

00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:24,570
but I think it's fair to you as well is

00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:28,250
he recommends some readings on the topic

00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:34,080
data solidarity sovereignty but on this

00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:36,300
collective societal level yeah um I will

00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:38,220
send some we're actually producing some

00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:40,440
right now we've been doing a Q&A series

00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:41,730
with some practitioners and there's

00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:43,500
there's a couple things we'll be putting

00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:47,070
out really soon with some amazing

00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:50,670
insights from like a woman who had just

00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:53,250
interviewed recently named Peru Chung

00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:57,390
who's based in Southeast Asia and doing

00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:59,490
a lot of indigenous data sovereignty

00:49:57,390 --> 00:50:04,020
with with indigenous groups across

00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:05,790
Southeast Asia I think that yeah I'll

00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:09,600
put some links and then yeah we'll be

00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:11,770
doing more Rudo mentioned this and his

00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:14,050
talk and the concept of

00:50:11,770 --> 00:50:17,859
of indigenous data sovereignty I think

00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:19,210
is really critical so and and I'm we're

00:50:17,859 --> 00:50:20,950
still trying to figure out kind of how

00:50:19,210 --> 00:50:22,450
that applies to individuals or you know

00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:25,180
non indigenous groups and that's gonna

00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:27,460
where our framing around data solidarity

00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:30,880
has come up because while an indigenous

00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:33,160
nation should of course be able to have

00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,570
sovereignty over their own data you know

00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:36,250
how that applies to maybe more of a

00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:38,260
community group or you know different

00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:41,470
groups who don't have as strong of a you

00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:42,940
know national identity I think is really

00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:44,740
interesting topic so I'll include some

00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:47,500
links like that one thing to note that

00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:49,540
comes to mind for example somebody

00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:51,609
mentioned they think in brudos talk that

00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:55,150
Rita was talking about you know the good

00:50:51,609 --> 00:50:58,540
Amazon amazon.com actually has been

00:50:55,150 --> 00:51:03,070
engaged in a multi-year fight to take

00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:04,900
the domain dot Amazon and to have that

00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:07,330
and be a you know be there's and I

00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:09,700
believe it's been in a long process with

00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:12,010
the different international governing

00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:14,770
bodies but for me that's a great example

00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:17,200
of like data colonialism or you know

00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:19,240
just tech colonialism to to have the

00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,890
arrogance to say you know there's a

00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:22,690
whole there's a whole region of the

00:51:20,890 --> 00:51:26,080
world with multiple countries spanning

00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:29,530
it that spans the air Amazon and the

00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:33,010
week and instead have that domain that

00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:34,990
domain name so that's that's something

00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:37,119
that the Peruvian and Brazilian

00:51:34,990 --> 00:51:38,800
governments were fighting but I believe

00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:40,330
that the latest news is that they lost

00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,920
that fight so also send a link to that

00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:43,240
because I think it's thing that most

00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:48,970
people don't know about and that is a

00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:50,290
great example of just how many ways I

00:51:48,970 --> 00:51:52,359
think corporate technology has just

00:51:50,290 --> 00:51:57,330
colonized even you know even our digital

00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:57,330
spaces thank you

00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:04,210
a new question from the chat as

00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:06,400
technology advances exponentially every

00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:07,780
day where do you see the future of data

00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:10,330
solidarity and protecting our

00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:17,369
marginalized communities in five and

00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:19,800
fifteen years I think we're going to see

00:52:17,369 --> 00:52:21,600
and of course

00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:23,310
this is a totally biased answer because

00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:25,260
this is what we're working on but I

00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:28,560
believe we're gonna see more and more

00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:30,690
offline first initiatives because as we

00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:33,090
recognize you know during natural

00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:36,540
disasters what happens well the internet

00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:39,450
often goes out you know during during

00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:40,830
crises you know like what's happening

00:52:39,450 --> 00:52:42,570
right now with coronavirus there's

00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:44,460
information that communities need to

00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:47,010
share and they often need to share you

00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:49,110
know in ways that are protecting private

00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:51,570
information and they need to share it

00:52:49,110 --> 00:52:53,940
quickly and so if we build tools that

00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:55,650
allow for decentralization and allow for

00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:57,780
information to be shared amongst trusted

00:52:55,650 --> 00:53:00,110
pods and networks then we're building

00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:03,150
tools that can that can meet those needs

00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:07,050
so I hope I hope that we see more of a

00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:10,170
reclaiming of the Internet and of you

00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:12,300
know spaces for sharing from from the

00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:14,130
kind of centralized while Gardens that

00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:15,780
we currently have online into more

00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:18,930
decentralized spaces that are run by

00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:20,430
different communities and I I hope that

00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:22,590
you know part of what's been challenging

00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:25,080
about building Maffeo is that we're

00:53:22,590 --> 00:53:26,850
still kind of doing a lot of somewhat

00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:29,910
cutting-edge things in terms of a

00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:31,800
peer-to-peer database and decentralized

00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:34,200
sharing and so on and but I think as

00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:35,700
more people work on on that and

00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:38,610
recognize the importance I mean it's you

00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:40,530
know we're seeing in an academia

00:53:38,610 --> 00:53:43,050
like you know amazing work of people

00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:46,440
trying to to share share information

00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:48,830
that is decentralized so that's one of

00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:51,360
the things I hope we see I also think

00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:53,160
again this is optimistic side I really

00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:56,010
hope we'll see more and more tools being

00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:58,710
built by the communities that are using

00:53:56,010 --> 00:54:02,010
them so we'll see less of the innovation

00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:03,450
coming from from Silicon Valley or will

00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:05,310
recognize more of the innovation that's

00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:08,370
not just coming from Silicon Valley you

00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:10,380
know I'm thinking about rhizomatic based

00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:13,770
in Oaxaca where they've been building

00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:15,420
their own cellphone networks you know

00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:18,870
there's just there's a lot of examples

00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:21,000
around the world of people creating

00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:24,630
technology you know for themselves and

00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:29,850
and I hope we'll see more of that next

00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:35,550
10 to 15 years thank you

00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:37,650
um just looking through the shafts any

00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:39,540
questions it looks like they slow down a

00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:44,040
little bit but it seems to be a really

00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:46,610
active discussion based on your your

00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:47,910
thoughts your presentation in comments I

00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:50,490
appreciate that

00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:55,290
we have a couple minutes left for

00:54:50,490 --> 00:55:11,460
questions if anyone wants to get submit

00:54:55,290 --> 00:55:13,140
a question so seeing anything I had I

00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:16,200
had a question earlier and I think you

00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:22,160
started to argue you spoke about it a

00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:24,140
little bit about own how the

00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:29,580
technologies and these methodologies

00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:38,310
might be deployed and places that have

00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:42,390
less recognized less recognized cohesive

00:55:38,310 --> 00:55:47,040
communities and I'm thinking know a lot

00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:48,630
about like communities that have been

00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:50,430
established over the last hundred 200

00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:53,690
years 300 years are now being

00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:56,790
distributed through external forces

00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:59,580
people been thinking about how to apply

00:55:56,790 --> 00:56:00,990
either these methodologies or even the

00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:04,620
tool that you've developed in these

00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:10,260
communities yeah I mean that's a great

00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:12,390
question so we we pretty much only work

00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:14,040
with people who kind of come to us so

00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:16,920
we're not actively like out kind of

00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:20,400
evangelizing necessarily or trying to

00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:21,690
get people to adapt our tool um because

00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,660
we're just kind of interested in that

00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:26,070
but that being said and we are having

00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:27,660
lots of different groups come to us for

00:56:26,070 --> 00:56:28,680
different reasons or people see you know

00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:29,580
learning about math Bayeux in some way

00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,990
like you know maybe through this

00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:32,280
presentation and they're like oh you

00:56:30,990 --> 00:56:37,290
know that's interesting maybe we could

00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:39,180
apply it to this so I do think I mean we

00:56:37,290 --> 00:56:41,880
knew from the get-go that we had to

00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:44,340
design it to be offline and local first

00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:46,680
for our partners see

00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:49,920
but our hunch has always been that it

00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:51,510
because it it allows for communities to

00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:54,240
control the information themselves and

00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:56,190
then choose how and when and have the

00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:58,099
power to share that outward that it will

00:56:56,190 --> 00:57:00,780
be useful to other groups and so I think

00:56:58,099 --> 00:57:02,160
I think we will see more and more of

00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:04,200
that mirror our hope is just to make

00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:05,460
make it available and to hopefully be

00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:07,859
able to make whatever changes

00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:10,230
communities might request so for example

00:57:07,859 --> 00:57:12,990
a lot of our current partners are very

00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:14,790
cohesive and so they're able right now

00:57:12,990 --> 00:57:16,800
the peer-to-peer database is like

00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:18,300
automatically share everything within a

00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:20,640
network of trust and then you choose

00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:23,400
what you're going to export out but for

00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:26,160
other communities they may need to you

00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:28,560
know they don't have that full trust yet

00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:29,820
and so because of colonization and

00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:31,980
because all these different forces that

00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:33,240
you know the impact Community Trust they

00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:35,070
may need to have different sharing

00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:36,599
settings just with an app not just for

00:57:35,070 --> 00:57:38,310
export so that's the thing we're working

00:57:36,599 --> 00:57:45,210
on currently like they're kind of levels

00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:47,310
of kind of trust within the app so yeah

00:57:45,210 --> 00:57:48,960
right now I mean like I said we've had

00:57:47,310 --> 00:57:50,880
we've had some different groups coming

00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:52,770
to us and and I think we will see more

00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:54,330
who are adapting it to not just

00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:55,950
environmental data but it could be

00:57:54,330 --> 00:57:58,140
people at some of the some groups are

00:57:55,950 --> 00:58:00,270
adapting it to you know coronavirus or

00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:01,260
they did information right now and to

00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:05,640
could be a whole host of different

00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:11,359
issues thank you

00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:14,160
I think we are officially at time so

00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:16,349
with that I wanted to say thank you

00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:19,500
thank you again for your presentation

00:58:16,349 --> 00:58:21,570
and for answering all the questions and

00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:23,970
the conference issues that you started

00:58:21,570 --> 00:58:25,530
thanks so much John and thank you

00:58:23,970 --> 00:58:28,750
everybody for your kind words and the

00:58:25,530 --> 00:58:30,349
chat is really sweet way to get feedback

00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:33,720
[Laughter]

00:58:30,349 --> 00:58:35,670
so folks who had questions that we

00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:42,410
didn't get to of course we'll move them

00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:48,170
over to the slack Q&A CSV Q&A and then

00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:51,830
with that I think I'll if I could just

00:58:48,170 --> 00:58:55,050
do a little bit of housecleaning and

00:58:51,830 --> 00:58:57,620
housekeeping that's the phrase okay I'll

00:58:55,050 --> 00:59:05,220
sign off thank you all right thank you

00:58:57,620 --> 00:59:11,040
and say that coming up now is llama

00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:15,090
brunch lunch lunch and there are going

00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:20,370
to be there are zoom rooms that have

00:59:15,090 --> 00:59:23,010
been posted in the SWAC sort of bird of

00:59:20,370 --> 00:59:29,090
a feather style so folks can follow up

00:59:23,010 --> 00:59:31,560
with those they're interested and I

00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:35,490
thank you everyone who attended and I

00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:39,660
will sign off but I remember the llama

00:59:35,490 --> 00:59:43,010
brunch is that at the half hour and you

00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:43,010
