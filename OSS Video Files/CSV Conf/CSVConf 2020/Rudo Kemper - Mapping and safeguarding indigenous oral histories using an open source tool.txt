Title: Rudo Kemper - Mapping and safeguarding indigenous oral histories using an open source tool
Publication date: 2020-05-28
Playlist: CSVConf 2020
Description: 
	For many indigenous and other local communities in the rainforests of South America, survival in the rainforest has always depended on an intimate knowledge of their territory, passed down by their ancestors. Place-based stories help determine where food or resources are located, or where dangers lie hidden. Most importantly, the oral histories reinforce their historical and cultural connection to their homelands, which in turn informs their collective identity. However, in the contemporary context, oral history storytelling traditions are at risk of disappearing as younger community members leave their villages recurrently or permanently, in search of work. To prevent invaluable oral histories from disappearing into oblivion, we developed a methodology and built a FOSS application to help communities map their oral histories. Terrastories was born in 2018 after realizing the need for an offline-first geostorytelling tool that can work in very remote conditions such as the Amazon rainforest, and give communities the power to manage their own traditional knowledge and storytelling data. I will share how the project was born and why indigenous peoples needed this tool, how Terrastories works, and discuss some tough questions around data sovereignty, protection of sensitive data, and archiving traditional knowledge.

all right good afternoon everybody it's

00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,839
great to be here my name is Rudo today

00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,650
I'm very excited to be sharing with you

00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:12,480
about a whole different type of data

00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:14,370
namely indigenous oral histories about

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,230
their lands and how we are working with

00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,240
this data in a super remote context in

00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,980
the middle of the Amazon so what I'm

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,900
gonna be doing today is to basically

00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,910
have two parts of the presentation so

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,980
the first part is gonna focus on the

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,080
kind of local community context where

00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,330
this project was born and then secondly

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,859
I'll talk a little bit about the an open

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,649
source application called terror stories

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:36,570
that we are developing how it works and

00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:39,840
why we are building it the way that we

00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,340
are building it so just a little bit

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,719
about me so I'm a geographer with an

00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,360
organization called the Amazon

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,399
conservation team it's an NGO that

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,410
partners with indigenous people in South

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,300
America to protect their force and

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,280
strengthen their culture I'm originally

00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,530
from Google sow and live in DC and my

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,870
heart beats for South America it's my

00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,399
first time attending CSV conf I'm really

00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,500
loving it I've been seeing a lot of

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,510
synergies between the work that we've

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,100
been doing I've been in the open source

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,200
space for about two years now working on

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,850
territories and I'm just like really

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,670
learning a lot from the conversations

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:14,760
about communities of practice about data

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,140
about gets so lots of contents and I

00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,930
really look forward to sharing with you

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,490
and hoping to also learn from you a lot

00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,710
about how we can improve our workflow

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:26,159
based off of your experiences and

00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:27,720
knowledge --is so let's see you have a

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,030
CT were active in Colombia Suriname in

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:34,259
Brazil and you can follow me on Twitter

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:37,320
so I'd like to begin with this really

00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:39,840
kind of Awesome beautiful hand-drawn map

00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,640
that was made in the 90s by the guy

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,360
who's holding it his name is Bhutto what

00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,399
she knew this was made before any kind

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,130
of GIS or you know modern GPS software

00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,390
became available and so the map is of

00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,520
Southwest Suriname which is in the

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,680
northeast of South America there and

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,329
it's representing a watershed region

00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,549
where the where his people that are

00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:03,329
gonna live it's about 3 million hectares

00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:05,369
in size and muta weighed him up because

00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:06,990
his chieftain at the time requested it

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:09,119
because there were a lot more outsiders

00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,250
coming into his territory and so they

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,200
needed tools to kind of express what

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,920
their territory looks like from their

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,990
worldview

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,200
as well as the extent of their territory

00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:21,330
so the way we did this was basically by

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,490
sitting down with the elders in his

00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,080
community and asking him where the

00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:28,170
sacred sites where the places they go

00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:30,840
hunting medicinal plants historical

00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:32,970
sites battle sites and then through his

00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,910
own memory navigating the rivers

00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:37,770
throughout his lifetime he drew this map

00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:39,540
which is just kind of amazing I can

00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:41,130
stare at this map for hours just

00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:45,630
imagining what's us sort of navigating

00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:47,360
the rivers in his mind so basically the

00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:49,440
government started to come in and

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,900
Surinam at the time it still doesn't

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,640
have land rights and so this was a tool

00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,410
that the communities were using to

00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,030
hopefully petition for land rights and

00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,519
that was the reason for the creation of

00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:01,769
this map decades later Utah would also

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,690
say that the reason he made this map was

00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:05,340
to capture and safeguard the knowledge

00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:09,180
of the elders so that he could be able

00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:10,560
to pass it along to his children so one

00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,959
of the first things that a CT did as an

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,510
organization was to georeference these

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,600
maps and kind of overlaid him with the

00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:20,310
National topography maps so as to better

00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,290
provide them with a powerful tool that

00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,459
they could use for that petitioning of

00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:25,590
rights

00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:28,079
this started in surinam and eventually

00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:31,410
we also helped that I know who live

00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:33,630
across the border in Brazil make maps of

00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:35,549
their lands so that's the entire

00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,780
community regardless of which side of

00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,700
the border they live on which is of

00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,780
course a colonial fiction that that I

00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,180
know had been living there for centuries

00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,620
before the borders were drawn I would be

00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:47,519
able to have maps of their land for

00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:49,380
similar purposes the maps are really

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,970
fascinating I actually spend a lot of my

00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,980
time in lockdown at night sort of

00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:55,980
staring at the details and I've blurted

00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:57,299
here because it's community data and

00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,790
there might be some sensitive cultural

00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:01,410
information that the community would not

00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:03,630
want to share but they're really

00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:06,390
fascinating maps was a ton of detail and

00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:09,209
sort of richness of cultural information

00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:10,560
that appears on them but the way that

00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:13,140
these maps were produced at the time and

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,400
this is a map from 2001 you wouldn't be

00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,280
able to really get much of that

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,789
information just looking at it and so

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,150
just right here on this screen there is

00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:25,140
the depiction of a Granite Mountain

00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:26,940
which you can see here with the Google

00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,690
Earth kind of satellite imagery view

00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,520
there in 3d

00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:31,500
and this granite mountain is called sama

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,320
waka and for the Torino it's one of the

00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,820
most important sacred sites they have a

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,650
ton of oral histories going back

00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,890
hundreds of years about how their

00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:42,270
community came together here as a people

00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:44,490
decided to basically form the community

00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:46,200
that they are now and sort of started to

00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:48,270
settle the region's stopped fighting and

00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,400
a lot of other sort of sacred oral

00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:52,740
histories about this place on the map

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,870
it's just a point but there's so much

00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,880
more richness of sort of oral history

00:04:54,870 --> 00:05:00,360
information about this place which is

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,070
not depicted on a paper map so you know

00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,450
this is 2001 I think at the time the

00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:06,330
Toronto mappers who worked on there's an

00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:09,290
AC t2 team kind of realized this and so

00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:11,250
they published a book about this place

00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:13,260
because that would be a way of depicting

00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:15,180
that oral history knowledge and in the

00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:16,740
preface they have this to say why the

00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,420
emphasis on history and land use mapping

00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,670
history is a part of the people's

00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:22,140
identity and among indigenous peoples it

00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,760
is strongly linked to life in a certain

00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:25,470
territory that's why this publication

00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:28,830
focuses so strongly on tracing the

00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:30,090
ancient history of the trio or Torino so

00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:32,070
there was already an awareness of the

00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:37,320
importance of history as it pertains to

00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:39,180
indigenous mapping and so we weren't the

00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,169
only one so our AC T wasn't and people

00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,640
that we were working with weren't the

00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:43,470
only ones to come across this need

00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,030
there's this really beautiful video that

00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:46,800
I recommend to everybody called counter

00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:48,570
mapping which is about the Zuni

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,030
community in the southwest of the United

00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:53,730
States New Mexico Arizona area there and

00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:55,710
sort of their mapping of their lands

00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:57,720
process where there's these really

00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:59,130
beautiful reflections about how much so

00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,290
much story would come out of this map

00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:02,610
making process you know its initially

00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:04,530
thinking that they were making maps just

00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:05,790
to sort of challenge the notion of Maps

00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,860
maybe North doesn't have to be all the

00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:09,030
way at the top but then the storytelling

00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,560
came out of it what are more important

00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:12,090
are the stories the history described in

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,680
his vignettes of experience when people

00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:15,660
have the map that is part of affirming

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,600
their identity it tells them they're of

00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:22,320
this place very very similar to what we

00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,520
discovered in South America and so I'd

00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:26,669
like to tell you a little bit about my

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,850
own work with the Matawai Maroons in

00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:30,570
Suriname this is a community of

00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:33,210
descendants of formerly enslaved

00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:35,370
Africans who over 300 years ago

00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:37,710
essentially fled from the plantations

00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:40,200
into the rainforests fought for their

00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:41,100
right to exist there and still reside

00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,420
there today

00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,220
so this is a picture that was taken in

00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,780
the 70s there

00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,460
it's a their communities that have a

00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,980
very strong traditional culture they

00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:52,020
have their own language and an extremely

00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:53,850
rich oral history storytelling tradition

00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,950
that goes back to the first times that

00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:56,910
their that their ancestors first arrived

00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:59,090
in his territory

00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:01,410
so really fascinating kinds of stories

00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:03,060
history begins their entire worldview

00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:05,510
actually really revolves around that

00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:07,560
initial moment that their ancestors

00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:09,060
successfully fled and for the front of

00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:14,040
plantations and fought for their right

00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:16,050
to exist there so in 2015 a CT was

00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:18,690
invited by the Matawai to do some

00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:20,520
mapping because essentially there was a

00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:22,070
lot of land-use changes taking place in

00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,210
their territory and they wanted to know

00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:26,640
what the territory looks like and have

00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:28,680
tools for that so a CT came in to do

00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,510
trainings to train the community to make

00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,610
maps of their own territory because it's

00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:34,860
always done in a participatory way and

00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:37,140
so essentially the very same process

00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,520
that we did working with a I don't know

00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:41,070
20 years ago just with newer

00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:43,440
technologies GPS handhelds but also

00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:45,140
sketch mapping and I still remember one

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,860
of the very first workshops that we did

00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,810
where we started to do this

00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,400
participatory mapping the first thing

00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,390
that the motto I wanted to do was to sit

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,660
down with the elders

00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:56,910
just like the Torino and sort of ask

00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,920
them about where are the place names the

00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:01,110
sacred sites the historical places the

00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:03,000
former villages because that's important

00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:05,750
to their world view of their land and so

00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,430
that was the first thing that we did

00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:10,020
later on we also went on expeditions

00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:11,880
with elders so at the top left there

00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:14,420
that's me sitting on a boat with an

00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:16,950
elder Mata wine neat William Anita and

00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:18,180
so we did I was fortunate to be part of

00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:20,070
two different expeditions where

00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,480
basically crossing hundreds of

00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:24,390
kilometers of land and mouth wide

00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:26,130
territory where with younger Matawai as

00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,960
well where the elders are pointing out

00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:29,970
the different places and then the

00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,430
younger matawaia are recording those on

00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:34,650
GPS and it's just this amazing

00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:37,169
experience where you see just like walls

00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:39,479
of forests to you anyway through to me

00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:42,419
which to them is this incredible storied

00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:44,730
landscape right and so we mapped over

00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:47,580
700 different places in that during

00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:49,830
those expeditions and you really immerse

00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,630
yourself in the history as you're doing

00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:53,400
this and you realize that it's such a

00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,650
big part of their perception of their

00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,390
lands as

00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:59,370
kind of similarly in the bottom right

00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:02,160
there this is a woman named Dorothy link

00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:03,810
we had the experience once where some of

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,090
us would seem young Matawai sat down

00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:07,890
with her to ask her about some places in

00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:09,930
the lands and there was one place that

00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:12,720
we mentioned that just really brought

00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:15,420
her back into this really long beautiful

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,190
story where you know she picked up

00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:19,920
objects around her to illustrate for

00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:21,300
example a boat on the river in terms of

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,910
what was happening in the story and

00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,950
started to break into song just really a

00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:27,900
beautiful experience where you realized

00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:29,400
that this oral tradition is such a big

00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,900
part of the way that these communities

00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:34,140
view their land and such a big part of

00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:37,590
their identity as well so what we

00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:39,330
started to do in 2017 was to work with

00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:41,730
the younger Matawai in the community

00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:43,920
like you see in the pictures here to

00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:45,510
interview the elders and to record them

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,670
talking about the stories because we

00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:49,740
realized you know that many of the

00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:51,690
elders are in of an older age of course

00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:53,250
and they are the ones had no the

00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:54,750
knowledge the best have no the stories

00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,580
the best and so we wanted to preserve

00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:58,650
that and the community really had a

00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:00,390
desire for this so that the younger

00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:02,670
Matawai who are now in the more modern

00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:04,830
age right would still have the ability

00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:08,550
to know who they are and where they come

00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:10,080
from so for about two years we we spent

00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:11,610
time interviewing the elders with the

00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,750
younger community members in partnership

00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:15,630
with a local community-based

00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:17,640
organization and in a nutshell this is

00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:19,770
what the results of that project where

00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,380
we interviewed 35 elders this is a

00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:24,210
community of only a thousand people

00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:26,550
producing 17 hours of footage over 300

00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:29,839
oral histories recorded for 150 places

00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:32,280
and then we made some maps of course

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,960
initially just paper maps but we ran

00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:36,360
into very similar limitations as what I

00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:38,460
told you earlier that you can only put

00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,680
so much content on a physical map here

00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:42,720
we try to kind of Nat Geo style put

00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,640
stories along different places in order

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,740
to give a sense of the meaning and the

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,750
significance and the value of the place

00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,520
names but not only do you have a

00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:52,860
limitation of space but also you're

00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:55,470
losing the storyteller right and you're

00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:57,690
losing the the way that the stories are

00:10:55,470 --> 00:11:00,930
conveyed in a sort of part in a

00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:03,000
biological fashion and so this we knew

00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:06,040
that this was not enough in order to

00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,079
really depict what we had captured

00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,850
so we started to think about what else

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,709
is out there right in terms of

00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:14,500
technologies that are more digital

00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:16,990
interactive and so some of you might be

00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,459
familiar with the ESRI story map format

00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:20,350
which is what you're looking at here and

00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:21,940
this is actually a story that we put

00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:23,470
together about one of the first that I

00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,600
know cartographers who worked on this

00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:26,889
first maps that I showed you earlier

00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,360
sort of telling stories about his life

00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:30,130
he has this really incredible story

00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,410
about how he was born in Guyana moved to

00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:33,269
Brazil and so he's traveled all across

00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:36,160
the Amazon

00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:38,110
but this format is more for using maps

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,670
to tell stories not really to map

00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:41,649
stories if you know if you can see what

00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:43,690
I mean and the other big sort of

00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:45,970
limitation here is its online it's

00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:47,980
dependent on an ArcGIS online template

00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:49,569
so king who lives in a village called

00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:51,550
Carmel Isamu to where the internet

00:11:49,569 --> 00:11:54,430
access it actually is there is internet

00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:56,319
but it's expensive would not be able to

00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:58,060
show this to his family which is a huge

00:11:56,319 --> 00:12:00,790
limitation of this format for us because

00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:02,310
we did this work for the community so

00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:04,620
that they would have access to their

00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:08,620
oral histories that would be able to

00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:10,360
review those in the village itself so we

00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:12,639
started to kind of think a little bit

00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:16,240
and brainstorm about what kind of tool

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:17,889
we could we need to basically connect

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,930
the maps with the stories and this is

00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:22,240
sort of what we came up with so there's

00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:24,279
a need for customized base maps because

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,529
if you go on Google Earth or if you go

00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:28,569
on even Open Street Map you don't really

00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:30,220
see the life world of the communities

00:12:28,569 --> 00:12:31,660
right and in some cases the communities

00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:33,819
don't want to share that because it's

00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:35,430
their knowledge and it's protected in

00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:37,630
that regard and they want to restrict it

00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:40,600
so there's a need for customized base

00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:43,000
maps an easy elegant user interface not

00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:45,040
a GIS software you know not something

00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,490
that's very complicated for community

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,720
members to use I'll talk about this a

00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:52,569
little bit more later as well but a

00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,370
restricted contents the ability to set

00:12:52,569 --> 00:12:55,990
limitations on who gets to see what

00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:57,930
story because we're talking about

00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:00,579
restricted knowledge and data here

00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:01,540
ability to stream audio-visual content

00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:02,829
that speaks for itself

00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:05,290
you know we've got videos and audio of

00:13:02,829 --> 00:13:06,819
course so needs to do that free and open

00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:09,149
source really important for us because

00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:11,230
we didn't want to there be a software

00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:13,509
licensing limitation which is another

00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:15,310
issue that comes up with s3 and then

00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:16,870
offline an online compatible that needs

00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:19,480
to work entirely offline and entirely

00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:20,200
online and so we surveyed the landscape

00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,910
and there wasn't really

00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:25,060
anything out there that accomplishes all

00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:26,350
of that so we decided to build a article

00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,310
which is called terror stories which I'm

00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:31,540
going to tell you a little bit more

00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:32,770
about now so first from a conceptual and

00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,900
I guess kind of technical point of view

00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:37,300
why did we decide to build in what went

00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:38,590
into thinking about that I'm gonna move

00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,930
to the writings and then to the left

00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:42,730
here first is this notion of offline

00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:44,800
first design and we're we were really

00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:46,270
inspired by a digital democracy of

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,220
course Emily is giving a keynote later

00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:51,010
of my friend Emily which I definitely

00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:53,440
recommend you to check out the software

00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:55,150
should at the very first interface be

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,070
designed to be able to work offline and

00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:59,560
only then can you start thinking about

00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:02,890
online that's a really important design

00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:04,420
principle for us data sovereignty is

00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:07,870
really important for indigenous people

00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:09,370
just in terms of just many experiences

00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:11,800
that indigenous people have had where

00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:14,140
researchers come in or NGOs and they

00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,340
collect data and then they leave and

00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:18,010
then it the communities don't have

00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:22,390
access to that data or it's in a format

00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:24,280
that's they can't use it's not a CSV

00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:26,230
it's a shapefile or it's something else

00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,240
right where it's complicated to work

00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:29,680
with another important point about this

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,600
is for example when you think about the

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,640
cloud and data being existing in the

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,070
cloud for some indigenous community such

00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,930
a very uncomfortable notion because that

00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:39,850
means that it's physically left the

00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:42,250
territory and it's existing somewhere

00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:44,800
else and for some communities they

00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:47,350
prefer their data and their knowledge to

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:50,680
be physically in the territory so with

00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:52,630
offline you kind of get at that mapping

00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,370
and storytelling bide for communities so

00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:56,980
this is primarily a product for the

00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:58,930
communities for their own usage so they

00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,520
can choose to share stories with the

00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:02,550
outside world that they want to but it's

00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:04,240
primarily for their own usage to

00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:06,610
transfer the knowledge to the younger

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,470
generations and then there's a few

00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:10,600
points here suffer it created directly

00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:12,700
for indigenous communities not adapting

00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,800
something like we've had experiences

00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:16,240
with open data kids where it can kind of

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,800
work for data collection but it's not

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,570
built for the communities and so there's

00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:22,150
still that kind of user interface

00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:23,860
struggle I mentioned decolonizing Maps

00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:25,510
already are referred to it really

00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:27,220
important to have the communities own

00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:29,560
Maps and not have colonial place names

00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,730
where their territory is and the reason

00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,380
again why it's open source is because

00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,820
it's not only an amazonian issue we kept

00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,089
hearing about similar needs elsewhere in

00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,059
cat

00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:39,009
New Zealand and so on and so forth and

00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:40,509
this principle of when an elder dies the

00:15:39,009 --> 00:15:43,110
library is burned down which is a

00:15:40,509 --> 00:15:45,550
tribute to a Molly and ethnologist

00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:47,559
to put the the guy that I was on the

00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:49,809
boat with William and NEPA passed away

00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:51,370
last year and so it's something that we

00:15:49,809 --> 00:15:54,639
take very seriously that time is of the

00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:56,740
essence and software is needed to help

00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,559
communities retain their oral histories

00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:00,639
and their ancestral knowledge so telling

00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:02,439
you a little bit more about the app now

00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,360
there's basically three ingredients that

00:16:02,439 --> 00:16:06,490
you need in order for it to work you

00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,870
need a map or actually you don't need a

00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:09,189
map if you want to use just Open Street

00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:10,720
Map and work it online but if you're

00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:12,100
working offline you do need to create

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,139
your own map which can be designed in

00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:16,779
matte box studio which has a pretty

00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:18,519
user-friendly interface as far as that

00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:21,370
goes you don't need to do any coding or

00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:23,529
anything like that you need audio-visual

00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:25,149
content so obviously the recordings and

00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:27,309
then you need to download terror stories

00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:28,899
and then with that you can spin up your

00:16:27,309 --> 00:16:30,490
own instance with the application and

00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:33,399
feed in your own graphics for example

00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:34,660
logos and background and I'm going to

00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:36,009
give you a quick tour of it and if

00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,649
anybody's interested I can give a more

00:16:36,009 --> 00:16:41,290
detailed tour later we have screen share

00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:43,449
so the application is entirely

00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:45,189
translatable into the native language

00:16:43,449 --> 00:16:47,259
it's just a docx file that you edit

00:16:45,189 --> 00:16:48,639
basically add to the app that's really

00:16:47,259 --> 00:16:50,259
important because many apps that we've

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,569
encountered you can translate part of it

00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:54,699
but the main user interface will still

00:16:52,569 --> 00:16:56,529
be in whatever your system languages

00:16:54,699 --> 00:16:58,569
write Spanish Portuguese English Dutch

00:16:56,529 --> 00:17:00,459
whatever so we wanted to translate the

00:16:58,569 --> 00:17:02,379
entire app so that you can see here that

00:17:00,459 --> 00:17:04,919
is a very bottom there it's now set to

00:17:02,379 --> 00:17:08,110
Matawai but you can switch it to English

00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:10,209
the way that the application works is

00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:11,409
essentially it's a map right and here

00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:14,049
you're seeing that same map that I

00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:16,360
showed earlier of the Matawai where it's

00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:18,579
it's their data entirely and this works

00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:20,740
entirely offline what's nice about map

00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,789
box too is you can set it to 3d which is

00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,909
really nice with indigenous communities

00:17:21,789 --> 00:17:26,500
because what's frequently maps are kind

00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:28,600
of this abstract idea you know this

00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,309
God's eye point of view that doesn't

00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,260
make a lot of sense and so to at least

00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:34,690
have some 3d in there is nice to get a

00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,890
sense of the landscape and then of

00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:37,419
course you have the stories on the left

00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:39,070
hand side so the way that this works is

00:17:37,419 --> 00:17:41,200
you can either click on points on the

00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:42,940
map and then you add filters the stories

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,760
that are associated with that place or

00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:46,940
on the top left there you can use the

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,370
filters to

00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:51,170
filtered by type of place a type of

00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:52,610
sacred site and this is all taxonomies

00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,950
that you can that the communities can

00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:57,050
input themselves or by speaker for

00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:58,640
example so that you only see the stories

00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:00,950
that are associated with that speaker or

00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,480
place and then it also filters the map

00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:05,440
so you only see those places that are

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,670
associated with those stories so that's

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:12,470
just time check we have about one more

00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:13,700
minute oh okay sweet yes so just to show

00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:15,890
you a little bit more about it I

00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:18,050
mentioned restricted knowledge so

00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:20,090
there's the ability to set stories so

00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:22,550
that you can limit who gets to view them

00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:24,140
it works entirely offline and we have

00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:27,020
adopted the portable OpenStreetMap

00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:29,120
format of a computer that generates a

00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:30,980
Wi-Fi beam through which other devices

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,020
can kind of get in touch with that box

00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:35,300
to load the application on the phone

00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:37,940
it's designed to be user-friendly for

00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:39,320
kids the kids are and educators really

00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,990
love it because it's a tool that teaches

00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:44,840
geography history language all in the

00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:46,370
same so we have a methodology that we

00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,890
developed around how to do this kind of

00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:51,110
work it's ohnparrot stories io for

00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:53,030
anybody that's interested and I just

00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:54,560
want to give a shout out to the people

00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,850
who really made this possible it had

00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:58,370
developed this which is a volunteer

00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:00,080
group of coders called Ruby for good and

00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:01,610
there's this wonderful quote that I

00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,040
really loved by one of the team members

00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:05,750
betsy Havel any coding project is a

00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:08,210
living system composed of both the code

00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:09,770
and the people working on the code which

00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:12,650
i think is just really expressive of how

00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:14,330
this is a living ecosystem right so we

00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:16,130
developed this in three different build

00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:17,390
a Thon's as well as it hacked Ober Fest

00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:19,430
I want to give a shout out to everybody

00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:21,020
that's worked on this we are on github

00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:24,710
so if anybody's interested in taking a

00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:26,750
look it's there and these are some

00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:28,640
things that we're still working on just

00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,560
peer to peer sinking ease of

00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,140
installation building and compatibility

00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,850
with other applications building a

00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:36,410
curriculum builder and guaranteeing

00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:37,720
indefinite access for community members

00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:39,800
into perpetuity

00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,880
which I would love to talk more about

00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,950
that but I think we're a little bit out

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,510
of time but that has to do with working

00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:46,930
with indigenous archives across the

00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:49,130
world to get that going

00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:51,560
place matters we all know this because

00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:52,670
we're stuck inside and but just I put

00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,350
this up here it says beautiful quote

00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:57,380
from the Museum of african-american

00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:59,240
history and Smithsonian because this is

00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,540
not something that's true for indigenous

00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,270
people this is true for all of us

00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:05,370
right so just to leave on that note just

00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:06,000
about place-based data and why it's

00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,820
important

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,190
thanks everybody yeah thank you I'm

00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:13,050
sorry we have to move on but it's like

00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:15,810
we could talk about this for hours so

00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:18,330
the conversation will continue over on

00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:19,830
slack and we'll have to go ahead and get

00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:24,320
started on the next presentation so

00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:24,320
