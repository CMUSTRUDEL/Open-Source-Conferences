Title: Gabriele S Hayden - The cultural meaning of programming languages
Publication date: 2020-05-28
Playlist: CSVConf 2020
Description: 
	Human languages develop over time a set of cultural associations. For example, during the early and mid-twentieth century, the Spanish language in the United States was seen both as a European high literary language and as a language associated with femininity and racial mixture. In my dissertation work, I documented how US modernist poets who translated from Spanish used or resisted those associations as they intervened in controversies over race and style in twentieth century poetics. Coding languages, too, can take on gendered and raced cultural associations. This talk explores the changing cultural associations of coding languages and how those cultural associations were expressed in changing coding styles or conventions. It draws on the work of Vikram Chandra (Geek Sublime) and other writers exploring the cultural meanings and stylistic associations of computer code.

all right thank you so much and thanks

00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:10,469
everyone for being here I'm Gabrielle

00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:12,750
Hayden I'm the librarian for research

00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:15,660
data management and reproducibility at

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:19,380
the University of Oregon but before I

00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:23,090
did that I got a PhD in 20th century

00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:26,369
poetry and I spent three years as a

00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:28,590
visiting professor at Reed College and

00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:30,750
it's some of the things that I learned

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:36,870
in that former profession that kind of

00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:41,309
gave me the idea for this talk so in in

00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:43,050
my dissertation work where I got to do a

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:46,410
lot of research at this ridiculously

00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:48,629
beautiful and inappropriately wealthy

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,160
library the by McCue library one of the

00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:53,250
things I was looking at was the ways

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,079
that Spanish language and literature or

00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,489
the ways that people had biases about

00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,879
Spanish language in literature sometimes

00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:01,920
suppress the translation and publishing

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:07,950
of that literature in the 20th century

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:09,960
and so that essentially what struck me

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,729
was that some of the biased ways that

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,430
people talk about human languages I saw

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:15,750
some real parallels with the biased

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,970
language that people use to talk about

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:21,420
programming languages so here I want to

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:24,390
stop and say that I'm going to talk

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,820
about language of bias and things that

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,409
people will say that if they were said

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:32,939
in earnest would absolutely violate the

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:35,189
code of conduct here and so if you're

00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:37,890
not in the mood to think about sad and

00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:39,119
stressful things or interactions that

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,720
you've had in the past you should

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:45,680
totally feel free to just hop off and

00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:48,360
come back the end of the talk will be

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,590
less about these depressing topics so

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,100
you could even just hop off for the next

00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:55,439
seven minutes but but but that was

00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,840
basically just noticing that parallel

00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,030
right and and seeing so programming

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,640
languages like human languages are

00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,110
social right and I think the little

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,670
scholarship that's done on this I think

00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,649
there's a lot of consensus right there

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,599
embedded in existing hierarchy so just

00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:12,610
as the way that we talk about human

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:17,190
language is influenced by things like

00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:22,240
history of imperial colonies and

00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:25,540
differences in power between cultures

00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:27,520
and nations in the same way you can see

00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,110
that there are differences in the way

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,910
that people understand programming

00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:32,970
languages or who has access to certain

00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:39,370
programming languages over others or

00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:41,920
parts of the computer science and

00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:43,840
software engineering ecosystems and you

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,820
know the pay differentials that can be

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,709
associated with that so another way of

00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:50,110
saying this in more positive terms is

00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:52,030
that in the way that we talk about all

00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:53,560
sorts of human languages formal

00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:56,620
computing languages and other we have

00:02:53,560 --> 00:03:00,900
opportunities to emphasize solidarity or

00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:05,560
division so here's just a selection of

00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:10,810
kind of classic gender and put-downs

00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:12,820
that you know my my thought for this the

00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:14,230
inspiration for this context was really

00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,420
kind of running across these kinds of

00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:18,100
things often people don't say this type

00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:20,650
of stuff out right it's more like you

00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,420
notice oh it this company I'm working at

00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,920
it seems like there are more women

00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:27,989
working in the front end or there's an

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:30,790
assumption that that would be the case

00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:32,019
those kinds of things but it was very

00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:34,000
interesting because once I started to

00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:36,910
look into it of course I saw that

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,940
actually this kind of way of putting

00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:42,610
down things that are newer potentially

00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:45,640
more accessible that that change who's

00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:47,799
using the technology are often getting

00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:54,549
put down in the same way by in the kind

00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:59,500
of gendered gendered language and that

00:03:54,549 --> 00:04:00,970
really harkens back to a way of putting

00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,730
down other people with languages that

00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:06,790
goes back quite a long way right so just

00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:08,709
I could have taken things from my

00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,970
dissertation but I actually thought it

00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:11,260
would be useful to think about how this

00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:16,060
goes back a lot farther so this is a

00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:19,120
fantastic feminist and post-colonial

00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:22,930
analysis of the gospel of Saint Paul and

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:25,960
his role in history and talking about

00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:28,990
the way that he is pushing back against

00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,729
languages in Rome of imperial conquest

00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:32,680
being associated with masculinity and

00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:34,360
conquered lands and languages being

00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:38,440
associated with femininity right you had

00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:40,180
this like image of potentially of sexual

00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,940
violence here on the cover right of the

00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:46,900
Roman soldier and the feminine the

00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:51,750
female figure who sort of stands in for

00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:55,020
lands conquered by Rome and you see that

00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:57,849
more recently in the 20th century with

00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:00,099
so I was studying as a pound

00:04:57,849 --> 00:05:04,449
among other writers and you can see here

00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:06,310
he's talking about he sort of making a

00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:08,280
direct parallel between well banished

00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:12,360
literature's good when Spain has power

00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:14,740
now that it doesn't its feminine and

00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:21,490
then he just throws in some gratuitous

00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:24,849
racism so okay on the one hand that's a

00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:26,319
kind of depressing thing to notice on

00:05:24,849 --> 00:05:30,699
the other hand I think it's useful when

00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:33,759
we run across this kind of toxic

00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:39,330
language to know that it has this sort

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:44,650
of long and in a way on an original

00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:47,469
uninteresting genealogy but of course I

00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:49,990
think that if you were to have this

00:05:47,469 --> 00:05:50,979
conversation on reddit you would come

00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,150
across a lot of people who would say

00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:53,440
well but aren't some programming

00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,060
languages better than others

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,180
I'm actually not much of a programmer

00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:00,880
although I do help teach some intro are

00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,530
on Python in my work and I am excited to

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,080
be learning more but I'm not someone

00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:07,180
who's going to have this opinion very

00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,340
firmly well who does care about the

00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:12,219
answer to this question but the folks

00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:13,719
we've we've just been alluding to but

00:06:12,219 --> 00:06:15,130
then also people who design and write

00:06:13,719 --> 00:06:17,349
programming languages right I mean

00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:23,650
unlike human languages which develop

00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:25,120
completely organically program unlike

00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,469
human languages develop that develop

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,169
organically programming languages are

00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:31,930
written by people and they're written to

00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:33,880
be successful and so the people who

00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:37,240
design them want other people to adopt

00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:39,070
them and they are also thinking about

00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:44,320
this so this is a great article

00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:50,050
2015 by a CMU professor jinyang and re

00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:53,710
wrapkin but talk about the question is

00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:56,800
kind of again this is this kind of faux

00:06:53,710 --> 00:07:00,150
technical language and there that essay

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,560
actually comes out of this great study

00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:04,570
called the sociology of programming

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:09,670
language adoption that wrapped ended

00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:11,980
with Leo meyerovich where they surveyed

00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:14,350
developers and asked them you know why

00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:16,870
are you choosing one language over

00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:19,600
another and I think their sense was as

00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:21,160
people who wrote programming languages

00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,350
or who are involved in the development

00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,370
of programming languages you know that

00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:27,310
people would care about things like

00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:32,130
development speed and and correctness I

00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:34,270
think all of these very specific

00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:35,770
technical things I mean you can think

00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:37,410
about if you're an advanced

00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:42,700
mathematician there's all sorts of fun

00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:45,480
work I think that can be done but in

00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:50,470
fact what they found was no developers

00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:54,010
ultimately are choosing languages based

00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:56,020
on you know who they know and what what

00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:59,440
those people are using right open-source

00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:01,540
libraries powerful existing code

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:06,220
personal familiarity team familiarity so

00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:09,220
that those interpersonal dynamics are

00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:13,150
are the things that really that really

00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:20,320
matter but there are still people who

00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:23,740
are thinking about the differences

00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:26,350
between languages and how that might

00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,940
affect people and here again there's

00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:29,890
sort of interesting parallels between

00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,810
the way that we talk about human

00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:35,950
languages and the way that we talk about

00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:38,200
programming languages so German

00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:40,419
Romanticism that's the 1700s and early

00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,610
1800s there was a lot of talk about

00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:44,860
language representing the spirit of the

00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:48,190
people at the spoke of a people and this

00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:50,740
was in the context of really empowering

00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:52,940
the German language over say Latin and

00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:58,790
and you know really thinking about

00:08:52,940 --> 00:09:00,920
the mother tongue and how I'm thinking

00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:04,880
about that as a font of literary

00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:08,450
inspiration and so on a more recent

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,250
version of this in the 20th century is

00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:13,190
what people tend to call the sapir-whorf

00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:14,960
hypothesis which is that this idea that

00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:19,090
the structure of language of human

00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:21,620
languages can influence how we think and

00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:24,410
I think there's a general sense that

00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:27,800
that is not true in a in a really strong

00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:29,780
way but that there can be a subtle the

00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,520
subtle structures of language can subtly

00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:33,020
affect what we're paying attention to

00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,640
within the language or what we're sort

00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:37,370
of in the ways that weren't invited to

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,140
speak and what's interesting is that

00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:43,430
there are people now who are doing

00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:46,250
research around those questions within

00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:48,110
programming languages as well so the

00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:50,540
knowledge lab at the Chicago just got a

00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:52,910
sloan Foundation grant to do a bunch of

00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:54,620
machine learning analysis of the way

00:09:52,910 --> 00:10:00,290
that people are using computer

00:09:54,620 --> 00:10:05,150
programming languages really thinking

00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:08,180
about that there's also a fantastic talk

00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:13,220
that's still available on the wayback

00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:16,370
machine by the inventor of Ruby where he

00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:19,340
talks about having written Ruby really

00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:22,220
very much with the Secor Whorf

00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:23,810
hypothesis in mind and in particular the

00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:26,660
way that it's articulated in this

00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:31,010
fantastic novel by Samuel R Delaney if

00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:34,700
you don't know him he is a really great

00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:40,339
sci-fi novelist who thinks about a lot

00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:42,200
of smart interesting stuff so the the

00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:47,120
other thing that that comes up out of

00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:49,250
this is I don't have time to really get

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,710
into but I would love it if you guys had

00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:53,860
questions about it or wanted to chime in

00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:56,810
about it in your own experience is that

00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:58,250
you know programming languages to a

00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:00,200
certain degree are based in English

00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,790
right so Python was developed by someone

00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,550
from the Netherlands ruby by someone

00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:05,810
from japan and yet the sort of small

00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:07,519
words in there

00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:12,589
to the extent that their human language

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:13,519
words are based in English and Yukihiro

00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,720
Matsumoto

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,149
and I don't know that I'm saying his

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,829
name right who develops ruby in the same

00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:19,939
talk which I highly recommend that you

00:11:18,829 --> 00:11:22,490
go back and look at all the flats for

00:11:19,939 --> 00:11:24,259
because it's hilarious you know starts

00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:26,360
out by saying you know when someone came

00:11:24,259 --> 00:11:28,610
to talk about ruby in japan we got them

00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:31,579
an english translator because he had

00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:34,279
looked at japanese for two weeks and but

00:11:31,579 --> 00:11:38,959
here i have to stand before you with my

00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:41,360
bad english i need to suffer just

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:44,029
because i was born in japan life isn't

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,129
fair but he's really I mean it's he's

00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:48,920
being he's being cute but of course it

00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:55,519
does reflect real structural imbalances

00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:57,439
in how easily people can access language

00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,529
and then maybe how they feel about it -

00:11:57,439 --> 00:12:05,420
so geek sublime is a beautiful set of

00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:08,689
essays about all of these issues this is

00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:10,790
your five-minute warning okay great and

00:12:08,689 --> 00:12:15,860
one of the things he talks about is the

00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:20,689
origin of of computer languages being

00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:23,240
inspired in part by semiotics which is

00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:26,569
kind of a forbearer of certain strand of

00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:28,759
linguistics and that in turn having been

00:12:26,569 --> 00:12:30,559
really inspired by this brilliant

00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:34,610
sanskrit grammarian from the 4th century

00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:37,129
BCE who made a grammar of sanskrit that

00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:40,069
can really be understood according to

00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:44,019
the most recent arguments by scholars as

00:12:40,069 --> 00:12:46,910
a kind of precursor to a a formal

00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:48,709
language or even a computing language so

00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:51,170
it's fascinating I don't know Sanskrit

00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:53,179
and I'm not a logician but if you want

00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:57,730
to go down that rabbit hole I got really

00:12:53,179 --> 00:12:59,569
excited them read skimmed a lot of a B

00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:01,579
logic stuff that I didn't fully

00:12:59,569 --> 00:13:03,110
understand so totally fascinating stuff

00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:05,689
but you know this is also something

00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:07,579
where when I mentioned this to a

00:13:05,689 --> 00:13:10,939
colleague who worked in tech they said

00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:12,709
oh you know I had heard of that because

00:13:10,939 --> 00:13:14,660
someone you know that I talked to who

00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:17,690
was being kind of bro E who was from

00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:19,640
India was like oh yeah well you know

00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:21,170
it all came from panini right and

00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:25,760
there's that sense of wanting to express

00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:29,900
a kind of national pride or a cultural

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:33,890
contribution when programming languages

00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:36,260
are so dominated by English language and

00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:38,620
by English language companies and then

00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:43,130
I'll just mention one other study that

00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:45,110
kind of gets into this is a chapter on

00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:48,320
critical code studies this new book out

00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:50,330
from MIT press about flow Matic which

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,690
was written by Grace Hopper and was a

00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:55,850
precursor to COBOL which is sort of

00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:57,440
focused on business folks which in turn

00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:59,720
can imagine as a kind of very early

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,760
precursor to excel in certain ways in

00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:07,340
terms of its focus on the business

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:09,440
audience and just talking about how that

00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:11,510
was a matter of bringing more English in

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,990
and then I just want to end with noting

00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:16,970
that excel is one of the only sort of

00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:18,980
platforms for programming languages it

00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:21,980
actually allows you to program in your

00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:25,490
language so there's the excel the German

00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:28,370
version and and so on so I want to end

00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:30,110
the end by asking some questions that I

00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:33,500
hope can lead to some conversation

00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:36,350
either now or in the slack so you know

00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,940
how has language chauvinism affected

00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:39,770
your relationship to particular

00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:42,110
programming languages or your access to

00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:44,210
opportunity if your first language is

00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:45,770
not English do you feel that the fact

00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:47,360
that programming languages are based in

00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:49,940
English affects your work or do you see

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,500
it affecting others and are there

00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:52,880
strategies you've found helpful for

00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:58,760
interrupting language chauvinism

00:14:52,880 --> 00:15:01,550
so no obligation but if you're

00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:08,180
interested I am totally fascinated to

00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:10,339
share your thoughts so yeah so I'm just

00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:11,960
gonna stop there somehow I wanted there

00:15:10,339 --> 00:15:13,760
to be a more uplifting note at the end

00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:19,250
of this but this was me on Twitter come

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:20,680
find me if you want and yeah I want to

00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:23,930
continue this think and talk more about

00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:26,510
about interrupting these these kinds of

00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:31,210
associations or just noticing the ways

00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:31,210
that they are truly unoriginal

00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:39,350
gabriele thank you so much that was

00:15:35,739 --> 00:15:41,300
absolutely fantastic um and I just want

00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:43,040
to give a a little comment on in terms

00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:47,920
of the time we've got left we've got

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:51,499
five or six minutes so certainly time to

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:53,720
ask a few questions or to have that

00:15:51,499 --> 00:15:57,199
discussion and in fact we could go a

00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:59,209
little bit experimental and if anybody

00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:02,029
would like to come up on I'm come up

00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:04,069
onto the screen and engage in any of

00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:06,980
those questions then hopefully happy to

00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:13,639
do that we've got a question that has

00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:16,239
come in and I will I'll read it out and

00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:18,709
it's from mr. Klein Thank You Melissa

00:16:16,239 --> 00:16:20,029
and they say I'm furious whether you've

00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:22,579
looked at similar effects within

00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:25,100
programming languages ie dialects that

00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:30,649
develop in a particular workplace or set

00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:32,689
of packages so tidy versus besar you

00:16:30,649 --> 00:16:37,009
know I haven't but I'd really like to I

00:16:32,689 --> 00:16:40,970
mean this was really this talk is like

00:16:37,009 --> 00:16:44,449
posing the question and I think that the

00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:47,089
I wanted to be able to come in here with

00:16:44,449 --> 00:16:49,009
more answers and less questions but I

00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:51,769
think that to do that really requires a

00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:57,980
certain amount of more ethnographic

00:16:51,769 --> 00:17:00,889
research or really kind of getting into

00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:01,670
so but I want I think that's a really

00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:03,259
good question

00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:05,029
right I mean it's sort of the what

00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:06,740
follows from that observation that

00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:13,370
people are choosing languages based on

00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:15,740
the language packages and so on yeah so

00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:16,819
I'm excited to keep keeping looking into

00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:19,459
that how much is the culture of the

00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:22,429
language due to the actual founders or

00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:26,709
community that evolve I think that's a

00:17:22,429 --> 00:17:32,059
great question from Peter Marie rest and

00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:34,909
something that comes to mind there is a

00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:44,180
recent controversy that some of you will

00:17:34,909 --> 00:17:46,760
remember better than I about about there

00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:51,610
in a linux manual there was a sort of an

00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:56,480
abortion joke that was made around the

00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:59,390
abort command and the person who was

00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:02,620
maintaining it insisted upon keeping it

00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:11,660
despite the fact that people really

00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:13,340
didn't like it and and then that person

00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:15,920
and I really remember their name just

00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:19,010
just recently got kicked out of MIT for

00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:22,100
being a jerk so so I think in that sense

00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:28,960
like the people who are like so much of

00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:31,790
the work that is gone so beautifully at

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,370
CSV comp for example is that people do

00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:36,890
this work of maintaining and setting up

00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:39,650
the culture of being inclusive and

00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:41,180
inviting and respectful and I think when

00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:45,380
you have people who are involved who are

00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:47,360
doing the opposite of that I think you

00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:51,680
really see that so yeah Andromeda Yelton

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:54,140
is saying in her opinion founder effects

00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,640
are very strong yeah absolutely any

00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:57,860
opinions on programming languages not

00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,900
written in English yeah so I'm not I'm

00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:03,200
still so new to programming that it's

00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:04,760
not like I have opinions myself about

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,650
different programming languages I mean

00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,720
it seems like there's a big challenge

00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:12,310
that people talk about network effects

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:17,270
right that because many people have to

00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:19,580
learn the English based programming

00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:23,090
languages in order to enter in to the

00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:24,860
conversation then that's also then what

00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:26,810
everyone knows and so there's a kind of

00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:32,450
bigger audience and there's a kind of

00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:34,550
knock-on effect that you get from just

00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:37,550
in the sense that the founder maybe the

00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:39,830
language can help set the culture the

00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:41,570
fact that the early languages were in

00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:43,910
English then makes it harder to not

00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:50,600
write in languages that are not in

00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:52,550
English and so a couple more comments so

00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,590
several people said this reminded them

00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:56,690
of the work of Celine Hermann and that

00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:57,620
was someone who I ran across right at

00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:59,750
the end

00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:03,740
giving this talk and I'm excited to read

00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:05,480
more about their work and then Jonathan

00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:06,950
Cain says it makes me think about

00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,210
conversations this morning about

00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:09,409
community building and what does this

00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:10,940
mean for all the work that folks are

00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:13,340
doing to build inclusive unities I think

00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:15,679
that's a great point and in fact I had

00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:17,590
really written I had meant to say at the

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:20,150
very beginning to give a shout out to

00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:22,159
Angela Lee and her talk on data

00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:24,950
communities and those who build them I

00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:27,169
think that these kinds of posturing

00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:29,059
right are the exact opposite of creating

00:20:27,169 --> 00:20:34,100
the kind of excitement and kindness that

00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:36,830
we work so hard to foster here at CSP

00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:38,570
comp so it it almost looked a little sad

00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:41,179
to give this paper here in the sense

00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:43,580
that it's sort of documenting the

00:20:41,179 --> 00:20:46,909
opposite of of what we want to build but

00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:50,539
I I hope that there's some value in in

00:20:46,909 --> 00:20:53,980
noticing how the operations of our of

00:20:50,539 --> 00:20:57,490
the enemies of our inclusive communities

00:20:53,980 --> 00:21:01,390
Thank You Gabrielle that I think is a a

00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:01,390
