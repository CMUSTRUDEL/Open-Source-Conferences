Title: Christina Gosnell & Pablo Virgo - Getting climate advocates the data they need
Publication date: 2020-05-28
Playlist: CSVConf 2020
Description: 
	When it comes to electricity regulation a little data can go a long way. There is a wealth of data about the US electric system, but unfortunately it is not accessible, clean or connected. The Catalyst Cooperative collates and analyzes data to help advocates close coal power plants. We’d like to share what we’ve learned about how open source data can further the policy conversation around clean energy, using real data and examples from our work.

when it comes to energy regulation a

00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:10,080
little bit of data can go a long way in

00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:11,840
the United States we have a wealth of

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,790
information about our electrical grid

00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:18,270
unfortunately much of it is not clean

00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:21,359
accessible or connected the catalyst

00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:24,990
cooperative collates analyzes and

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:27,869
prepares data to help advocates close

00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,490
coal power plants what we'd like to do

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:31,679
is share some things that we've learned

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:34,020
about how open source data can further

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,809
the policy conversation using real

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,309
examples for artwork my name is Pablo

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:40,500
I've been working with catalyst as a

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:42,480
contractor since December and this is

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,360
Christina who is the president of the

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,690
catalyst co-operative Christina can you

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:52,079
tell us what you've been up to

00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:53,610
yeah sure so a few years ago a few

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,129
buddies and I got together with our

00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:58,050
laptops scrape some data about our

00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:00,719
electric utility we were in Colorado at

00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:03,750
the time and we helped convince our

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,640
utility Xcel Energy to close two of its

00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,850
coal plants and then play and then later

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,240
pledged to move towards 80 percent

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:16,950
renewable by 2030 and 100 percent by

00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:20,040
2050 that's what we're done here that's

00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:22,080
very very cool the thing is if you're

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,259
gonna be a superhero you actually need

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,340
to tell the whole backstory maybe you

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:32,610
can fill us in with a little bit more

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:35,460
than that of course fight like this one

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:38,040
is never alone I'm sure many of you have

00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,900
seen headlines across the country of

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,700
coal plants clothing or the fact that

00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,070
coal is dying and all of these things

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,560
and in it is and that it those things

00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,759
are happening but that they're certainly

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,990
not happening without a fight and

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,229
they're certainly not happening fast

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:55,409
enough for the climate our part in all

00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:58,890
of this started with local advocacy and

00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:01,829
education I was looking into some of the

00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:04,439
remaining coal remaining capital costs

00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:07,110
of coal plants the undepreciated value

00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:09,539
of those plants and differentiation is

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:13,080
weird and arcane so I had some questions

00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:13,680
so I ended up reaching out to a previous

00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,450
regulate

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,329
in Colorado named bran lair it's an

00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,920
all-american hero him dearly he was

00:02:18,329 --> 00:02:21,840
actually setting up a group of folks to

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,730
come together to try to figure out how

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,209
we can collectively get ourselves out

00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:28,560
from under the capital costs of coal so

00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:31,379
we can transition to a clean energy

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,849
economy which was a great timing for us

00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:36,299
so it was a nice little gang to fall

00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:38,970
into okay and when you say get out from

00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:42,180
under the capital costs oh you're saying

00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:46,170
I mean to me right and this is something

00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:48,629
I think that should come across the coal

00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,819
power plants don't want to divest from

00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:53,069
cold until they've actually made back

00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:56,459
some money on their investment is that

00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:58,379
correct yeah exactly the utilities need

00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:00,750
to like want to be made whole they can't

00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:05,069
just like think it just like walk away

00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:07,530
from their their investments and so what

00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:10,079
we were trying to find targets for early

00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:13,079
retirement and we were trying to propose

00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:15,060
various ways of dealing with those with

00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:16,650
that remaining capital costs through

00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:20,549
refinancing or through other like

00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:23,910
regulatory mechanisms and for us a good

00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:24,780
target meant that coal plants it was a

00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,609
coal plant that was particularly

00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,250
expensive which is bad for the

00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:30,780
ratepayers particularly polluting which

00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,180
is obviously bad for the climate and bad

00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:36,449
for the local communities and but those

00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:38,579
plants didn't have a ton of local a ton

00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:40,230
of recent investments because it's much

00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:44,669
harder to get out from under a bigger

00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:47,250
pile of cash and on this on this like

00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:50,250
general team of advocates and financial

00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:52,500
analysts and data monkeys unsurprisingly

00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:56,459
we're cease to be calm we were the data

00:03:52,500 --> 00:04:00,349
monkeys okay and so what exactly did the

00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:03,449
data monkeys do well so we collected

00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:06,000
information about these two crucial

00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:08,549
pieces of costs of the plants the

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,810
capital costs as so they're like all of

00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:14,459
the money that's ever been poured into

00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:18,180
the plant as well as the the operational

00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:20,639
costs so yeah that operational costs or

00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,200
which also card called the marginal

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,300
costs okay

00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,800
and when you say the operational costs

00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,510
are marginal costs essentially what

00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,510
you're describing

00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:32,900
how much money it costs just to turn the

00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:34,730
coal powerpoints on exactly if you think

00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:37,610
if you think of a plant having a big

00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:39,800
switch or a big knob its how much extra

00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:43,670
money gets eaten when you turn on the

00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:46,370
switch or turn up the knob and so we

00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:48,370
were trying to with that up with those

00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:51,290
operational costs we were trying to pit

00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:55,010
those existing operational costs with

00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:58,250
the all-in costs of new wind that's not

00:04:55,010 --> 00:05:00,380
a particularly fair fight because it's

00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:03,530
all the full costs versus just the

00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:05,750
operational costs but the utilities have

00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:07,790
already poured money into these plants

00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:09,590
the capital has already been spent and

00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:12,950
because of the way they're regulated

00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:14,570
they more or less get there like they're

00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:16,610
more or less guaranteed to get that

00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:17,630
money back unless they spent it

00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:18,020
imprudently and that's a whole other

00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:22,580
story

00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:23,780
oh that's not our talk but we were

00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:26,450
trying to find those plants that could

00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:28,400
immediately if we turn if we stopped

00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:30,200
operating them we could immediately save

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:34,670
money for the ratepayers by switching to

00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:36,620
a new noble source and we found in

00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:41,330
Colorado we found a few of those unicorn

00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:43,250
plants which was very exciting and what

00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:45,800
the utilities are it just because a

00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:47,420
plant was potentially on an economic to

00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,600
run utilities didn't just like

00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:56,840
voluntarily turn them off on their own

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:58,760
they had to be nudged so armed with our

00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,780
with that data the advocates did what

00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,120
they did best when they went and

00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:05,090
advocated so they made the case to the

00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:07,250
various stakeholders at play with the

00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:08,900
utilities they were like hey it's not

00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,330
like this is not gonna like break your

00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:13,400
bank it's not going to actually be bad

00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:16,280
for you it might actually be good to

00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:19,220
swap coal for a coal for wind in this

00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:24,260
case also with the governors and elected

00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:25,850
officials the case there is like if they

00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,770
care about climate we can make big moves

00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:29,180
on climate also they don't care about

00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:32,390
climate we can potentially still save

00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:36,020
rate payers money and for the regulators

00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:38,330
I mean they were trying to make the case

00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,039
that it was at least plausible that this

00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:41,419
should be and all this is would be a few

00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:44,029
but they should look into because

00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:46,129
regulators in theory are there to keep

00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:48,169
rates low and if it's a possibility that

00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:50,360
we could save rates by doing a new and

00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:53,629
potentially better thing they should

00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:57,919
that's their job to help investigate

00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:59,360
that so with all of that pressure Excel

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,309
I said pressure especially from the

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,499
environmental advocates Excel came out

00:07:01,309 --> 00:07:07,099
and said ok fine we'll close two of our

00:07:03,499 --> 00:07:09,669
coal plants and once they got sort of

00:07:07,099 --> 00:07:13,099
familiar with that closure process and

00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:16,039
I've got cozy with it they came out with

00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:19,009
the pledge to say hey will will reduce

00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:24,349
our emissions by 80 percent by 2030 and

00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:27,339
100 percent by 2050 and with a new the

00:07:24,349 --> 00:07:29,599
newly-minted a Colorado Legislature and

00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:31,969
climate Hawk and governor they like

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:34,969
quickly signed that into law and now

00:07:31,969 --> 00:07:38,959
it's the law of the land in Colorado so

00:07:34,969 --> 00:07:41,240
that's a pretty great result yeah it was

00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:44,689
it was it was a fun process was long but

00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:47,180
it was fun and in in our part it showed

00:07:44,689 --> 00:07:49,520
that we could make a big impact with

00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:55,069
just a little bit of data in the right

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:57,529
hands and our broader team wanted to do

00:07:55,069 --> 00:07:59,749
more we wanted to we wanted to like do

00:07:57,529 --> 00:08:00,860
this for more than one utility we want

00:07:59,749 --> 00:08:02,269
to do this for multiple in Chile this

00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:05,029
came at the same time we want to target

00:08:02,269 --> 00:08:08,749
utilities based on these operational and

00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:10,969
capital costs and we knew that we could

00:08:08,749 --> 00:08:13,099
not employ we employ a lot of manual

00:08:10,969 --> 00:08:16,789
tactics when we to actually scrape data

00:08:13,099 --> 00:08:19,519
in Colorado and we decided to create

00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:21,729
cattles cooperative and and creates a

00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:25,879
public utility data Liberation project

00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:28,879
to automate automate this like data data

00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:31,309
monkeying Paulo you've been you've been

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,459
working with us for a while what is your

00:08:31,309 --> 00:08:36,949
take on on all this what we're up to

00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:38,750
okay well as the contractor the things

00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:40,849
that I've seen the most is that you've

00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:43,459
got a whole bunch of different data sets

00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:45,260
that have a ton of information so you've

00:08:43,459 --> 00:08:47,329
got stuff from it Energy Information

00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:49,220
Administration you've got things from

00:08:47,329 --> 00:08:51,740
the Federal Energy regulation can

00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,610
and from the EPA which I hope everybody

00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:56,899
knows the Environmental Protection

00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:58,370
Agency and they're all of them actually

00:08:56,899 --> 00:08:59,529
making their data available to the

00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:01,430
public but they're doing it their own

00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:04,300
distinct ways they've got their own

00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:06,529
formats and they've got their own

00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:10,310
standards for how well they keep the

00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:11,779
data and because of that sort of just

00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:14,870
really disparate us all over the place

00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:16,670
and so work that I've been helping you

00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:19,399
with and that you've been doing in

00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:21,319
general has been pulling all that stuff

00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:25,009
together packaging it up and so that you

00:09:21,319 --> 00:09:27,439
can get one big picture the entire grid

00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:32,810
and start asking questions about the

00:09:27,439 --> 00:09:33,790
state of energy costs the u.s. yeah

00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:37,430
exactly

00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:38,269
we right now we're archiving weight with

00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:40,579
Pablo's help

00:09:38,269 --> 00:09:43,879
we're archiving all of our raw data

00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:45,319
sources on the note and then pulling

00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:47,449
them down and running them through a

00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:50,480
standard ETL process the extract

00:09:47,449 --> 00:09:53,720
transform load and that process

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:56,660
generally like cleans gives it gives the

00:09:53,720 --> 00:10:00,050
data set data sets IDs normalizes the

00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:03,259
data and most importantly and also most

00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:05,689
difficulty um it connects the data so

00:10:03,259 --> 00:10:08,180
there's you know a coal plant that is

00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:09,889
reported in FERC is also reported in ia

00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:12,740
but there's no shared IDs between the

00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:15,399
two of them and we need those in order

00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:17,660
to kind of ask bigger questions quickly

00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:19,339
so we do some of that inner data set

00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:21,980
connecting an intro data set connecting

00:10:19,339 --> 00:10:24,500
sometimes unfortunately what's a mess

00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:27,769
and then we archive that like cleaned up

00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:30,559
data in odo data pack I'm sorry well

00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:32,449
again we archive Don's Noto but we um in

00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:35,379
the format is frictionless data packages

00:10:32,449 --> 00:10:38,059
which have been fun to work with and

00:10:35,379 --> 00:10:40,069
then there's that like on top of that we

00:10:38,059 --> 00:10:42,050
kind of pipe it into other data data

00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:46,459
formats and have some like stock

00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:49,100
analysis that's kind of built in well so

00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:51,980
this is the part where we get to do a

00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:53,689
demo so we can show these people say we

00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,970
can sell books what kind of question

00:10:53,689 --> 00:11:05,330
funnel actually

00:10:54,970 --> 00:11:10,130
ready exciting all right can you I'm

00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:14,410
gonna nice great thank you

00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:17,150
can you all see this notebook yes we can

00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:19,130
grant okay so I'm gonna go through this

00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:21,140
quickly but um so there's this is a

00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:22,850
little notebook that is exploring these

00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:26,390
marginal and capital costs of coal

00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:28,280
plants there's a ton of prep that kind

00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:34,220
of just pulls everything into one place

00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:36,830
oh my computer's being slow but

00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:39,820
generally if that prep above it

00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:42,440
generates these two separate data frames

00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:45,020
one is about renewable costs and the

00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:49,730
other is the data frame here that pulls

00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:52,280
in data from FERC the one data set FERC

00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:55,910
and other aia about the capital and

00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:59,180
marginal costs and we have data in this

00:11:55,910 --> 00:12:02,450
for 43 states not all of the utilities

00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:06,830
and all of the states need to report so

00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:10,040
we're not everything but but the best

00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:12,080
way to look at most things is Lots so

00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:17,660
what's what's play with some plots real

00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:20,200
quest so I'm gonna show y'all some

00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:25,000
information about Colorado in particular

00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:28,250
but we can get some crowdsource to state

00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,820
in a minute if you all want so this is

00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:34,100
the this is just a snapshot of the

00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:37,310
annual operational costs in Colorado and

00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:40,850
2018 the blue the purple at the bottom

00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:43,100
is his fuel costs and the turquoise at

00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:46,100
the top is those non fuel operational

00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:47,480
cost everything else that all the other

00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:51,650
money that's spent when you turn that

00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:54,740
plant on and these number down here is

00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:57,350
how big the plants are it's the capacity

00:12:54,740 --> 00:13:00,920
of the plant so on the biggest ones on

00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:03,890
are on the left and the way that we kind

00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:05,960
of compare and sort of do kind of some

00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:08,120
ground truthing of whether or not these

00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,710
plants are potential targets is

00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,170
you know doing that pitting them against

00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:15,440
renewables so I'm gonna turn on the

00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:21,800
renewables in here so it's a little

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:24,380
small but so so right this is the line

00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:26,029
of out this is average u.s. cost of wind

00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:30,980
and the average u.s. cost of solar in

00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:32,690
2018 solar and wind prices vary quite

00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:34,310
dramatically across the country so if

00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:37,130
you were to pick up this data to run

00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:39,589
with it in one of your states there's

00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:42,470
some local variability and need to get

00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:46,130
some more granular data but but as you

00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:47,690
can see in Colorado in 2018 the really

00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:49,160
all of the plants are more expensive

00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:52,100
than wind and most of them are more

00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:54,890
expensive than coal now that was very

00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:57,260
much not the case ten years ago

00:13:54,890 --> 00:14:03,710
and we can show that in a few separate

00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:05,660
ways we're done so yes Solar is the

00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:08,750
right now it's just lightly more

00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:13,190
expensive resource than wind but like

00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:16,970
yeah in 2009 this this landscape looked

00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:20,720
very different in terms of the economics

00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:22,310
of wind versus mercifully we can also

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,190
look at these operational costs over

00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:29,540
time this is just one of the plants in

00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:32,180
Colorado and you can can we can look at

00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:34,250
it against with the changing cost of

00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:37,700
renewables so for this particular plant

00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:38,270
it was around 2017 when it actually

00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:41,120
became

00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:42,830
quote-unquote economic to immediately

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:48,050
switch there's a lot of other reasons

00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:49,820
why why a plant is on like we need to

00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:51,950
mean to keep the lights on we need to

00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:53,570
keep the grid running but the data that

00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:56,300
we've been trying to compile in these

00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:58,070
are is really to find out like is it

00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:01,100
plausible could we could we turn these

00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:03,620
off um please utility if it's plausible

00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:05,779
and it's economically viable to switch

00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:10,130
to renewables we should do additional

00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:11,839
modeling none this is really a lot

00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:14,630
people can tell we rehearse some of this

00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:17,600
but the downward trend of the costs for

00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:20,050
the solar and wind that's new that's

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,050
actually

00:15:22,499 --> 00:15:29,049
yeah it's it's it's a it's been quite uh

00:15:25,449 --> 00:15:30,399
it's quite fun to get overtime yeah we

00:15:29,049 --> 00:15:32,589
can also look at the capital cost and

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:35,829
how capital costs are change over time

00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:38,589
in plants this is a particular plant in

00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:42,639
Colorado which had a big investment in

00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:45,189
2014 they got scrubbers installed which

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,480
is great for the emissions of that like

00:15:45,189 --> 00:15:48,249
that some of the emissions of the plant

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,989
like Sox and NOx but is actually if it

00:15:48,249 --> 00:15:53,379
makes this plant really hard to kind of

00:15:49,989 --> 00:15:56,160
make the case to retire well so I think

00:15:53,379 --> 00:15:59,290
we only have a couple more minutes so

00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:03,779
any final point sir want to take a

00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:08,790
question yeah let's take questions

00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:13,809
looks like Zane's been getting some yeah

00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:16,239
thanks really what I what I like is are

00:16:13,809 --> 00:16:25,199
there ways to to get help from

00:16:16,239 --> 00:16:29,110
volunteers or crowd sources hmm yes yeah

00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:31,089
right now we have several like open

00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:32,769
source contributors to our project most

00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:35,470
of them are academics which has been

00:16:32,769 --> 00:16:38,379
really lovely it's been great to see

00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:40,540
folks kind of use pick up and use our

00:16:38,379 --> 00:16:43,779
data in their research as well as like

00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:47,829
add datasets and add to the project in

00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:50,919
general so it's been very helpful yeah

00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:52,869
we have a ton of sort of pain points

00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:57,009
that we're always trying to work on and

00:16:52,869 --> 00:16:59,589
trying to get better about yeah if

00:16:57,009 --> 00:17:02,110
someone's in the coding side of things

00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:05,529
particularly with Python it would be

00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:08,529
handy for us to get a boost in there's a

00:17:05,529 --> 00:17:13,149
library we depend on for it called BBF

00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:15,399
read that works in it basically opens up

00:17:13,149 --> 00:17:16,959
FoxPro databases because when we said

00:17:15,399 --> 00:17:20,350
some of these folks are using really

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:23,529
older weird games publication methods

00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:25,299
this is one of them and that means so

00:17:23,529 --> 00:17:28,089
that needs some attention and we're

00:17:25,299 --> 00:17:29,770
we're we're interested in taking on the

00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:31,390
task of making sure that it gets

00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:32,950
since days updated but it would be

00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:34,540
really nice if we didn't actually well

00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:37,030
if we could just play more of a

00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:40,030
coordinating role rather than having to

00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:41,560
like individually write all that code

00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:43,780
ourselves we're gonna check we're gonna

00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,940
try to do it anyway but if someone's get

00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:49,060
in that area everyone wants to have some

00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:50,770
some extra attention yeah that's fine

00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:54,300
well thank you both we have to move on

00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:54,300
