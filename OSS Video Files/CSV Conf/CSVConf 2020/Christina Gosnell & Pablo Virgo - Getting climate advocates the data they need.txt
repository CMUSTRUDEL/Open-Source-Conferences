Title: Christina Gosnell & Pablo Virgo - Getting climate advocates the data they need
Publication date: 2020-05-28
Playlist: CSVConf 2020
Description: 
	When it comes to electricity regulation a little data can go a long way. There is a wealth of data about the US electric system, but unfortunately it is not accessible, clean or connected. The Catalyst Cooperative collates and analyzes data to help advocates close coal power plants. We’d like to share what we’ve learned about how open source data can further the policy conversation around clean energy, using real data and examples from our work.
