Title: Andrew McKenna-Foster and Kathleen Sullivan - Complicated Problem of Closing Open Data
Publication date: 2020-05-28
Playlist: CSVConf 2020
Description: 
	Open government data portals can be a valuable source of diverse public-sector information, from lobbyist spending to water quality test results. They also have a lot of aging junk: little-used datasets with cryptic titles and scant documentation. The library domain has years of experience “weeding” out under-used or outdated materials, and our team brought that perspective to the Washington State open data portal (data.wa.gov/browse). But weeding open data turned out to be pretty complicated. What counts as “low quality” or “little” use? Who makes the weeding decision, in a publishing environment that’s usually decentralized and managed anonymously? How do portals, created for transparency, remove content in a transparent way? We examined nearly all U.S. state and many U.S. city government portals and found very few formal data removal policies -- a void that raises questions about authority, usability and management, as many civic data portals enter their second decade. Supported by the Open Data Literacy project (https://odl.ischool.uw.edu/), this work is contributing to a new open data curation partnership between the Washington State Library and the state’s data portal. The talk will cover our findings, recommendations from archivists and other public records experts, and how the Washington State Library and state agencies are working together to improve open data resources for the public.

all right so high CSV come it is so

00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:15,360
wonderful to be part of this and Andrew

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:18,630
and I are delighted to talk to you about

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:22,500
this tricky little problem of whether

00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:27,150
and when and how you close data that's

00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:29,099
been opened so I am the open beta

00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:33,000
librarian for the Washington State

00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:36,600
Library and very recently it became part

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,719
of my job to help curate and manage data

00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,750
gov which is our state government open

00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,719
data portal you see a screenshot of it

00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,940
there on the right

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,860
data.gov is about a decade old it's one

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,530
of the more seasoned government data

00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,570
portals in the United States and for

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:58,350
most of that decade the emphasis is

00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:02,280
understandably been on growth getting

00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:04,170
more of our state agencies to establish

00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,650
an open data plan which they're all

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:10,260
supposed to do and identify public

00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:13,049
interest data and publish more of that

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,210
data on the portal and this has all

00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:17,939
happened in a very decentralized process

00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:21,450
so the office of the chief information

00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:23,549
officer in Washington State provides the

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,920
infrastructure provides this open data

00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:27,210
platform and a little bit of support but

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,189
basically it's left to the state

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,790
agencies themselves to select the data

00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:37,860
and prepare it and publish it and

00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:39,810
hopefully maintain it and a lot about

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,869
that decentralized process had worked

00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:44,850
really well so here we are in 2020 and

00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:48,090
we have dozens of state agencies

00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:49,890
publishing hundreds of data sets on the

00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,140
portal and we've been talking to them

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:55,680
and it looks like use is just going to

00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,930
accelerate if you can go to that portal

00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,229
and you can find wonderful public

00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,909
interest data on campaign contributions

00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:06,180
and consumer complaints to the attorney

00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:08,220
general's office and salmon counts and

00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,209
other environmental data and a lot of

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:13,410
our agencies do a beautiful job of

00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:15,710
carefully choosing

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:18,270
public interest user centered data and

00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,800
preparing it and documenting it really

00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:24,780
well so that when it's published its

00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:28,820
it's really usable however not all of

00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:31,200
the data falls into that category so

00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:34,140
along with that beautifully prepared

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:37,470
data we also have a few data sets that

00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:40,590
are clearly identified as practice data

00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:43,110
sets but they're still there and we have

00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:45,000
a number of data sets that I think this

00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:47,940
sort of like little jigsaw puzzle pieces

00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,600
so it's a little bit of budget

00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:55,050
information for one agency in 2013 or

00:02:51,600 --> 00:03:00,420
it's some test results from one location

00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:02,310
in 2015 and it's never updated and it

00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,710
doesn't look like anybody uses it after

00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:07,710
maybe the first month and it's just sort

00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:09,930
of living there and this makes the

00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:13,050
collection the collection of data on the

00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:15,540
portal sort of noisy and noise is a

00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:19,070
problem because noise makes it harder

00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:23,010
for the user to find what she wants and

00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:24,660
it also just lowers confidence overall

00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,670
in the portal we want people to go to

00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,600
the portal and have confidence that

00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:33,360
they're going to find something good

00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:37,920
there so enter the library the State

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:40,500
Library so luckily for the State Library

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,930
and libraries generally the person who

00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,000
for many years spearheaded open data in

00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:48,270
Washington state as well Saunders and

00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,580
well has worked extensively with

00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:53,280
librarians and library staff over the

00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:56,040
years and about a year and a half ago he

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,800
and OCIO started talking to the State

00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,600
Library about a partnership where the

00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:03,270
library would provide some curation

00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:06,090
services for the data on the state

00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:08,220
portal and this is doing some pretty

00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:10,230
straightforward library stuff with the

00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:12,270
collection of data there so the idea was

00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,830
that the library would come in it would

00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:16,890
help to prune some of the so-called

00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:20,220
low-quality data clean up the stuff that

00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:22,229
was rest that was left like you know go

00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,970
in the data dictionaries maybe add some

00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:26,669
categories make things a little easier

00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,180
to find and generally support data

00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:30,900
quality

00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:33,840
and circulation and usability going

00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:36,419
forward so State Library love that a

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,509
partnership was forged this is now half

00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:41,190
of my job but when we were getting

00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:44,520
started we wanted to have a baseline

00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:48,360
assessment so it was a good job for a

00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:50,430
summer internship we turned to the open

00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,680
data literacy project at the University

00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:55,380
of Washington where I had been an intern

00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:58,199
when I was in library school and ODL

00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:01,349
connected us luckily with Andrew who

00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:03,389
came in to conduct this initial

00:05:01,349 --> 00:05:07,139
assessment so we got Andrew all settled

00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:10,740
and he dug in and started assessing the

00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:12,630
data but very quickly as he was looking

00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,270
at the data and in talking with well

00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:20,610
they they realized that there was a

00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:22,889
little hitch and that is that there

00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:26,610
isn't actually really this clear path

00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:31,650
for retiring or removing data once it's

00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:34,919
been opened so in a library selection

00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:39,210
adding content or deselection weeding

00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:40,380
content happens and has a single basis

00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:43,470
and that's the collection development

00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:46,440
policy so ideally a library has a policy

00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:49,740
that's written down and it says this is

00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,659
our community these are the needs that

00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,610
we believe our community has and in

00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:55,620
order to meet those needs we are going

00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:56,849
to collect these sorts of things and

00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,940
we're not going to collect these sorts

00:05:56,849 --> 00:06:01,949
of things and so as the library adds

00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:04,740
things or takes things away there is

00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:07,949
this document that provides some clear

00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:10,349
transparent criteria and and it's there

00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:15,000
to engender confidence and trust in the

00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:17,639
institution but remember data.gov like

00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,949
all of the government data portals that

00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:21,960
I'm aware of in the United States

00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:24,360
operates in a decentralized fashion so

00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,400
the agencies themselves are the ones

00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,039
doing the selecting for a variety of

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,169
reasons and they're the ones who are

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,300
publishing and maintaining the data and

00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:35,310
technically they can also just delete

00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:38,370
their data so the screenshot you see

00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:39,500
there is my activity log when I log in

00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:43,070
as an administrator

00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:45,710
and owner's data owners can just delete

00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:48,590
their assets now effectively they they

00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:50,270
don't just yank data that the public has

00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:52,460
been using most of what's deleted as a

00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:55,460
draft or or something that was never in

00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:58,130
the public eye but this seem to be a

00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:01,010
whole like it didn't really seem to be

00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:03,440
in step with the spirit of open data

00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:06,110
transparency and accountability and so

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,690
Andrew and I talked about like let's

00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:10,580
look around and see if we can find some

00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:12,290
policies or procedures that would be a

00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:15,980
good foundation for something we could

00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:19,520
use in Washington State so this is what

00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:21,560
we did we decided we would look at other

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,710
state government data portals as many as

00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:27,320
we could find and then we also looked at

00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,370
other domains that do selecting and

00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,140
weeding

00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:32,960
so besides libraries that would be

00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:35,300
archives and depositories and scholarly

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,610
with Plaza Tories museums that sort of

00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,470
thing now I'm going to turn it over to

00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:42,700
Andrew and he's going to tell you a

00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:42,700
little bit about what we found

00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:59,960
when you stop sharing your screen going

00:07:52,040 --> 00:08:06,290
on okay so I'll pick up where Kathleen

00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:11,690
left off and I think my screen is now

00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:17,930
being shared properly can everybody see

00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:18,560
that um okay I'm gonna say me everything

00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:22,430
see this

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:25,280
so we looking great great thanks so we

00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:31,910
we looked at all 50 states and we found

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:34,370
91 open government data sites 14 I of

00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:37,700
which were geospatial sites 13 or

00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:40,190
transparency sites that are via like

00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:43,729
figures about financial data or their

00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:46,940
meeting minutes 24 sites were make

00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:50,930
tabular data available like tada Oaxaca

00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:52,010
and if I were other open gov sites that

00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,950
generally fit in any of the other

00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:58,459
categories we also had 53 emails to

00:08:54,950 --> 00:09:00,620
contact links on a set of those sites we

00:08:58,459 --> 00:09:02,690
got 29 responses and we were asking

00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:07,250
about do you have a data removal of

00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:08,810
retirement policy for your portal so as

00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,310
too many people have seen open

00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:12,080
government data port works a difficult

00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:14,300
case this is one of them for Oklahoma

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,330
based on the geek and software you can

00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:19,120
see a list of data sets and descriptions

00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:22,610
and then on the left there's some facets

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:26,060
to help someone browse on same with

00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:27,470
bated Etica it's on secreto platform so

00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:30,589
these are the sites that Kathleen and I

00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:32,360
were looking at and we're trying to find

00:09:30,589 --> 00:09:34,029
contacts and find policies and

00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:39,470
procedures

00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:42,529
so those 91 sites only six sites and six

00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:45,800
states had any type of policy that we

00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:47,720
could find and so five of those listed

00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:50,390
criteria or removal and that's that

00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,670
little word cloud they're only replaced

00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:55,100
by a new version was that was in two

00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:58,250
policies everything else but only unique

00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:00,079
you can see mostly is about weather data

00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,250
without fleet or it's been replaced in

00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:03,530
version

00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:06,800
that there's a inaccuracy or it's

00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:09,460
private data five-state site states also

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:12,410
had some type of procedure published

00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:15,170
about how to deal with remove removing

00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:16,790
data sets so or labeled for tired

00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:19,340
datasets and three had a waiting period

00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:21,470
for a data set might get labeled and

00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:25,730
then 30 or some number of days later it

00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:27,830
would be unpublished from site now there

00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:29,900
is a really excellent example of a

00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:32,090
policy and procedure around removing

00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:35,030
open government data and that's on the

00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:36,860
New York City open data portal which was

00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:39,350
out of our scope the city portal and

00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:41,630
state portal but it's it's a great

00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:43,730
example so you can google it you can

00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:45,620
find it all the documentation is there

00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:47,300
they have a data set that lists all the

00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,460
removed data sets and why they removed

00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,290
and there's this nice flow chart that

00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:53,180
describes what might happen to a data

00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:56,000
set maybe it's considered for aircrafts

00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:57,140
maybe go somewhere else but a lot of

00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,820
state core will probably don't have the

00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:01,070
resources to implement this kind of

00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:02,810
thing and so it's nice to know is out

00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:05,740
there maybe there's some useful aspects

00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:08,810
of that that can be used in st. portals

00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:12,410
so we've in five evidence of data sets

00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:13,430
being removed retired archived both in

00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:16,310
our searching and through our

00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:19,310
correspondence with portal managers we

00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:20,660
heard from a majority of export managers

00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:22,040
mentioned the big thought about this

00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:25,220
that they're working on it but their

00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:26,839
interest in this some case some managers

00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:30,589
even mentioned yeah we've removed data

00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:33,200
before on a screen you see examples of

00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:35,810
data sets that have been less labeled

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,240
archive and this is a great way to let a

00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:40,730
user know that maybe there's newer

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:44,030
better data available especially this

00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:45,740
archive version points to a new data but

00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:49,250
it has to be done well it has to be well

00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:51,680
documented the lower-right one beaches

00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:55,010
archive data that is computing could be

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:57,980
an archive data set or is it a data set

00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:59,810
of old Beach data that is maybe updated

00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:02,210
regularly so it needs to be done with

00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:04,610
care I mean I should say I personally

00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:07,430
had like trying to find a data set I saw

00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:09,860
before and it was gone so personal

00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:13,040
experience for this so if the data set

00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:14,870
is removed a user might want to contact

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,120
the portal or figure out

00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:19,940
they can get that DJ and we notice that

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,320
corals can to be very baseless it can be

00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:25,700
really difficult to figure out who is

00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:28,060
behind it and so hand reaches zero five

00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:33,620
minute warning so yeah

00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:36,380
got it and we have some examples here of

00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:39,170
our correspondents so you know one

00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:41,720
portal had a dataset owner who called

00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:44,420
themselves the open portal come food

00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,710
master kind of cool but also that's hard

00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,930
to tell who you're emailing there and

00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:49,580
then Kathleen got this really nice email

00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:52,520
and it was just signed portal

00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:54,920
administrator so not all portals are

00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:56,330
like this though some corals have really

00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,160
great contact and documentation

00:12:56,330 --> 00:13:00,050
information it's really kind of builds

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,370
trust the user if you're looking for

00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:03,560
something you know where to go this is

00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:04,990
Delaware Maryland and DC and there were

00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:09,590
definitely other examples with free

00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:11,270
contact and documentation so like

00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:13,730
Kathleen mentioned we looked at several

00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:16,370
domains for guidance on what to do with

00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:18,920
government data that might to be removed

00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:20,660
from the portal we considered archives

00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,670
we talked to archivist

00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:25,610
we thought about tension schedules for

00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:27,920
government documents we looked at

00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:31,310
research data libraries and the fate of

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:33,530
curation life cycle and we also consider

00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:36,140
just public libraries can open

00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:40,100
government data just be meeting like you

00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:42,050
would with a the library question and we

00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,970
had we've settled on that it doesn't

00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:48,200
really fit in any one category although

00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:50,120
any given data set might you know it

00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:53,030
might be appropriate for the archives or

00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:55,700
it might have some retention rules

00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:57,260
around it but they seem to fit best they

00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,900
just have seem to fit best between

00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:01,550
research data libraries and public

00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,860
libraries so research data libraries

00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:06,020
have really stringent appraisal and

00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:09,050
selection guidelines and then there's a

00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:11,300
eyx sessioning guidelines takes a lot of

00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:12,890
work training to do that right data sets

00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,960
aren't necessarily updated all the time

00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:18,230
open government data though is all about

00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:20,780
being updated and current relevant and

00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:22,040
so it didn't seem to fit quite right in

00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:26,120
the bucket

00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:28,110
public libraries seems like a possibly

00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,300
good analogy but

00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:32,310
you need a book from a public library a

00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,620
user or a patron can get that book

00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:36,570
elsewhere interlibrary loan publisher

00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,459
open government data set though it might

00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:42,209
be the only possible and still removing

00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:46,730
that it's more difficult for the user to

00:14:42,209 --> 00:14:50,730
find archives are typically focused on

00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:53,910
data set or on records that are original

00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:57,630
that need to be preserved for a long

00:14:53,910 --> 00:15:00,839
term some open dated me fall under that

00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:04,200
umbrella same with record retention it's

00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:07,890
mostly focused on like records or maybe

00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:09,600
some types of publications but open data

00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:11,370
again is just a copy

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,930
okay government dated copy of data

00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:16,920
that's sitting somewhere in a state

00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:18,120
agency and so looks like the archives in

00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,190
record retention rules would apply to

00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,500
the data the original data not

00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:26,670
necessarily the open government data

00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:28,110
routing so with that I'm just gonna keep

00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:29,519
transitioning slide but Kathleen is

00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:34,529
going to talk about what this means for

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:36,810
data data right so I'm continuing to be

00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:39,420
the curator and as the curator okay so I

00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:42,660
don't order people around but I make

00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:46,529
recommendations to OCIO into our open

00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:49,649
data advisory group so yeah going to

00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:51,870
recommend that we have a written data

00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:54,329
retirement policy identify some of those

00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:56,490
criteria that we found elsewhere have a

00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:58,589
clear procedure some notice so that we

00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:01,560
don't you know yank some data that

00:15:58,589 --> 00:16:04,050
somebody was using and then have some

00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:07,769
clear labeling to make a record of

00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:09,540
what's been removed and why also good to

00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:12,600
kind of go back to the beginning and

00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:14,190
raise the conversation about selection

00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,990
again this is a decentralized

00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:17,940
environment we're not going to take that

00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:20,750
away from agencies but it's great to

00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:22,920
have this conversation in that spirit of

00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:24,870
collection development which is just

00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:28,290
who's our community who are our users

00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:30,600
why do we publish open data what are we

00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:32,010
trying to do so it's good publishing

00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,290
open data is a lot of work it's good to

00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:36,810
have these touchstones that help us to

00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:39,810
remember why we're doing it of course

00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:40,860
we're talking about lower quality data

00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:42,690
that we want to remove

00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:44,580
thinking about that whole continuum it's

00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:46,560
a great reminder to you know at the

00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:48,660
10-year mark talked to our wonderful

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,450
digital archives in Washington State

00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:55,800
about long-term preservation and

00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:59,490
historic value and finally we don't want

00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:03,600
to be one of those faceless data portals

00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:06,930
we want humans on data.gov humans are

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,880
undated what gov if anything has come up

00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:10,800
in the past couple of days we've heard

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,620
these wonderful presentations reminding

00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:17,130
us that data is not this anonymous

00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:21,330
antiseptic neutral magic thing it is a

00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:25,020
human endeavor with lots of human work

00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:27,660
and human ideas and goals and interests

00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:32,010
and values and we do a service to the

00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:33,750
public by reminding them of that and we

00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:36,960
can do it really easily by just having

00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:40,650
my name on the portal for help and also

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,330
some who we are documentation so that's

00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:44,520
where we're going that's what we found

00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:48,510
and we're happy to answer any questions

00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:51,420
if we have time thank you very much that

00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:55,500
was really fantastic we have got time

00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:58,140
for a very quick question and it's a

00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,700
question from Sarah and it says how has

00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,560
this research influenced your approach

00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:07,200
to curating Washington's over Data

00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:11,190
Platform well so certainly the

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:14,430
recommendations that that we just talked

00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:16,860
about and I think that it's also helped

00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:19,430
me to focus on how we're going to do

00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:23,490
this in a collaborative way working with

00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:26,190
our publishers many of whom as I said

00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:28,620
are have been laboring in the vineyard

00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:30,990
and doing just wonderful user centered

00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:32,910
work and so it's a great opportunity no

00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:34,560
it's what librarians do we circulate you

00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:37,010
know we find things and make exhibits

00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:39,480
and we promote really good quality

00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:41,850
material and we have plenty of that so

00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:46,170
it's it's nice to be in a position to
