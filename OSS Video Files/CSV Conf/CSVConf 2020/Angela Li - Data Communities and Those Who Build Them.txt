Title: Angela Li - Data Communities and Those Who Build Them
Publication date: 2020-05-28
Playlist: CSVConf 2020
Description: 
	In order to support the use of data in various contexts, it is important to have champions who demonstrate the value of tools, shepherd new users, and provide support to those learning to use data. In this talk, I’ll cover my experiences with data community building and share strategies from open source communities such as R-Ladies and The Carpentries, as well as the spatial data science community I support at my research center. I’ll discuss the value of the data community builder and their role within / outside of institutions for encouraging uptake of technical tools. Some of the skills needed for these roles may not be what you think: building relationships, being empathetic toward use cases (and users!), organizing events, teaching effectively, and setting strategy for expanding data networks, among others.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,669
I'm really excited to be talking about

00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:04,529
data communities and those who build

00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:06,540
them I'm also excited for this our

00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:10,410
ladies Chicago power session with

00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,599
Katherine and me and so like having that

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,610
representation is very very exciting I'm

00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,980
gonna start off with a little bit about

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,510
me and then jump into some insights that

00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,760
I've pulled from working from with

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:23,390
various data communities you can find

00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,460
these slides at bit dot leaf slash 20

00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:29,609
2005 - CSV comp if you want to find them

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,650
i've also tweeted about them and you can

00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:33,480
use them for reference later all right

00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,640
so Who am I and what communities do I

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,440
built and I want to start off with a

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,540
little bit of intro here because I think

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,100
that's always interesting and relevant

00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,559
especially if you're talking about

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,989
building data communities introducing

00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:47,879
myself I'm currently a researcher at the

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:50,700
Center for spatial data science at the

00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:52,440
University of Chicago I'm also in my

00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,059
free time the maintain our community

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,190
lead for the carbon trees so this is

00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:58,199
something that I actually got written

00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,660
into my job so five hours a week I'm

00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:02,730
working for the carbon trees highly

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,650
recommend this is like a tactic if you

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,180
want to work with a community and have

00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,250
your boss sign off on your work with

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,720
that community um one thing that I'm

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,369
very passionate about is thinking about

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,670
underrepresented minorities in data

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:16,650
communities I do a lot of work thinking

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,080
about how to make those communities more

00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,180
diverse organizing things trying to

00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,549
bring people into the fold and you can

00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,290
find me at civic Angela this is sort of

00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:26,970
a remnant from what I did like an

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,979
internship at a place called Civic Hall

00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,390
labs I'm thinking about civic technology

00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:33,780
so that's also been in the back of my

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:35,850
head for a while um so as a day of a

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,610
Community Builder I'm bringing skills

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:40,860
into my communities that have been with

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:43,619
me before I even started working with

00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,600
data so I'm thinking about my early days

00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:47,399
as a Community Builder and this is a

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,890
picture of me working with a sort of

00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:52,409
positivity project called make Chicago

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,720
smile so this was back when I was still

00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:58,590
in school and one big thing that we

00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:01,020
pulled out from this was basically how

00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,759
to get people to you know organize

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,740
together around a common mission and do

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,229
things so this was before I really even

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,450
though vinta data and I learned a lot of

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:11,970
lessons from just this early community

00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:13,360
building things I learned included you

00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,790
know how to get people to help

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,320
how to plan a large-scale events how to

00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:19,060
build volunteer teams how to share out

00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:21,460
your work don't forget to take photos

00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:24,610
and I'm happy to talk specifically about

00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:26,380
tactics for each of these but I think

00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:28,660
today's talk is gonna be a little bit

00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,590
more about the broader picture from

00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,110
working with a number of these

00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:33,940
communities recent days is the data

00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:37,810
community builder and here are some

00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:39,550
photos from recent events left is a

00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:41,290
workshop that I taught for our ladies

00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:44,080
Chicago about data visualization with

00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:46,240
maps and we had a bunch of people come

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,480
out and learn and on the right is

00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,860
another workshop that I've taught with

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,380
amazing our lady Stephanie Kramer and

00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,790
and we did a package workshop I think

00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:56,140
Katherine is in this photo somewhere

00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:58,239
potentially oh no she's the one taking

00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:00,790
the photo so she was behind the scenes

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:04,510
of in this one and we taught people how

00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:07,180
to write our packages in a week weekend

00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:10,300
workshop I'm so very very happy about

00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,830
that sort of thing so I believe that

00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:14,860
community building is a skill just like

00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:17,110
anything else the I think the second

00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:19,660
talk of the morning about research

00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:21,489
software communities and mention this

00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,380
basically a lot of the people that

00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:25,840
you're working with have skills

00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,610
specifically in data or in technical

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,930
fields and they don't necessarily have

00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:33,250
you know um you know the the background

00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:36,040
in terms of community building

00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:38,350
specifically I'm so thinking that

00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,920
through I believe it's a skill that you

00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:43,299
can accomplish like get through practice

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,440
so this is something that I picked up

00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:47,010
from the car country's thinking about

00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:50,560
things as skills and and various

00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:51,790
contexts okay so I think thinking about

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,110
it as a skill I think there are two

00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:58,450
parts to community building and I think

00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,739
this is true of most things and there's

00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:03,190
the vision and then there's a strategy

00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:04,570
and let this become just business

00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:06,910
buzzwords I think this is sort of the

00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:08,530
big ideas and then the getting it done I

00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,700
actually had a lot of trouble writing

00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,650
this talk because I wanted to write a

00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,120
talk specifically on how to get it done

00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:15,190
because I'm someone who like loves

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,200
details loves like thinking through like

00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:18,430
a communications plan or like you know

00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,570
how are we gonna make this event like

00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,669
how we're gonna order the pizza and then

00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:23,680
do all this um but I realize that would

00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:25,720
be a very boring talk in terms of data

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,610
communities and it might be not relevant

00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,219
to your specifically so I'm gonna talk

00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:31,419
about three big ideas that I think I've

00:04:30,219 --> 00:04:33,460
pulled out from the communities that

00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:36,280
I've worked with and those communities

00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:37,629
are as I mentioned are ladies and the

00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,550
carpenters which have already gotten so

00:04:37,629 --> 00:04:41,590
many shoutouts already and then my

00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:43,300
specific research center the Center for

00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:46,330
spatial data science at the aresty of

00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,590
Chicago quick overview of these in case

00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:49,120
you don't know what they are

00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:50,710
our ladies is a meet-up for gender

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,210
minorities who's the programming

00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:54,250
language are there's a local chapter

00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:56,889
structure emphasis similar to things

00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:59,169
like pi ladies like I think there's one

00:04:56,889 --> 00:05:02,370
called map time and they're sort of

00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:04,930
informal meetups around the world

00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:06,639
differently the Center for spatial data

00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,979
science is my research center at the

00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,300
nursery Chicago we're focused on spatial

00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:13,060
analysis and open source software

00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:15,669
development so we build a tool called

00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:20,469
geo de that helps with exploratory

00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:23,259
spatial data analysis and we are heavily

00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:25,029
involved with social science research so

00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:27,699
I'm currently doing work on the opioid

00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:30,069
epidemic this is my job it's sort of

00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:31,839
funny that I put it second but I'm gonna

00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:34,449
I think it Maps well to sort of the

00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:35,830
topics we want to talk about and then

00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:37,719
the most recent community I've been

00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:39,879
involved with is the carbon trees so

00:05:37,719 --> 00:05:41,289
this is a volunteer initiative nonprofit

00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:43,389
teaching computational skills to

00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:46,210
researchers around the world as I said

00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:48,490
before this is my sort of job but I love

00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:51,089
their vision I love sort of what they're

00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:54,610
doing and I want to get more involved so

00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:57,069
um what I was thinking about this talk

00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:58,779
the things that stood out to me from

00:05:57,069 --> 00:06:02,379
these communities were three main ideas

00:05:58,779 --> 00:06:04,620
and I think I asked myself why do they

00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:08,770
work and what do they have in common and

00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:11,500
I can't say that these are the this is

00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:14,199
all of it but I think there are three

00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:16,839
big ideas which are excitement empathy

00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:19,240
and kindness so I'm gonna start off with

00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:21,580
talking about excitement I'm a pretty

00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,990
excited person I think people have told

00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,659
me that that's something that I bring to

00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:27,430
a community is that my enthusiasm is

00:06:25,659 --> 00:06:30,250
something that they're excited about um

00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:34,000
but I want to talk a bit about our Lady

00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:35,289
of Chicago so um this was like the most

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,580
exciting and I think this is most

00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:38,649
relevant when you're building or

00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:40,710
starting a community and building that

00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:43,290
momentum and getting started and

00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:45,030
on the Left we have a picture of our

00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:47,100
launch so this is the first event we

00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:49,560
ever did and we basically pulled it

00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:52,530
together in like three weeks which I'm

00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,750
still astonished by on the right is one

00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:56,820
of my friends who faked an AR pie for

00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:59,160
the first event so we had something sort

00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:01,500
of fun and exciting and just inspired

00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,510
people to you know get involved and see

00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,450
that things were happening we had two

00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:08,640
amazing speakers and we filled up the

00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:09,840
entire room got a lot of stickers I

00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,300
think you could see them on the table

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,150
and people were excited the momentum

00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,920
from that kickoff event led to a lot of

00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:19,320
good collaboration down the road and

00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:22,110
this is why things like sprints and

00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,220
things like workshops are important

00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,690
getting people in the room and

00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,460
discussing and building that excitement

00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:28,950
and momentum is really really valuable

00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:31,230
when you're building a community um so

00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:33,390
my question to you is how you can build

00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:35,040
excitement into your community whether

00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:37,020
that's a kickoff event whether that's

00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:39,750
sort of doing things that the people in

00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:41,370
your community value and that might vary

00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:43,770
so I found you know when I was teaching

00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:45,540
workshops that people find like really

00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:47,430
cool visualizations and my workshops and

00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:49,500
seeing those exciting and maybe not as

00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:50,190
exciting some of the data structures

00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,560
behind it

00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:54,150
however um based on the first talk of

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,560
this morning that's exciting to some

00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:57,840
people thinking about metadata and

00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,820
schemas like that is exciting to many

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,090
people and you might know that as you're

00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:04,290
someone who's excited right so um so in

00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:05,610
my experience like some of my

00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:07,290
researchers are definitely more excited

00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,450
about the visualization than they are

00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:10,170
the data but knowing your community is a

00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:12,270
big part of that

00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:13,710
similarly maybe it's exciting to have a

00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:15,840
bunch of people in the room and maybe

00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:16,380
it's not so exciting to install our in

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,080
your free time

00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:20,250
however you know maybe documentation is

00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,730
exciting to you and that's something

00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:25,080
that you should keep in mind as well so

00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:26,790
knowing that need in your community I

00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,230
think is something that brings me to my

00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:31,710
next point which is empathy

00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:33,540
basically what is empathy knowing sort

00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:34,890
of what your problems like what the

00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:37,710
problems are of the people in your

00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:39,330
community and how you might understand

00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:42,270
like their frustrations their needs and

00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:44,070
things like that um I think this is

00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:47,370
especially valuable if you have been

00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:49,470
there yourself and so early days of me

00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:52,020
doing data analysis this graph

00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:52,840
frustration and timee I would get

00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,370
extremely

00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,980
streeted in a very short amount of time

00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:59,020
and I still remember you know like not

00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,700
being able to like do anything with my

00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,990
data not being able to figure out you

00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,810
know how to make this visualization but

00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:06,820
I really wanted to um and in my mind you

00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,920
know when when would I ever get to this

00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:11,860
point where I was like doing things and

00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:13,390
not getting frustrated right um one tool

00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:15,820
that really helps me in my early days

00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:17,230
was this resource curls are for data

00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,120
science I think it's an awesome book

00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:21,310
it's a really good place to start if

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,460
you're learning are specifically for

00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:26,470
data analysis for the first time and I

00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:29,290
think the reason one reason that it is

00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:31,780
so good is because the people who wrote

00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:34,750
it had empathy for the problems that

00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:37,510
people like me researchers people had

00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:39,400
who had to analyze data were tackling

00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:42,520
and the reason for that is actually

00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:44,410
really interesting I read an interview

00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:47,290
of Hadley Wickham who's the guy who

00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:52,110
co-wrote this book and also played a big

00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:56,530
role and ggplot2 and other our tools and

00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:59,320
actually what he says is during his I

00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:00,850
think PhD days he got a consulting

00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,500
position where I helped students from

00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:05,410
other departments to do statistical

00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:08,110
analysis this gave me a steady stream of

00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:10,660
people with statistics problems and so

00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:12,760
he was seeing people come in with issues

00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:14,200
reshaping their data issues you know

00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:17,140
visualizing in the way that they wanted

00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:19,330
to these word problems that he saw over

00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:21,040
and over and over again as a statistical

00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:24,160
consultant and so he decided to write

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,050
software to basically fill those gaps

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,120
and to think about you know how can we

00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:29,290
make this better you don't have to go

00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,840
out there and write open-source software

00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:33,790
and you know put it out to the world you

00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,250
can if that's what you're great at but I

00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:38,260
think a key lesson for this is how can

00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:41,260
you develop empathy with your community

00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:43,210
within your community and one way to do

00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:45,730
that of course is hearing people's

00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:47,410
problems so this ties into some of the

00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:49,870
work that I've done at the University of

00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:51,040
Chicago um I teach these weekly

00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:54,100
workshops maybe done it for two years

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,530
about spatial analysis specifically for

00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,780
social scientists so we're like mapping

00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,950
things we're doing spatial analysis

00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:03,010
trying to figure out filling and

00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:04,600
polygons things um and so on the left is

00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:07,029
me just like delivering my workshop

00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,949
happy about my material and then on the

00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:10,540
right is the real reality of what

00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:12,940
happens next after I deliver that

00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:14,649
workshop it is sitting down trying to

00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:17,500
figure out why exactly the spatial

00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:19,449
package quote install you know figuring

00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:22,870
out this like very convoluted system

00:11:19,449 --> 00:11:24,130
that you know people have for a spatial

00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:25,870
data and like trying to work through

00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:27,790
that and I think that really really

00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:30,069
helped with my empathy for thinking

00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:31,269
through some of these cases um you may

00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:32,860
not be in a position where you can do

00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:33,850
that where you can you know teach

00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,130
something and then immediately get

00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:39,250
feedback from people for what their

00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:41,769
issues are but I think what is important

00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:43,540
is asking at least people in your

00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:44,949
community what are the stakeholders what

00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:47,290
do they care about what are their big

00:11:44,949 --> 00:11:49,089
problems what are things that they have

00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,680
issues with you know what data problems

00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:52,000
are they facing that could be tackled in

00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,910
a short amount of time that might have

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,579
big impact and having that empathy I

00:11:54,910 --> 00:12:01,029
think is a starting point for really

00:11:57,579 --> 00:12:03,579
strong theatre communities my final

00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:05,440
point is thinking about as we build

00:12:03,579 --> 00:12:07,810
empathy it's important that people feel

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,639
comfortable asking questions of you and

00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:12,970
bringing their problems to you which

00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:14,709
brings me to kindness um this is the

00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:17,319
last point but I think it is the most

00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:19,060
important one and I think every

00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:22,000
community that you are part of should be

00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:23,769
a kind one specifically for newcomers

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,709
but also to people who've been there for

00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:28,449
a long time I but this idea sort of from

00:12:26,709 --> 00:12:30,130
teaching tucked together another amazing

00:12:28,449 --> 00:12:34,120
free resource highly recommend you check

00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:35,860
it out by Greg Olson and the first sort

00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,509
of page I guess like the first web page

00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:40,810
that you see in there has a list of ten

00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:43,149
rules and the first rule is be kind all

00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:46,180
else's details I think this is a really

00:12:43,149 --> 00:12:47,579
really good place to start so if you are

00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:51,430
starting from a place of kindness

00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:54,639
empathy with your community's problems

00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:56,620
and understanding I think you you know

00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,410
the rest you can figure out how to like

00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:02,410
run an event or you can figure out how

00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:04,350
to you know lead specific people through

00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:06,399
the you know package development process

00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:09,069
but you're gonna start with this like

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,720
foundation of kindness um so my question

00:13:09,069 --> 00:13:14,079
is how can you prioritize kindness as a

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,579
key value in your community and I want

00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:18,370
you to leave you with that and sort of

00:13:15,579 --> 00:13:20,740
thinking about that um some sort of

00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:22,720
the cuff ideas you know make sure you

00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:25,180
don't tolerate unkindness in your

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,370
community make sure that that's not

00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:29,110
accepted right and that might be through

00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:31,900
a code of conduct which the CSV comp

00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:33,610
organizers have so read it like done a

00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:36,279
great job with and introduced that and

00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:38,290
set that as the norm but it also starts

00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:41,290
with you being kind to others and you

00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:42,430
being kind to yourself so I'm gonna talk

00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:45,040
about this because I think this is often

00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:47,350
overlooked in data community discussions

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,450
self-care and self kindness you're going

00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:51,640
to be doing amazing work you have the

00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:55,240
right to stop take a break or leave when

00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:57,130
you need to and this is this is coming

00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,290
from places where I've seen people

00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:02,279
working in communities for a long long

00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:05,170
long time and they get burnt out and

00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:06,640
what happens is that because they

00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:07,930
haven't been kind to themselves it's

00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,490
really hard for them to be kind to

00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,950
others and you start seeing people get

00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:13,240
crispy and like sort of being harsh to

00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,890
newcomers and things like that

00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,360
so it's really really important that you

00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:19,300
are kind to yourself and what you could

00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:22,450
do as you build these communities from

00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:23,890
the flip side of that I think the flip

00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:25,930
side of being kind to yourself and

00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:27,760
stepping back a bit is that you have the

00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:29,950
privilege to bring others along so that

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,380
they can grow maybe you stepping back

00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:34,779
means that yes you are less involved but

00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:37,150
it also means that you can bring up a

00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:38,529
new generation and mentor people in your

00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:40,810
data community I think this is

00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:43,300
especially valuable when you have helped

00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:45,820
someone come a long way you know maybe

00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,740
they're now doing reproducible things

00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:49,180
now they're like opening their data and

00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:51,520
they're really excited about all that

00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:54,550
they are the perfect person to become

00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:57,040
the next leader of your community and to

00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:59,890
grow and to grow that community so just

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:02,080
a few thoughts there so my three

00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:04,510
takeaways excitement empathy and

00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:06,550
kindness and I think when you have all

00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:08,680
of these things they lead to something

00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:10,990
which is exciting and to be in all your

00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:13,060
communities which is belonging and I

00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:14,890
think every community day and part of I

00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:16,870
feel like I deeply and truly belong

00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:19,000
there and it's been amazing it's like

00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:20,920
totally like change my work it's it's

00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,010
really helped me meet others doing

00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:26,080
similar things and finding other

00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:28,040
community builders is also a good part

00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,720
of this so

00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,160
I guess maybe not the final question but

00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,350
how can you stay focused and belonging

00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:35,840
your community I think it should come up

00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:38,360
naturally if you focus on the other

00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,940
three things so I'm just a few thoughts

00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,960
there and one term that I found really

00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:45,530
useful in terms of thinking about

00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:46,970
belonging is communities of practice so

00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:49,160
I would just Google search this term

00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:52,310
this book is also helpful if I don't

00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:54,260
think it's free but I learned about

00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:56,270
communities of practice from talking to

00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:58,190
Ted ladarius who's an amazing educator

00:15:56,270 --> 00:16:00,560
at Oregon Health and Science I think

00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:03,170
University and he basically said to me

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,700
in a private discussion I think the key

00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:06,980
to educational sustainability is to

00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:08,570
build a community of practice I'm gonna

00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:10,130
leave you with that term to think about

00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:11,600
as you go forward as well and to you

00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:13,430
know google and find all these things

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,320
about but I think that's a really good

00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:17,870
way to frame it and people doing similar

00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:21,310
things in similar areas working together

00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:24,290
to a to increase their knowledge and

00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:25,730
understanding um so keep on building

00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:27,640
community keep on getting feedback and

00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:31,070
keep working to make things better and

00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:34,400
you can find me on Twitter and you can

00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:38,870
find my website and I'm on very very

00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:42,290
very many slacks I'll be on the CSV 5qa

00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:44,540
I'm on the our ladies one um there's an

00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:46,340
another one for scientific community

00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:48,500
builders that I'm on called I think the

00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:50,630
Center for scientific community or

00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:53,090
something and communications and

00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:54,350
engagement and that's good and if you're

00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:56,240
interested I'm gonna put a plug in here

00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:59,440
and joining another virtual conference

00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:04,100
we're running a conference on May 30th

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:05,959
for users in the Chicago land area so

00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:10,310
feel free to join me there and thank you

00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:11,120
so much thank you so much Angela that

00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:15,170
was fantastic

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:16,760
I heard so much and and hope to help

00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:18,470
build my communities as well we have

00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:22,579
time for a few questions are you okay to

00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:24,589
answer a few of them yeah awesome so

00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:26,600
what so several people in the chat have

00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:28,310
asked do you have suggestions for

00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,840
pitching to your employer to get this

00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:32,090
kind of work added to your job

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,060
description it is hard to get approval

00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:36,770
for a dedicated time to train people

00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:38,660
yeah I feel like I am not the perfect

00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:41,750
person to answer questions about this

00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:44,240
because my employers have always been so

00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:45,950
I think they've seen the value of having

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,779
a community or I think they were the

00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:49,070
people who are like maybe we should do

00:17:47,779 --> 00:17:51,860
some workshops because people are

00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:53,990
struggling and I think one thing that

00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:57,169
I've heard from others is that sort of

00:17:53,990 --> 00:18:01,309
some quick wins and showing what you

00:17:57,169 --> 00:18:03,169
could do with this like community is so

00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:04,640
basically like like thinking about I

00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:07,130
think someone told me that they wrote a

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,380
package that you know helps automate

00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:10,940
like 20 percent of the work that someone

00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,980
was doing and then it turned out that

00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:16,940
the company wanted the rest of the team

00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:18,559
to use that package so thinking about

00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:20,750
you know how can you show that you're

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:23,330
making impact and then how can you make

00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:25,580
the case that that impact will be scaled

00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:27,950
if you have more people or like you're

00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:29,630
you're you know I think like having

00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:31,429
something that is like hey like I'm

00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:32,750
doing this and like this will make us

00:18:31,429 --> 00:18:36,049
more efficient you know this will make

00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:37,940
us you know 20 times more productive or

00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:41,990
something like that I'm not the perfect

00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:45,080
person to talk about this all right

00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:46,940
another question is how do we how do we

00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:50,630
generate excitement in the absence of an

00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:52,130
initial in person Meetup yeah that's

00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,860
hard I feel like that's something that

00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:57,770
we're all thinking about sort of virtual

00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:59,570
meetings and things and I can't say that

00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:01,940
I figured out the right way to do it and

00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:03,799
I do think like getting everyone into

00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:05,240
the room in some way is important

00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:08,720
because like you get sparks between

00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:10,870
people like people are talking and like

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,679
whether that's a video meeting or

00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:14,270
thinking about some sort of online

00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:15,679
launch there have been a lot of people

00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:18,110
who've been doing work on this lately

00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:21,860
and I think people in the chat might

00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:23,750
have ideas but but I think like getting

00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:29,720
some face time and not having it totally

00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:30,380
be asynchronous is important um let's

00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:37,190
see here

00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:41,899
questions I'm erased coming I'm a soul

00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:43,909
of the negotiation tactic nope we did

00:19:41,899 --> 00:19:45,470
various that one I think we did clearly

00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:46,170
I'll never get this apologies everybody

00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:49,630
I'm learning I'm learning

00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:52,929
[Laughter]

00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:52,929
[Music]

00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:59,000
everyone's called me think about your

00:19:55,160 --> 00:20:03,830
energy that's fantastic yes yes empathy

00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:06,110
and excitement is very contagious let's

00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:07,460
say here can you say more about kindness

00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,780
and community building it's not

00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:10,370
something you can force a man of a code

00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:12,110
of conduct and in global communities

00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:14,020
with very broad set of cultures

00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:15,650
represented kindness everything

00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:19,040
especially online can look very

00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:21,320
different yeah I think like this is

00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:24,700
something that I think starts from you

00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:27,350
as the community like as someone who is

00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:29,810
managing that community so for me a big

00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:31,730
part of is gratitude so when someone

00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:33,860
does something amazing I say thank you

00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:35,540
like that was awesome and I believe it

00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:38,270
I'm like oh my gosh like this person

00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:39,860
like started you know um with one

00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:41,660
question like one month ago and now

00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:43,820
they're leaving a workshop and I think

00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:45,800
like being grateful for what people put

00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:48,080
in and and acknowledging that is a big

00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:50,060
part of it for me so that's been a tool

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,900
that I've used in terms of you know we

00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:52,850
ran a meet-up

00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:54,290
like I think every single person I like

00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:55,970
tell them what they did like that I

00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:58,520
really appreciate it um that's a big

00:20:55,970 --> 00:21:00,140
part of like the kindness and I think

00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:02,240
this other point about cultural

00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:04,700
differences is also important to take

00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,230
into consideration I've worked across

00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,730
cultures I think specifically with the

00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:11,120
carbon trees and they're just different

00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:13,040
norms for how people interact and just

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,990
being aware of those norms and laying

00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:18,620
them out in the open is is really good

00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:20,330
for example um I think like I'm trying

00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,800
to think of something like maybe

00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:23,810
Americans are a little bit more blunt

00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,820
with their feedback it's a way that like

00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:27,860
East Asian cultures and as someone who

00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:30,710
identifies with both you know thinking

00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:35,230
about sort of the distinction there is

00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:40,730
important and yeah so two ideas on that

00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:42,950
awesome and the question is how how do

00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:45,010
you step back how to step back when you

00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:46,220
are ready you have any advice on that

00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:47,480
yeah

00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,620
stepping back I think this is something

00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:54,430
that I've been working through myself

00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:56,750
recently and I think a big part of it is

00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:58,610
trusting other people you know like I

00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,960
think there's part of me that's like oh

00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:02,240
I could do this like really efficiently

00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:06,200
and really well I know what to do but

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:08,570
keeping in mind that you being the

00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:11,330
sometimes is preventing other people

00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:13,640
from having a chance to grow so so

00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:15,620
thinking about how you can coach and

00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:19,220
lead people to a way where they can

00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:20,750
become big players and and and important

00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:22,730
important contributors in your community

00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,930
and it's something that I've had trouble

00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:25,550
with you know like figure out what to

00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:27,680
delegate and you know like stepping back

00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:30,410
entirely and trusting that my team will

00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:32,660
take it on and I think for those of us

00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:35,420
who are really good at putting together

00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:36,650
communities it's something that we don't

00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:38,480
want to step back you know if you want

00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:40,070
to keep working on it but for me

00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,360
sometimes it's like another thing has

00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:43,010
come up and I realize there's just no

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,490
way I could do like everything at once

00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:48,530
so um I have to you know move back and

00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:50,960
off-board myself and and like on the

00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:52,640
flip side like people get to learn new

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,520
things and they get to become leaders

00:22:52,640 --> 00:23:01,210
and it becomes their project which is

00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:01,210
