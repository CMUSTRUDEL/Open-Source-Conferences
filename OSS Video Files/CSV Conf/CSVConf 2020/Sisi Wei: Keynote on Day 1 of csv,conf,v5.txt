00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:39,770
right so as you all know by now I'm Cece

00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:43,110
I thought I would actually start with a

00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:46,530
unrelated share just because we're in

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,939
this kind of crazy time and that one of

00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,369
the things I've been doing a lot lately

00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:52,229
is spending a lot of time doing art sort

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:57,750
of as my therapy as a way of getting

00:01:52,229 --> 00:02:00,750
through this and so I wanted here and I

00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:02,969
also wanted to say that this is my first

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:05,070
CSV comp I've been wanting to come for

00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:06,810
many years I was really excited that I

00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:09,360
would actually be able to come this year

00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,830
and I'm even more thrilled that the

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,220
organizers were able to put this online

00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:15,350
and to bring us all together and

00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:18,860
way and I actually wanted to ask all of

00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:21,230
you if you would show the organizer some

00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:23,510
love by putting some emojis in the chat

00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:25,640
right now because they've done such an

00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,320
awesome job transporting the physical

00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,360
conference into a digital one and

00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,970
supporting the speakers many of whom

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:35,480
like myself have never presented in this

00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:38,240
literal environment before so thank you

00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:41,360
to the organizers and thank you for

00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,920
folks for putting things in the chat and

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,660
then you know the other thing is I

00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:47,480
wanted to sort of thank all of you for

00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:49,640
being here because it is a hard time to

00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:52,190
focus right now and that's a lot of the

00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,170
work that open news has been doing which

00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:55,370
I'll talk a little bit about later but

00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:59,150
just help me people get through this

00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:01,190
time and I know attending a talk when

00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:03,380
there isn't a craziness happening in the

00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:06,470
world right now is very different than

00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:08,090
attending a talk at a time in which many

00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:10,970
people are second home or worried about

00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:13,670
loved ones so thank you for being here

00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:16,010
I've really enjoyed the morning session

00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:18,320
so far and I kind of feel like I like

00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:20,510
discovered similar of my people just

00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,310
hearing like Angela talking about

00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:24,170
building data communities which is

00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:26,750
really close to my hearts and then the

00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:28,550
multiple talks on open data how to grow

00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:31,070
how to support each other through an

00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:33,230
inclusive research and coding culture

00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:36,560
that stuff is really exciting to me

00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:39,440
right now and that's also because most

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,650
of my life in my career and journalism

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,540
this is sort of my path I think this is

00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:46,700
the right direction so I was a

00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:49,489
journalist first I came out of college

00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:52,010
wanting to do journalism but I didn't

00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:53,600
have any idea of actually how

00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:55,940
transformative it would be for me

00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:58,459
because I ended up also falling in love

00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:59,959
with coding and with data and I wanted

00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:03,410
to merge all of those things together to

00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:05,360
tell stories in a different way and then

00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:08,750
over the last couple of years I spent

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,190
some time as an editor so that in

00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:12,709
journalism means that you are both

00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:15,560
literally helping people write better

00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:18,229
words and tell their stories and make

00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,720
them sort of the best help them do the

00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:22,490
best work they could possibly do but

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,140
then on the other hand also trying to be

00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,970
a good manager and trying to figure out

00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,710
what does that me and how can I be there

00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:29,900
for people

00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:33,319
and then a common thread throughout all

00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:35,569
of my work is sort of a real close to my

00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:37,819
heart part of it is about diversity and

00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:41,659
equity and inclusion everywhere to work

00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:45,199
and how important that is to me and

00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:46,849
especially now during kovat 19 and so

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,099
we'll be talking about that a lot later

00:04:46,849 --> 00:04:52,879
on and how that is interval event with

00:04:49,099 --> 00:04:54,650
hiring and this is also also ultimately

00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:57,110
a talk about something I wanted to look

00:04:54,650 --> 00:05:00,020
more deeply into for a long time I've

00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:01,699
been there in the journalism and data

00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:04,009
journals and communities feeling this

00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:05,479
change feeling that with these skills

00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:08,389
and an increased number of people

00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:11,330
working in journalism with these skills

00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:14,180
that there isn't change and so now I'm

00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:15,830
hoping to both with this talk and with a

00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,599
good amount of work in the next couple

00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:22,819
of weeks and months to really dig into

00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:24,440
it all right so two places I wanted to

00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:25,159
highlight really quick so you understand

00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,319
my background

00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:29,810
ProPublica for those of you who don't

00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:32,870
know it is an investigative nonprofit

00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:35,569
newsroom when I started there eight

00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:37,849
years ago it was about 30 people when I

00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:41,210
left this January I think it was almost

00:05:37,849 --> 00:05:44,599
if not already 200 people total so it's

00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:48,650
been an insane ride really amazing for

00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:50,089
me and it has really sort of been a

00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:51,860
place that has given me almost three

00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:53,870
different types of jobs and the ability

00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:56,330
to learn both how to do the data

00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:58,550
journalism work how to manage your team

00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:01,669
that does that work and then how to both

00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:05,569
communicate collaborate and make it sort

00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:08,930
of a seamless part of the entire body of

00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:12,020
work that is journalism and then this

00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:14,270
February I started open news which for

00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:16,969
those of you don't know is a community

00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:19,330
driven community support organization

00:06:16,969 --> 00:06:20,930
that tries to marry journalists and

00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:23,839
technologists who are doing this work

00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:26,960
together and so this is some language

00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:29,060
that we've been working on recently just

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,190
about like what what is at the heart of

00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:33,500
open news right now and I think this

00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:35,959
really puts it pretty well which is that

00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:39,500
we're here currently to support a

00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:41,020
movement in journalism and people are

00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,520
doing this we want to

00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:44,470
you there for them and we want to help

00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,120
catalyze their work and it's all

00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:48,789
centered around newsrooms being

00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:51,039
equitable inclusive and collaborative

00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:53,139
which was really key and then also the

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,360
communities that are involved that

00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:59,590
journalism is trying to serve that they

00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:02,139
can once again really trust journalism

00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:05,560
to have their backs and to represent

00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:06,940
them so that's sort of the core values

00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,669
we've been talking a lot about values

00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:14,770
today of what open news is really here

00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:16,509
for and and I see a lot of love in the

00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:19,030
chat for these organizations thank you

00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:22,389
and so this is our community here

00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:23,919
journalist slash technologists and even

00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:25,930
at the beginning of the talk I was

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,750
talking about how data has changed

00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:31,090
everything right data I use it almost as

00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:33,610
a shorthand because when I talk about

00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:35,650
how it's changed journalism in this

00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:38,020
journalism / technology community it

00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:42,699
means so many different interconnected

00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:44,259
things so as an example I started my

00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:46,000
career as a graphics editor at The

00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:48,880
Washington Post the skills that I use

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,580
there were front-end development design

00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:54,250
and my journalism skills and so I made

00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:57,069
graphics I did data visualization

00:07:54,250 --> 00:08:00,130
whether it was on the Olympics or the

00:07:57,069 --> 00:08:03,610
election but then I also wanted to do

00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:05,710
some data analysis right data collection

00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:07,690
and I wanted to do some backend database

00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:10,779
program I kind of had an interest in

00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:11,740
almost everything full stack and so when

00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:14,710
I went to Pro Publica

00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:17,319
I was called a news apps developer right

00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:18,819
and all these titles when you're really

00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:22,029
in the community you know what they all

00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:25,449
mean but on a generic level it's just

00:08:22,029 --> 00:08:28,090
this journalism / technology a type of

00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:30,719
job and as a news apps developer I did

00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:33,909
everything from beginning to end and

00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:36,550
that included right collecting the data

00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:38,260
cleaning the data trying to find some

00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:41,890
insight that I would then go do some

00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:44,260
journalism on by interviewing people and

00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:46,899
then if it turns out it's like a wealth

00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:48,760
of data that people would love to sit

00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:50,380
through then you build the backend

00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,959
database then you design the front-end

00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:54,140
UX for all the people who are gonna sit

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,420
through it I don't know any

00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:58,940
about the data already and then writing

00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:02,420
your story and that was like a ton of

00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:03,470
stuff and so we also frequently work and

00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,240
collaborate with other people in the

00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:07,670
newsroom so that you are not the only

00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,459
one doing literally everything though I

00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:11,720
did that a couple times and I loved it

00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:15,440
but I'm also very happy that I'm not

00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:17,029
doing everything anymore so that's sort

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,100
of an example there's a lot of different

00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:20,899
titles but we're just looking at people

00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,320
who are working in journalism

00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:25,610
they've got data design coding skills

00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:30,589
and they're trying to do their

00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:33,370
journalism that way ok so then this is

00:09:30,589 --> 00:09:35,870
something that we say a lot at open news

00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:39,290
that journalists and technologists are

00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:42,440
uniquely positioned to change journalism

00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:45,079
it's a field right that is already great

00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,940
at digging for stories and at writing

00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:48,920
really compelling narratives to tell

00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:51,320
those stories so then the question is

00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:53,209
what happens and now we have over 10

00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:56,390
years to look at what happens when you

00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:58,670
build into journalism the skills and the

00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:01,040
tools that are available from the data

00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:03,890
community the tech community and the

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:06,110
open source community so here's I'm

00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:08,870
going to show you three changes so

00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:12,820
here's change number one better

00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:17,300
journalism and this is probably the most

00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:20,720
well trodden space in terms of how does

00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:23,329
data and technology improve journalism

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,070
itself I could spend our entire hour

00:10:23,329 --> 00:10:27,440
together in this section I'm only going

00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:29,630
to give you one walkthrough of an

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,430
example but if you want to know more

00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:33,500
about this I can share loads of

00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:35,420
resources that you can read about almost

00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,980
any specific project or a group of

00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:41,029
projects so please let me know if that's

00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:42,769
interesting and the one thing that I'll

00:10:41,029 --> 00:10:44,540
share for folks obviously many of you

00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:47,660
who are not following along and what

00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:49,910
journalism communities are doing is that

00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,260
something that's always wrong true in

00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:53,480
the data journalism community this is

00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:56,660
more than 10 years ago right is that if

00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,670
you can marry your data skills and then

00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:01,880
oftentimes your technology skills in

00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:04,880
order to use your data skills with your

00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:07,250
journalism there are many cases in which

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,920
you will no longer need to take all your

00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,889
expert

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:13,350
at their word because they should be

00:11:10,889 --> 00:11:15,990
able to show you and have you be able to

00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:17,160
reproduce the data itself and show you

00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:19,019
essentially the proof in the pudding

00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,630
right so that's what it really enables

00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:24,959
journalists to do to take these critical

00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:28,500
views of what's going on and demand to

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:30,180
see the proof as opposed to have to deal

00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:33,839
with just a statement which we do in

00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:36,930
many areas of journalism still okay so

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:40,920
here's my better journalism example this

00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:44,310
is a piece that I edited last year by

00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:48,149
three very talented journalists and was

00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:50,910
a larger collaboration with pro públicas

00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:52,470
local reporting network basically Pro

00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:54,329
Publica has this program where they want

00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:56,940
to help local journalists do

00:11:54,329 --> 00:11:58,560
hard-hitting investigative work but they

00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:01,860
don't want to parachute in so what they

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,389
do is they pay for the salary of a staff

00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:05,880
person who is already at the

00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:08,190
organization so that the local newsroom

00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:11,040
can backfill and have someone do sort of

00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:12,420
the demands of the day-to-day job so

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,000
that somebody on their staff can

00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:17,130
actually focus on doing an investigation

00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,060
and an investigative series for a whole

00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:24,029
year and so this is one piece in a much

00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:26,220
larger package in which Pro Publica

00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:30,110
partnered with the Advocate and the

00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:33,029
times-picayune in New Orleans to look at

00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:35,070
this part of Louisiana that is so

00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:38,880
notorious for being polluted that people

00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:40,410
just call it cancer alley and once I

00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,190
sort of knew that for this story I

00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:45,480
started seeing it everywhere like in

00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:47,820
novels that I was reading even in

00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:50,130
fiction I don't even remember what it

00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,660
was but it was like two days after I was

00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:53,190
editing this story I was reading this

00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,870
book and they were like oh yeah I'm in

00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:56,220
our truck driving through cancer le and

00:12:54,870 --> 00:13:00,120
I was like wow okay this is really

00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:01,709
welcome and so then the problem right as

00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,139
journalists that we're looking at is why

00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:06,350
are more chemical plants still being

00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:08,279
approved to be built in this area

00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:09,839
questions that we want to know answers

00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:12,000
to are what's going on

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,589
how much pollutants are in the air what

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,910
is the difference these new plants are

00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:19,230
gonna make how do they get approved okay

00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:21,360
so

00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:24,529
in addition to some great on-the-ground

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:30,180
reporting to journalist Leila Young's

00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:33,240
and Al Shah both were on the news apps

00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:35,730
team at ProPublica and they both worked

00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:38,520
hand in hand with an expert researcher

00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:40,950
and they were looking at an EPA data

00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:44,040
model that estimates the concentration

00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:45,870
of chemical pollutants in the air that

00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,690
are specifically coming from these

00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:51,029
chemical plants in the area so in the

00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:54,740
map that you see right now the red

00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:56,550
gradation is the level of air toxicity

00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:59,250
specifically from cancer-causing

00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:01,740
chemicals that are being emitted the

00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:03,480
really tiny grey dots those are just the

00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:07,110
plants that I already built there's over

00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,910
200 of them the purple dots are the new

00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:11,130
plants that are already approved and

00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:12,980
will be built and the orange ones are

00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:15,420
the ones that are still pending approval

00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:18,029
at the time that we did this piece and

00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:20,220
we had a source tell us that there are

00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:22,290
no permits that are pending approval

00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:24,690
that have that to their recollection

00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:25,830
have ever been rejected so we can pretty

00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:29,040
much assume that they're going to get

00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:30,990
built okay so I'm going to share with

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,870
you sort of two things that are part of

00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:38,520
this massive project that we learned one

00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:41,339
example is in this specific area of the

00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:42,930
cancer alley section I'm going to

00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:44,670
explain what the colors mean because you

00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:45,630
don't have the benefit of going through

00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:49,320
the whole walkthrough of the

00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:53,550
presentation the blue gradient on land

00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:56,040
that shows how predominantly black the

00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:58,320
residents are in a given district right

00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:00,690
so you can see in the lower left that

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,279
area is predominantly black and then

00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:05,070
there's this little slice over on the

00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:07,350
right this little shape that is not only

00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:12,209
not predominantly black it is also

00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:15,810
predominantly white okay so I wonder if

00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:17,790
I can actually move my mouse can you

00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:21,089
yeah you can see my mouse so this area

00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:22,500
right here what you already know when

00:15:21,089 --> 00:15:24,990
you get to this part of the story is

00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:27,630
that a new plant is moving in and that

00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:29,070
plant is going to double the the toxic

00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:32,370
air emissions in this and

00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:37,680
our area and what we found looking at

00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:42,180
this right is that every single one of

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:44,009
these shapes all represent plants that

00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:45,240
have been approved and will be moving in

00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:47,370
right and they're all going to be

00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:52,350
admitting chemicals but you don't see

00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:54,569
any right here so we looked into it and

00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:57,240
what we basically found out is that

00:15:54,569 --> 00:15:59,759
there's actually these two plant

00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,889
complexes that originally wanted to move

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,540
in one inside of the predominantly white

00:16:01,889 --> 00:16:05,610
district and one across the river from

00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:07,259
it and the District Council those were

00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:09,240
the only two plants that they borrowed

00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:10,949
from actually building and you kind of

00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:14,819
see the quote that we got from a council

00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:16,709
member on the slide but that was sort of

00:16:14,819 --> 00:16:18,209
something that really I don't want to

00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:20,009
say shocked us but we didn't know that

00:16:18,209 --> 00:16:22,290
it would be this crystal clear of a

00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:24,329
difference given how many on the

00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:26,459
previous slide you can see different

00:16:24,329 --> 00:16:31,529
plants are moving in all over and around

00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:33,089
the river so that's one example the

00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:35,459
second example though and this is

00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:37,079
another aspect of being able to bring

00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:39,480
your data scales in right is that as

00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:41,370
Lela and I'll dig further they actually

00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,790
realized that the local regulatory

00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:46,589
agency has a really interesting way of

00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:49,910
regulating their chemical emissions they

00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:52,589
only regulate whether the level of each

00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:54,990
individual pollutant separate from the

00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:57,500
other ones they make sure that those

00:16:54,990 --> 00:17:00,149
levels do not violate state law

00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,709
individually so they don't look at the

00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:03,569
cumulative risk of multiple

00:17:01,709 --> 00:17:06,870
cancer-causing chemicals being emitted

00:17:03,569 --> 00:17:09,000
from the same place and so Entergy you

00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:11,549
can see on the map where that is

00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,159
supposed to be built and these are their

00:17:11,549 --> 00:17:16,500
projections for the levels of air

00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:18,329
toxicity given each of their

00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,730
cancer-causing chemicals so this is just

00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:23,490
looking at one at a time which is what

00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:25,350
the regulated the regulators would be

00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:28,409
looking at when they're trying to decide

00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:31,049
is this an acceptable level but then we

00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:32,940
were also able to on top of that show

00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:34,679
you okay but there's also a second

00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:37,590
chemical that is also cancer-causing

00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:40,409
this is what the cumulative air toxicity

00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:42,570
looks like and then finally obviously

00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:45,450
this is not the first and all

00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:48,059
any plant that exists in this area this

00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:49,950
is what actual actual cumulative air

00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:51,960
toxicity looks like if you consider

00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:54,200
emissions from every other plant that's

00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,100
already there and whether or not those

00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,710
chemicals are going to travel to this

00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:02,399
area and so we also found that when

00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:04,289
toxicity reaches these levels it's done

00:18:02,399 --> 00:18:06,029
so in other states as well like it did

00:18:04,289 --> 00:18:08,549
in Illinois and the Illinois EPA

00:18:06,029 --> 00:18:10,740
actually shut the plants down but in

00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:15,330
this case in Louisiana it's totally

00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:16,710
legal totally okay and so just share

00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:19,019
something so it's not all depressing

00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:21,450
news after the investigation and there's

00:18:19,019 --> 00:18:22,919
still more follow-up now Louisiana did

00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:25,049
decide that they wanted to Commission a

00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:27,840
detailed study on cancer rates in the

00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:31,080
area there's also I feel like I've gone

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,120
over maybe 25% of the journalism in this

00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,100
project so if you want to know more

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:39,299
about it I highly encourage you to check

00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:40,889
it out okay so that's what I mean by

00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:42,299
better journalism right there's so many

00:18:40,889 --> 00:18:44,190
different aspects of what's going on

00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:47,190
there there's the visualization

00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:49,259
there's the understanding of how to be

00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:52,740
critical about data processes and then

00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:55,340
third the use of data itself so that's

00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:58,370
change number one better journalism

00:18:55,340 --> 00:19:01,799
here's change number two so this is

00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:04,320
collaboration on an entirely new level

00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:06,990
and especially as we talk about the open

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,779
source community and the tech community

00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:12,210
even earlier the our community and how

00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:14,129
everyone is really collaborative in

00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:16,259
terms of helping each other this is

00:19:14,129 --> 00:19:20,220
something that has grown I think

00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:23,429
exponentially in journalism so here is a

00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:25,860
really easy example so this is the

00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:27,929
website source it's one that we publish

00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:29,909
at open news the whole point of source

00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:32,159
is essentially to share knowledge and we

00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:34,110
publish articles that help journalists

00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:36,120
help each other this was something that

00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:38,639
was published I think last week May 8th

00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:41,669
was last week I think and it's a story

00:19:38,639 --> 00:19:44,279
recipe basically as local journalists

00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:45,570
are doing their own stories or national

00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:47,909
journalists are doing their own stories

00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:51,600
they collect all this data they analyze

00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:54,750
it and they can only do so many stories

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,400
out of that data set when journalists

00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:58,230
all over the country would be

00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,270
able to use this slice of it or this

00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:02,850
slice of it to specifically tackle a

00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:05,670
story about their community and so we

00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:07,800
invite them and we pay them to write a

00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:09,900
story that walks you through exactly how

00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:12,300
to do it and then tells you how to

00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,890
customize it for your area how to

00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:16,650
analyze the data and then what questions

00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:18,810
to ask and to show you the fun example

00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:20,480
as well in this one there's literally

00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:22,770
the are code that you can copy and

00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,980
commented through how it all works and

00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:28,680
then we also do this the same thing the

00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:29,820
article has Google sheets instructions

00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:34,590
so that if you don't know how to use our

00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:38,670
you can still figure it out with us and

00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:39,930
so this is something that is a quote I

00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:42,390
don't know who to attrib it to you

00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:44,820
attribute it to but I know is said in

00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:46,770
the community a lot which is you know

00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:48,750
journalism is a competitive place right

00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:50,460
people are trying to break news first

00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:53,070
they're trying to get their news

00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:55,320
organization or themselves recognition

00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:57,060
as the experts on something but when

00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:59,460
there's so many stories to cover what we

00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:02,520
can obviously do is collaborate on the

00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:04,970
tech compete on the stories help each

00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:07,740
other do our journalism better and just

00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:09,180
compete when it comes to figuring out

00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,330
what's actually going on in our

00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:16,070
communities and making sure that we are

00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:19,740
reporting on it respectfully accurately

00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:22,860
so source is definitely not the only

00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:25,290
place doing this these are four of the H

00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:28,230
story recipes that we have published

00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:30,270
recently just on kovat but other

00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:31,560
organizations for example where I used

00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:34,140
to work for pública they call them

00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:36,300
reporting recipes every time we came out

00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:38,880
with a huge news app even we would walk

00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:41,460
reporters through how to use it how do

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:44,340
you use it to report on your local area

00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:46,440
and so it's something that more and more

00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:48,600
journalists are doing and especially

00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,430
when you have data as that kernel as

00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,200
your kickoff point because I can't write

00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:56,670
a story about every row of data it's

00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:58,710
just not humanly possible but journals

00:21:56,670 --> 00:22:02,550
across the country could write a lot

00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:04,220
more stories collectively and then I

00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:06,090
wanted to highlight a couple of other

00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:08,100
projects as well that really show

00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:09,660
collaboration on a different level not

00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,559
just teaching each other how to write

00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:13,769
stories but

00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:17,179
coming together to do big projects so

00:22:13,769 --> 00:22:20,700
this is the Cova tracking project it was

00:22:17,179 --> 00:22:22,259
I even hesitate to say incubated I feel

00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,149
like it was kicked off at the Atlantic

00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:26,879
and then more and more journalists

00:22:24,149 --> 00:22:28,350
started to volunteer their time to put

00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:32,249
this together so that there was at least

00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:34,190
one complete data source available and

00:22:32,249 --> 00:22:37,230
these people do it on a volunteer basis

00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:39,809
they work at all different parts of

00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:41,789
journalism and they provide this to

00:22:39,809 --> 00:22:42,899
other people for free data journalists

00:22:41,789 --> 00:22:46,889
or anyone else who wants this

00:22:42,899 --> 00:22:49,950
information another instance big local

00:22:46,889 --> 00:22:53,279
news is a organization run out of

00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:55,440
Stanford University and they are also

00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:57,389
all about sharing data so that

00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,450
journalists can use it they also made

00:22:57,389 --> 00:23:02,159
this fantastic case mapper so that local

00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:04,019
journalists if you don't have those

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,450
front-end skills or don't want to do it

00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:08,279
yourself you can embed this for your

00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:11,399
local area and just put it on your site

00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:12,840
which embedding graphics and making

00:23:11,399 --> 00:23:15,179
graphics so they're embeddable for local

00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,440
journalists is not a new concept it's

00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:18,539
something that's been going on for many

00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:21,330
years now and this is sort of the latest

00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:23,399
iteration of it and then also this

00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:24,749
newsroom guide to Cove in nineteen and I

00:23:23,399 --> 00:23:26,460
wanted to share this because this is

00:23:24,749 --> 00:23:29,909
also collaborative people working at

00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:32,129
different places but its focus right is

00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:33,720
not solely on data but also as you can

00:23:32,129 --> 00:23:34,320
see things like let's take care of

00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,299
ourselves

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:42,480
and how do we take care of one another

00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:44,340
which I really appreciate and then

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,460
finally so this is collaboration at a

00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:50,759
massive scale everything before is much

00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:53,039
smaller in comparison which is I wanted

00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:55,799
to highlight two rather famous examples

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:58,860
of major journals and collaborations the

00:23:55,799 --> 00:24:00,749
first one is the Panama papers so for

00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:03,480
folks who aren't familiar with this

00:24:00,749 --> 00:24:05,399
it started at IC I J which stands for

00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,740
the international consortium of

00:24:05,399 --> 00:24:11,340
investigative journalists they worked

00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:14,940
with over a hundred media partners they

00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:18,049
sifted through over 11 million leaked

00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:21,389
files and it was all about exposing

00:24:18,049 --> 00:24:24,059
offshore holdings of world political

00:24:21,389 --> 00:24:24,770
leaders of details of hidden financial

00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:26,840
deal

00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:29,480
drug traffickers billionaires

00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:32,179
celebrities it was probably I think the

00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:34,670
biggest leak of inside information in

00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:36,610
history and in order to parse this they

00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:39,980
couldn't do it by themselves

00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:42,080
and so I wanted to show this quote from

00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:45,050
their site which is just that they

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:47,030
indexed organized and analyzed 2.6

00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:48,980
terabytes of data that made up a week

00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:52,640
and that leak is like not just data

00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:55,070
right it's like PDFs and memos and

00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,320
emails as well and then they used

00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:58,820
collaborative platforms to communicate

00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,370
and then share those documents with

00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:04,910
journalists working in 25 languages in

00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:07,580
nearly 80 countries and that I think is

00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:11,000
just has been really incredible it has

00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:13,520
spurred a lot of investigations a lot of

00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,130
impacts and then ultimately resulting in

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:19,929
this effort getting a Pulitzer Prize in

00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:22,640
2017 which was really incredible and

00:25:19,929 --> 00:25:25,870
then the other example like a few as

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:29,960
well is something that Scott Klein my

00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:32,450
previous boss at ProPublica thought of

00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:35,120
and then orchestrated a project called

00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:36,920
election land and what's interesting

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,679
about election land is that it's about

00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:41,420
covering the election on the day of not

00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:44,870
in terms of results but making sure that

00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:47,960
people who run into problems on voting

00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:49,880
day journalists can report on it fast

00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:52,070
enough to make a difference so that

00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,210
maybe you'll still be able to vote so

00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:55,970
when it comes to things like voter

00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:58,910
intimidation cyber security issues voter

00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:00,260
suppression all of that right across the

00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:03,410
u.s. on Election Day

00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:05,809
can we get tips to journalists in those

00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:08,540
places fast enough so they can report on

00:26:05,809 --> 00:26:13,370
it publish and then impact change before

00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:14,900
polls close and so I think election land

00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:16,550
I don't remember how many times it's

00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:19,820
been done at least twice if not three

00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:21,770
times happening again in 2020 but in

00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:24,020
2018 there were more than a hundred and

00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:26,030
twenty local and national newsrooms that

00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:28,940
participated in the country getting

00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:31,730
real-time tips and in total there is

00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:34,610
more than 230 stories published so this

00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:36,650
is sort of what it means now when it

00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:38,630
comes to massive like anywhere from

00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:42,640
micro to major

00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:46,039
best collaborative journalism efforts in

00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:50,030
in the industry and a lot of it most of

00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:51,650
it uses data in order to power that so

00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:55,580
let's change number two massive

00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:58,070
collaboration and then finally change

00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:01,100
number three is this is what I mean by

00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:05,450
inside and out so making the journalism

00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:08,660
industry a better place to work this is

00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:13,340
something that I'm gonna break into

00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:17,750
three parts for you first one is unions

00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:19,610
so you know unions have been around for

00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:22,429
an incredibly long time data journalism

00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:25,010
cannot take any credit for their

00:27:22,429 --> 00:27:26,960
existence in any way we've learned an

00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:30,020
incredible amount from them but what's

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:37,090
been really fun to see on my end is that

00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:41,210
a lot of the newest union based pay and

00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:43,220
equity studies have been led by and the

00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:45,500
data analysis has been done by people

00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:48,770
who are data reporters on the editorial

00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:52,730
side of the newsroom right so this was

00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:55,760
in 2018 a pay study by the Union of the

00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:57,309
Los Angeles Times I have their findings

00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:01,250
on there you can check this stuff out

00:27:57,309 --> 00:28:03,440
but this was led by Anthony pest who is

00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:06,799
a data journalist and a reporter on the

00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:10,669
data desk and there's a more recent

00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:13,520
example as well I think this was just

00:28:10,669 --> 00:28:15,860
last year the Washington Post Union also

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,210
did a study of pay also finding that

00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:19,820
woman of color in the newsroom are

00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:22,880
making less money and this was led by

00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:26,299
Steven rich who's an investigative data

00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,830
journalist at the Washington Post and in

00:28:26,299 --> 00:28:29,659
the full spirit of everything we've been

00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:31,309
talking about today in addition to doing

00:28:29,659 --> 00:28:34,400
the study he then open-source the

00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:36,770
techniques and the code to do it and not

00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:39,080
only is there a ipython notebook version

00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:40,280
there's also a R version that you can

00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:44,809
walk there if you want to do the same

00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:46,370
thing and so that's really cool but I

00:28:44,809 --> 00:28:49,120
also don't want to just highlight large

00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:52,360
places there's also examples like this

00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,920
where Katie Gillespie

00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,500
education and data reporter at The

00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:59,410
Columbian which is in Vancouver

00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:01,690
Washington also sort of was part of the

00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:03,700
Union organizing effort for their local

00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:06,490
newsroom right and so I think we're

00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:09,429
really only seeing the merge of these

00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:14,110
two communities come together and really

00:29:09,429 --> 00:29:15,429
build on each other and the last thing

00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:17,020
I'll say about this too is that there

00:29:15,429 --> 00:29:18,760
are a lot of other data journalists

00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:20,590
especially as I was reporting out this

00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:23,530
part of the presentation who have led

00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:25,330
pay studies either at their organization

00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:28,510
or at their Union and the findings

00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:30,160
aren't public to all of us but they were

00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:35,640
brought to management right and so

00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:39,340
they're also as always more quiet

00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:41,290
moments of change that are happening and

00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:42,790
obviously this is all on top of work

00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:45,070
that unions have been doing for a long

00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:46,660
time the major change that I'm seeing

00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:48,730
now is that instead of needing to pay a

00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:51,100
consulting group to look at the data

00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:54,880
that the employer gives you you now have

00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:56,980
in-house talent and in-house skills

00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,750
inside of your bargaining unit that know

00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:59,980
how to do this and that really know the

00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:01,570
people involved and know the

00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:05,309
organization thoroughly because they

00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:05,309
work there and that's kind of incredible

00:30:05,549 --> 00:30:10,510
okay so then the second part of making

00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:15,160
newsrooms better is their hiring

00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:17,350
policies and diversity reports so I just

00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,370
want to say before I show you what I'm

00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:20,919
going to highlight it's not

00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:22,870
comprehensive of a timeline but what I

00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:25,080
would like to highlight is newer

00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:27,490
journalism companies and by newer I mean

00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:30,309
probably created in the last decade or

00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:34,059
so whose data and graphic staff were

00:30:30,309 --> 00:30:36,429
really integral to creating diversity

00:30:34,059 --> 00:30:38,620
reports that are available and geared

00:30:36,429 --> 00:30:40,809
towards the public which is the people

00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:43,840
who paid the journalism as opposed to

00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:46,020
geared towards like your board or

00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:49,679
stakeholders or something like that and

00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:53,140
after doing as much research as I could

00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:55,690
I felt like there were only around ten

00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:57,549
total news organizations that even have

00:30:55,690 --> 00:31:00,040
something like that that's publishable

00:30:57,549 --> 00:31:01,840
right meeting that criteria name meaning

00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:03,760
that it's not buried like in a PDF

00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,679
report that you kind of have on the side

00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,400
on your site but that you really treat

00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:08,530
like another

00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:10,720
journalism on your website so that the

00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:16,210
public can find it and actually read it

00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:19,930
and so here is the beginning I think of

00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:22,060
it all which is in 2014 a lot of you

00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:23,980
will probably also remember that it

00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:26,080
follows the same trend as when

00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:28,090
technology companies were reporting

00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,910
their diversity reports for the first

00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:33,790
time and BuzzFeed was the first

00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:36,010
journalism organization to do it and it

00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:38,200
makes a lot of sense because BuzzFeed's

00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:40,630
origin story really was about being a

00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:43,510
tech company that does journalism right

00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:45,370
and after talking to some folks I also

00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:47,410
found out for sure that it was their

00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:48,820
data science team that was looking at

00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:50,560
and analyzing the data to make the

00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:52,420
report possible but that was sort of

00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:54,550
already embedded in their company

00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:57,790
culture and still is right that they use

00:31:54,550 --> 00:32:01,750
data to make a lot of their decisions

00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:03,730
and it's really important to them I was

00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:05,680
at Pro Publica at the time so the next

00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:07,870
year following their example ProPublica

00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:10,090
published their first one and now in

00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:13,060
2020 the fifth one has come out right

00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:15,040
they're done annually and in this case

00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:18,580
Wayne McGregor and I were both news apps

00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:21,060
developers and part of the kickoff for

00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:24,310
this was that we were like hey you know

00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:26,830
we should do this we're currently not

00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:28,600
tracking as a company in any way the

00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:30,220
demographics of the staff and we should

00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,650
give people an opt-in way to

00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:34,570
self-identify and then report on it for

00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:36,690
the public especially when our

00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:39,430
journalism is so centered around

00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:40,870
fighting and justices right and we want

00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:43,590
to know what the makeup of the staff is

00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:47,080
like and so we were able to sort of

00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:49,300
create that data set and then analyze it

00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:52,750
and then visualize it and put it up in a

00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:55,390
report more places have followed suit

00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:59,070
the Marshall project their diversity

00:32:55,390 --> 00:33:03,280
report also was prompted and started

00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:06,850
with a group of people including a data

00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:09,370
journalist on their staff as well as the

00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:12,040
city which is a compared to all the

00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:14,980
other organizations the newest which

00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:16,750
launched to be a organization that

00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:18,770
really serves and covers the people of

00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:21,380
New York City

00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:25,190
in this diversity report was also led by

00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:26,660
a data journalist there and so the one

00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:27,980
last thing I'll say is that I'm certain

00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:29,809
there are backstories that I don't know

00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:31,970
about because I couldn't interview every

00:33:29,809 --> 00:33:36,280
organization that had come out with the

00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:40,400
diversity report before this talk but

00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:42,050
they were definitely I feel like there

00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,940
was definitely something that I saw and

00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:46,100
I want to keep researching about how

00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:47,960
these having these inherent data skills

00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:50,750
in house right are enabling

00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:53,270
organizations to look at themselves much

00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:55,970
more critically and from maybe a safer

00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:59,420
place because their staff is trying to

00:33:55,970 --> 00:34:02,800
work with the company to try and be

00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:02,800
transparent with their readers

00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:11,480
okay and then here's here's like a sad a

00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:13,310
sadder point right which is that the

00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,960
work of collecting diversity and

00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:18,080
demographic data in journalism is not

00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:21,290
new there is this diversity census

00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:23,359
called a SME or a SME is the

00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:26,889
organization but they've been doing this

00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:29,869
diversity census for over 40 years and

00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:31,490
news organizations just report to them

00:34:29,869 --> 00:34:36,580
and then they put out an aggregate

00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:39,710
aggregated sort of report every year and

00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:42,590
participation rates have been so slow in

00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:44,780
recent years that a SME decided that it

00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:49,399
wasn't worth doing the diversity census

00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:52,040
anymore which is really sad for me and

00:34:49,399 --> 00:34:53,690
there's a long list of major news

00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:56,629
organizations that all of you will have

00:34:53,690 --> 00:35:00,350
heard of that don't participate no one

00:34:56,629 --> 00:35:02,900
requires that they do and even when

00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:05,090
listed publicly it doesn't sort of have

00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:07,430
any effect and so you're sort of seeing

00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:10,130
these two two different things happening

00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:12,950
simultaneously which is data journalism

00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:15,130
bringing in more public facing diversity

00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:18,260
reports while journalism as a whole is

00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:20,119
sort of regressing when it comes to how

00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:25,070
willing they are even to report their

00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:28,310
own numbers so very interesting and then

00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:30,530
finally so I love this example though I

00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:32,190
wanted to merge the two right unions and

00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:36,089
receive reports marrying them

00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:42,450
one last example which is that at the

00:35:36,089 --> 00:35:45,150
intercept they are a they are also an

00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:46,740
investigative nonprofit you can learn

00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:49,140
more about them as well they're also a

00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:50,579
relatively new organization but what's

00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:54,359
really interesting about the intercept

00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:56,069
is that they as a union decided that

00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:59,250
diversity was the most important thing

00:35:56,069 --> 00:36:00,150
to them and so in their actual union

00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:03,900
contract

00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:05,430
there are diversity agreements which I

00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,470
think is different right than a

00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:09,510
diversity committee or some people on

00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:11,569
staff getting certain things published

00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:14,849
right this is a sort of second level

00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:17,250
agreement and they had a

00:36:14,849 --> 00:36:22,230
first-of-its-kind diversity provision

00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:23,970
that requires that when people who are

00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:26,760
interviewing when people interview for

00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:28,619
the bargaining unit jobs that at least

00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:32,190
two people of color have to be

00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:33,900
interviewed at that stage right so those

00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:35,640
kind of rules aren't new but the fact

00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:38,400
that it's part of a union agreement has

00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:40,490
never happened before at least to the

00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:44,640
knowledge to my knowledge and journalism

00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:46,829
and the contract itself right has that I

00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:49,109
kind of jumped the gun a little bit but

00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:51,180
then the contract also created their

00:36:49,109 --> 00:36:52,920
diversity committee and it includes the

00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:57,060
fact that managers have to come and they

00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:58,829
have to discuss issues that affect their

00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:00,630
staff effects traditionally

00:36:58,829 --> 00:37:04,230
underrepresented people in journalism

00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:06,240
and that also sort of includes creating

00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:07,710
this demographic survey it also includes

00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,420
discussions for how to allocate

00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:11,910
resources to address this kind of thing

00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:13,380
so I think that was really cool just

00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:17,700
sort of bringing all that kind of stuff

00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:20,609
together so these changes as we've

00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:22,920
talked about right going back to my

00:37:20,609 --> 00:37:25,290
original statement about journalists and

00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,780
technologists being uniquely positioned

00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:30,810
to change journalism for all these

00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:33,390
reasons both when it comes to coverage

00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:36,660
and when it comes to the makeup and the

00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:39,359
process and the culture of what it's

00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:41,940
like inside of newsrooms and so I think

00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:43,859
my conclusion so far is that they're

00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:44,660
doing it one step at a time they're

00:37:43,859 --> 00:37:49,880
creating

00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:53,150
bringing change and you know we've gone

00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:55,849
through these various ways that attempts

00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:58,700
are being made even at a time in

00:37:55,849 --> 00:38:00,890
journalism that is really difficult

00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:04,910
right now just like in many different

00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:08,480
industries with people going through pay

00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:10,970
cuts people going through furloughs this

00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:13,099
work and the work of the unions that I

00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:15,410
showed you before are still moving

00:38:13,099 --> 00:38:18,950
forward to try to do the best that they

00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:25,819
can to help keep their newsrooms sort of

00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:28,700
a fair and equitable place and so see ya

00:38:25,819 --> 00:38:31,400
so the one thing I want to say here is

00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:32,869
that if you're in journalism and you're

00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,099
listening to this talk and you want to

00:38:32,869 --> 00:38:36,319
make these types of changes in your

00:38:34,099 --> 00:38:38,329
organization you want to talk about it I

00:38:36,319 --> 00:38:40,549
would love to talk to you but similarly

00:38:38,329 --> 00:38:42,170
and I think this is more the case for

00:38:40,549 --> 00:38:44,270
the people at CSV comms is that if

00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:45,650
you're in another industry and you want

00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:47,359
to sort of take some of these things

00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:50,420
that journalism is doing and apply it

00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:51,619
yourself I know that in different

00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:54,710
industries there are definitely

00:38:51,619 --> 00:38:56,119
different types of challenges for which

00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:58,549
things are harder and which things are

00:38:56,119 --> 00:39:00,289
easier but I would love to learn more

00:38:58,549 --> 00:39:02,630
about what you're doing what you want to

00:39:00,289 --> 00:39:05,799
do and if I can help sort of bounce

00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:08,119
ideas I think that would be fantastic so

00:39:05,799 --> 00:39:12,980
these are all the different ways to

00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:15,380
contact me and I think I spoke

00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:17,690
significantly faster than I planned so

00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:25,720
we have time to do questions live I

00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:28,990
think thank you see

00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:31,089
how do you want to handle questions do

00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:34,380
you are you able to access that a

00:39:31,089 --> 00:39:41,010
question yeah sure or do you want me to

00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:43,420
do I'm happy to see if I can just I

00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:45,670
think there's three in there right now

00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:46,869
so I think I can just read them and then

00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:49,420
go through them does that sound good

00:39:46,869 --> 00:39:52,839
that's great to me all right okay

00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:56,740
cool okay so the first one question from

00:39:52,839 --> 00:40:03,130
oh okay I see they move when you all

00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:04,630
vote on them so let me okay I feel like

00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:06,970
I maybe will be able to keep track of

00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:09,280
this so okay first question is story

00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:11,170
recipes sound really amazing I'm curious

00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,270
what kind of usage you're seeing on them

00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:14,680
do people let you know when they use it

00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:16,540
or do you have another way to know that

00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,790
it's enabled someone to report and

00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:21,940
analyze the data so this is a really

00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:24,190
great question because open news had

00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:26,109
published story recipes in the past but

00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:27,520
not as frequently as we are doing now

00:40:26,109 --> 00:40:29,740
and so we're actually in the middle of

00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:34,869
trying to figure this out we currently

00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:36,339
don't ask for anything because our the

00:40:34,869 --> 00:40:38,380
like center value that we're trying to

00:40:36,339 --> 00:40:40,510
hold here is that you don't need to pay

00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:42,670
anything whether that's in registration

00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:45,309
or personal data or anything in order to

00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:47,290
access this stuff and so we don't we

00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:50,440
don't have a guaranteed way of knowing

00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:53,290
there's no like code that you have to

00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:55,030
embed if you publish with it but we are

00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:56,890
thinking about ways that we can ask the

00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:59,710
community to tell us because we have

00:40:56,890 --> 00:41:01,569
heard anecdotally that people use that

00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:03,099
report on something and then they

00:41:01,569 --> 00:41:04,809
publish like sometimes people will

00:41:03,099 --> 00:41:06,190
proactively tell us that other times

00:41:04,809 --> 00:41:08,799
let's say they looked into it but it

00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:10,089
didn't work out but the third case which

00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:12,970
is really interesting is that some

00:41:10,089 --> 00:41:16,210
people look at it and they use it not to

00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:18,040
report on the story recipe but just to

00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:20,650
learn the techniques that the authors

00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:23,829
went through and getting to that story

00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:25,180
and so that's also really cool I also

00:41:23,829 --> 00:41:27,190
know that the way that we had done it at

00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:28,569
four pública is that we just sort of

00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:30,910
it's a similar thing there's a little

00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:32,290
blurb that says if you use this we'd

00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:35,109
love to know we'd love to promote it

00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:37,329
send it to us and so sometimes when

00:41:35,109 --> 00:41:38,250
people would do that we would accumulate

00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:39,900
all the links and

00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:41,760
and we would have a little section on

00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:43,860
the site for that project that says

00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,420
local stories that were written and then

00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:47,280
we would show all of them which is like

00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:48,960
a good way of motivating people to share

00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,240
the links back but we're still trying to

00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:58,070
figure out how do we thoroughly look at

00:41:51,240 --> 00:42:00,810
this out of a noose okay next question

00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:04,020
okay so this is question from Jennifer I

00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:06,990
know data sources I think I see local

00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:09,030
stories in the data what can I do I'm

00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:12,120
not a writer how to connect with a

00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:18,510
journalist or interest in generating a

00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:19,920
local journalist I think Jennifer I see

00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:22,020
you in the chat I'm going to ask you a

00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:25,410
quick question to clarify which is I

00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:29,160
think what you're asking is I know how

00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:32,430
to use the data and I'm interested in

00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:35,060
contributing to this work but I'm not a

00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:37,260
writer right now how do I either

00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:38,790
collaborate with a local journalist or

00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:49,850
do my own work is that what you're

00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:49,850
asking yes no yes no in the chat perhaps

00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,840
while I'm waiting for that I can go

00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:56,790
ahead and just answer that version the

00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:59,180
question because I think that's right I

00:42:56,790 --> 00:43:02,370
think that if you're really data savvy

00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:06,620
you can definitely sort of look at what

00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:10,080
local newsrooms exist in your space so

00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:13,320
what that means geographically or if

00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:16,350
there's an area of expertise that you

00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:18,660
have that isn't in your geography but a

00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:24,210
newsroom is sort of based there I think

00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:26,150
that you could totally look at if

00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:28,560
they're doing any data stories are ready

00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:30,390
usually people will have something like

00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:33,000
the word data in their title or their

00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:34,410
biography but the other thing is you

00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,440
should also feel free if you want to

00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:39,240
just chat me in the CSV comp slack with

00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,830
sort of like your location or if you

00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,660
want to bring some a little bit there

00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:46,740
are a lot of places where data

00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:48,630
journalists hang out and so there is

00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:49,950
sort of easy ways to get in contact with

00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:52,270
folks if you want to work together on

00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:54,410
something

00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:59,840
and then okay

00:43:54,410 --> 00:44:01,940
next question oh it shifted again okay

00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:04,610
I'll do these in the boat order as well

00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:06,710
as they shift but okay one of the

00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:09,050
criticisms for requiring representation

00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:11,060
among job candidates is that it can be

00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:13,160
inherently uttering especially when the

00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:14,770
people / committee doing hiring isn't

00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:16,760
trained to confront their biases and

00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:18,710
understand the higher bars that are set

00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:20,720
for oppressed groups are there also

00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:22,760
requirements for inclusivity training

00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:25,190
and practices do accompany interviewing

00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:26,840
for contacts in academia we often hear

00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:28,130
about requirements for your ends in an

00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:30,530
interview pool who end up not being

00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:32,270
seriously considered okay so this is a

00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:34,310
question from how it's a hundred percent

00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:36,590
on points so if all you do is follow

00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:40,940
that rule and nothing else it could be a

00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:43,930
total disaster like for all of the

00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:47,600
reasons that are stated in the question

00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:49,970
all I can tell you is what my sort of

00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:53,420
recommendations or things that I've seen

00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:55,010
work gradually one is that to

00:44:53,420 --> 00:45:00,470
communicate to people that with this

00:44:55,010 --> 00:45:03,320
rule the spirit of it is that a inherent

00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:06,770
understanding that it isn't that people

00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:09,200
of color who are qualified to this job

00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:13,160
don't exist which is sort of like one

00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:14,390
layer of very most like mostly when

00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:16,190
people are at the very beginning stages

00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:17,780
of understanding how this works and

00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:19,609
confronting their own biases that's like

00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:21,680
the first layer right people think well

00:45:19,609 --> 00:45:23,420
like I would hire people of color but

00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:25,790
they're just not qualified and to

00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:27,650
establish that's just not true the key

00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:29,660
is that you are not finding them right

00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:31,190
and so the question is like why are you

00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:33,200
not finding them or why are they not

00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:35,720
interested in working here and so this

00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:39,220
bar of having at least one or two or

00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:43,160
however many more you want to say of

00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:46,700
finalists who are POC is is that if you

00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:49,460
cannot find two of them who would do a

00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:52,490
great job at this then you are not done

00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:54,890
with your applicant pool stage of your

00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:56,840
job hiring process like you just haven't

00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:58,880
done a good job as an organization and

00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:01,850
sort of framing it that way I think that

00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:03,640
step two steps to B definitely includes

00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:06,130
things like how do you then conduct the

00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:09,460
reviews better including how do you make

00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:10,900
sure that people are asking all sort of

00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:12,670
hitting all the same points on their

00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:15,010
questions how do you make sure that

00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:19,570
people aren't just like trying to

00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:21,130
connect purely on stories like personal

00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:23,350
stories about where you've worked before

00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:25,300
because then institutional biases can

00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:28,660
just sort of like keep rolling into each

00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:30,760
other and then there's also you know

00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:33,150
like the question mentioned inclusivity

00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:35,560
training though I've personally never

00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:36,880
been able to study those up close in

00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:40,150
terms of being a part of one and then

00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:42,190
seeing how it affects the staff but I

00:46:40,150 --> 00:46:46,990
think it's an area that I'm definitely

00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:50,290
really interested in okay

00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:51,700
next question is oh and any questions

00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:53,170
that I don't read out loud I will answer

00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:57,370
them in the chat so please don't worry

00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:59,530
about that what is your perspective on

00:46:57,370 --> 00:47:01,750
using data to form narratives more

00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:03,550
responsibly in journalism especially

00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:07,240
when there's potential for transforming

00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:12,180
industries social issues yeah so this is

00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:14,770
from Selena I think that you have to be

00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:16,210
yeah to be really good at your job and

00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:20,410
what I mean by that is that as

00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:24,310
journalists right if you want to do your

00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:26,440
job well you have to have I mean some

00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:27,880
words to borrow from my predecessors who

00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:30,400
have already given talks this morning

00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:33,340
you have to have empathy for your

00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:35,860
community you have to do your job and

00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:38,530
understand the types of things that they

00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:41,110
are going through you have to report out

00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:44,410
what does it mean to be respectful when

00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:46,030
it's not your own monoculture that

00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:49,410
you're in right and that we're in a

00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:53,490
blend of different cultures and

00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:56,230
journalism and we've seen it before and

00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:58,120
there's an example I can give to is that

00:47:56,230 --> 00:48:01,270
one of the local reporting network

00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:04,030
partners from over the last year and

00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:06,280
also this year who ended up winning a

00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:09,460
Pulitzer this year which is really great

00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:11,590
they're based in Alaska and one of the

00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:13,240
things that some of the engagement

00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:15,770
reporters that ProPublica did when they

00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:17,510
were trying to fully understand

00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:20,690
the community they were covering which

00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:22,490
was on a really hard topic which is

00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:25,790
about sort of the like sexual harassment

00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:32,060
and rape of women in remote locations

00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:34,850
that have no no police protection or

00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:37,280
even physical access to a rape kit right

00:48:34,850 --> 00:48:39,320
and one of the things that the community

00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,900
was telling our engagement reporters

00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:45,170
over and over again is that however long

00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:47,270
ago journalism comes in writes a story

00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:49,790
about this and then the entire community

00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:52,430
is branded by this one thing and that's

00:48:49,790 --> 00:48:54,710
all they're ever known for and

00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:57,920
journalism has a responsibility for that

00:48:54,710 --> 00:49:01,340
to understand the implications of their

00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:03,860
actions on multiple levels and to tell

00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:06,670
stories in a way because it's possible

00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:09,590
to do so to tell stories in a way that

00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:14,300
don't sort of scar a community forever

00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:16,850
right so I think that oh 10 minutes left

00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:19,670
I think that data is sort of like one

00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:21,470
component to making sure that you

00:49:19,670 --> 00:49:23,300
understand what's going on but then you

00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:25,550
absolutely have to talk to the people

00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:27,560
involved especially if it's not a

00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:29,930
community that you're already part of to

00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:31,730
fully understand what's going on and

00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:33,800
that sort of you know the the flipside

00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:41,570
of really good traditional journalism

00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:44,630
helps you accomplish that let's see oh

00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:46,640
this one's fun I would love to know how

00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:54,020
any tips on how to interview your data

00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:55,730
to find unique stories the interview in

00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:58,130
quotes I don't know why you put it in

00:49:55,730 --> 00:50:02,080
quotes but it's really appropriate

00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:04,640
because one of the first people who I

00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:08,359
learned data journalism from Derek

00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:10,490
Willis who were except for pública and I

00:50:08,359 --> 00:50:12,650
ended up editing for a couple years had

00:50:10,490 --> 00:50:14,359
always talked about when we work with

00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:16,550
data as journalists we're doing is

00:50:14,359 --> 00:50:18,380
interviewing them pretend like they're

00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:22,310
human being and ask them what you want

00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:26,030
to know so if you have a data set that

00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:27,450
is about schools or test scores or votes

00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:29,430
for Representatives

00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:30,570
like if you had a human being with all

00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:33,210
that knowledge in your head what would

00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:35,220
you ask them and I think that's a really

00:50:33,210 --> 00:50:36,900
fun way of thinking about it because

00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:38,940
then you'll quickly realize like oh

00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:40,530
maybe my data can't answer this question

00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:44,810
and if that's the case you'll know that

00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:47,430
you need to combine datasets or maybe

00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:49,080
what I find often is when I do that I

00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:51,270
realize something is missing and then I

00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:52,710
go back to the entity that gave me the

00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:54,780
data and I'm like why is this not here

00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:56,250
are you withholding it for me or what's

00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:59,130
going on because it wouldn't make sense

00:50:56,250 --> 00:51:03,750
without this information but if you want

00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:06,030
to know more I can I can try to maybe

00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:08,340
pop in some resources because there's a

00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:10,790
lot written I think both by Derek and by

00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:14,460
other folks who teach data journalism

00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:16,620
how journalists can think about data as

00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:21,180
a source in that way so I'll drop

00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:22,920
something in the slag and then okay we

00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:24,750
have two left so I think I can get to

00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:26,460
all of them as a designer and

00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:28,650
technologist how do I level up my

00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:33,360
journalism and get involved in news apps

00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:34,580
development from John so this is a great

00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:38,490
question

00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:41,760
designer design and technology skills

00:51:38,490 --> 00:51:45,420
are really great to have as a backbone I

00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:46,500
find that the most super broad-stroke

00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:49,050
point of view

00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:50,610
whenever I've taught folks who come from

00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:53,450
that background who want to come into

00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:55,560
journalism which is what open news

00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:58,530
facilitated for a long time before I

00:51:55,560 --> 00:52:00,690
worked there is that the scariest thing

00:51:58,530 --> 00:52:02,910
for people who don't come from a

00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:05,640
journalism background is calling

00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:08,520
strangers to ask them whatever questions

00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:10,910
you want to ask and that make a lot of

00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:13,530
sense like in normal day-to-day life

00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:17,690
most professions do not require that

00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:22,110
skill and it's a very social based skill

00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:24,060
and I think the thing that I would say

00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:26,010
is I would start out with the topic that

00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:29,940
you're really passionate about that's

00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:33,450
that's not super high stakes so to give

00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:34,980
you an example remember that show we all

00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:37,620
used to really like called Game of

00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:39,840
Thrones until the last season happened

00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:41,520
well so the Washington Post

00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:44,340
those great piece that they did on it

00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:46,560
that was just literally tracking every

00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:49,020
death per episode that had happened

00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:52,110
across every single season right so

00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:54,090
that's some data and design and if

00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:55,620
you're really into the topic you will be

00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:58,080
really into this right and then

00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:59,610
depending on what you want to ask try to

00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:02,910
figure out like what do I want to know

00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:04,970
more about what do I want to confirm and

00:53:02,910 --> 00:53:07,740
get some practice sort of just

00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:10,790
attempting to ask for other people's

00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:13,440
time to tell you some information and

00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:15,750
practice wise that's what I would start

00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:19,170
with if you really want to get into the

00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:21,900
profession you can totally like if you

00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:24,740
want to check out my car which I can put

00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:27,120
in the chat here that's where a lot of

00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:29,010
data journalists hang out it's a

00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:31,530
conference but it's also a listserv that

00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:32,760
anyone can join for free understanding

00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:34,530
that it's a bunch of journalists if you

00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:36,870
say something they're like it's gonna be

00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:38,370
on the record but it's a great place

00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:41,040
especially for new people that get

00:53:38,370 --> 00:53:46,520
started including students and people

00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:54,680
are really happy to help there yeah

00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:58,500
let's see here we go next question I

00:53:54,680 --> 00:54:00,600
don't see any any newsrooms in Europe

00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:02,430
that are known to utilize data in a

00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:06,660
powerful way

00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:09,500
so oh yeah and then folks yes so

00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:11,520
Guardian and BBC absolutely fantastic

00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:15,270
depending on what country you're in you

00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:17,430
might have more familiarity but the

00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:19,860
other thing that I would say is the

00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:22,650
organization that won the Pulitzer for

00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:25,890
the Panama papers I CIJ they're based

00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:27,570
internationally in Europe and that was

00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:32,960
probably one of the most powerful uses

00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:39,060
of data I've seen the other thing is in

00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:42,000
Germany I think at Der Spiegel and he

00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:44,420
Julian used to work at the Berliner

00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:48,880
Berliner Morgan Post as well he's

00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:52,099
absolute powerhouse in this kind of work

00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:54,440
there is a ton of different

00:54:52,099 --> 00:54:58,609
organizations also in Norway and Sweden

00:54:54,440 --> 00:55:00,140
I would say if you're really if you want

00:54:58,609 --> 00:55:01,819
kind of like a shortcut to figure out

00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:08,630
places that are doing really good work

00:55:01,819 --> 00:55:14,180
in Europe I actually go to the Society

00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:15,890
of News design so that is a professional

00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:17,420
organization in journalism that is

00:55:15,890 --> 00:55:19,990
specifically for journalists who are

00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:22,940
also designers and they have a

00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:24,859
competition every year for the best of

00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:27,020
digital and they show you the

00:55:24,859 --> 00:55:29,270
organizations that win medals and I

00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:32,930
often use that as like a shortcut to

00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:36,619
look at places that are doing amazing

00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:38,359
work across the globe not just in Europe

00:55:36,619 --> 00:55:40,700
and both the print and the digital

00:55:38,359 --> 00:55:42,680
competitions are absolutely amazing they

00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:44,420
have data visualization categories which

00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:46,369
often leads you to the same people who

00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:47,420
are doing the VIS are the same team

00:55:46,369 --> 00:55:49,640
essentially that's doing the

00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:52,010
visualization as well as the data

00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:56,589
analysis so that's that's where I would

00:55:52,010 --> 00:56:01,940
go to check out very specific projects

00:55:56,589 --> 00:56:11,829
and I think I covered all of them but

00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:16,029
let me just make sure yes yes yes yes

00:56:11,829 --> 00:56:19,579
yeah I think that's all of the questions

00:56:16,029 --> 00:56:22,819
it's pub and I can um yeah I think you

00:56:19,579 --> 00:56:27,200
handled all the questions and I wanted

00:56:22,819 --> 00:56:29,660
before we we close on time to say thank

00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:35,059
you again for your ear really

00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:36,770
encouraging and informative keynote I

00:56:35,059 --> 00:56:39,099
feel very energized and I have a

00:56:36,770 --> 00:56:42,460
notebook full of things to follow up on

00:56:39,099 --> 00:56:42,460
