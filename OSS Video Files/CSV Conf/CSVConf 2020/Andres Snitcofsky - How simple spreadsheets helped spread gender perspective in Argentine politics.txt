Title: Andres Snitcofsky - How simple spreadsheets helped spread gender perspective in Argentine politics
Publication date: 2020-06-02
Playlist: CSVConf 2020
Description: 
	In Economía Feminista we try to get the feminist perspective in usual male dominated areas as Politics and economics. Through the use of simple spreadsheet born interactive and digital projects we did just that with minimum resources: A crowdsourced database to pre-whip / figure out congress votes on legal abortion, a twitter bot that shows the lack of women in op-ed every day, an automated scrapper to monitor menstruation "cost", a feminist index for candidates for 2019 election and other small feminist nerd projects.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
how you all from I'm here in Buenos

00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:06,839
Aires Argentina is 4 p.m. right now it's

00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:11,280
starting to get winter and we are quite

00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:11,969
in time as everyone I think so so what's

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,059
this all about

00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:18,600
I'm part of a group called economy

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:21,270
feminista that we actually try to deal

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:25,560
with economic system from the feminism

00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:29,250
perspective so what I want to show you

00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:31,800
is some really small projects that we

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:35,340
need when I say small I say that they

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:40,440
were started small and then they create

00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:43,350
grew and get to different points so the

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:48,690
the very very first thing I want to say

00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:52,140
that I am C's gender main white dude but

00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:55,350
in the group I'm the only one and the

00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,539
rest of them are all really great girls

00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,820
that they are really awesome in their in

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:02,129
their fields and my field is nerdness

00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,260
and visualization so that's why I am

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:09,200
talking to you guys the rest of them are

00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:13,290
on in different fields of economics and

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,170
feminism of course so what I wanted to

00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:19,320
show you this project that we started

00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:25,470
were we had these issues we wanted to

00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:28,110
know what the outcome of the body the in

00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:31,229
the Congress that the law of abortion of

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:33,630
the abortion of choice pro-choice and we

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:36,360
wanted to know what the sent the two

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:38,729
hundred fifty seven deputies and seventy

00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:41,850
two senators were going to vote and of

00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:45,180
course they didn't told us so we we are

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:47,549
a really small group and we we started

00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:51,299
thinking how we can do that if we don't

00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:54,780
have a high amount of money or humans to

00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:57,329
help lot but we did have a big community

00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:01,439
of followers and we have this moving

00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:03,299
topic the legal abortion so the very

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,219
first thing we did was to make a

00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:07,229
spreadsheet just a small spreadsheet

00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:09,239
where we put all the deputies all the

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:11,039
Senators and we started to see that's

00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,970
why we call it party oh that's counting

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:16,580
beans so we started to see

00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:19,100
we knew what they are going to vote on

00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:21,860
who we didn't know who was going to be

00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:24,410
voting against the problem was that we

00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:26,450
are like seven or seven or eight people

00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:28,700
working on this and we don't know all of

00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:32,000
the deputies of all of the provinces

00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:33,620
Argentina it's a further country so we

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,710
started sharing the spreadsheet with

00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:39,100
friends and with friends of friends with

00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:42,680
other people that we didn't even know

00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:44,750
another thing could be pointing putting

00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,610
comments on it so we didn't make a

00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:48,680
software with you make us something

00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:52,910
really strange or something very costly

00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:57,350
we just shared a spreadsheet we didn't

00:02:52,910 --> 00:03:00,920
we didn't have public data sorry we did

00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:04,340
allowed to put things without source so

00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:07,790
that the data should be public with him

00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:10,270
allowed to put off the record about it

00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:12,890
like I think this guy is going to put

00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:15,380
against or I think he's going to know

00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:17,780
you had to put a public source you say

00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:21,709
okay this guy said in this media this is

00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:23,450
the link he says and the expression was

00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:25,940
open to comments so we had like

00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:28,670
discussions like wait this then this guy

00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:30,680
this say that was going to vote against

00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:33,200
abortion and then he said if it were

00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:37,280
pro-choice so those comments were

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:39,650
tracked the thing is that it was a

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,560
simple spreadsheet but it got so big and

00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:45,230
people started to share it and started

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,410
to use it as a source like wait this is

00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:51,440
devoting this is the polls they even

00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:57,020
sent to our home to my home they sent us

00:03:51,440 --> 00:04:01,160
to you TV team they should my screen

00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:04,220
like he's kind of rel to say that but

00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:05,810
they should screen and put it on TV live

00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:08,690
on TV that the stream of icon my

00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:11,239
computer that's truly not the way we

00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:14,090
should do things but this way it was

00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:16,790
working so people was trusting more our

00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:19,209
simple spreadsheet than the real media

00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:21,890
actually the media was trusting our

00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:23,780
scratch it that's what you are seeing

00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:26,060
right now this is kind of one of the

00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:28,370
biggest channels in Argentina

00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:31,639
it's really ugly you can you can tell

00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:34,610
but it was trust that was important

00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:38,810
because people knew that all the data we

00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:43,070
had all those voting numbers had a

00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:45,200
backup a source a public source so that

00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:48,850
night where the Congress was debating

00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:53,450
these were lot of people in the streets

00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:55,040
really low connection like you know 3G

00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:58,280
connection gets low when you had a lot

00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,350
of people so we have this is the that

00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,150
night at 3 a.m. where people were

00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:04,850
freezing in the night I'm waiting for

00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:09,140
the Congress to to get their boats they

00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:13,060
were like 50 like 500 5000 people

00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:17,270
logging in every hour we have like

00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:20,840
60,000 abuse that night that's what the

00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:22,640
the local field of that night you have

00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,650
one side that is pro-choice and the

00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:29,900
other one that is against abortion and

00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:32,600
he was divided and well actually what

00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:35,660
end that happening was like I want to

00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,490
share this video this awesome so

00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:39,830
eventually I don't know if you can hear

00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:44,169
I don't think you can hear the songs but

00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:49,910
people got really happy when the the

00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:51,950
deputies approved the law eventually the

00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:53,600
senator didn't approve those so we don't

00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:56,150
have the abortion free abortion in

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,890
Argentina but the interesting thing

00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:00,560
about this project was all the data was

00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:03,560
open and they what you started growing

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,570
with we started adding the age of the

00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:09,320
deportees the province where they were

00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:12,169
born the family how many kids they have

00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:14,360
if they are married or not all the data

00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:17,539
started growing because people started

00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:20,360
adding that data anyone we just checked

00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:22,160
them but they put comments and we added

00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:26,660
the comments to the to the spreadsheet

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:29,330
so eventually we started having like all

00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:32,600
kind of graphics that to see if they if

00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:37,099
they were going to vote on I'm

00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:38,530
pro-choice based on the if they they

00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:42,710
were like

00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:47,200
italic or not or they were practicing

00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:50,210
any religion then we have these kind of

00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:53,420
tangles of of connection between all

00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:54,770
these dots here are the actual deputies

00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,810
and their connection between themselves

00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:59,420
and you can see that you have like

00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:02,990
candles two bubbles once that they are

00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:04,760
against and when they are pro and those

00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:06,890
connections are Twitter follows so that

00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:10,190
they follow themselves like in a bubble

00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:12,950
even if there are different parties so

00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:15,200
eventually these other spin-offs that we

00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:17,990
have from this spreadsheet was for

00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:21,860
example this this another project that

00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:24,350
was a way to call your your deputy your

00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:27,160
representative you could treat them you

00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:32,030
could call them you can make a Facebook

00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:36,740
comment or whatever and like we were of

00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:38,540
course we were all pro-choice but they

00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:40,700
could even use this tool if you were

00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:43,670
against abortion you wanted to tell them

00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:46,700
to change it or to to get against it so

00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:48,380
this this this tool was really

00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:51,020
interesting because you can't even use

00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,550
it for other laws that were going to be

00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:55,300
passed

00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:58,100
so the earnest about this was the the

00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:01,250
content was really important these we

00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:04,040
didn't need need something innovative or

00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:07,550
awesome or nice it was the content and

00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:09,560
the audience our audience was trusting

00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:11,690
us more than trusting the media because

00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,930
they may have interests in this kind of

00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:19,400
thing so they are so profound in

00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:22,640
societies and then if we if you can make

00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:25,520
something other will like we wanted to

00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,990
be to make so many things with this with

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,570
this data but we didn't have the

00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:32,390
resources but other other did it others

00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:35,030
took the data and did other things and

00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:36,860
then all the collaborators that were

00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:39,860
adding information to the spreadsheet

00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:41,000
they just stick with us they are making

00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:45,590
another perfect now

00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:48,680
so other project that we were building

00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:51,170
with the experience of these one was

00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,980
really similar but was based on other

00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:54,230
not

00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:59,270
not only abortion but other gender

00:08:54,230 --> 00:09:03,350
issues like reproductive rights or pay

00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:05,540
gap or LGBT rights so for the next

00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:08,840
election we did something really similar

00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:12,110
we just make the form a Google form a

00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:15,590
release simple one where we asked like

00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:18,050
what the position of every candidate on

00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:22,210
different subjects I will share that

00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:26,770
form with colleagues and followers and

00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:31,010
friends so we we started feeling this

00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:33,860
information sometimes the the the

00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:37,070
politicians actually replied the forum

00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:40,130
and other times we just googled the

00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:44,150
information from outlets so we did these

00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:46,490
kind of this this visualization so you

00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:50,600
can choose what what deputies you wanted

00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:52,130
to vote this also was crowdsourcing in

00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:56,750
in the same way of the of the other

00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:59,000
spreadsheet another thing that is not

00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:03,110
really based on spreadsheet but it's

00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,810
based on a scrapping like we scrapped

00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:07,550
the page that the government the

00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:09,950
Argentinian government have this really

00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:13,160
poor in a way like it's really hard to

00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:15,620
ensure to it but it's it has a lot of

00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,490
data of prices of everything you can buy

00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:20,660
in a supermarket

00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:25,640
what we did was scrapped only the I like

00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:30,290
menstrual menstrual gene stuff for woman

00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:34,150
or or whoever administrates and we did

00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:39,110
this calculator to see how much anyone

00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:41,300
like cut to how much money you get you

00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:43,430
need four for having all these elements

00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:48,440
on your on your daily life on your

00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:49,910
one-year so eventually this was really

00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,490
interesting because you can actually

00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:56,650
prove the paper pickup because this

00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:59,360
these are expenditures that we men not

00:10:56,650 --> 00:11:01,420
non-administrative men don't have so

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,620
that's that that you have a pay gap

00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:05,270
demonstration right there for anyone

00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:08,810
that it's not really

00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:12,410
believing that there is a beggar another

00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:16,090
similar project what these about they we

00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:19,880
have more governors called Carlos than

00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:23,720
governors women governor's Lorna Louis

00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:27,710
and we did also have a five-minute

00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:30,080
warning thank you so the funny thing

00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:35,240
about this it was like we had to dig

00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:37,460
hard on the on different databases or

00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:40,010
not even databases but on media to find

00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:42,110
out who the governors were for the last

00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:43,940
30 years because you don't have a

00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:47,570
database of that in the government or

00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:50,360
any official thing so eventually we did

00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:52,730
these maps and the funny thing was this

00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:56,600
gift that you should you try to click

00:11:52,730 --> 00:12:02,450
and get a women but you also always go

00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:05,060
to Carlos probably then we this is the

00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:08,510
governors of Argentina and you can see

00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:11,150
that you don't even have women for the

00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:14,330
20 years ago 20 years ago there were no

00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:18,440
women in charge of any province and in

00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:22,340
the ministers of every province it's a

00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:25,790
feral State so he administers you can

00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:30,700
start finding out that as I was you have

00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:35,480
the women only in human rights education

00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:42,500
health social health and then in

00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:44,420
security economics sports like fuel all

00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:47,660
those ministers deal happening and any

00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:50,510
woman's there so it's always has this

00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:57,440
kind of this is a Minister for women not

00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:59,390
for men next thing was like a spinoff

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:03,680
from this project what this account that

00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:06,590
stores and collects pictures of politic

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:09,620
Argentinian politics politicians non

00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:12,560
with not any woman in a picture that's

00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:14,780
the name of the mujeres en la foto it's

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,730
like the opposite of what's happening

00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:19,300
here

00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:23,990
another thing similar to these it's

00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:24,470
Twitter bot that actually scraps every

00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:27,920
day

00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:30,220
scrubs all the main print media like

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:34,579
online version of the print media and

00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:38,420
gets the op-ed and gets if our women is

00:13:34,579 --> 00:13:41,810
signing the op-ed like the opinion the

00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:44,810
columns the opinion comes so what we got

00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:47,930
here is that we hardly get into the

00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:51,320
twenty five percent every day but we

00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:53,810
also have some moments in the year that

00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:57,560
you had more women will eat few moments

00:13:53,810 --> 00:14:00,350
here have abortion or the women March

00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:03,350
and then we have economic things that

00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:06,130
happen and then women gets laid off and

00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:10,370
only men are speaking about economics

00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:13,310
the this is for the nerd audience they

00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:15,500
are the Twitter but it's of course open

00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:17,810
source and has twist replicating in it

00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:20,839
like five countries already and it's

00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:24,800
really like nice it's a gentle bot it

00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:28,040
asked you if this this name is how it's

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,750
a female or male name because our

00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:33,430
database but sometimes she doesn't now

00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:36,800
so you ask you politely please and then

00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:39,019
it thanks you when you get the data and

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:44,300
here we've got the same like words that

00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:48,459
are mostly in news that are signed by

00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:51,829
men and words other which usually in

00:14:48,459 --> 00:14:58,850
news piece sang about women again the

00:14:51,829 --> 00:15:02,329
same love child's live education is for

00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:04,339
women I'm doing the cod marks and in the

00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:06,410
other side for men it's like politics

00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:12,050
and the name of the presidents and

00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:17,600
economics and Trump on whatever so I

00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:19,610
think this is it yeah I rushed but so

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,699
that's that's what we've been doing and

00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:26,610
all of our data it's open and all of our

00:15:22,699 --> 00:15:29,940
projects are open to be replicated most

00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:31,529
of them are in Spanish but if you want

00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:36,510
to replicate anything in your language

00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:37,620
please reach out I think I'm open to

00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:48,510
questions right now

00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:50,850
I think I can see you I know I always

00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:53,040
meet at sorry and just thank you so much

00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:55,860
that was really fascinating and I think

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,839
quite inspiring talk and if I'd known

00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:59,160
you'd shared your screen on successful

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,380
national TV I wouldn't have been so

00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,600
worried about anything ready for this

00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,529
talk I thought it was fantastic if

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,110
anybody has a question

00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:09,870
then we've got time for a quick one um

00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:11,579
and I've got a quick question actually I

00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:14,850
think it's it's fascinating like

00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:16,019
managing such an enormous spreadsheet as

00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:18,120
you're talking about the beginning of

00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:22,070
your talk I was wondering if there were

00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:24,240
any kind of unusual people related

00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:25,769
issues that you came up with that you

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,029
might not have expected because I can

00:16:25,769 --> 00:16:28,410
imagine the sort of technical things

00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:30,029
that he would have come up in the light

00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:33,000
from your side just managing the

00:16:30,029 --> 00:16:36,209
information but with only like behaviors

00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,040
that were strange to you you mean like

00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:41,130
like trolling the spreadsheet or

00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:43,260
something of that yeah oh yeah maybe

00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:45,180
like whirling or maybe like a non

00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:49,050
negative thing that was just a difficult

00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:51,959
thing to manage well we actually broke

00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:54,329
the thing because we instead of sharing

00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:55,920
like the spreadsheets are made for

00:16:54,329 --> 00:16:57,209
sharing for a lot of people but there is

00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,640
a way to do that you should you should

00:16:57,209 --> 00:17:02,010
like as a web page or we didn't do that

00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:04,199
because we know that so many people was

00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:06,270
going to get into it so we share like

00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:09,660
like when you share it to a colleague so

00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:12,689
it really broke in a moment you could

00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:17,189
answer anymore if you like and plain

00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:21,510
HTML I know is there some Google people

00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:23,579
working in Google and so that strengths

00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:27,360
of people getting into a spreadsheet I

00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:29,880
know things 565 thousands of people into

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,950
the approach is really normal but we

00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:36,660
like it was really interesting because

00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:39,990
people behave greatly like like he was

00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:41,730
not rude not rolling like I

00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:44,880
certain issue that it was really

00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:47,460
interesting the downside was that I was

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,220
sitting in this chair all that night

00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:54,030
like changing the leader came out

00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:58,080
actually some journalists treated to me

00:17:54,030 --> 00:18:00,450
like a DM asking me what was the the

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:03,720
next like what was the voting in that in

00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:05,490
that morning I'm not a journalist I like

00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,280
pretty known journalists were asking me

00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:10,020
that I know one but they did trust me

00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:12,450
because not be they trusted our

00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:15,380
spreadsheet because he was so proud

00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:19,980
founded that so close all see sorry

00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:21,900
thank you yeah absolutely fascinating

00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,520
it's really good I I'm gonna ask one

00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,450
more question from the audience I'm

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,059
hungry

00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:30,030
we'll have to be quite quick but it's

00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:33,179
from valaria and it says do you have any

00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:36,510
collaboration with other countries yeah

00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:39,840
we actually did we replicated like the

00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:43,260
the this this one are you still seeing

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:45,480
my share screen yeah this one they

00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:47,700
called nice toes is has been replicated

00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:52,830
like five different countries in Latin

00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:56,130
America and this one about this one it's

00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:57,990
also being replicated and yeah yeah we

00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:00,240
are really open to collaborate with

00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:03,440
mostly those Latin American because he's

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:06,300
in Spanish is really easy to replicate

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:09,150
amazing okay well maybe you could expand

00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:12,050
a little bit on that in and share some

00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:14,040
links in the Cuban a channel is back

00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:17,520
Kathleen thank you for your question as

00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:18,809
well I decided to give four there you go

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,780
given this you're going to be speaking

00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:23,670
later but andrás I'm sure you'll be

00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:27,200
happy to answer that question later as

00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:27,200
