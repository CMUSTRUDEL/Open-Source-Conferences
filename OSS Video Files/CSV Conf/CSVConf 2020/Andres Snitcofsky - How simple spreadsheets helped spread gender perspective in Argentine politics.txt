Publication date: 2020-06-02
Playlist: CSVConf 2020
Description: 
	In Econom√≠a Feminista we try to get the feminist perspective in usual male dominated areas as Politics and economics. Through the use of simple spreadsheet born interactive and digital projects we did just that with minimum resources: A crowdsourced database to pre-whip / figure out congress votes on legal abortion, a twitter bot that shows the lack of women in op-ed every day, an automated scrapper to monitor menstruation "cost", a feminist index for candidates for 2019 election and other small feminist nerd projects.
