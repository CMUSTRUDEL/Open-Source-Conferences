Title: Bradly Alicea - Epistomological Directories for Research Development and Education
Publication date: 2020-05-28
Playlist: CSVConf 2020
Description: 
	Learning and research involves more than simply looking things up on Wikipedia. The presenters propose a Github-based system for advancing research and interdisciplinary education called Epistomological Directories (EDs). We will present two versions of this: one for topics in Cybernetics and Systems and the other on Frontier Maps for education in AI, Philosophy, and Systems Science. Unlike conventional topical wikis, our approach serves as a set of research nodes, each of which contain a take-off point for other nodes. Each node (defined as a Markdown file or folder) might be based on interpretations of key papers in the field, or proposing new research directions based on a given research group's activities. At some nodes, we also plan to include annotated data in the form of .csv files (data tables) and .ipynb files (Jupyter notebooks), which serve to provide information about sample data for a topical domain, or for more theoretical topics what the data should look like (pseudo-data). Frontier Maps also serve the purpose of providing minimal information needed to understand jargon and advanced topics in fields unfamiliar to the user. More generally, EDs can serve as a tool for theory-building, self-directed education, and collaboration by bringing people up to speed on niche topics. They might also be used to engage in meta-research for special topics and published papers.

thank you uh i have my co-author jesse

00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,560
parent is in the chat

00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,120
and he's going to give you a link to the

00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:12,880
slides which are available at this link

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,080
a tiny url link and you can

00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,679
follow there there are a couple more

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,320
slides actually in that slide deck

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,480
because

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,080
i wanted to cut these down for in the

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,320
interest of time

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,720
so this is epistemological directories

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,599
for research development and education

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,679
this is our lab and jesse and i are the

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,800
authors

00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:35,520
okay um so

00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,079
this paper this this talk is is going to

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,079
introduce

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,840
a couple of instances of this thing

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,960
we're calling epistemological

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,200
directories

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,800
and they come in different flavors right

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,760
now it's it's something that we've been

00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,680
kind of developing in on multiple fronts

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,800
so you'll see some varieties of that as

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,120
we go along

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,239
but this is also rooted in the evolution

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,399
of the web

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,680
and i wanted to bring this up because

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,879
i'll talk about it in the

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,440
talk a little bit in terms of like what

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,680
the antecedents of these directories and

00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,119
then the feature of these directories so

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,080
the first thing the first part of the

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:12,400
web was a web 1.0 and that happened from

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,479
sort of the beginning of the graphical

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,360
web browser till about maybe the

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,880
early to mid 2000s and that involved

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,280
broadcasted information

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,960
and things like annotated bibliographies

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,600
so it was quite static

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,000
uh then we had web 2.0 which evolved

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,640
with the

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,960
advent of social media platforms so from

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,119
the early 2000s on to

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,200
more or less today so we had social

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,560
media we had version controls and other

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,119
technology

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,280
that enabled things and then we're

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,840
moving towards web 3.0 which

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,680
involve uh even more advanced

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,560
technological innovations like virtual

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,840
worlds

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,000
and the semantic web and so

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,479
with that framework i want you to think

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,280
a little bit now about history

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,360
uh what is a historical milestone and

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,240
what is the relevance of a historical

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,360
event

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,960
so i have these really abstract diagrams

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,240
but these are supposed to represent

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,520
events in

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,440
time uh so these events might have

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,120
qualitative significance and explain a

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,920
certain amount of the unknown

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,760
so it's like some you know innovation as

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,959
we were talking about in the last slide

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,160
or some paper

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,080
or some person that did something great

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,280
uh and that's up to the person

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,200
interpreting it

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,040
uh but can we do with this without

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,280
subjective judgment so can we do this in

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,480
an

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,239
objective way uh but even if we can't

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,120
does this lead to group consensus or

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:40,319
gatekeeping so who's telling the history

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,400
and uh who's presenting it so there are

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,319
a lot of common themes across scholars

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,200
and learners and if you look in the

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,640
uh full slide deck you'll see a bunch of

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,040
these questions i want

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,720
the one i wanted to focus on here though

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,400
was uh what are the most important

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,360
things we need to know in order to be

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,360
competent

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,720
and so this is kind of a digression from

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,800
the last slide but you'll see how they

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,800
stitch together in a minute

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,400
and so the answer to that is we can use

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,760
some criterion to say

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,519
this is what you need to know to be

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,480
competent in some area

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,480
and so this has been addressed by the

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,040
physicist leonard suskind

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,200
who along with his co-author wrote a

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,080
book called the theoretical minimum

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,840
and so their concern was if you took an

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,879
informed novice someone who had

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,080
the capacity to learn like all the uh

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,760
you know basically

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,159
with maybe an undergraduate degree or

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,400
maybe a high school diploma

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,159
you know what what if they acquired if

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,840
they had some basic skill level

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,440
what is the most efficient way to

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,159
understand the contents of a certain

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,920
field

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,680
so in this case they're interested in

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,400
teaching someone basically everything

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,640
you would learn

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,720
in an undergraduate physics course but

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,239
to do it in a self-motivated way or a

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,440
self-educated way

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,200
and so uh

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,040
we've you know this is this is their

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,640
answer you you address these different

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,799
issues if you read the book

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,400
you'll see they have a couple of key

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,319
things that they present

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,599
and it's supposed to give you everything

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,640
you need to know to be

00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,560
somewhat conversant in physics now i

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,480
work for an organization called open

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,319
the open worm foundation and we've

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,799
observed this very issue

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,519
we have people who come in with skills

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,759
in like

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,280
you know heavy computer science skills

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,799
maybe people come in with mostly

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,240
biological skills

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:23,840
and they need to contribute to this

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,520
community but they need to understand a

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,240
little bit of both

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,840
and so they need to get up to speed in

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,880
one area or another and this is

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,520
uh one approach that kind of used to do

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,120
this

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,880
but there's got to be a better way to do

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,520
this a more systematic way

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,840
um and so that's kind of where we're

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,000
going with the epistemological

00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,840
directories

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,240
now epistemological directories have

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,960
their origins in web 1.0

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,960
and so this is back in from like the

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,080
late 90s early 2000s

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,960
this is an example of a directory

00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,680
from that era and so you have it it was

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,160
uh

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,039
put together by the conled conrad lorenz

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,440
institute

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:05,039
and they had this uh website where you

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,720
would go and you could do

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,800
you know learn all sorts of theoretical

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,560
concepts in these different fields

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,639
so you know developmental biology

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,759
economics cognitive science

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:18,080
you could click on one of these uh

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,280
buttons and you know it basically

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,080
presented papers with

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,240
annotations with some other information

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,120
it is very static and

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,039
you know it's it it's uh it was a

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,759
predecessor to wikipedia

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,199
but it did have this sort of uh you know

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,800
centered around a

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:39,680
uh an academic field flavor to it

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,280
um so why don't i introduce one instance

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,000
of one of these uh

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,759
uh epistemological directories and that

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,919
is called the knowledge space

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,919
and so we've implemented the knowledge

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,520
space in the area of cybernetics and

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,280
systems and so this is the github

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,280
repository here

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,720
and uh you'll see if you look at the

00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,000
full slides i think you can actually

00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,280
click on it and go to the github

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,199
repository

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,280
so this is a github repository and it

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,160
has a bunch of folders

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,560
these directories uh are topical stubs

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,560
so

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,919
you may be able to see here there are

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,440
different topics

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,600
and there are different granularities

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:17,520
you have like irreducibility

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:19,360
egrt general interactivity so there are

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,240
all these things that like as we've come

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,560
along

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,319
uh through this topical area we've

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,199
thought okay this is a good thing to put

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,600
a stub

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,199
in this directory for and so you can see

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,000
there are different granularities and

00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,520
they're different

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,240
they may be a little bit vague as to

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,000
what the topics contain but you click in

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,680
through to that directory and you could

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,080
read the readme file

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,800
and uh you can get a taste of what those

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,360
are

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,880
uh version control encourages edits from

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,400
the community and general public so

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,720
hosting it on github

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,680
we can use version control to bring in

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,560
people's

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,440
contributions and then uh the

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,360
directories

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,960
edits and content can all be proposed

00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,520
through pull requests

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,520
so it makes it uh quite a bit very

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,360
democratic in that way

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,680
so the idealized structure you know we

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,919
have when we go into one of these

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,759
folders or these directories we can do

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,000
things like render equations in a very

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:15,120
nice manner using markdown

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,280
we can also incorporate things like

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,000
jupiter notebooks and collab notebooks

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,360
so

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,759
if you're doing machine learning or if

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,440
you're doing like you know coding

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,599
you want to include some code in your

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,240
descriptions or your content you can do

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:30,080
that

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,680
and it's very easy to do in github um

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,840
so the second instance is called a

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,680
knowledge map and a knowledge map

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,280
is a little bit of a departure from the

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,199
last instance i showed

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,199
these are graphical representations and

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,960
so these are

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,720
timelines and historical summaries of

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,919
key events so this is why i talked about

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,759
history a bit

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,440
and knowledge maps can be used to

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,400
summarize directories in the knowledge

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,720
space so

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,639
we want to summarize things that happen

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,919
how did a field unfold and what are the

00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,599
key events

00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,759
and then we'll talk about in the third

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,919
instance epistemological maps and we'll

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,000
get to that slide in a couple of slides

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,319
but this is a going a little bit further

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,400
in that graphical direction

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,080
so this is an example of a knowledge map

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,720
uh this is a machine learning knowledge

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,960
map

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,560
it starts in the 1800s and the

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,879
granularity is a bit

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,080
you know uh you know most of the stuff

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,759
happens in the last

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,680
70 years but that's you know you can add

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,000
different uh categories you can add

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,400
different events different people and

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,560
that's what makes it dynamic

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,560
uh but you can also do something like

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,200
this have a

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,839
in the field of artificial life instead

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,839
of

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,200
machine learning and here you have a

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,080
little bit different approach this is

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,880
where we have a lot

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:48,240
of events people uh experiments

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,920
software platforms uh things like that

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,680
and they're all kind of like you know

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,839
they look very chaotic here

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,959
but you can you know go to one of these

00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,040
events

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,920
and in this case like open problems in

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,240
artificial life this was a

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,160
published conference proceeding so you

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,760
have names here you have a date

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,000
and then you can find out more about

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,880
each of those events

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,720
so uh one other thing couple of things

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,279
about knowledge maps to keep in mind is

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,959
that

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,800
you have a number of milestones per

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:19,360
duration of timeline so

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,399
depending on your pedagogical aim you

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,920
want to include

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,480
different types of milestones and

00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,160
different amounts of milestones so

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,600
you saw with comparing the machine

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,839
learning map and the

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,839
artificial life map that the artificial

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,519
life flap was much more dense

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,519
and that's important if you're trying to

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,920
teach you know maybe

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,680
a lot more about the field or you know

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,560
more intimate history or something like

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,800
that

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,560
uh so a small number of milestones may

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,760
take a minimal amount of information

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,839
approach

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,440
uh but the artificial life map might

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,920
take a different approach which is to

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,200
sort of

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,120
be inclusive in terms of the history um

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,600
and then milestones can stress common

00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,160
themes across learners so learners can

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,519
propose different miles or different

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,040
milestones or

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:08,079
or nodes into this into these uh

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,560
timelines and you know they can modify

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,040
them as

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,079
they need as they see fit or as maybe

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,680
someone with

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,360
some knowledge of the background of that

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,760
field sees fit

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,279
and you can stress obscure events say

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,600
that build the foundation for later

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,600
advances so in the artificial life map

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,519
we had things like core war and theseus

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,600
which were software programs

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,600
that weren't maybe very big at the time

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,640
but they led to advances later on and so

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,240
you'd want to include those in a map

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,160
so that those are those are knowledge

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,600
maps now epistemological maps which is

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,920
the third instance of this

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,160
takes us a little bit further uh this is

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,160
a again a visualization

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,720
um this is a theoretical sort of sketch

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,519
of it and you have uh two different

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,480
categories basically of facts uh one is

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,920
what do we know so the knowledge maps

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,560
that i showed you are things that we

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,480
know

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,079
uh this has has to do with the history

00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,600
of the field but these are things that

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,560
we know happened in the history of the

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,480
field

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,399
well what do we need to know is the

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,440
other k or what we don't know is the

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,079
other category

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,920
and so uh this goes maybe a little bit

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,279
beyond the history of the field

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,720
but it could be in the history of the

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,640
field we don't know maybe some of the

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,519
history of the field it may be pretty

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,079
obscure

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,200
unless you're a historian doing a lot of

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,600
research on on

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,720
you know topics like in computing we

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,320
have people who

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,320
made contributions and we've forgotten

00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,560
about and we'd like to bring them back

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,640
into the fold and so that's what these

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,800
little bars are here

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,399
under what do we need to know so we can

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,880
include events that were

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,800
previously obscured or maybe things that

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,680
we find through experiment

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,000
or some other research mode and so we

00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,480
can

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,680
then uh put build a distribution of

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,680
those facts

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,079
i talk about it very quantitatively but

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,040
you can do this in terms of a

00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:54,000
historiography

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,760
and you can build a better knowledge map

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,920
or history of the field

00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:01,440
and so this is all for education um

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,800
educational purposes but there are a

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,760
couple things you need to think about

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,240
here

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,079
we need to think about top down control

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,120
and the emergence within a community and

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,560
i think

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,560
we know we talk about community

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,959
standards uh we want to enforce

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,839
community standards but we also want to

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:19,200
allow people to uh build a knowledge

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,880
base over time

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,440
so we don't want to be too over you know

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:26,639
heavy-handed with community standards

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,000
we don't want to uh use an admin to say

00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,839
wash things that we don't think are

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,160
important but we also

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,120
don't want people just to propose things

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,760
that aren't really

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,200
critical to the learning experience and

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,959
so we need to clarify what is

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,519
significant

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,440
um and so finally i get to the fourth

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,040
instance which is frontier maps

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,959
and this is something my co-author has

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,519
been working on this is an

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:52,639
instance of his frontier map and so this

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,959
incorporates some of the elements of the

00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,000
of the first instance uh what he's done

00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,560
is he's read

00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,440
kind of reimagined this a bit and uh

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,519
he's built

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,480
broad taxonomy outside of traditional

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,200
disciplines

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,639
so he uses these macro tags techniques

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,000
discoveries and ideas

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,079
and these are these serve as like

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,040
directories here

00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,519
and those are you know ways that you can

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,279
like

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,440
think about it in terms of like going

00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,360
from the general to the specific so you

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,480
go from ideas

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,320
and discoveries to techniques or you can

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,000
use ideas and then techniques and you

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,760
can jump to discoveries it's

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,079
it's that sort of synergy that you can

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,920
build into these maps you know you have

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:34,720
different categories of thing and you

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,959
can build from that

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,920
but you also want to cover

00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:40,079
transdisciplinary topics

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,600
so you know you want to frame the map as

00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,160
a as a learner that grows their

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,160
educational resources so

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,440
right now jesse has artificial

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,959
intelligence

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,800
and systems and ethics in his um

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:55,120
frontier map but later that might

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,839
transmute and in different fields

00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,440
so it's very constructivist in that way

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,560
frontier maps should provide minimal

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,959
information to become

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,959
competent in the field so we go from

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,880
broad ideas and assumptions

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,560
and methods and techniques to systems

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,639
and then to theories

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,959
we can you know uh we have this sort of

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,880
staged complexity of discovery

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,480
you start at sort of the foundational

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,760
aspects of a field you build up to

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,839
specifics

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,000
and then nodes can lead to other nodes

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,399
so you can sub-reference different

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,839
uh topics and you can you know kind of

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,160
go down a rabbit hole but in a

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,240
controlled way

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,760
so in the future jesse would like to

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,320
build visualizations of

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,839
themes and individual nodes he'd like to

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,160
incorporate more things

00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,639
um you know jupiter notebooks and

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,959
tutorials and presentations

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,480
and then allow people to choose paths

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,279
would you like to be an individual

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,279
scholar

00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,720
or would you like to be heavily into the

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,959
collaborative space

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,160
and so that's that's something that

00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:55,040
talks about you know

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,360
uh learner mode or learner style and so

00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,120
that

00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:01,680
that's all part of his vision for that

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,279
finally i think one of the applications

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,839
is that you can integrate this with

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,519
you know digital courses with course

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,360
materials that are in your organization

00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,600
so in our organization

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,760
we have courses that we host this is one

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,720
of them this would be an example of

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,160
putting

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,199
these knowledge spaces into the course

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,440
curriculum

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,040
uh i don't show a really clear example

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,320
that here but you can imagine that we

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,279
can use these

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,920
to teach this topic in different various

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,519
topics in this curriculum

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,600
and we can incorporate it with other

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,320
technologies so we use

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,360
github as the host for this but we don't

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,720
have to

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:44,000
uh conversely we have all these other

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,800
uh forms of education in our uh digital

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,079
course

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,680
uh stack so we have github but we also

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,759
have hypothesis

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,839
which allows you to make notes in web

00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,519
pages we have getter which is an

00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,639
interactive chat

00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,959
we have micro badges that we use to you

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,399
know

00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:05,040
uh uh impart you know very small

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,959
scale lessons to students and then we

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,079
have youtube which allows us to stream

00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,800
video

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,519
of topics so all those things people are

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,160
learning

00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,240
in our organization uh and but we want

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,560
to also have this sort of

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,440
uh these sort of epistemological

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,800
directories

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:25,040
one is in terms of like basically

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,399
a reference so you can go back and look

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,199
at different topics

00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,240
and store things in your own topic uh

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,959
directory

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,160
and you know compare notes but also just

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,440
to have these

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,759
uh assets as part of these uh

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,639
directories to say you know use youtube

00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,519
videos

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,399
as a stub or use a hypothesis note as a

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,480
stub

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,519
and so those are all possibilities as

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,959
well

00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:52,600
uh finally i would like to talk about uh

00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,000
how we envision sort of

00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,079
interdisciplinarity

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,680
and so we think about this in a sort of

00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,680
a cybernetic model

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,800
so we think about this in terms of like

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,279
the evolution of these

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,720
type the these epis epistemological

00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,439
directories

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,360
so we facilitate new contributions from

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,120
allied fields on a regular basis so

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,199
people with different skill sets

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:16,079
and they want to learn about other areas

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,000
that may be relevant to our organization

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,240
and in the process they're making all

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,199
these cross-disciplinary discoveries

00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,880
so they're making their own

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,600
contributions based maybe on what they

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,079
know

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,240
or what they'd like to know and then

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,679
they identify key papers and historical

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,880
milestones and then there are other

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,799
people who maybe

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,400
have expertise in that area and they can

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,880
verify whether that's

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,720
important or not or maybe that's a good

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,520
thing to follow up on

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,080
and so this model of interdisciplinarity

00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,960
is based sort of on the practice of

00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,000
transdisciplinary so it's kind of like

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,039
building this emerging

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,919
community of you know transdisciplinary

00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,280
scholars

00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,960
they're all kind of helping each other

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,160
learn they're all learning kind of at

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,160
their own pace

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,840
and then you're building this resource

00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,440
uh for future learners and it's

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,679
improving with each iteration

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,799
so the community builds a model of

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,640
knowledge

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,320
rather than simply consulting or

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,600
borrowing from another field

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,280
and i say that uh with the caveat

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,880
of what we mentioned a couple slides

00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,200
back which is that

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,240
you know even if you have this community

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,400
of people

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,080
uh you know it's just one community of

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,799
people there are other perspectives out

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,240
there

00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:25,760
that might be you know uh that might be

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,280
able to give you more information so

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,000
they have their own biases their own

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,320
perspective

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,440
their own interests it's you know we

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,280
really want to

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,440
be as inclusive as possible to make

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,320
these really successful

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:41,200
and so finally i'll put in a plug for

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:44,000
the data reuse initiative

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,240
and this is our initiative that we do uh

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,600
for data reuse and data sharing so if

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,840
you're interested in

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,440
a bunch of topics in this area you

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,880
should check this out and we're

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:59,840
uh accepting collaborators in our in

00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,840
this project and thank you very much

00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,760
thank you so much bradley and it looks

00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,240
like there's one question

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,919
uh is what kind of informations would

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,520
what kind of innovations would

00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:14,320
further enable greater interactivity

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,880
between users and curators

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,880
i think maybe building on to the github

00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,440
functionality so building on like you

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,039
know

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,440
things that are more effective at

00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:26,400
interaction between maybe learners

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,440
or maybe like you know uh moderators and

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,120
learners

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,280
people with expertise bringing them

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,200
together so you know we use github and

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,799
github is a social component

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,440
but we really do need to have a more

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:39,840
explicit sort of interactivity

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,760
you know an interactive um aspect to

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,360
this and it's that's what's missing

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,280
among a couple other things but i think

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,240
that's the biggest thing

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:50,080
cool and another question is this is

00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,840
interesting and parallels a lot of basic

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,520
frameworks for archived libraries

00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,320
especially with regards to

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,960
transmissionary and interdisciplinary

00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,720
work

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,320
have you thought about learning from or

00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,480
partnering with librarians archivists

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,799
who have similar goals

00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,919
uh well yeah we're at an early stage in

00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,000
this so we would definitely be

00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:10,000
interested in input from

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,440
archivists librarians and other people

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,960
who have done

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,159
similar types of work um but yeah we're

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:20,720
looking for people

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:24,080
who would like to collaborate so

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,080
cool um

00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,400
thank you so much bradley for this

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:31,200
lovely presentation of

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,080
are there any more questions from from

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,840
the

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,840
studio audience

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,880
looks like there's a lot of

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,520
conversations about what software

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,520
might be best

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,360
and a lot of sharing of sets off of

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:52,159
different

00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:53,760
timeline type software awesome

00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,360
well then um if there's no other

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,360
question i am i'm sure

00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,360
um riley and jesse you'll be around on

00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,600
slack during the rest of csv conf and

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,120
perhaps in the future as well if anyone

00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,919
has any more questions feel free to drop

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,440
them a line

00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:09,360
in the q a in slack q a we're about one

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,360
minute away from closing ceremonies

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:14,320
so feel free to hop over to the closing

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:18,400
ceremonies url

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:27,440
and uh and hopefully see everyone there

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:27,440
