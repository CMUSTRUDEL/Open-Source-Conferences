Title: Christa Hasenkopf - Fighting air inequality by building a global air quality open data ecosystem
Publication date: 2020-05-28
Playlist: CSVConf 2020
Description: 
	Air inequality - the unequal access to breathe clean air across the world - is one of the biggest, yet most solvable problems of our time. Ninety-percent of the world’s population breathes air that doesn’t meet World Health Organization guidelines, and this results in an estimated 1 out of every 8 deaths on the planet, more deaths than caused by HIV/AIDS and malaria, combined. Creating a core data-sharing infrastructure for simple access to air quality information can enable an ecosystem of solutions and solvers across diverse geospatial scales and sectors. This presentation will share the impact of OpenAQ, a non-profit that has built an open-source air quality data-sharing infrastructure and community to fight air inequality around the world. Impact stories will include examples from science, policy, software development, and journalism.

so thanks first of all for being here at

00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:09,150
CFC conference it's our first time

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,030
participating in the conference but I

00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,559
think the idea that drives the

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,870
conference resonates a lot with our own

00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:18,480
mission and also seeing a lot of

00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:21,480
familiar faces and named so very excited

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,609
and grateful to be here with you all and

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,039
also excited to catch the kama AMA

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:28,859
that I did not get to catch yesterday so

00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,439
as an introduction I'm Krista Hayes and

00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:34,380
cope I'm with open AQ we are a

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,600
non-profit based in Washington DC and

00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:41,850
our mission is to fight hair inequality

00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:43,260
with open data and community and air in

00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:47,250
equality if you have not heard of it

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:50,250
before is a term our community of coin

00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:52,110
to express the severe human rights and

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,000
public health issue that the lack of

00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:59,100
clean air to breathe across the world

00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,870
poses to to all of us and so in this

00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,210
talk I'm going to cover a few points

00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:05,010
I'll talk a little bit about open excuse

00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:08,340
motivation in our missions I'll

00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:11,400
introduce the thank you platform I'll

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,200
share a few cool uses of the platform in

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,229
our community and I'll highlight two

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,630
particular use cases involving Co the 19

00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:20,610
in air quality and then share what's

00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:23,130
next for our community and how to get

00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:25,409
involved if you're interested I'll also

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,630
hopefully end a couple minutes early to

00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:30,540
take questions but if I don't please do

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:32,610
post any questions in the conference's

00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:36,270
Q&A flak Channel and I will definitely

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:38,700
answer your there so as I mentioned an

00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,110
air quality is a huge issue it's really

00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,630
one of the biggest public health and

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:45,149
human rights issues of our time air

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:47,460
pollution in general indoor and outdoor

00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:50,220
air pollution causes one out of every

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,649
eight deaths on a planet it's a huge

00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:55,250
issue and one of the things we've

00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:58,110
noticed in community after community is

00:01:55,250 --> 00:02:00,509
basic issues at tackling air pollution

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:03,780
at the local level is access basic

00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:06,270
access to air quality data and when that

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:10,229
access is enabled a community can

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:12,239
kontakion tackling the issue and so a

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:12,990
great example of this that we've seen

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,530
was

00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:19,100
in Beijing about ten years ago about ten

00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:21,810
years ago the US Embassy in Beijing

00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:24,030
watched a little air quality monitor on

00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:26,640
its rooftop that started sharing out air

00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:29,160
quality data via Twitter soon

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,070
third-party apps started scraping that

00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,660
data and suddenly millions of Beijingers

00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:36,450
for the first time we're walking around

00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,890
with air quality information on their

00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:41,010
phone that they could see in real time

00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:44,460
this created a huge stir and actually

00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:47,910
caused a series of actions from the

00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:50,010
Chinese government that improved open

00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:52,950
access to air quality data and also

00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:55,020
initiated many different policies air

00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:56,850
pollution policies both in Beijing and

00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:59,310
across the country in terms of

00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:02,160
monitoring but also mitigation of

00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:05,550
pollution and air pollution is still

00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:07,830
clearly a huge issue in in China and in

00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:10,530
Beijing but it has significantly

00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:12,690
improved year on year for the past about

00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,160
four or five years and you really can't

00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:16,080
trace a lot of that progress for the

00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:21,180
initial stir that was caused by there's

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,320
a little bit of open data and so we have

00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,180
found in the opening key community

00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:27,330
across the world or other examples as

00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:30,090
well where that basically when you open

00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:33,450
up this access to data that communities

00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:35,790
can affect policy change and so what we

00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:37,770
see is the challenges in many different

00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,660
locations is there's a lack of access to

00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:42,330
air quality data often in the most

00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:45,180
polluted places and that when data is

00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:47,400
shared it's often across many fields

00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:50,760
besides air pollution but often shared

00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:54,330
in an inconsistent format from place to

00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:56,460
place or formats it's temporary so on a

00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:58,380
say government website air quality

00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,510
information shared on an hourly basis

00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,490
and it gets updated in that data glass

00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:05,400
trade the access after that data has

00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:08,670
appeared and these these factors that

00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,200
prevent civil society from taking action

00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:12,270
to improve their quality in their local

00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,190
communities and so that's where our

00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:17,010
mission comes in we have a very simple

00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:19,859
mission which is to aggregate and

00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:21,570
harmonize existing disparate air quality

00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:24,780
data largely from government sources

00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:26,639
currently to put it into one format and

00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:29,400
make that data available in the way

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,620
that enable a larger public audience to

00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,229
use that data in the ways that their

00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:36,719
expertise best suits and so essentially

00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:39,749
extracting more value more impact from

00:04:36,719 --> 00:04:42,029
from that data so this can be data uses

00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:45,419
including you know app development

00:04:42,029 --> 00:04:48,719
education Public Health analysis other

00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:53,279
scientific use cases policy work a wide

00:04:48,719 --> 00:04:58,289
array of activities and so the idea

00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:59,909
behind this is that the platform the

00:04:58,289 --> 00:05:02,789
platform harmonizes this disparate air

00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:04,800
quality data enables the convening

00:05:02,789 --> 00:05:07,889
diverse sectors to improve the

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,750
coordination around building solutions

00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:11,159
and in general you're creating a

00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,439
healthier and more efficient data

00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:15,300
sharing ecosystem which really positions

00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:17,879
the civil society to better fight air

00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:24,089
inequality in local regions and across

00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:27,300
the world so to briefly introduce the

00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:32,039
open aq platform so if you go to open a

00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:35,849
Q or you'll see a world map of data from

00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:39,240
across the world and at various

00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:41,580
locations from currently 93 countries

00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:46,830
this data is also accessible for

00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:48,960
download on the platform everything you

00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:51,060
see on the website and in our platform

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,610
is open source has been created by an

00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,710
open source community I link here to our

00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:59,310
github page with the different

00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:01,620
repositories of our platforms code and

00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:03,689
the data is made available in a few

00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,060
different ways one is through the

00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:09,169
website I showed but also through an

00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:12,060
open API and there's a link to the docs

00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:13,770
there this is the same API that powers

00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,770
the website and anything that's built on

00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:18,870
top of our platform by ourselves and

00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:20,520
then there's also so this is the API and

00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:22,589
the website provides the past 90 days

00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:27,319
worth of data so you can also access

00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:31,259
that data of the s3 buckets on AWS

00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:33,750
we see quite a bit of usage of data from

00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:35,819
the platform we see on average about

00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,800
thirty three million data requests per

00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:39,779
month to to the platform so this equates

00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,200
to about 400 million data requests per

00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:42,360
year

00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:45,330
and these come from all over the world I

00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:47,910
will say there is a larger amount of

00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:49,650
data usage in the places from from the

00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:52,890
places where there is existing data so

00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:55,170
where you see data gaps you see less

00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:58,410
usage which makes sense and speaks to

00:06:55,170 --> 00:07:02,370
the need of generating more data in

00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:04,560
places with currently without any and so

00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:07,500
as I mentioned our our platform was

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,570
really created and is still in large

00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:13,380
part contributed by an open source

00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:15,390
community who also use the data so for

00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:17,820
example an open source contributor in

00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:22,620
our community from Mongolia a software

00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:25,440
developer Dogen wrote a code for to

00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:28,200
access data in Bosnia because there was

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,990
a small group in Tuzla Bosnia who were

00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,280
recording data by hand from a website so

00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:34,740
we had heard about this he wrote the

00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,630
adapter that got added to our system and

00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,760
then this group can now access that data

00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:42,600
much much more easily than they were

00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:46,170
before or another example is a Swedish

00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:48,530
app developer wanted to ingest Swedish

00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:51,530
air quality information into his apps

00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:54,260
contacted the Swedish environmental

00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:57,480
administration to adjust their API to

00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:59,580
provide all of the the data and metadata

00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:02,130
that our system requires so that the

00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,990
data can be ingested and as I mentioned

00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:06,420
and I'll give a few examples of other

00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:09,630
community uses of the data but there's

00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:12,150
been one popular example is smokey the

00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:15,150
air quality bought owl on Twitter and

00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:17,700
Facebook and on air pollution co-created

00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:19,440
by a developer who is based in Delhi

00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,820
India at the time and it really takes

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,130
the information that's shared on our

00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:26,670
platform that the raw information and

00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:28,110
helps present it in a very human way in

00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:32,970
a way that connects with the public in

00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:34,800
more ways and so we use the really the

00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:37,050
gravity of this massive data set to

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,060
convene local communities across sectors

00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:41,849
and we've done this in cities across the

00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:44,730
world in fact David the first speaker in

00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:48,030
this session was a participant in the

00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:50,220
workshop we held in Accra Ghana and the

00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:51,900
idea of these workshops is to get folks

00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,889
from across different sectors in a local

00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,509
area

00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:56,339
where there's an air inequality issue

00:08:54,509 --> 00:08:58,350
and find the low-hanging fruit that

00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:01,109
everyone can get behind to take an

00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:03,839
action so for instance in Sarajevo

00:09:01,109 --> 00:09:05,790
Bosnia the group the participants there

00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,189
decided that while there was a lot of

00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:11,279
open air quality data what was lacking

00:09:08,189 --> 00:09:12,899
was an understanding of how much

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:17,309
pollution was coming from which sources

00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:19,259
so the group which was comprised folks

00:09:17,309 --> 00:09:22,079
from a think-tank some scientists who

00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:24,299
could do the research some air quality

00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:26,160
agency staff they came together and

00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:28,169
decided to launch a field campaign on

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,939
figuring out just that how much

00:09:28,169 --> 00:09:32,609
pollution was coming from which sources

00:09:29,939 --> 00:09:34,290
in Sarajevo for the first time and they

00:09:32,609 --> 00:09:38,519
are just wrapping up that the work of

00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:42,480
that project now so I'll mention a few

00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:45,239
community uses of the data that we have

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,399
seen over the past few years and also

00:09:45,239 --> 00:09:49,949
briefly mentioned that who our community

00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:54,359
is so we conducted a survey a couple

00:09:49,949 --> 00:09:56,790
months ago to to figure out who is in

00:09:54,359 --> 00:09:59,309
the community and you can see it's quite

00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:03,869
diverse several different countries but

00:09:59,309 --> 00:10:05,699
you do still see the domination of the

00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:08,009
community being focused on where there

00:10:05,699 --> 00:10:10,350
is a lot of access to air quality data

00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:13,259
already and again points to this this

00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:17,519
data access gap where there's simply no

00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:19,110
data to really inject publicly so one

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,419
use case that we've seen from the

00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:24,419
research community is using the air

00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:27,239
quality data to inform air quality

00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:30,299
forecasts so a team at NASA for example

00:10:27,239 --> 00:10:32,249
they have a atmospheric chemistry model

00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:34,019
of air quality at the city level from

00:10:32,249 --> 00:10:35,759
various places around the world and they

00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:37,919
can test how well their model works by

00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:40,169
taking the observation data they access

00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:42,480
from the open aq platform in in near

00:10:40,169 --> 00:10:46,259
real-time to assess to assess their

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,989
model another example is the medium so

00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:50,579
data-driven journalists can access the

00:10:48,989 --> 00:10:52,709
information and make data visualizations

00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:55,259
that are relevant to their region or the

00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:58,319
world in this case so Bloomberg News

00:10:55,259 --> 00:11:00,600
recently launched Bloomberg green and

00:10:58,319 --> 00:11:02,369
one of the pieces of that has been as

00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,619
air pollution visualization that shows

00:11:02,369 --> 00:11:06,089
air quality across the world and they

00:11:04,619 --> 00:11:10,499
ingest data from

00:11:06,089 --> 00:11:12,420
we open a new API to to do that another

00:11:10,499 --> 00:11:14,550
example this is not so much a data use

00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,769
case but an example of how governments

00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:19,110
can be incentivized to open up data once

00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:21,569
you have a massive set of harmonized

00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:24,360
data in one place is we were recently

00:11:21,569 --> 00:11:29,100
contacted by the Icelandic environmental

00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:31,860
agency to help them build their API in a

00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:33,930
way that would let their data be shared

00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:36,629
on to open a queue which was which was

00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:38,999
awesome so now that data appears on on

00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:41,339
open a queue and again I think it speaks

00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:44,870
to the fact that if you do have data in

00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:47,639
one place in a harmonized fashion it can

00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:49,589
get more data so data can be get more

00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:52,019
data and incentivize governments to to

00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:55,170
open their data in a fully harmonized

00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:56,879
able fashion so I did want to highlight

00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:59,249
a couple examples we've seen from our

00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:01,589
community recently around Koba 19 and

00:11:59,249 --> 00:12:03,209
air quality you may have seen some

00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:05,819
articles in the news around air quality

00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:10,519
and how it's been changing with Cobin 19

00:12:05,819 --> 00:12:10,519
lockdowns and and what this can can mean

00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,899
so one example we've seen from our

00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:18,179
community comes from India from shrap go

00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:20,490
to Kunda at urban emissions with some

00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:22,769
fantastic series of analyses I have a

00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:24,480
link there to the article I can also

00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:28,319
post that in the slack channel that

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,089
shows an analysis of what air pollution

00:12:28,319 --> 00:12:33,329
specifically in this case shown here

00:12:30,089 --> 00:12:34,949
nitrogen dioxide is was doing before and

00:12:33,329 --> 00:12:36,420
then during the onset of the lockdown

00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:40,379
period in Delhi

00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:44,160
nitrogen dioxide is a pollutant that is

00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:47,790
associated with transportation cars you

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:50,249
can see a pretty market decrease after

00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:52,050
the lockdown period and so the reason

00:12:50,249 --> 00:12:54,059
for us able to do this sort of analysis

00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:57,149
is because the data is available in a

00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:59,009
near real-time fashion and also in in

00:12:57,149 --> 00:13:01,379
one harmonized place and he's done this

00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:04,399
analysis for various pollutants in

00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:08,100
various cities across across India a

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:09,899
really interesting preliminary analysis

00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,759
that's been done globally comes from

00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:13,889
this Norwegian group where they took

00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:16,980
satellite data and they also access data

00:13:13,889 --> 00:13:19,379
from the open aq platform for 27

00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:21,509
countries and did a more

00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:24,269
global analysis of the impact of

00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:25,739
lockdowns across the world so they

00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:29,129
looked at the two-week period after a

00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:30,779
lockdown and compared that air the air

00:13:29,129 --> 00:13:32,999
quality previous does that period they

00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:34,319
also controlled for meteorology and

00:13:32,999 --> 00:13:37,799
other conditions that could be changing

00:13:34,319 --> 00:13:39,629
during this time and they found over all

00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:43,409
pollutants and over the 27 countries

00:13:39,629 --> 00:13:44,999
they looked at 20% decline on average of

00:13:43,409 --> 00:13:47,309
pollution and then they want to step

00:13:44,999 --> 00:13:49,319
further and link that to some human

00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:51,119
health impacts as well and what we can

00:13:49,319 --> 00:13:54,779
glean from this is sort of a silver

00:13:51,119 --> 00:13:57,689
lining to to the Koba 19 lockdown for

00:13:54,779 --> 00:14:00,089
air quality policy going forward and so

00:13:57,689 --> 00:14:01,829
there's a link there to the preprint I

00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:03,839
know it's small again I can share it on

00:14:01,829 --> 00:14:07,349
the Q&A flag channel if anyone is

00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,999
interested but again the the the reason

00:14:07,349 --> 00:14:10,649
this preliminary analysis can be done in

00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:12,749
such a timely manner is because the data

00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:15,539
is available programmatically and in a

00:14:12,749 --> 00:14:17,429
harmonized fashion so that the people

00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:19,829
who want to do such an analysis can get

00:14:17,429 --> 00:14:21,539
to doing what they do as quickly as

00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:24,389
possible and apply their their expertise

00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:26,879
instead of Wrangell data so if you'd

00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:28,139
like to hear briefly what's next for the

00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:30,209
opening Q community and how to get

00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:32,939
involved that's how we'll end this out

00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:35,399
so what's next for us we are really

00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:37,799
excited to be expanding our platform and

00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:39,389
really launching a pilot platform that

00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:42,499
will include low-cost air quality

00:14:39,389 --> 00:14:45,899
sensing in our system right now we

00:14:42,499 --> 00:14:48,929
primarily share government and some

00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:50,100
research grade air quality data and one

00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,839
of the biggest demands we've gotten from

00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,239
our community is the ability to host

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,129
low-cost air quality sensing data so we

00:14:54,239 --> 00:14:58,470
are not launching world-class sensors

00:14:56,129 --> 00:15:00,419
ourselves but it rather saying for low

00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:02,039
class sensing initiatives out there that

00:15:00,419 --> 00:15:04,079
want to share their data in a harmonized

00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:05,699
way alongside both other low class

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:08,879
sensing initiatives as well as these

00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:11,220
other government sources that we're

00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:13,229
building a pilot platform to do that and

00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:15,299
one of the hopes is that this helps fill

00:15:13,229 --> 00:15:16,769
in those data gaps and regions where

00:15:15,299 --> 00:15:19,199
there's not government monitoring or

00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:22,349
there's not open sharing of that data by

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:24,419
the government yet and we're always

00:15:22,349 --> 00:15:26,129
working on various tools and light

00:15:24,419 --> 00:15:28,109
visualizations that help the community

00:15:26,129 --> 00:15:30,119
do more we ourselves aren't building an

00:15:28,109 --> 00:15:32,399
app or sort of an end product but rather

00:15:30,119 --> 00:15:33,180
building the tooling infrastructure that

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,850
helped others do

00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:38,130
more with the data so for example we're

00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:41,820
working on a data averaging tool that

00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:44,220
averages spatially and temporally in our

00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:47,400
system so that you can get back the Eric

00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:49,380
forty average daily value in Beijing as

00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,760
opposed to the hourly level at the

00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:54,480
station level which is what our raw

00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:56,040
system provides now so with that I'll

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,990
close out I'll say if you would like to

00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:01,680
get involved in our community or one day

00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:03,450
here more we would love for you to reach

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,640
out to us I've had my email in the

00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:08,100
bottom right hand corner Chris pad open

00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:10,080
acute org form any of the five so please

00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:12,690
feel free to reach out that way or an

00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:15,120
info at opening chute org we also have a

00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:17,550
public clack channel that I'd invite you

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,930
all to join as well where we have a

00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:22,830
bunch of folks from different sectors

00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:25,230
who share their interest throughout air

00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:27,180
and equality or share what they're

00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:29,550
building on top of the platform or ask

00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:31,710
questions about how to use the data so

00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:34,470
with that I'll say thank you again for

00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:36,810
everyone's attention and for the ability

00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:39,660
to present today yeah thank you

00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:41,490
there's a it's really great a lot of

00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:44,370
people in the chat saying wow and

00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:46,920
clapping along the way so it's amazing

00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:50,670
work so just real quick wanted to remind

00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:52,500
everybody who's listening there is a the

00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:54,510
way that they works is there is another

00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,240
session session seven that's starting so

00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:58,410
another crowdcast

00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:02,060
URL that's starting in a couple minutes

00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:06,210
and so check your schedules check the

00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:08,040
links and make sure that you attend

00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:10,110
different sessions throughout the day um

00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:12,570
but I do think we have time for one one

00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:14,190
question I mean I I was just thinking

00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:15,750
about myself I work at the University of

00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:17,310
California and I know there are

00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:20,130
researchers that use this kind of data

00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:21,930
to like crunch and analyze against

00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:23,010
social science and Humanities data to

00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:26,280
like kind of say like what are they

00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:28,050
effect the effects of air quality on you

00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,400
know ethnographic research or on

00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:31,590
different things there's a project out

00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,650
of UC Irvine called the asthma files

00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:36,300
that's like about trying to bring air

00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:38,250
quality into the discussion around

00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:40,080
social science and so I was just

00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:42,180
thinking I'm talking a lot about public

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,190
health but then also like how the access

00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:46,350
to this information affects other types

00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,980
of research and like opens up so much

00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:51,780
more

00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:54,360
disciplinary research and I just thought

00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,799
like it you know there your emphasis is

00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:59,100
on public health but I just thought like

00:17:55,799 --> 00:18:00,750
are what are your thoughts around kind

00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,340
of how it affects and how it can affect

00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:05,669
the social sciences and the humanities

00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:07,980
as well yeah I think that's a

00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:09,330
fascinating question you know I'm a

00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,710
physical scientist by training but I

00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:12,960
think some of the aspects that have

00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:14,640
captivated me most about seeing how

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,340
people are using the data or its impact

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:20,240
have been around more the social science

00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:23,299
realm I you know early on we did a

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,620
really light analysis of just seeing how

00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:27,150
with access to these real-time air

00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,740
quality levels and then if you look at

00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:31,350
Google searches that correspond in

00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:34,559
various regions during their apocalypses

00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:36,870
how how interest changes or shifts from

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:39,150
people googling air pollution versus

00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:40,650
climate change actually so I think it's

00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:43,799
I think it's fascinating to see how

00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:45,390
folks are motivated to to change the

00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:47,669
other thing that I'd point out is you

00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:49,440
know with the example from Beijing

00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:52,710
or were several other examples we've

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:57,690
seen it's not that the science changed

00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:59,460
it's not that what really changed was

00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:01,500
the act that the way the information was

00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:03,090
presented to them to the people to the

00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,620
public and then the public getting

00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:06,059
activated on the issue is the social

00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:08,340
issue it wasn't really the sort of

00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:10,350
technology issue the data and there's no

00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:12,360
idea let's that data be shared was was I

00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:14,340
guess the key thing that needed to be in

00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:18,059
place but it's really getting that data

00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:19,919
in a way that you can let the social

00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:21,720
impacts happen more so than I think

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,630
anything anything else

00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:27,330
yeah okay I love this some this trigger

00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:30,390
event - that's like I'm the Beijing came

00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:32,760
from a little bit of either intentional

00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:35,669
or accidental advocacy by the US Embassy

00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:38,700
there that then sparked this information

00:19:35,669 --> 00:19:40,940
you know ripple effect that created

00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,840
social change and I think like the

00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:44,700
potential that you're creating with

00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,490
creating that same kind of ripple effect

00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:51,030
in other communities is amazing so

00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:54,240
really great work that's awesome yeah so

00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:56,280
I think that's it for time so we have

00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:00,450
the questions for Christa that will be

00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,960
moving over to slack and also slides rep

00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:03,270
runs a note

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,779
and we'll see you in the next session

00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,779
