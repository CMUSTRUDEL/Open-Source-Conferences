Title: Christa Hasenkopf - Fighting air inequality by building a global air quality open data ecosystem
Publication date: 2020-05-28
Playlist: CSVConf 2020
Description: 
	Air inequality - the unequal access to breathe clean air across the world - is one of the biggest, yet most solvable problems of our time. Ninety-percent of the world’s population breathes air that doesn’t meet World Health Organization guidelines, and this results in an estimated 1 out of every 8 deaths on the planet, more deaths than caused by HIV/AIDS and malaria, combined. Creating a core data-sharing infrastructure for simple access to air quality information can enable an ecosystem of solutions and solvers across diverse geospatial scales and sectors. This presentation will share the impact of OpenAQ, a non-profit that has built an open-source air quality data-sharing infrastructure and community to fight air inequality around the world. Impact stories will include examples from science, policy, software development, and journalism.
