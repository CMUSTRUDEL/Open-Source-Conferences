Title: Hao Ye - Accessibility and reproducibility in ecological time series analysis
Publication date: 2020-05-28
Playlist: CSVConf 2020
Description: 
	Although many scientific datasets are now shared openly and there are numerous tools for reproducible research, many barriers remain. Datasets are diversely structured and dispersedly situated; most domain scientists lack formal training in data management, software development, or reproducible research; and learning these skills or assembling a skilled team requires a large investment of time and/or resources. To resolve these challenges, we built MATSS (Macroecological Analysis of Time Series Structure), an R package that provides access to over 80,000 ecological time series in a standardized format and promotes best practices in computational research through reproducible & shareable templates of full workflows bundled as research compendia ~ Marwick et al. 2018.
