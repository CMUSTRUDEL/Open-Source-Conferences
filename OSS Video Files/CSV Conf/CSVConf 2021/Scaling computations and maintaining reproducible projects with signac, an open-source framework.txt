Data science projects are often messy, with complex workflows and large, heterogeneous parameter spaces. Bash scripting and long file names can only get you so far, and can result in a project that is incomprehensible to collaborators or your future self. The open-source data management framework, signac, (https://signac.io) makes it easy to maintain organized and reproducible projects, and integrates with existing file-based workflows. The serverless data management and lightweight workflow model ensure that projects are easily transferable between laptops and high-performance computing environments, and the data model is well suited for high-dimensional parameter searches or hyperparameter optimization of machine learning models. In this talk, we will demonstrate the signac approach to managing data science projects, emphasizing its use in real-world scenarios. The signac framework not only increases research efficiency, but makes best practices and scalability easy and intuitive.
