Title: Brigitte Vezina - Should open content be used to train artificial intelligence?
Publication date: 2021-05-20
Playlist: CSVConf 2021
Description: 
	Developments in artificial intelligence (AI) raise several questions when it comes to the use of copyright material and Creative Commons-licensed content in particular. One of them is whether CC-licensed content (photographs, artworks, text, music, etc.) should be used as input to train AI. This question illustrates the tension between the value of open data vs. legitimate concerns about ethical, moral and responsible use of openly licensed content, which this session will explore.

hi thank you so much um i'll just share my screen

00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:21,980
and yes say again that um i am extremely pleased to be here so thank you so much for the opportunity

00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:28,679
to speak at this conference um my name is bridget visna and i'm the director of policy

00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:34,550
at creative commons so my background is in in copyright law and so it's from that perspective

00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:40,430
that i'll be speaking to today about open content but more specifically creative commons

00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:47,740
license content and artificial intelligence so there's actually many questions that we

00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:52,080
need to find answers to and many problems that we need to find solutions to but i'll

00:00:52,080 --> 00:01:00,500
focus on one today and that's can or or should openly license content and by that i mean

00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:07,869
photographs or artworks text or music especially creative commons license content should it

00:01:07,869 --> 00:01:15,159
be used as an input to train ai and to answer these questions we have to take a look at

00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:21,740
the the cc licenses and tools themselves but even before that um let me share a real life

00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:29,240
example maybe some of you have heard of it in 2019 uh we at creative commons learned

00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:35,369
that researchers at companies like ibm were training their facial recognition ai programs

00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:41,979
by feeding their algorithms with cc license photos that were publicly available um on

00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:47,330
flickr for example so i think there was about one million sorry let me go back there was

00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:54,380
about one million photos uh taken from flickr website uh used to to train this uh facial

00:01:54,380 --> 00:02:00,079
recognition program uh those photos were openly accessible through creative commons licenses

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:08,050
um and ibm had not told or even asked permission from the people that were either photographed

00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:15,670
or from the photographers however some flickr users were dismayed to learn that ibm had

00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:22,049
used their cc license photos to train the ai all the more so as it was done for commercial

00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:29,370
advantage they had questions about the ethics and the privacy implications of such a data

00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:37,150
set being used for algorithmic training so the question was well do the terms of the

00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:44,599
cc licenses allow the open content to be used as input to train ai without any further permission

00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:51,519
from the licensor and to get a sense of the various views on this question we launched

00:02:51,519 --> 00:03:01,269
a twitter poll back in january and nearly half of the respondent says it depends and

00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:07,900
we agree and here's why it depends i'm hearing a bit of background noise and maybe it's just

00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:16,670
me um it's like yes i'm better um so on the one hand uh creative commons is dedicated

00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:22,129
to facilitating greater access and openness for the common good so we believe that the

00:03:22,129 --> 00:03:28,579
use of openly accessible content can lead to greater innovation collaboration and creativity

00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:35,319
we also believe that the limitations within copyright law which generally privilege their

00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:41,129
reuse of the facts and the ideas that are embodied in creative works contribute to a

00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:50,060
rich and generative public domain so we support in principle broad access and use of copyright

00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:56,450
works including openly licensed content to train artificial intelligence systems because

00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:05,200
such access can for instance help reduce bias it can enhance inclusivity and inclusion it

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:11,680
can promote important activities like education and research and it can also foster beneficial

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:21,030
innovation in the development of ai but on the other hand with new patterns of online

00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:27,400
sharing billions upon billions of copyrighted works that have become the basis of business

00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:35,590
models including those that are built about processing all that content turned data copyright

00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:43,000
licensing becomes inextricably linked to privacy and ethical concerns and something that the

00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,080
licenses were not originally designed to address so as people share vacation photos online

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,949
for example on flickr they're contributing to a massive trove of data that's processed

00:04:55,949 --> 00:05:02,360
by potentially you know a lot of machine learning or algorithms and i should note that this

00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:07,840
is likely to be the case whether or not they're these photos are shared using cc licensing

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:15,750
or not because in many jurisdictions at least in the united states copyright has very limited

00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:22,919
purview over machine learning and also to the extent that copyright can be leveraged

00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:28,810
to restrict invasive machine learning over content uh creative commons is is reluctant

00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:35,110
to kind of encourage weaponizing copyright law for purposes that are far outside the

00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:45,030
original goals of copyright so um i i think it's important to recall at this point that

00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:51,660
creative commons licenses are copyright licenses they're designed to give creators of all types

00:05:51,660 --> 00:06:00,080
of work a simple way to grant public permissions um to use their works these tools were or

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,449
licenses and tools they were a response to overly restrictive copyright laws in the context

00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:12,980
of a digital ecosystem where sharing and remix were easy and ubiquitous but where copyright

00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:20,169
was imposing unnecessary barriers to the exchange of knowledge and culture so what does this

00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:26,979
mean in the context of ai training well quick refresher about the cc licenses three three

00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:33,150
main points the first one is that our licenses they don't restrict the reuse to any particular

00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:40,069
types of reuse or technologies so long as the the terms of the license are respected

00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:48,560
so that's the attribution requirement so cc by the share alike or sa no derivatives or

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:57,409
nd and non-commercial nc so from a strictly copyright perspective there's no special or

00:06:57,409 --> 00:07:02,289
explicit permission that's required from the license store to use the cc license content

00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:08,349
to train the ai applications to the extent that covered permission is required at all

00:07:08,349 --> 00:07:14,930
and that brings me to the second point which is that the licenses do not override limitations

00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:23,190
and exceptions like fair use so if a use is not one that requires permission under copyright

00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:29,650
or suicionaris database rights for example if it's if it's text and data mining that's

00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:35,949
allowed under an exception to copyright one may conduct the ai training activity without

00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:43,449
regard to the cc license and the third point is it's also report important to recall that

00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:51,629
our licenses operate within the copyright system so privacy personality publicity and

00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:58,939
other types of rights or even ethical considerations are not covered by the licenses they're not

00:07:58,939 --> 00:08:05,689
universal policy tools they're they're limited to the confines of copyright law and copyright

00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:12,460
is the primary obstacle to reuse that the licenses solve but there are many other issues

00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:18,300
that are related to the reuse of content that our licenses do not address and that re-users

00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:25,330
have to be aware of and like i said this includes privacy rules governing ethical research the

00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:32,390
collection the use of data data protection and these have to be addressed and respected

00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:38,349
separate and apart from the copyright issues that the licenses cover so we do our best

00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:45,100
to ensure that those releasing their creations under cc licenses understand the scope of

00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:50,910
the copyright right that are managed under the licenses so if a license may offer users

00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:57,480
permission to reuse a photo it would not offer the permission to make the use of the the

00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:04,380
personal likeness of the people in the photos which might be governed by image or personality

00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:12,410
rights so whether one has to comply with the copyright regime and hence with the the cc

00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:17,650
license terms will depend on whether the type of ai training activity is an exercise of

00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:26,570
a right reserve to the rights holder this is a very useful um workflow if you if you

00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:32,070
really are facing this question i encourage you to take a screenshot right now i won't

00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:39,370
be going through every single um tree branch but i think it's a good representation of

00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:44,730
the many situations might one might encounter

00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:50,750
and one of the the main difficulties that there remains significant legal uncertainty

00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:57,190
about whether copyright applies to ai training which means it's not always clear whether

00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:03,600
a cc license applies so in other words there is no consensus on whether the use of copyright

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:10,779
words as inputs to train an ai system is an exercise of an exclusive right right it doesn't

00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:16,720
involve reproduction of the work does it um does it involve its adaptation et cetera does

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:23,649
it trigger some kind of exercise of an exclusive right i'm happy to go through this in the

00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:29,620
q a if we have time at the end by the way and like i said the situation is likely to

00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:36,510
vary across jurisdictions because countries are now progressively regulating the copyright

00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:42,760
ai nexus like i mentioned in the u.s the use of warps to train ai is likely considered

00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:50,800
fair use and in the eu there's article uh three and four of the dsm directives that

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:57,950
i would refer to uh that's on text and data mining that um that foresees a a regime that's

00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:04,330
a bit different whether the tdm is done for commercial or non-commercial purposes but

00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:09,610
as a matter of copyright law so the we believe that the use of works to train ai should be

00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:15,230
considered not infringing by default assuming that access to the works was lawful at the

00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:21,450
point of input so to give you an example if someone conducts text and data mining in the

00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:28,450
context of research or education and that's allowed under an exception following the adduct

00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:33,050
that the the right to read is the right to mine then the licenses would not be triggered

00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:43,260
however uh we do recognize that today every act of online sharing potentially implicates

00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:50,870
privacy or ethical concerns and some believe that this is an inevitability that foregoing

00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:56,480
personal privacy is necessary when sharing content online but we still imagine a world

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,970
where sharing and privacy can co-exist and that this coexistence is paramount to sustaining

00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:09,350
free and democratic societies and this is why our new strategy um i have a little excerpt

00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:16,519
up there on the screen um it recognizes that we need an approach that transcends copyright

00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:22,430
so the conversation on artificial intelligence within copyright policy must be held also

00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:27,740
in a coordinated and inclusive manner and through the lens of ethics responsibility

00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:33,589
sustainability also cultural rights and human rights and personality rights and privacy

00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:43,430
rights and data protection um yeah as with any fundamental ideal the openness of data

00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:49,380
is should not be considered an absolute end in and of itself but it has to be balanced

00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:54,930
with equally valid considerations the ones that i just mentioned to ensure that sharing

00:12:54,930 --> 00:13:00,850
ultimately benefits the public right we want to promote better sharing for a brighter future

00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:07,959
and that might be where the future of open is so beyond copyright issues um artificial

00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:12,710
intelligence is likely to affect the sharing of creative content and the open community

00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:19,360
in general and this legal uncertainty that i mentioned caused by the ethical concerns

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:27,570
about ai the lack of transparency of ai algorithms and the patterns of privatization and enclosure

00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:34,430
of ai outputs all together they constitute yet another obstacle to better sharing because

00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:41,910
for many creators these concerns are a reason not to share so while we we do support broad

00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:46,890
access to content we also aim to increase our understanding of the ethical concerns

00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:49,480
that may constitute barriers to open sharing

00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:56,880
Hi. Thank you so much. I'll just share my screen. And yeah. So, again, that I'm extremely

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:02,880
pleased to be here. So, thank you so much for the opportunity to speak at this conference.

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:13,070
My name is Brigitte Vezina and I'm the director of policy at Creative Commons. So, my background

00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:18,769
is in copyright law. It's from that perspective I'll be speaking today about open comment,

00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:24,360
but mostly creative license comment and artificial intelligence. There's answers and problems

00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:31,060
we need to find answers to. But I'll focus on one today and that's, can or should openly

00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:34,350
licensed content -- by that I mean photographs or artworks, text or music, especially Creative

00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:38,930
Commons licensed content -- should it be used as an input to train AI?

00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:45,540
And to answer these questions, we have to take a look at the CC licenses and tools themselves.

00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,570
But even before that, let me share a real life example. Maybe some of you have heard

00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:54,740
of it. In 2019, we at Creative Commons learned that researchers at companies like IBM were

00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:59,370
training their facial recognition AI programs by feeding their algorithms with CC-licensed

00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:03,550
photos that were publicly available on Flickr, for example. So, I think there was about 1

00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:04,550
million -- sorry -- let me go back. There was about 1 million photos taken from Flickr

00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,769
website used to train this facial recognition program. Those photos were openly accessible

00:15:06,769 --> 00:15:09,694
through Creative Commons licenses. And IBM had not told or even asked permission from

00:15:09,694 --> 00:15:13,090
the people that were either photographed or from the photographers.

00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:14,090
However, some Flickr users were dismayed to learn that IBM had used their CC licensed

00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,090
photos to train AI. All the more so, as it was done for commercial advantage. They had

00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:17,740
questions about the ethics and the privacy implications of such a dataset being used

00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:21,720
for algorithmic training. So, the question was, well, do the terms of the CC licenses

00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,111
allow the open content to be used as input to train AI without any further permission

00:15:24,111 --> 00:15:26,230
from the licensor? To get information on the various views of this question, we launched

00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,230
a Twitter poll back in January. And nearly half of the respondents says, "It

00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,230
depends." And we agree. And here's why it depends. I'm hearing a bit of background noise.

00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,230
Maybe it's just me. Yes. Better. So, on the one hand, Creative Commons is dedicated to

00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:33,410
facilitating greater access and openness for the common good. So, we believe that the use

00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:36,029
of openly-accessible content can lead to greater innovation, collaboration, and creativity.

00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:41,500
We also believe that the limitations within copyright law, which generally privilege their

00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:48,100
reuse of the facts and the ideas that are embodied in creative works, contribute to

00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:54,680
a rich and generative public domain. So, we support, in principle, broad access

00:15:54,680 --> 00:16:00,660
and use of copyright works. Including openly-licensed content to train artificial intelligence systems.

00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:07,130
Because such access can, for instance, help reduce bias. It can enhance inclusivity and

00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:11,943
inclusion. It can promote important activities like education and research. And it can also

00:16:11,943 --> 00:16:12,943
foster beneficial innovation in the development of AI.

00:16:12,943 --> 00:16:15,930
But on the other hand, with new patterns of online sharing billions upon billions of copyrighted

00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:18,290
works that have become the basis of business models, including those that are built upon

00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,250
processing all that content turned data, copyright licensing becomes inextricably linked to privacy

00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:24,283
and ethical concerns. And something that the licenses were not originally designed to address.

00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:25,283
So, as people share my vacation photos online, for example, on Flickr, they're contributing

00:16:25,283 --> 00:16:26,283
to a massive trove of data that's processed by potentially, you know, a lot of machine

00:16:26,283 --> 00:16:28,380
learning algorithms. And I should note that this is likely to be the case whether or not

00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,480
these photos are shared using CC licensing or not. Because in many jurisdictions, at

00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,480
least in the United States, copyright has very limited purview over machine learning.

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,470
And also, to the extent that copyright can be leveraged to restrict invasive machine

00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:40,250
learning over content, Creative Commons is reluctant to kind of encourage weaponizing

00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:44,880
copyright law for purposes that are far outside the original goals of copyright.

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,300
So, I -- I think it's important to recall at this point that Creative Commons licenses

00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,440
are copyright licenses. They're designed to give creators of all types of work a simple

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,850
way to grant public permissions to use their works. These tools were -- or licenses and

00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:53,850
tools, they were a response to overly-restrictive copyright laws in the context of a digital

00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:55,910
ecosystem where sharing and remix were easy and ubiquitous, but where copyright was imposing

00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,040
unnecessary barriers to the exchange of knowledge and culture.

00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,390
So, what does this mean in the context of AI training? Well, a quick refresher about

00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,390
the CC licenses. Three main points. The first one is that our licenses, they don't restrict

00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,390
their reuse to any particular types of reuse or technologies so long as the terms of the

00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,390
license are respected. So, that's the attribution requirement, CC, BY, the share, SA, nonderivatives,

00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:05,280
ND, and noncommercial, NC. So, there's no special or explicit permission required from

00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,793
the licensor to train the CC licenses to override the licenses. That's not that government permission

00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:11,360
is required at all. The second point is the licenses do not override

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,770
limitations and exceptions like fair use. If a use is not one that requires permission

00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:14,770
under copyright or the database rights. For example, if it's -- if it's text and data

00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:15,770
mining that's allowed under an exception to copyright, one may conduct the AI training

00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:16,770
activity without regard to the CC license. And the third point is it's also important

00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:17,770
to recall that our licenses operate within the copyright system. So, privacy, personality,

00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:18,770
publicity, and other types of rights or even ethical consideration are not covered by the

00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:19,770
licenses. They're not universal policy tools. They're limited to the confines of copyright

00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:20,770
law. And copyright is the primary obstacle to reuse

00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:21,770
that the licenses solve. But there are many other issues that are related to the reuse

00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:22,770
of content that our licenses do not address and that re-users have to be aware of. Like

00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:23,770
I said, this includes privacy, rules with ethical research, and protection. And these

00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:24,770
have to be addressed and respected, separate and apart from the copyright issues that the

00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:26,015
licenses cover. So, we do our best to ensure that those releasing their creations under

00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,015
CC licenses understand the scope of the copyright right that are managed under the licenses.

00:17:27,015 --> 00:17:29,500
So, if a license may offer users permission to reuse a photo, it would not offer the permission

00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:33,130
to make the use of the personal likeness of the people in the photos. Which might be governed

00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:35,540
by image or personality rights. So, whether one has to comply with the copyright

00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:39,520
regime and hence with the CC license terms will depend on whether the type of AI training

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,520
activity is an exercise of a right reserved to the rights holder. This is a very useful

00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,520
workflow if you really are facing this question. I encourage you to take a screenshot right

00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,520
now. I won't be going through every single tree branch. But I think it's a good representation

00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,520
of the many situations one might encounter. And one of the main difficulties that there

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,930
remains significant legal uncertainty about whether copyright applies to AI training.

00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:49,390
Which means it's not always clear whether a CC license applies.

00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:50,690
So, in other words, there's no consensus on whether the use of copyright works as inputs

00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:51,690
to train an AI system is an exercise of an exclusive right, right? It doesn't involve

00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:52,690
reproduction of the work. Does it involve its adaptation? Et cetera. Does it trigger

00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:53,690
some kind of exercise of an exclusive right? I'm happy to go through this in the Q&A if

00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:54,690
we have time at the end, by the way. And like I said, the situation is likely to

00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:55,690
vary across jurisdictions because countries are now progressively regulating the copyright

00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:56,690
AI Nexus. Like I mentioned in the US, the use of works to train AI is likely considered

00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:57,690
fair use. And in the EU, there's Article 3 and 4 of the DSM directives that I would refer

00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:58,690
to that's on text and data mining that -- that foresees a regime that's different. Whether

00:17:58,690 --> 00:17:59,690
the TDM is done for a commercial or non-commercial purposes. But as a matter of copyright law,

00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:00,690
we believe the use of works to train AI should be not infringing by default. Assuming that

00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:01,690
access to the works was lawful at the point of input.

00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:02,690
So, to give you an example, if someone conducts text and data mining in the context of research

00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:03,690
or education and that's allowed under an exception following the right to read it, the right

00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:04,690
to mine. Then the licenses would not be triggered. However, we do recognize that today every

00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:05,690
act of online sharing potentially implicates privacy or ethical concerns. And some believe

00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:06,690
this is an inevitability, that foregoing personal privacy is necessary when sharing content

00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:07,690
online. But we still imagine a world where sharing and privacy can co-exist and this

00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:08,690
coexistence is paramount to sustaining free and democratic societies. And this is why

00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:09,690
our new strategy, I have a little excerpt up on the screen, it recognizes that we need

00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:10,690
an approach that transcends copyright. So, the conversation on artificial intelligence

00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:11,690
within copyright policy must be held also in a coordinated and inclusive manner and

00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:12,690
through the use of ethics, sustainability, and privacy rights and data protection.

00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:13,690
Yeah. As with any fundamental ideal, the openness of data is -- should not be considered an

00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:14,690
absolute end in and of itself. But it has to be balanced with equally valid considerations.

00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:15,690
So, ones I just mentioned. To ensure that sharing ultimately benefits the public, right?

00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:16,690
We want to promote better sharing for a brighter future. And that might be where the future

00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:17,690
of open is. So, beyond copyright issues, artificial intelligence is likely to affect the sharing

00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:18,690
of creative content and the open community in general. And this legal uncertainty that

00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:19,690
I mentioned caused by the ethical concerns about AI, the lack of transparency of AI algorithms

00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:20,690
and the patterns of privatization and enclosure of AI outputs all together they constitute

00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:21,690
yet another obstacle to better sharing. Because for many creators, these concerns

00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:22,690
are a reason not to share. So, while we do support brad access to content, we also aim

00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:23,690
to increase our understanding of the ethical concerns that may constitute barriers to open

00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:24,690
sharing. So, I would invite you to join this conversation.

00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:25,690
We -- we want to promote the use of CC license content to train AI. But we think that we

00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:26,690
need a community-led, coordinated and inclusive approach to not only consider the copyright

00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:27,690
system, but also these other issues of responsibility, accountability, sustainability, et cetera.

00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:28,690
So, we're one actor in a vibrant community of open advocates that promote the interests

00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:29,690
of the millions of people who use CC licenses. And we want to engage in rich conversations

00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:30,690
on AI's multiple facets to promote better sharing in the public interest. And to that

00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:31,690
end, the Creative Commons copyright platform working groups have been set up. And throughout

00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:32,690
the year, they will examine the intersection of AI and open content as well as the ethics

00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:33,690
of open sharing. And through these discussions and collective action, we look forward to

00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:34,690
identifying options in licensing and infrastructure, policy, norm-building and also awareness-raising.

00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:35,690
So, I would invite you to join them. They're two that you might be interested in. AI and

00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:36,690
open content. Or the ethics of open sharing. There will -- they will be presenting the

00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:37,690
outcomes of their work at a public webinar on November 9th. So, if you're interested,

00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:38,690
please do mark your calendars and get in touch for any further information.

00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:39,690
So, with this, I thank you for your attention and I look forward to any questions that you

00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:40,690
may have. Thank you. Serah: Fantastic. Thank you so much if this

00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:41,690
presentation, Brigitte. We do have questions. And I think we have at least time for one.

00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:42,690
So, Jeremy asks, does it seem from your user community that there's interesting in deriving

00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:43,690
a new CC license with no machine learning or artificial intelligence?

00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:44,690
Brigitte: I think this is one of the options being explored is to see whether there is

00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:45,690
a need for -- to develop a new type of license that would regulate -- or that would give

00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:46,690
permissions based not on copyright, but on ethical considerations. That's one option

00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:47,690
that's being looked at, at the moment. Another one is an ethical layer built into the existing

00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:48,690
licenses. So, not a separate license, but that each license would include some kind

00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:49,690
of layer in addition to the existing conditions that would take into account privacy or ethical

00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:50,690
concerns. But these are -- these are all open questions that we are beginning to explore.

00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:51,690
And I think that if -- if you would like to learn more, the working groups are probably

00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:52,690
the best way to -- to do -- to do so. Serah: All right. Thank you. And another question:

00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:53,690
What do you think about the development of structured data and Wiki data used as basis

00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:54,690
for commercial applications? That is machine learning plus crowd sourcing.

00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:55,690
Brigitte: Yeah. I don't have any specific knowledge about that -- those datasets. But

00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:56,690
I think that, yeah. On the principle, Creative Commons would support access to open data

00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:57,690
to the largest extent possible because we think there are many benefits to using as

00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:58,690
diverse and varied data. But at the same time, I want to point to these limits that I -- that

00:18:58,690 --> 00:18:59,690
I mentioned where I think that openness maybe stops to be the -- the driving focus and that

00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:00,690
there are other perhaps equally important considerations that need to be taken into

00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:01,690
account. Serah: Great. And the last question, because

00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:02,690
we have time for it. And Lee asks: How do these licenses apply in the context of other

00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:03,690
data that is non-creative like geolocation? And he's thinking of Open Street Maps here.

00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:04,690
Brigitte: That's an important question. And the Creative Commons licenses only apply to

00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:05,690
copyrighted licenses. If it's not original in the copyright sense and does not constitute

00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:06,690
a copyright work, one cannot attach a Creative Commons license to it. So, we wouldn't advise

00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:06,700
