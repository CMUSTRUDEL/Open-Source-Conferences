Description: 
	Developments in artificial intelligence (AI) raise several questions when it comes to the use of copyright material and Creative Commons-licensed content in particular. One of them is whether CC-licensed content (photographs, artworks, text, music, etc.) should be used as input to train AI. This question illustrates the tension between the value of open data vs. legitimate concerns about ethical, moral and responsible use of openly licensed content, which this session will explore.
