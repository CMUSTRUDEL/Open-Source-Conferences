Title: Catherine Stihler - Better sharing, brighter future
Publication date: 2021-05-20
Playlist: CSVConf 2021
Description: 
	2021 marks the 20th anniversary for Creative Commons. For 20 years we have helped build a commons of 'open' creative content free of most copyright restrictions. With CC licenses and tools, we created a simple way for creators to opt into a more permissive model of sharing. As we reflect on the past and think of the future, we know that today we must pursue a commons of knowledge and culture that is inclusive, just and which inspires reciprocity - a commons that serves the public interest. To that end we must transition from promoting more sharing to fostering better sharing. In this talk, I want to share what better sharing means in practice and how we can achieve this together.

>> CATHERINE: Super. It's great to be with you,  Jo, and it's great to be with all of you. Thank  

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:13,040
you so much for giving me the opportunity to talk  about "Better Sharing, Brighter Future." I'm going  

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,360
to try and talk for about ten minutes and then  take some questions, and we'll take it from there. 

00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,760
Firstly, I want to talk a little bit about  Creative Commons, a little bit about better  

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:32,240
sharing, and a little bit about the future. Just  to introduce Creative Commons, who we are, we're  

00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:37,440
an international nonprofit dedicated to building a  thriving commons of shared knowledge and culture.  

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,600
What we do and why we do it? Well, we're behind  the legal too goods, which are called licenses.  

00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,800
We're creating a globally recognized alternative  to the model of all rights reserved copyright.  

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,160
Why is opening sharing important? It advances  universal access to knowledge and culture.  

00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:02,800
It fosters creativity, innovation,  and collaboration. And open sharing  

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:09,760
is an act of solidarity. In our new strategy,  which was passed by our board in December,  

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:16,080
the theme of how we can do open sharing better  was the central theme of new strategy. That's  

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,400
something I wanted to share with you all  today within the short time I have with you. 

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:29,680
Here is a thought I would explore very briefly  as they are three huge areas, but something about  

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,200
open sharing and why it's important. If we take  COVID and what we've just ‑‑ well, going through,  

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,800
gone through. I'm getting vaccinated on Friday,  which I'm hugely excited about. But if we think  

00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:47,520
about what the pandemic has taught us, we've seen  more sharing of academic research to allow us to  

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,440
look at how we can develop vaccines. We've  seen education when schools have been shut.  

00:01:53,440 --> 00:02:00,240
We've seen how important open education resources  in trying to put education online for teachers and  

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:07,840
students, how important that's been. And we've  also seen how equity has been risen because when  

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:14,080
people don't have access to technology or  access to a report that came out last week  

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:21,200
in Scotland about not just the digital division  but the data division ‑‑ so, how can we show  

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:27,120
through the experiences of the pandemic why open  sharing is so important and how we can do that  

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:35,360
better? Then we go to the greatest challenge of  our time, climate. The climate crisis that we're  

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:44,000
experiencing as well and with COP 26, which is  coming up in November, what can we do to address  

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:56,320
the climate change and climate emergency? The open  sharing of research and the open sharing of data  

00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:01,200
in order to deal with our climate emergency is  absolutely critical if you want to develop the  

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:08,800
solutions and develop those ‑‑ the problems we  face, we have to develop the solutions to those,  

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,680
so this is where open sharing really, really  matters. When we go to artificial intelligence  

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,440
and thinking about copyright, thinking about  the norms and rules ‑‑ somebody struck me last  

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:28,320
week about how if we think today ‑‑ more reading  today is conducted by robots than is conducted by  

00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:34,240
humans. The change and pivot we're going through,  how can we make sure that better open sharing  

00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,880
addresses some of the challenges we face with  AI? We think about COVID and the experience  

00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,360
of the pandemic. We think about climate and the  challenges we have. We think about AI, opening  

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:49,120
sharing and doing it better has to be critical  to the success and critical to our futures. 

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,920
Now, when we move to the next slide, better open  sharing, the sharing paradox, license stewardship,  

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,640
and the public domain. When I'm thinking about the  sharing paradox, I wanted to thriving common share  

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:10,800
a couple of pictures with you of where I live.  It is just north of Edinburg. It's famous for a  

00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:16,000
couple of things. It's the resting place of  the famous Scottish king Robert the Brute.  

00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,440
He gave this to the people. When he was  a small child, he stood at the gates  

00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:43,440
and couldn't enter it. It was literally a  walled garden. He couldn't go in, and to the  

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:52,160
people he gave this space, this physical space  so everyone can enjoy and is enjoying today. 

00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:01,280
Another picture on the slide is a picture of the  Amazon warehouse, which is a couple of miles from  

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:12,800
the building in the other picture. I use this as a  contrast because we're living today in the virtual  

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:22,960
world where we are having challenges, shall we  say, around the public domain, how we ensure the  

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,960
public domain is our space. It's for our future,  and how we preserve and what we do with it.  

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:36,880
I use a contrast between the two because I  wanted to very much highlight that it is a mile  

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:43,040
away from where I'm sitting, these two very, very  different worlds. How are we going to bring some  

00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:52,240
of these challenges? We're sharing more than we've  ever done before in social media and all these  

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,840
different places and spaces, but how we share in  the public interest, is there not a difference  

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:05,200
between social media, which is showing and telling  rather than sharing in the public interest? How do  

00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:11,040
we make sure the sharing of the public interest,  the sharing to make sure we find the vaccines  

00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:17,120
to tackle the problem that we've just faced with  the pandemic, to share the resources to make sure  

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,480
kids are educated in schools when they go virtual  due to the pandemic, how are we going to make sure  

00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:29,120
there is this differentiation between how  we share for the public interest and what  

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,400
is not sharing in the public interest? It takes me to the shopping trolley.  

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,320
I share this picture with you because when  we think about the public and private spaces,  

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:48,720
I think the shopping trolley dilemma of that  private ‑‑ some of you call it a shopping cart.  

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:55,760
It's just neglected, put there, and nobody takes  responsibility. It's somebody else's thing to do,  

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:02,640
and I keep thinking about how, when we're  looking at the public spaces, private  

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:09,440
interests, the public domain, which is  the commons that we can enjoy in terms  

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,000
of public parks in a physical world, how can  we share when it comes to the digital world  

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:22,480
when addressing the shopping trolley problem? I want to touch on how you can get involved  

00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:27,120
in terms of better opening share. By joining  our community platform at Creative Commons,  

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:37,120
thinking about our three priorities, which  is advocacy, license innovation, and capacity  

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,480
building, think about how we take people on the  journey of understanding how the licenses that  

00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:47,120
we have, which helps put things in the commons,  helps put things in the public domain through  

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,560
our training and boot camps and webinars, how  you can get involved with those. Thinking about  

00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:58,560
the Open Minds podcast where we have different  people coming together to share thoughts and ideas  

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:05,200
about the open ecosystem and its biggest form,  but also how are we working together in public  

00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:15,120
places and spaces to build together? The CC Summit  is between the 20th and 24th of September. I know  

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:23,360
many of you are interested in open data and want  to make a difference in the world of ours today.  

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:30,480
I'm thinking how we all come together is  important. September gives us another opportunity. 

00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:38,640
Just to end, we've got the future in terms of ‑‑  we celebrate 20 years of Creative Commons. It's no  

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:46,720
surprise that a number of organizations this year  celebrating their 20th anniversaries. Wikipedia  

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:52,560
has just celebrated 20 years. Other organizations  are celebrating 20 years. There was something  

00:08:52,560 --> 00:09:00,160
about 20 years ago when so many open organizations  were created and today celebrate 20 years, but it  

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,200
gives you an opportunity to think not just what  you've achieved over the past 20 years but what  

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,960
you can do in the next 20 years. This is where  better open sharing becomes a really key theme. We  

00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:17,360
addressed the issue of field sharing 20 years ago,  and now today we want to do open sharing better.  

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,400
We're still the stewards of the licenses,  and those licenses are pivotal. When you  

00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:27,440
think about a tree, the trunk of the tree are the  licenses and the things that blossom out of that,  

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,200
whether it is open education, open GLAM,  our ambitions around open science and open  

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:46,080
climate, the licenses are pivotal to that. I have  kept to my very short time scale in talking about  

00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:52,240
better open sharing. I would love to hear what you  think, and I'm really keen to take any questions.  

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,120
I think I have a grand eight minutes in my  20 minutes I was given to be able to do this. 

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,800
Jo, how would we like to take this forward?  Thanks to everyone for listening, and I look  

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,800
forward to hearing your thoughts. >> Thank you very much for that,  

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,360
Catherine. You have stayed very well within  your time, which is fantastic. It gives us  

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,840
lots of opportunity to have  a little bit more discussion. 

00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,040
>> CATHERINE: Great. >> I'm looking at the questions that have  

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:24,320
been asked by our audience. People are voting,  so I'll ask them in order. The first question is,  

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:32,720
can you talk a little bit about the ethics  involved in sharing? For example, are there  

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,480
things that should not be shared in your opinion? >> CATHERINE: So, this is a really great question  

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:45,520
because we've done a lot of thinking about where  were we 20 years ago and where are we today. And  

00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:52,480
there's something about ‑‑ take the example  of traditional knowledge and how 20 years  

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,600
ago in the debate we were having, when we were  creating licenses ‑‑ clearly, I've been in the  

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,640
role of CEO just for eight months. When we were  talking to people involved 20 years ago, there  

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,840
were issues around traditional knowledge, issues  around knowledge that should be more respected ‑‑  

00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:16,640
all of that debate is fairly recent and fairly  new. We need to think about. The ethics around  

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:24,480
Creative Commons, we were caught up in that when  images were shared and were used, for example, in  

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:32,880
the training of AI to do some quite nasty things  in terms of facial recognition. There's something  

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:39,920
about how we have to learn from the past 20 years  and think about what our challenges are today,  

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:47,280
and this theme of better open sharing really tries  to give us that opportunity to start to think more  

00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,680
deeply about the challenges of today. Because  if we're going to address those things of today,  

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,960
we need to think about what that is and  looks like for the next 20 years as well.  

00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:03,120
I think that's a really important question. There's one other podcast that Coraline has  

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,480
done, which addresses some of the issues  around the ethical open-source question,  

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,840
which I think you might find interesting. Please  look at our podcast and have a listen. I think  

00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:20,800
you would find that useful. Is that helpful? >> Thank you very much, Catherine. That's a great  

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,000
answer. I've got one other question.  You're not immediately new to your role,  

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,480
but I know you've been in your role for  less than a year. I was wondering what your  

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:38,080
impression is of the Creative Commons  community and what you've learnt and reflected  

00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:45,040
in your time and how much is that made up of  people who are actively behind and supporting  

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,680
the mission and how much is it people just making  use of this in what they're doing? Is there an  

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:57,440
awareness in the wider aims, do you find? >> CATHERINE: So, I feel so privileged.  

00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:06,640
We worked together at Open Knowledge. Creative  Commons also has an international community.  

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,760
It's probably about a month ago. There was one  day I took a call in the morning to talk to the  

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,320
Hong Kong chapter. At lunchtime, I was talking to  the Ugandan chapter. In the evening, I was talking  

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:26,720
to the New Zealand chapter. Where in a day would  you cover Hong Kong, Uganda, and New Zealand? This  

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:35,360
variety of people who are part of this common  cause about how to share knowledge and culture  

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,240
and make things more open for the common  good and public interest, it's so empowering.  

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:52,080
The community that makes up Creative Commons has  been so welcoming to me and are so passionate  

00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:01,680
to make that difference. I find  that so inspiring, Jo. Each person  

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,200
I speak to I learn something else from. When I was talking to the Peruvian chapter ‑‑  

00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:15,120
tomorrow is the Scottish parliament elections.  I was talk to the Peruvian chapter. There are 15  

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:28,480
candidates for the presidential election and  2 are tied. Just being able to go on a call,  

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:34,400
find out what's happening in a local area,  discuss things, and try to understand more  

00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:40,160
about what are the pressing problems that  are facing our community and how we open up  

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,320
culture and knowledge for the public good. Hope  that helps. Does that answer your question, Jo? 

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,960
>> [ Muted ]. >> CATHERINE: You're ‑‑ 

00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:55,440
>> Thank you very much, Catherine. Yes. I  think we've got time for one more question.  

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,800
We've got three minutes left. We had a great  keynote yesterday from the COVID tracking team.  

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:11,200
How can we harness that to share more broadly? >> CATHERINE: That's a great question, Carol. We  

00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:17,360
were really proud at Creative Commons for helping  instigate and being part of the project, which  

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:28,080
was going to be stewarded by PJ at Washington  University in D.C. We were so proud of the work  

00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:36,400
we did to try and open up knowledge and culture  to be able to address that pressing problem we're  

00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:43,360
facing. Now, the learning is we're in a climate  emergency. We need to take our learning from what  

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:49,440
we did with the open COVID pledge to apply that  to climate and to start to see this emergency  

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:56,160
just as important as what we've gone through in  the pandemic to try and make sure that we have all  

00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:01,760
that research and all that data in an open format  that can be shared and reused, and therefore  

00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:07,120
we can work together with this most pressing  problem that affects humanity. I think that's  

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:13,440
maybe where I would place the learning moving  forward and what we can do. It is so important  

00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:21,360
we take as much about the benefits of open sharing  and apply that to the latest challenge that we  

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,960
have, which is the climate emergency. >>  

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,640
Thank you very much. Okay. We have about  30 seconds left, Catherine. I think we're  

00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,560
going to end there, but thank you very much.  That's perfect timing. There are several more  

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:42,480
questions. These are being moved over into Slack. >> CATHERINE: Look, thank you. I want to say  

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:48,480
