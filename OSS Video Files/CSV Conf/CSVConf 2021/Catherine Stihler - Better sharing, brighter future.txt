Description: 
	2021 marks the 20th anniversary for Creative Commons. For 20 years we have helped build a commons of 'open' creative content free of most copyright restrictions. With CC licenses and tools, we created a simple way for creators to opt into a more permissive model of sharing. As we reflect on the past and think of the future, we know that today we must pursue a commons of knowledge and culture that is inclusive, just and which inspires reciprocity - a commons that serves the public interest. To that end we must transition from promoting more sharing to fostering better sharing. In this talk, I want to share what better sharing means in practice and how we can achieve this together.
