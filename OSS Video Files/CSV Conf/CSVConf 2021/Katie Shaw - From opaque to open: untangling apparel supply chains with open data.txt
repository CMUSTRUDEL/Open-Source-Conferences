Title: Katie Shaw - From opaque to open: untangling apparel supply chains with open data
Publication date: 2021-05-20
Playlist: CSVConf 2021
Description: 
	Historically, the apparel sector has been shrouded in secrecy and mystique, using this to generate an impression of exclusivity and glamour. As the tragic Rana Plaza building collapse in Dhaka, Bangladesh in 2013 showed (in which well over 1,000 workers died manufacturing clothing for many major western brands) the reality is anything but. The aftermath of the Rana Plaza disaster shone a light on how few brands were aware of where their products were being manufactured, let alone the conditions in which they were being made. In response to this, a growing trend has developed for supply chain disclosure in the apparel sector, spurred on by groups such as the Transparency Pledge coalition and Fashion Revolution. However, in response to these calls for greater transparency, supply chain disclosure has been inconsistent, difficult to track from one website to another and data is often locked away in non-machine readable formats such as PDFs or tables embedded in websites. A lack of standard formatting for information as basic as name and address data (coupled with the poor quality of this data) makes it difficult and costly for anyone to compare across datasets and understand shared connections to facilities. Data has been stuck in silos and lacked a universal, central ID through which systems could synchronize, making interoperability between systems impossible. Enter the Open Apparel Registry (OAR). The OAR was launched in March 2019 to address this data challenge. At its heart, the OAR exists to drive improvements in data quality for the benefit of all stakeholders in the apparel sector. As well as many other efficiency and process benefits, the way the OAR organizes and presents data ultimately improves the lives of some of the most vulnerable workers in global supply chains. During our talk, we’ll share details about the challenges facing the apparel sector, including low levels of technical sophistication and understanding of open data; collaborative work that’s being done to educate the sector on the power of open data, including the launch of the Open Data Standard for the Apparel Sector (ODSAS); before finishing up with inspiring examples of how data from the Open Apparel Registry being freely shared and used is creating meaningful changes in the lives of some of global society’s most oppressed people.

>> KATIE: Thank you so much for that introduction.  Thanks very much for having me here today. 

00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,120
I'm going to talk to you about a major  open‑source initiative in the apparel  

00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,000
sector, the Open Apparel Registry. I'm  going to tell you how it is fundamentally  

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,200
changing lives and conditions for some of the most  vulnerable people in the global garment industry. 

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,000
So, what is the trouble with fashion? Before I  talk you through what the Open Apparel Registry  

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,800
is and the technology it's built on, I'm going  to give you full disclosure of what is quite a  

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,040
depressing overview of the garment industry  and why it is in desperate need of fixing.  

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:52,400
It is not about high fashion. If you  wear clothing, these issues affect you. 

00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,840
Let's start with some context  of the scale of the industry.  

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,520
Fashion is one of the biggest industries in  the world and generates about 2.5 trillion  

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:10,080
U.S. dollars in global annual revenues.  Figures vary, but the Ellen MacArthur  

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:17,120
Foundation estimates that 300 million people  are employed along the clothing value chain,  

00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:26,320
and among those people are women, who are often  the main income earners in their family. The  

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:32,000
rights of those women in the workplace are often  limited, and verbal and sexual abuse are rife,  

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,400
but fashion is also an industry that  exhibits enormous income disparity.  

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:46,080
Two of Forbes top wealthiest people in the world  are fashion leaders. You'll see Bernard Arnault,  

00:01:46,080 --> 00:02:04,960
who owns multiple luxury brands,  including Louis Vuitton and Gucci. 

00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,760
At the other end of the scale, thousands of  workers are toiling in garment factories around  

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,680
the world adding to the wealth of these  and other members of the fashion elite,  

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:25,440
but they don't even earn a minimum wage, let  alone a living wage. I'll touch briefly on  

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,760
wealth disparity and on the lack of wages  for garment workers, but unfortunately,  

00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,360
this aren't the only issues  affecting the industry.  

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,880
Many people tuned in today may well remember this  tragic moment in history, which was the collapse  

00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:51,600
of the Rana Plaza building in Dhaka, Bangladesh  in 2013. 1,100 people were killed and more than  

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:59,200
2,500 were injured. On the morning of the 23rd  of the April, many workers in the factory had  

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,120
spotted cracks in the wall of the building and  had expressed concern about going into work. The  

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:11,040
managers said if they didn't go into work, they  wouldn't just lose their pay that day. They'd lose  

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:20,800
their job. The majority of workers entered the  building under duress with horrific consequences.  

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,120
All this in order to meet the impossibly tight  turnarounds imposed on factories by global  

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:35,120
brands to feed our appetite for fast fashion. Challenges in the fashion industry are not  

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,200
solely social challenges. As an industry, many  stages of production are heavily dependent on  

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:47,280
highly chemically‑intensive processes, including  dyeing and finishing treatments. In a bid to cut  

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,960
corners and save costs, management standards are  frequently lax. This impacts both the health of  

00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:59,040
the workers handling chemicals but also local  ecosystems and waterways. Those waterways are  

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,920
often the very same places where the people who  live locally to garment facilities will both  

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:10,800
wash themselves and source water for cooking and  drinking. So, how has this been allowed to happen? 

00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:17,520
Supply chains in the fashion industry are  incredibly complex and often really quite  

00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:24,080
murky for a number of different reasons. Firstly,  because creating an item of clothing isn't as  

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:32,000
simple as its often-low cost implies, that made in  Vietnam label in your top is only telling one tiny  

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,680
part of the story, which is where the product  was finally cut and sewn. Where was the cotton  

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:50,080
grown and by whom? How did it get from the farm  to the ginner in the spinner? Who dyed it? Has  

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,360
it been given a special finishing treatment? Who  cut the pattern and stitched all the different  

00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:01,440
bits together? Where did the button come from  and the sparkly embellishments on the test?  

00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,760
What about the brand label in the neck and the  care label on the side? How did those get there?  

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,040
Your top was really nicely  pressed before you bought it.  

00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,440
Even that process of ironing probably  happened in a different factory as well. 

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,000
I think you get the idea that producing  fashion is in and of itself a fairly  

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,480
complex endeavor. Then you throw in buyers  that are challenging targets to continually  

00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:38,400
secure cheaper prices. You're left with the global  industrialized fashion system where the process of  

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,080
creating one ordinary T‑shirt can involve multiple  shipments between multiple different countries.  

00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,760
Countless steps in producing that one simple  T‑shirt that I just talked you through.  

00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:54,560
Remind yourself, it's just one product  and a simple product in the inventory  

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,360
of brands that are churning out thousands of  products around the world on a weekly basis. 

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:08,000
How can better data and open data help?  When you're dealing with this many layers,  

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,360
keeping track of the data in your supply chain is  seemingly as simple as the names and addresses of  

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,200
your facilities. It becomes really challenging.  If you don't have a clear sense of exactly where  

00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,920
the facilities in your supply chain are, how  can you possibly have any sense of the social  

00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:30,080
and environmental conditions at those facilities?  And what we've found in building the Open Apparel  

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:39,520
Registry is at its basic level information and the  quality of data in the apparel sector is really  

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:45,760
poor. So, we hear stories of auditors turning up  two days in a row at the same facility thinking  

00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:51,600
they're going to two different places. Or in  reverse, you have the same social improvement  

00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:57,440
programs being run twice at some facilities  and not at all at others. You can see from the  

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:04,320
examples on this slide that the data of many  global brands is often quite frankly a mess. 

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,680
What is the Open Apparel  Registry and how can it help?  

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,120
I'm going to play a quick 90‑second animation  in a couple of minutes, but at a basic level,  

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:21,920
it's a neutral open‑source tool in which  we're mapping garment facilities worldwide  

00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:29,840
and we're allocating a unique ID to each facility  in the database. Here's that 90‑second overview.  

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:11,840
 (Video playing) >>  

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,200
KATIE:  

00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:19,920
Okay. Moving smoothly on in the presentation,  as the animation showed, the OAR is creating one  

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:26,240
common registry of facility names and addresses  in the global apparel system, and it's eliminating  

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,704
issues with matching across multiple inconsistent  databases. What that does in turn is enables  

00:09:32,704 --> 00:09:38,560
in‑facility collaboration between organizations  that all share connections to the same facilities.  

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:45,600
These unique ID numbers that are allocated to  each facility in the registry do not replace  

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,800
any existing ID schemes but instead they serve  as a central source of truth alongside name  

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:58,000
and address data. You can see here the logic with  which the IDs are generated. There's a country ID,  

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,320
the origin date for when the facility first  appeared in the Open Apparel Registry,  

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:09,360
a general ID, and then a check ID at the end. So, what were the technical challenges we faced  

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,120
when it came to building the Open Apparel  Registry? Well, it starts with the data  

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,960
because it's always the data. Particularly, in  the apparel sector, due to its global nature,  

00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:25,920
we knew that we were going to have varying levels  of technical exposure and expertise from both  

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:35,200
users of the database but also contributors of  the database. There were also no industrywide  

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:41,120
standards for name and categorization in  the apparel sector. Data was often extracted  

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:51,040
from PDF via OCR. There were nonstructured  address sects and international character sets  

00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:05,520
and translation inconsistency. We wanted  to reach 50,000 facilities in the database,  

00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:10,080
but what does that mean for processing times?  Well, if you have an organization that wants to  

00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:16,240
contribute and check 5,000 facilities against the  existing database, you're looking at 250 million  

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:22,400
comparisons, which when you then multiply that up  into the time it will take to process that data,  

00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:28,320
it could take up to seven hours, which simply  wasn't acceptable, so we needed a shortcut. 

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:34,640
What was our solution? Dedupe, an open‑source  Python library for accurate and scalable fuzzy  

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:48,720
matching, deduplication, and entity‑resolution.  In summary, duplicate records almost always  

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,600
share shotgun in common. If you define  those groups of data that share something  

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,720
and compare only the records in that group  or a block, you can drastically reduce the  

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,560
number of comparisons that need to be made. If  you do the work to define those blocks well,  

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,040
then you can make very few comparisons and  still have confidence. What that means in  

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:14,720
terms of processing time is you can dramatically  reduce the amount of time it takes to run data  

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,680
through the system by training that new model,  processing thousands of matches, which takes  

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:27,280
less and significantly less than four minutes. In terms of the benefits that the Open Apparel  

00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:33,040
Registry provides, our OAR IDs, plus that  simple reference of facility affiliations,  

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:38,640
enables much more efficient collaboration for  any kind of organization in the sector because  

00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:43,680
those organizations, which share facility  relationships, can quickly identify one  

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:50,720
another to work together on improvements. Data  currently sat in silos is also able to synchronize  

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,880
using the OAR ID and connecting through  our API allows for more data exchange. 

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:07,360
The work we're doing is raising  the awareness for more open data,  

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,200
especially given the challenges that the  apparel sector is facing. We worked together  

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,480
with others on something called the Open Data  Standard for the Apparel Sector. This is an  

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:24,240
entry‑level introduction for any organization  in the apparel sector to not only understand  

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,840
what data they have to share but how they need to  share it. We've gone so far as creating templates  

00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:37,200
for organizations to download to help them with  their data in a more practical and usable format. 

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:48,560
I want to share a couple of examples of how  OAR data is being used. We've received really  

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:54,720
wonderful examples of how it is leading to  improvements in some of the lives of the most  

00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:00,560
vulnerable people in supply chains that I spoke  about at the start of the presentation. I'm going  

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,920
to share two quick stories. There's a range of  other examples available on our website, but the  

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,720
first I'll share comes from an organization called  Clean Clothes Campaign, which is a global alliance  

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:17,040
dedicated to improving working conditions in the  garment and sportswear industries. They use OAR  

00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,640
both in their urgent peel work where they're  responding to concrete violations but also in  

00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:29,040
their research initiatives. Our data enables trade  unions to identify which brands are sourcing from  

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:37,280
which factories. This information was used  in combination with data from an initiative  

00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,920
in the apparel sector called the Transparency  Pledge, and it revealed that the brand was also  

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:47,680
a member of four multi‑stakeholder initiatives.  In consultation with the Clean Clothes Campaign,  

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:53,600
the trade union picked the MSI known for the  fastest response times on grievance mechanisms  

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:59,280
and was able to swiftly resolve the issue. What  that looks like in practice, within five days  

00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:05,520
the union leader was reinstated to have full job,  including back pay. Without the centralized source  

00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:10,480
of data that is the Open Apparel Registry, we know  from Clean Clothes Campaign that resolving these  

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:16,160
sorts of issues can take months and not days. >> Katie, you have about three minutes left. 

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:24,400
>> KATIE: Okay, great. Another example. Our data  has enabled them to respond to the dismissal  

00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:30,560
of over 1,000 garment workers striking over  the nonpayment of benefits in Cambodia. The  

00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:38,000
BHRRC was able to swiftly use the OAR to  identify brands sourcing from the factory  

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,720
to ask for their response and plan of action. Through pressure from many quarters,  

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:49,040
including brand interventions, the majority of  workers were reinstated. So, those were just a  

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,240
couple of examples of how OAR data is being used.  Here's what you can do to influence the system. 

00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:00,400
Check us out on GitHub. Search the Open Apparel  Registry to see which organizations are openly  

00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:05,520
sharing supply chain data. Contact brands.  Use your voice as a consumer and a purchaser  

00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:11,040
of their products to encourage them to share their  supply chain data. Educate yourself on the issues.  

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:21,840
I would encourage you all to consider  how you purchase and reuse clothing.  

00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:34,720
More immediately, with the Open Apparel Registry,  get (Lagging) ‑‑ I just encourage you all to  

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,240
keep in touch and follow our growth. We  have lots of exciting things coming up. 

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,800
We've got a couple of minutes  if anyone has got any questions. 

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:50,160
>> Katie, thank you so much. That was  a really great presentation. We do have  

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,400
a little bit of time, so I'm going to start with  the most popular question, which is from Peter.  

00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,480
The question is, have you had  much pushback from the industry? 

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:04,240
>> KATIE: I'm really happy to say because we  ran quite an extensive stakeholder consultation  

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:10,560
exercise prior to launching the open apparel  industry we actually secured buy‑in for what we  

00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:16,640
were trying to achieve with the registry prior to  launch, and so what that means in practice is that  

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,920
we've got a lot of trust within the industry, and  organizations very early on recognized the benefit  

00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:30,560
it can bring to all. Our neutral positioning and  the fact that all of our data is open sourced is a  

00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:43,120
really important part of securing that contrast. >> Very quickly. A short answer, if that's okay  

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,120
with you, but there was an initial question  about whether you use blockchain technologies  

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:52,080
and then a follow‑up question, which is have  you identified any challenges there that you  

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,200
would like to talk about? >> KATIE: About blockchain specifically?
