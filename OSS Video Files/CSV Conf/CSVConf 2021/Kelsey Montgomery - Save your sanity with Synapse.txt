Description: 
	Synapse is a freely available data repository to organize your research, get credit for it and collaborate with colleagues and the public. Data exploration provokes a curiosity that can lead the analyst through a labyrinth of possible outcomes. Synapse contains features to track file versions with an immutable identifier, string together file transformations, manage the visibility of sensitive data, make data discoverable with structured metadata, describe experimental context with unstructured copy and connect your output with code. All of this can be accessed from the web or programmatically with R, Python or the Command Line, thus integrating seamlessly into your scientific analysis. Allow Synapse to hold the memory of the places you have been to instead focus your energy on testing creative hypotheses.
