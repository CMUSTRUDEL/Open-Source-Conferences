Title: Kelsey Montgomery - Save your sanity with Synapse
Publication date: 2021-05-20
Playlist: CSVConf 2021
Description: 
	Synapse is a freely available data repository to organize your research, get credit for it and collaborate with colleagues and the public. Data exploration provokes a curiosity that can lead the analyst through a labyrinth of possible outcomes. Synapse contains features to track file versions with an immutable identifier, string together file transformations, manage the visibility of sensitive data, make data discoverable with structured metadata, describe experimental context with unstructured copy and connect your output with code. All of this can be accessed from the web or programmatically with R, Python or the Command Line, thus integrating seamlessly into your scientific analysis. Allow Synapse to hold the memory of the places you have been to instead focus your energy on testing creative hypotheses.

	00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,639
so my name is kelsey montgomery

00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,559
i am a senior bioinformatics engineer at

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,120
sage bionetworks which is a health

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,400
research

00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,480
non-profit in seattle i have worked with

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,920
and manipulated large amounts of data

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,199
for my entire career

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,720
from coral reef in the florida keys

00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:27,439
microbiome samples to

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,039
mitochondria and neurons to currently

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,119
the work that i'm doing to support open

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,120
science communities in the analysis of

00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,840
large genetic data

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,360
so scientific research generally follows

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,719
this arc that you see on

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,160
on the screen a testable idea we plan

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,800
for the experiment

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,239
we organize the data we test our

00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,200
hypothesis

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,640
we re-test our hypothesis we synthesize

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,640
these results and share our findings

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,559
with the community

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,239
it's linear it's clean it feels good

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,399
right however

00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,480
research can start in one place and end

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,440
in a totally different place so

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,519
how do we justify that journey how do we

00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,760
communicate about that journey

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,799
in practice science gets complicated

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,640
fast

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,000
this is a super common problem in our

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,880
technological world

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,680
the sheer magnitude of information can

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,880
feel

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,080
daunting and inaccessible yet we need

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,119
sufficient data

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:26,400
to build robust claims as these data

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,880
sets grow so does the complexity

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,079
there's so much movement and dynamic

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,600
change in

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:36,640
an analysis for example in my life

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,920
i might revise some code i might

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,880
share preliminary findings with my peers

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,520
or i might

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,479
reprocess the entire data set and

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,439
reproduce

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,479
several thousands of files so tracking

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,320
these transfer

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,560
transformations is important because i

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,320
want my results to be credible

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,840
and i want someone else to be able to

00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:00,240
independently verify

00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:03,200
my claims all these transformations

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,079
are really critical to that independent

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,920
validation

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,080
so how do we share our journey our

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,120
findings and communicate our learnings

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,440
with the broader community where i work

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,480
at sagebionetworks we use a tool called

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,640
synapse

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,959
that solves this problem of complexity

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,879
and sharing very well

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,200
our engineers who designed and built

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,400
synapse worked hard to implement fair

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,360
principles

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,160
findable accessible interoperable and

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,400
reusable

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,400
so you will notice some of the ways that

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,599
we applied fair and synapse as i

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,319
describe this tool to you i'll walk you

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,480
through some

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,360
strategies for organizing your data for

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,760
sharing

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,680
how and why they work and how you can

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,040
implement them in your own professional

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,440
life

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,560
i'll mention this again at the end but

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:54,319
you see a link there to synapse.org

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,000
csv conf 2021 this is a public project

00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,760
with this presentation and

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,720
you can check out some of these features

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,800
and strategies and actions

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,959
i definitely want to acknowledge that

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,959
contributing to a public resource

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,440
like definitely requires the right

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,920
incentive structure

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,080
most scientific research is inherently

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,959
incentivized to contribute to a public

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,959
space

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,319
whereas other industries that you might

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,560
be a part of might

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:24,080
require you to devise some more creative

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,080
ways to make your work open

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,519
so working with data and analyses in

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,799
this way

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,720
is the style of practice and what do i

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,799
mean by a style of practice and what

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,000
does the style of practice

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:41,519
mean to you so for me one of my

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,680
daily habits and practices involves yoga

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,440
there are concrete rules of yoga and

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,799
when implemented routinely become

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,200
integrated

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,120
sitting without movement is hard but

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,080
might gradually day by day become

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,319
comfortable

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,200
breathing in a certain way might be

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,439
accessible

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,040
until slowly you're able to like

00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,599
integrate it with your movements

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,360
so i would love to know how many of you

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,560
have already established

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,480
a style of practice earlier today i

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,959
really appreciated ryan's idea

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,200
on snippets and i totally planned to

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,120
incorporate that into my daily or weekly

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,440
life i would love to see some other

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,000
ideas in the chat

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,840
so solving the problem of complicated

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,560
science and sharing

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,840
our goal here is to develop a process to

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,840
incorporate into your daily work

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,560
there um in my experience i find

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,479
that there's a common professional

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,960
insecurity

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,639
about sharing sometimes sharing our

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,080
nuance sometimes messy

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,919
sometimes inaccessible process

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,520
you know we experience a lot of ups and

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,040
downs

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,560
trial and error that get us to an

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,120
insight i think it's

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,560
very important for us to normalize this

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,160
process of sharing work

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:59,199
early and often and in doing so will

00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,160
reinforce this kind of muscle memory

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,320
so synapse is a tool it's open source

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,720
it's available for anyone to use

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,759
and synapse helps achieve these three

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,479
goals

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,960
share your data responsibly make your

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,600
work

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,440
accessible and make your work past

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,680
independent validation

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,960
so the concepts we're about to explore

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,479
all map back to these three goals

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,440
and why these goals it's always

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:28,560
important to answer the why

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,000
responsible sharing this seems like a

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,080
given

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
maybe but requires special

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,560
considerations

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,080
i have a special relationship with this

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,000
with responsible sharing

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,840
because my work deals with human data

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,440
and it is critical to plan for

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,440
responsible sharing

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,199
in order to mitigate harm to research

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,280
participants

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,320
when we talk about accessibility

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,960
accessibility

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,759
empowers community and empowering

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,639
community

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,639
is the best way to get to the best

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,479
answers the most quickly

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,720
science is a community and i want to

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,560
share my learnings

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,560
so independent validation first of all

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,120
what does this mean

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,840
it means that you can arrive at the same

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,639
insight

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,440
by using my process so this is an

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,720
incredibly

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:19,199
daunting and difficult task

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,000
it's a challenge data is complicated and

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,600
big i need

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,600
to organize my work for sharing as i go

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,600
these goals are not mutually exclusive

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,120
the more accessible my work is

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,960
the easier it is to validate

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,080
independently

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:37,199
so let's deconstruct this how

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,680
can i share data responsibly just as

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,160
when

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,880
any information you make public on the

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,440
internet

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,919
special care and consideration must be

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,919
made

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,440
when sharing your data in complete

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,639
analysis

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:53,199
so ethical norms are critical

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,280
it is not ethical to put some human data

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,919
in the public domain and all

00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,479
genetic data is at risk of

00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:00,880
re-identification

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,080
however you can implement a permission

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,639
structure in synapse

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,960
to keep your data restricted to protect

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:10,240
a participant's identity

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,800
you can decide one file is visible while

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,680
another

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,440
is not and there are some strategies for

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,400
preserving accessibility that i'll

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,280
mention

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,080
later on in this presentation for

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,039
example

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:25,039
to keep the large omics data we host on

00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,960
synapse accessible

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,440
interested users might need to state

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,080
their intended use of the data

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,599
and beyond human data any healthy

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,520
community benefits from a code of

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,720
conduct to communicate integrity and

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,639
respect

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,919
anyone who interacts with synapse must

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:46,240
agree to this code of conduct

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,240
how can i make science accessible

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,599
so when you have data that is

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:54,000
appropriate to be shared publicly

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:56,479
look for opportunities to not put your

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,319
data or results behind a paywall

00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,759
in our tech community this might look

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,599
like documenting your code and

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,160
methodology in a public

00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,360
github repository as journalists you

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,599
might rely on

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,840
propublica or the intercept the

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,319
intercept for public information

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,520
in genetics it might be the biomedical

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,479
data from

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,759
the all of us research hub so in synapse

00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:21,440
we make sharing

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:23,759
really easy there's a button make public

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,440
in your entire analysis files and

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:29,360
supporting language is available

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:32,479
publicly permanent

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,880
so this might seem obvious

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,880
we all love and hate that if it's on the

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,519
internet it is there forever

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,240
but when i say permanent i imply an

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,919
immutable

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:46,240
reference so the strategy

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,000
is potentially more specific to data

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:52,080
management and project

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,480
reference in synapse every entity

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,760
which could be a file is this assigned a

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,959
unique immutable

00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:02,320
identifier this entity can change

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:04,959
over time but the identifier does not

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,120
this works by appending a version number

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:09,279
to the unique identifier

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,720
in my illustration this unique

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,800
identifier can get you

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,839
a specific file within this linear

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,640
history

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,240
so a single source of truth certainly

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,160
reduces complexity

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,519
i can always find a version that i

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,480
created before

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,959
and i can also find the exact version

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,160
that

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:30,800
that led me to my insight

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,839
to bridge the gap between data and

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,320
publication

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,600
we can link these file transformations

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,959
to digital

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:43,360
object identifiers or dois

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:47,279
data set citation is super important

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,240
a doi is also for those of you that

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,160
haven't

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,480
interacted with doi's before an

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,200
immutable identifier in many journals

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,440
require

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,120
you to register your data bits by

00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,160
assigning them a doi

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,079
so in synapse you commit a doi directly

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,720
with the click of a button which is

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:09,360
fantastic and incredibly useful

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:12,000
at times make your work discoverable

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,600
the world is full of information how do

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,480
i find your project

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,079
how do i find your research the way in

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,480
which i encounter your

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,839
work is entirely up to you so one

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,360
strategy for making your work

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:27,040
discoverable is to add

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,720
metadata meta means higher order

00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,839
metadata is the information that

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:34,560
describes the data

00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:35,440
so for example here's the data of what i

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,399
do

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,640
um there's large amounts of genetic data

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,440
from brain tissue of more than 2 000

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,399
individuals

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,519
diagnosed with alzheimer's disease and

00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,040
this data

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:52,640
is available in the ad knowledge portal

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:56,720
the metadata of what i do human data

00:10:52,640 --> 00:11:00,320
rna brain alzheimer's disease

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,880
open science so we can distill our work

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,480
into a few concrete terms and apply it

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,120
as metadata

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,720
machines require structure so when i say

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,640
machine readable

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,680
i'm referring to the structured data

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,680
like a common vocabulary

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,760
so i discussed the importance of some

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,360
human data not being appropriate for the

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,399
public domain

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,880
one strategy for remaining discoverable

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,440
is to keep the metadata describing the

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,000
files

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,360
public this can enable some

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,279
accessibility

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,600
so synapse accepts a structured

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:36,000
vocabulary to apply to your projects and

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,760
files to make them discoverable

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,079
and we the sage bio network scientists

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,399
have also developed a common vocabulary

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,640
or ontology for our open source

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:50,399
communities to make data discoverable

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,839
and where possible we build on existing

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,040
ontologies

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:58,160
we definitely rely heavily on other

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,600
open source communities i also want to

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,959
throw out that we have

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:05,360
built programmatic clients in python our

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,639
rest and the command line to interact

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,600
with data on senate

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,519
synapse empowering broad accessibility

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,839
so you can

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,240
kind of build this pushing and pulling

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,680
of data into your analyses and into your

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,480
processing

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,560
build it into your workflows beyond

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,480
synapse you can also add meta tags in

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:28,480
google to make your work discoverable

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:32,839
so this is being applied in other

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:35,600
tools and domains elsewhere

00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:36,079
discoverability public permanence all

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,079
these

00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,839
help maintain the accessibility of your

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,480
work

00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,320
so let's recap the bigger problem we're

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,120
trying to solve is how to reduce

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,320
and communicate complexity in our work

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,600
we've touched on

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,720
making our work accessible

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,440
being responsible data sharers let's

00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,959
explore

00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,720
how to create work that can be

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,880
independently validated

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,120
we want robust claims and we need our

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,680
work to hold up under public scrutiny so

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,440
let's

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:10,160
set our critics up for success

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,440
make your work have provenance

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,240
provenance is

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,000
the chronology of ownership if you

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,279
incorporated a raw data set into your

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,600
analysis

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:22,079
this could be an incident from the u.s

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,320
press freedom tracker api

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:26,240
cite the raw data such that someone

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,920
interpreting your analysis can find the

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,639
exact csv

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,480
with a line item incident so the only

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,279
way someone can arrive at your same

00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,560
conclusion

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:38,880
is to follow your process just like

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,839
leaving a trail of breadcrumbs back to

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,680
source

00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,199
document all the ways you transformed

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,760
your data

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:48,079
i need to know how you arrived at every

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,920
insight every step of the way

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,680
so we have a feature in synapse called

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,639
provenance where the data can be linked

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,040
together

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,600
by unique identifier and additionally we

00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,600
can link code to output

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,760
imagine something like the tree of life

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,079
or something like this illustration here

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,120
an interconnected web of transformed

00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:08,160
data

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:11,440
the brilliance of provenance is it is

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,040
a snapshot in time a file might continue

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,040
to change and evolve

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,440
but the provenance of your analysis

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:20,880
preserves the connection to data

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,880
at the time of your analysis

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:26,880
transparency so this is where leveraging

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,839
technologies adjacent to synapse can be

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,000
the missing ingredient to independent

00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:33,360
validation

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,519
this strategy

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,440
or goal is rather specific to the

00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,079
computational world where large amounts

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,320
of

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,480
in quantities of code and information

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,639
about the working environment

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,880
specifically must be documented in order

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,920
to reproduce an insight

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:52,639
um to be transparent with large quantity

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,760
quantities of code leverage github which

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,880
i'm sure

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,720
all you superstars already are

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,639
additionally i heavily rely on a

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,040
technology called docker to guarantee

00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,240
someone can re-run my analysis on their

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,000
own

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,000
a list of instructions that include

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,760
information like the operating system

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,720
can create a lightweight

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,880
mini computer this mini computer only

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,000
does the things you

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,320
um you needed to do to rerun my analysis

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,360
so

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,920
that's docker five minute warning thank

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,079
you

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,160
synapse supports linking to external

00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:28,399
sites including immutable github

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,399
references to connect data to code

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,839
and synapse also contains its own docker

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,480
registry so

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,079
having provenance and transparency help

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,880
ensure your analysis will pass

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,720
independent validation all these

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,720
strategies are interrelated and together

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,480
we have a kind of mind map to reference

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,680
and incorporate into our style of

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,759
practice so going back to the beginning

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,440
science gets complicated fast and we

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,040
want to minimize that complexity in

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,079
order to share our findings with the

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,240
community

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,519
we established three goals in order to

00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,079
solve that problem

00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,759
accessibility independent validation and

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,600
responsible sharing

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,519
these six strategies will help you

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,480
achieve those goals by providing a

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,240
structure

00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,600
that you can incorporate into your daily

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,720
work share

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:15,920
your nuance process early and often

00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:19,279
make your work discoverable public

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:21,680
permanent ethical transparent and have

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:23,199
provenance so just like sitting and

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,880
breathing for one minute then five

00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,720
minutes then for however long you care

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,519
to sit and breathe in one place without

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,079
moving

00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,680
this practice of staging structuring and

00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:35,040
sharing your insights

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:37,120
can find its way into your day-to-day

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,160
like all great analyses the contents of

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,720
this presentation

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,800
originated somewhere if not my brain so

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,240
i connect this presentation back to the

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,639
open source art

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,399
generated by photographers on unsplash

00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,480
the synapse features i mentioned

00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,959
the various examples i cited in the open

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,639
source way 2.0 for their articulation of

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:57,600
the style of practice

00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,519
so thank you again csv comp this is such

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,079
an amazing group of participants

00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:05,839
and i've really enjoyed being here and i

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,839
look forward to your questions

00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:16,400
thank you very much kelsey um let's take

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,400
a look

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,959
if anyone has any questions make sure to

00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:23,760
throw those in the chat

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,880
or in the question box below and we'll

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,440
get these to the

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:32,799
uh to the presenter um

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:37,280
really a quick question can you

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:37,280
talk a little bit about um

00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,120
two questions came to mind one about the

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,640
the collaborative uh

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:48,320
nature of of the work is this um

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:50,400
only at that sort of final stage

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,160
um where you're sharing out or is there

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,440
pre-work

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,600
yeah so my goal is for

00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,360
someone to leverage synapse to like

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,400
collaborate consistently through their

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,720
entire process

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,960
so you can imagine that synapse is kind

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,160
of like a staging space

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,000
where you can document not only

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,360
the ways that you're transforming data

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,919
but then

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,480
create then invite people to come in and

00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,000
view it

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:20,080
so you can invite a synapse user to have

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,360
access to your project you can invite a

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,360
team we have

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:27,360
several different sharing structures

00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,360
