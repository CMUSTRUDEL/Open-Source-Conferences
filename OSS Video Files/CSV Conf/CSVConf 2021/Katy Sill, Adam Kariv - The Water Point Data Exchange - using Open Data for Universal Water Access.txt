Title: Katy Sill, Adam Kariv - The Water Point Data Exchange - using Open Data for Universal Water Access
Publication date: 2021-05-20
Playlist: CSVConf 2021
Description: 
	Water points are still the main - or sometimes only - source of water for millions of people living in rural areas of the world. The Water Point Data Exchange (WPDx) unlocks the potential of water point data to improve the information available to governments, service providers, researchers, and NGOs, and create data-based decision-making for increasing rural water access. Governments and their partners are already collecting substantial amounts of water point data. However, data is often too fragmented to use, with different approaches for data collection and storage. Without harmonization among these different data sources, the true potential of this information remains untapped so it is only used for reporting and not decision support. By establishing a platform for sharing water point data throughout the global water sector, WPDx adds value to the data already being collected. It brings together diverse data sets and establishes an unprecedented understanding of water services. All stakeholders can easily use the WPDx Data Standard to harmonize their existing data structure. Formatting existing data into the WPDx Data Standard typically takes less than 30 minutes. The WPDx Data Standard fits most water point data, even if it was collected with no knowledge of the standard. After formatting, files can be uploaded and published using the WPDx ingestion engine. It removes duplicate entries, links multiple updates to the same water point, and integrates the data into the Global Data Repository. Using this data and advanced GIS and machine learning analysis, several decision support tools were built. Designed in partnership with governments and data scientists, these tools provide concrete insights, like which water point to send a technician to rehabilitate next to reach the most people. In this presentation we will share some of the challenges we face and the methods we use in making this possible.

>> KATY: All right. Good afternoon. My name  is Katy Sill, and I'm the director of the  

00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:14,160
Water Point Data Exchange program or what  we call WPDx with Global Water Challenge.  

00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:21,280
Today, my colleague Adam Kariv and I will present  on challenges and opportunities in harmonizing  

00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,360
day to help support evidence‑based  decisions for the rural water sector. 

00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:32,320
The challenge is that the world is not on track to  reach the sustainable goal development target of  

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:39,120
providing universal access to water and sanitation  by 2030. Rural access continues to lag urban.  

00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:54,080
Countries in sub‑Saharan Africa and Oceania  have the highest access gaps. Most countries  

00:00:54,080 --> 00:01:00,880
don't have adequate finance to reach their  water targets. We either need to find a lot  

00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:10,640
more money or make our money go further. One way  we can do this is to harness data to prioritize  

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:18,240
investments to reach the most underserved  possible. In general, we don't have the  

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,320
type of data at the subnational level  we need to complete these analyses. 

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:33,120
Here's some photographs from around the  world of the types of water points we're  

00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:38,080
seeking to collect data about. These are  not household systems but instead public  

00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:43,040
water points where individuals are traveling to  collect water and then transport it back home.  

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,240
Management of these varies. Sometimes it is  a community, a local government, a private  

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,480
company. These are different kinds of hand  pumps, springs, rainwater catchers, and so on. 

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,960
There are a lot of groups that are working  in this space and a growing recognition  

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,920
that evidence‑based decisions will  improve the impact of our rural  

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,280
water programs. More and more organizations  are collecting and monitoring routine data  

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,800
than ever before. They're using that  day to inform decisions. However,  

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,840
if the data is not shared, then each entity  only has their piece of the much larger puzzle. 

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,080
WPDx is a platform which is bringing  these public pieces together  

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,720
through a data standard and an ingestion  engine that we'll go into more detail  

00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:41,440
about later. WPDx harmonizes data regardless of  the organization or collection platform used into  

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,880
a singular dataset. This dataset is available  online and our data repository and playground.  

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,080
With all of these different contributions, we get  a much better sense of the landscape. Once these  

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:58,000
pieces are together, WPDx can provide analytic  tools to give key insights and try and make sense  

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
of the picture. I think of it like making those  magic eye puzzles from the 90s. Once you put the  

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,080
pieces together, you still need specialized  knowledge to find that 3D image pop‑out. 

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,360
To jump to the end and demonstrate why we want  to bring this data together, I want to show you  

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,480
a quick summary of our decision support tools.  We have four tools in development to support  

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,400
four key questions that have been identified by  government decision‑makers. The first is how many  

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:34,720
people lack access per district. That subnational  level. Second is which water point rehabilitation  

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:40,240
would reach the most people. Then where's the  most efficient place to build a new water point  

00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:45,840
or new construction, and then finally, which water  points are at the highest risk of failure and why. 

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,080
The first three of these tools use spatial  analytics to determine the populations who are  

00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:00,080
currently unserved based on the functionality of  the water points that we have within our dataset.  

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,560
With this approach, we can estimate water  access by district or subdistrict as shown  

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:11,120
here for Sierra Leone. All of the tools have a map  output slogan with a CSV download if you want to  

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:19,120
do further analysis. We can use this approach to  identify which water points need rehabilitation,  

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:27,680
so which ones are broken and which need to be  fixed first. This includes a CSV output and an  

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:35,280
optional satellite view. The larger the circle,  the more people that can be served with this fix. 

00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,720
Newly constructed water points that have the  potential to reach the greatest number of people  

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,960
that are not currently served by an existing water  point. This tool doesn't yet ‑‑ we're hoping to  

00:04:52,960 --> 00:05:05,520
one day to include hydrogeological information.  Finally, our predict water point status tool,  

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,640
which was developed in partnership with Data  Robot, uses attributes from our standard and some  

00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:15,840
external data, such as precipitation or land use  information, paired with a machine‑learning model  

00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:21,520
to determine which water points might be at high  risk for failure within relevant time frames. We  

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:30,000
can get an idea of is it works as of today, in  one year, or three years based on this system. 

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,200
The goal of is this is that any one of these  tools can provide valuable information,  

00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,120
but taken together they can provide  support through the entire process.  

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,080
Starting here on the left, once the  national water budget has been determined,  

00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:52,640
we can use this district tool to identify  which districts may need the most resources  

00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:59,440
to catch up based on their level of coverage. At  the district level, district managers can identify  

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:07,760
areas for rehabilitation, new construction, and  preventive maintenance. In a recent desktop review  

00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:15,760
of 12 districts in Sierra Leone, we found on  average using WPDx would have reached three times  

00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:33,840
more people nationally. Our analysis is really  designed to help focus on the unserved population. 

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,880
Feedback from government partners makes us  confident that bringing this data together  

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,520
will allow for meaningful analysis to help make  better decisions and ultimately improve services.  

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,160
We want to take a step back now and dive a bit  deeper into the some of the challenges that we  

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,440
faced and talk through some of our approaches.  First off, water point data does not come from  

00:06:53,440 --> 00:07:04,320
a single source. We have sources from governments,  NGOs, academic institutions, and many more. People  

00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,080
have a lot of different reasons they collect data  and a lot of different parameters that are defined  

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:15,120
slightly differently. For all of those who work  with field data, the reality is it is incomplete,  

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:22,960
noisy, duplicative, and fuzzy. We have a lot of  puzzle pieces that may not actually fit together. 

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,880
The first step was back in 2014. We  collaborated with an international  

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,400
working group to define a data standard. That was  using parameters that were both widely collected  

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:42,560
and were of interest at scale. This was a very  iterative process that resulted eventually in  

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,880
six required parameters and 20 optional  parameters that are listed here.  

00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:53,040
The standard is live. It evolves with the  sector, but essentially, we're looking at  

00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:57,840
parameters that describe the location, the  type, the functionality of the water point. 

00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:08,480
All right. Now over to Adam. >> ADAM:  

00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:17,440
Okay. So, Katy mentioned the standard, but even  with the standard and assuming everyone would  

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,960
use the standard, there are still big problems  because the data that is provided inside the  

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:32,880
standard is inconsistent. It's not just about the  field, but it's also about the values themselves.  

00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:40,400
Here you have an example of basically the same  technology being reported in different roles.  

00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:49,280
It can be provided in lots of different ways, and  the same kind of water point can be described in  

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:56,640
lots of different ways. It's not just about the  field but also about the data inside the fields.  

00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:05,680
Again, we need to understand the domain to  develop some heuristic to do that sort of mapping. 

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:13,120
I want to talk a bit about the  technological solution that we  

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:22,880
implemented to sort of tackle those challenges ‑‑  the multiple organizations and the fuzzy  

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:31,520
data and the fuzzy structure. One of the goals  in that solution ‑‑ we can go to the next slide. 

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:39,120
One of the goals there was to create something  that would be friendly enough so that  

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:48,400
those people in those organizations would be  able to upload their data to this system without  

00:09:49,280 --> 00:10:03,120
having to be extremely technical or having to have  some data wrangling capabilities. We don't want  

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:09,600
to sort of require a specific structure or  specific values because if we do put these  

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,760
requirements in, it just means we won't get the  data. Because sometimes the files are just there.  

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:22,560
Either we do the wrangling or no one else will do  that. We want to be able to get the data as‑is.  

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:31,840
Again, we didn't want to enforce any specific  format. We wanted to be as accepting as possible.  

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:40,400
Giving some agency to the people uploading  the data to see if there are any errors  

00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:44,960
or validation errors and be able to fix  them themselves. It really needed to be  

00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:52,320
something that tackled all the barriers that  we usually encounter in these sort of systems.  

00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:04,880
The way we tackle those things is using a  platform called DGP. That's on the next slide. 

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,680
It basically is a platform  

00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:18,480
that is sort of an evolution of work that I've  been doing for quite some time. It started with  

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:25,520
open spending. I don't know if you know that. It's  a similar system that was focused on fiscal data.  

00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:31,600
From there, I sort of took these concepts and  tried to build something that would be more  

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:40,400
generic built on top of the frictionless data  framework and the data flows at Python library.  

00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:48,880
The idea is that this platform basically  gets schema ‑‑ in our case, the schema is  

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,360
more or less a transformation of the  standard. Katy, go to the previous  

00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:02,000
slide. It have the data standard is  transformed to a schema or taxonomy that  

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:11,040
says the same things but in a more technical way. Each one of those fields has a definition as a  

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:18,400
data type. It's defined if it is mandatory  or optional. It defines validation rules.  

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:29,840
Once that schema is in the DGP platform, then  people can basically go to the platform, upload  

00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:39,120
a file, and do a simple process of mapping the  columns in their assorted file to the columns of  

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:51,840
that schema where mandatory columns are mandatory  and optional columns are obviously not required.  

00:12:54,080 --> 00:13:02,880
They can see interactively the different errors,  validation errors, in case they have them.  

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:09,840
Again, if some rows are failing, it doesn't mean  the entire file fails. It just means there's some  

00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:17,200
error. They can provide all kinds of parameters. Katy, can you go to the next slide? 

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,720
They can provide all kinds of parameters. For  example, undefined values. If there's some value  

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:35,280
that actually means this cell is empty, they can  specify that. Or if they have unique data formats  

00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:42,720
or number formats or different true/false values,  which are not exactly true or false ‑‑ in our  

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:53,280
case, it would be functional and nonfunctional for  water points. On top of that, we apply all kinds  

00:13:53,280 --> 00:14:01,360
of custom cleaning transformations. For example,  converting the water tech and water source that we  

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:08,240
saw earlier. That can come in lots of different  flavors. We map them into standard values. 

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,600
>> Five‑minute warning. >> ADAM:  

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,040
All right. Let's see how it actually  works. We have a very nice video.  

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:28,800
Basically, you just log into the system using  your Google account. You upload your source  

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:41,200
data to the system. Which again can be a CSV or  Excel file. You can provide a link to a Google  

00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:46,400
spreadsheet if you want. You need to provide  some metadata. The metadata is configurable.  

00:14:50,160 --> 00:15:00,000
Metadata on the entire source. Then once you  provide that file, the system automatically  

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:09,040
detects the file format, if you have some header  rows. Then it gives you an opportunity to map all  

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:17,920
the columns from the file to the schema. The idea  is that ‑‑ it looks like a very long process, but  

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:23,120
once you have mapped a similar process, the system  will try to automate it for you. If you have a  

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:30,080
column in the past that was already mapped to a  specific column in the standard system, it will  

00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:38,720
automatically suggest that. At the end of this  process, you basically submit this mapping for  

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:46,320
approval. What happens then is that Katy gets an  email saying, okay, there's a new source uploaded.  

00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:53,840
She can then take a look, see if she approves  of the file, and if so, it will go and  

00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,000
basically join the rest of the water  points in the harmonized dataset. 

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:07,680
Katy, you want to take it from here? >> KATY: Sure. Thanks, Adam. 

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,800
This is just an example of us bringing in the  data. You can see here on the left there's a  

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,200
list of different NGOs and organizations that  have shared data with us. You can see as they  

00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:23,360
appear on the map. You can see each of these  pieces coming together to present a much better  

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:30,640
overall view. The government comes in,  but you can actually see some of these  

00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,240
NGOs are still working in space where  the government didn't have that data.  

00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,880
It can even provide information to the government  as well as to others working in the sector. 

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,440
Just to give a quick here's where we're at and  the road ahead. We have over 6,000 water point  

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:51,120
records uploaded from over 80 organizations.  And we are working to sort of continue to  

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:57,200
build new and improve on our existing tools  to allow for better visualizations and easier  

00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:02,400
identification of these locations where you might  want to work, figuring out which locations are  

00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:08,320
likely to fail and really digging into that why  and what can be done to avoid that. This is about  

00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:16,640
providing an objective perspective to balance with  political pressures. Water is a very political  

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,200
area, so this is kind of trying to balance out  and focus on where there's unserved people. 

00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:28,080
Just a nod and appreciation to our very  generous funders and key partners. Our contact  

00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,840
details are here and that's it. >>  

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:45,840
Thank you so much. I think we have time for a  question. From the audience. I'd like to hear  

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:55,280
how you build relationships with local groups and  partners to get work done and to the end result  

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,720
of new water points. How do you build  trust to encourage people to share data  

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,520
and work with you? Any stories to share? >> KATY: Probably more stories than we  

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:11,680
have time for, but great question. It's a big  part of the challenge and opportunity, I think,  

00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:17,440
in that open data space. Sharing water data  for some organizations can come very easily,  

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:23,760
and for others it takes longer to demonstrate  the result. Here's what you can do with the  

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:31,200
data if you share with us. We work with a lot  of local groups. We are based in the U.S.,  

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,520
but we are work very closely with NGOs and  local partners who can build those longer‑term  

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,440
trusting relationships with the governments to  ensure they feel comfortable. Making your data  

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:48,240
transparent can be a big step. We've done sort  of longer-term relationships with Sierra Leone.  

00:18:49,280 --> 00:19:00,480
We're working with Ethiopia and Uganda. We're  making sure the data is well protected and safe  

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:06,080
and also that the results are responsive to  government need or responsive to organizational  

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:11,920
