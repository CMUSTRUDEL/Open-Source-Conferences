Title: William Lyon - Will You Be My Graph Data-bae? A Graph Data Love Story
Publication date: 2021-05-20
Playlist: CSVConf 2021
Description: 
	This talk tells the story of two technologies that were always meant to be together but came from different worlds, yet finally were able to come together and help the world make sense of data through APIs: GraphQL and graph databases. We'll discuss graph databases like Neo4j - what they are, why and how to use them, as well as the tradeoffs of building applications with graph databases. We'll review GraphQL and how to build GraphQL APIs. Then we'll see how GraphQL and Neo4j are even more powerful when used together, each leveraging features of the other (the property graph data model, a strict type system, index-free adjacency, extensibility through schema directives, and the Cypher query language) - resulting in a truly symbiotic and mutually beneficial relationship.
