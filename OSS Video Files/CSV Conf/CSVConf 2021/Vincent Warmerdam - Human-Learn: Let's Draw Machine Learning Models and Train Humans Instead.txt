Title: Vincent Warmerdam - Human-Learn: Let's Draw Machine Learning Models and Train Humans Instead

Description: 
	Back in the old days, it was common to write rule-based systems.

Systems that do; data ? -&gt; rules -&gt; labels.

Nowadays, it's much more fashionable to use machine learning instead.

Something like; (data, labels) -&gt; ML -&gt; rules.

I started wondering if we might have lost something in this transition. So I made an open source package in an attempt to keep the hype at bay. Maybe natural intelligence is just enough and maybe enough is plenty. In this talk I'll present a toolbox called "human-learn" that allows you to, literally, draw out a machine learning model. I'll demonstrate the benefits of the approach. Not only do we allows the machine to learn from a domain expert, we also force the algorithm designer to actually look at the data.
