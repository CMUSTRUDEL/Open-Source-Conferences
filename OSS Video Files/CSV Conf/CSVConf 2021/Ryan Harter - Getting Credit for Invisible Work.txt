Title: Ryan Harter - Getting Credit for Invisible Work
Publication date: 2021-05-20
Playlist: CSVConf 2021
Description: 
	A lot of the hard important work that goes into good data work is invisible. For example, most of an exploratory data analysis is testing *and discarding* hypotheses. We explore complex data, so we can distill our findings into a simple narrative. We never talk about all the hypotheses we’ve discarded!If we’re doing it right, we make our work look simple. This is super valuable, but can cause problems when we try to demonstrate our value. This talk covers some strategies for getting credit for this super valuable but invisible work.

hey

00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,160
thanks i'm uh i'm really excited to talk

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,639
to you all so i should be presenting

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,599
um and thanks for giving me some space

00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,480
to talk about this

00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,560
um quick introduction i'm ryan i'm a

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,600
principal data scientist mozilla

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,480
uh working on firefox um blog pretty

00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,000
regularly so

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,600
if you are interested in that you can

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,279
find the link right there

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,720
so i'm here to talk about getting credit

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,480
for invisible work

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,640
uh and since time's short i'll jump

00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,040
right in um

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,520
so i said them here to talk about

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,960
visible work what is invisible work

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,040
so for this talk i'm using a very

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,399
specific definition

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,079
and it has these three characteristics

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,040
so it's work that is critical to a

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,480
project success

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,719
something that you've worked on and is

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,719
very important something that takes

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,360
skill to do well and something that is

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,320
never shown to your stakeholders

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,840
so by this definition there's a lot of

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,160
invisible work this happens

00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,520
everywhere in knowledge work most of the

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,480
stuff that we do doesn't ever get

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,680
shown to a to a collaborator i think

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,280
this is unusually prominent in data work

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,360
so if you look at these classes of

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,320
invisible work you have like exploratory

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,880
data analysis

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,840
and data cleaning which monopolize the

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,840
time that you spend

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,479
producing a great analysis and this

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,680
never gets shared with anyone downstream

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,720
um just like a quick doodle of how i

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,479
visualize the data science process

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,840
we have a question and then we go

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,680
through this like

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,200
data science loop where we like build

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,439
hypotheses

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,280
look for data and reject those

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,119
hypotheses and build context up the

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,479
whole time

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:42,399
to us this process is pretty clear we

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,439
have been making progress the whole time

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:47,360
and we can feel that progress

00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,720
what our stakeholders see is they have a

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,240
question

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,640
we do some stuff and we come back with

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,159
an answer and this is

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,520
this is good i'm not saying that this is

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,479
a problem this is actually super

00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,520
virtuous

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:02,079
um the data scientist is creating

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,600
a lot of value when they're building up

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,520
all this context

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,119
and nobody wants the complexity that the

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,560
data scientist is dealing with we're

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,360
producing a lot of value by

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,200
simplifying these very complex data sets

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,760
into something that is

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,879
actionable but this can cause a bunch of

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,360
problems

00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:24,400
when we try to demonstrate our value

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,280
so i say demonstrate our value uh what i

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,920
mean by that

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,920
is well let's talk about it

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,760
demonstrating our value i work for a

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,959
company i work as an ic

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,840
i'm not mostly doing open source work so

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,440
i conceptualize getting proving my value

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,400
as maybe going for a promotion

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,519
or trying to get a raise this is true

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,840
also working

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,519
in the open or as consultant trying to

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,280
get folks to recognize difficult parts

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,040
your work is difficult

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,160
this is actually so this first line is

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,080
actually a piece that i got from a

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,040
performance review a long time ago and

00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,239
someone asked me that

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,400
they wanted to they wanted me to

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,080
demonstrate more complexity in my work

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,599
this may sound fine on the surface but i

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,280
think this thinking is pretty backwards

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,239
and this backwards thinking's pretty

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,959
common in the industry we tend to

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,440
conflate

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,080
really complex solutions with really

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,879
complex

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,159
problems and what we want is we want to

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,480
have really simple

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,080
solutions to complex problems the

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,760
complexity of our

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,720
solution is a cost to be born not

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,840
something to optimize for

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,560
and this is pretty common in the

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,959
industry i've seen this encourage

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,720
folks to slip machine learning into

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,159
places where it doesn't necessarily need

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,360
to be

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:39,440
and i've seen their i've seen folks

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,200
make their reports the things that

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,720
they're delivering to stakeholders i've

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,040
seen folks make these reports super

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,560
complicated in an attempt to document

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,000
all of the pieces

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,519
that they worked on all of the

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,959
complexity that they faced when coming

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,480
to this solution

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,480
they're trying to express this to their

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,799
stakeholders that they can understand

00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,000
how difficult this is in reality what

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,400
happens is you get a long

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,920
boring report that nobody really reads

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,640
and this is super lossy because you

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,360
could be

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,000
providing this super clean report um but

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,120
this push

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,840
for explaining complexity uh muddies

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,840
the conversation

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,000
so all right that's what invisible work

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,280
is that's what it might look like when

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,639
you're doing work

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,680
so what do we do and

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,960
this is the part where it's going to be

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,759
a little under satisfying because i

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,440
don't have a

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,280
silver bullet for this what i'm going to

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,960
suggest is

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,560
i'm going to explain some of the

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,000
strategies that have worked well for me

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,080
in building my career

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
and hope that that helps you in the

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,840
future

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,280
maybe like more importantly what i'm

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,120
hoping here is that by framing the

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,080
problem up nicely and demonstrating

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,240
where this problem

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,840
is that'll put you in good shape for the

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,040
next time you're trying to solve this

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,000
type of problem

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,360
i found that a well framed problem is 90

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,320
of the

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:58,560
90 of the way to being solved

00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,919
so i've had i have three things here i'm

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,680
going to go through them one by one

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,759
building a narrative arming your manager

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,000
and fighting a recency bias

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,759
so i'm i start by talking about building

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,400
a narrative because i think this is the

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,000
keystone to this whole process if we can

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,160
get this right we can kind of bumble

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,720
around with the other pieces

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,479
the key to building a narrative is

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,160
building this clean memorable story

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,120
about what you actually did and what was

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,880
hard about it

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,800
and this sounds simple on the surface

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,479
but i found that a lot of folks don't do

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,479
it when trying to explain their work

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,240
two tips on building this story things

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,240
that you want to focus on you want to

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,680
focus about what was actually really

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,919
difficult about your work

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,800
i've seen folks really focus on the most

00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,320
technical piece

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,880
or focus on the solution that they

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,120
pushed out those things can be useful to

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,039
talk about but more often

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,400
the really difficult part of the work is

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,880
something that

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,720
looks like framing up the problem or

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,320
finding the right data set or doing some

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,440
exploration and getting rid of a bunch

00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,880
of options

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,400
you want to focus on what was actually

00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,600
hard so that you can communicate that to

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,319
your peers

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,960
the other piece is focus on outcomes

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,039
instead of

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,720
this is maybe in contrast to the outputs

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,960
that you created

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,160
you don't want to focus just on the

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,680
piece of technical code that you

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,400
delivered or the data set that you

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,560
pushed out

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,000
you want to focus on how how it changed

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,440
the company

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,199
so for example maybe

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,639
my favorite type of project is one where

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,560
i decide to do nothing

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,759
i go talk to the stakeholder we talk

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,039
through their problems and they decide

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,319
there's a better way to solve this than

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,840
working with data

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,680
maybe they just go out and talk to some

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,120
folks maybe they just build a feature

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,800
and see what happens

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,319
in this scenario this is great it's the

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,319
best case scenario you haven't done

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,240
any work you haven't had to do any work

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,960
and everybody's happier

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,440
maybe maybe your outcome is that you

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,319
went

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,319
to a team that was very stressed because

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,039
they didn't know what was going on and

00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,080
that was making them uh very skeptical

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,680
and if you

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,840
walk away and the team's relieved

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,759
because they aren't angry anymore

00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,360
that's a huge win and you should sell

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:03,039
that that's something that you should

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,240
get rewarded for uh so that's two trips

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,599
here two tips for building this

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,800
narrative i also wanna like

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,160
cover one uh one risk don't again i've

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,280
talked about this before don't share

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,800
complexity

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,240
a lot of times folks when building up

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,039
this narrative about what their work

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,840
looks like

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,960
take the take all of the complexity that

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,560
they worked with

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,479
and document it and that really create

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,880
this big document that talks about uh

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,000
all the difficult parts of this work uh

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,520
that's really

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,880
not useful folks are gonna look at that

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,000
they're not gonna read it because it is

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,599
super complex

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,880
you need a story that you can share with

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,680
folks and that folks will share with

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,520
each other

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,000
something that can communicate or that

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,360
can be shared from human to human

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,400
so that's that's the goal behind this

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,599
building narrative i'm going to keep

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,520
moving at a pretty good click i'll leave

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,840
some time for questions at the end

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,440
uh once you have this narrative you need

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,280
to get into the hands of someone who can

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,879
share it around the company for you

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,800
uh sometimes you're gonna have to be

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,319
your own manager but the the goal here

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,360
is to have this story in the hands of

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,120
someone who's

00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:02,160
selling this selling this story around

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,560
so the high level piece

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,560
is that

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,120
your your manager or you in this

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,120
situation is going to be in a situation

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,160
where they need to

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,680
sell your story so you need to arm them

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,080
and make that as easy as possible for

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,599
them

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,120
sometimes folks feel like this is a

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,120
little conceited

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,479
they don't want to they don't want to

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,520
share this story about how great they

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,840
are and have someone

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,879
pushing that around in reality

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,280
everyone's busy

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,800
we want you to be successful and your

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,000
manager is going to be grateful for you

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,599
for making it easy

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,760
so giving them this narrative that they

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,599
can use when they're in a room with a

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,959
bunch of their peers trying to argue

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,479
over who gets promoted

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,159
if if they have this story and they're

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,599
armed well that makes them look good and

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,200
it makes it a lot easier for them to do

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,160
their job well

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,680
um one tactical strategy is once you

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,760
have this narrative slip it into your

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,839
one-on-ones and do it frequently

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,360
this helps arm your manager because the

00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,560
story will be common it'll be something

00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,200
that they've worked over a bunch of

00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,200
times

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,200
this also helps you build this narrative

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,640
because the more time you spend thinking

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,080
about it the more smooth it's going to

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,279
be and the better the presentation will

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,760
be

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,279
it also makes sure that you're aligned

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,720
i've been caught in a situation where

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,080
i've built this fantasy about how

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,360
important my work is

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,160
and that's not great and you want to get

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,600
rid of that as quickly as possible

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,240
this final piece is about finding

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,680
recency bias so

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,120
this is something that i fell into i had

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,320
the first two bits and i was writing

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,080
pretty good narratives

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,080
what i found is that when i would look

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,680
back at my work i would focus on the

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,279
solution because it's the last thing

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,800
that i did it's the thing that solved

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,360
this whole problem

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,040
uh what i found is that in reality the

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,720
solution is an answer to a problem that

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,360
took a really long time to frame

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,040
properly

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,040
and that framing was a difficult work

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,880
i've seen this reflected even the job

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,360
ladder that this framing of the problem

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,600
is the hard difficult work for data work

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,440
if you look at different job or as you

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,040
move up the job letter and you get more

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,320
seniority the biggest thing that changes

00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,360
is the problems you get are more and

00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,519
more vague

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,480
so sell that part of the work you're

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,640
doing

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,320
and the recency bias forces you to focus

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,680
on this last thing that you fixed

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,720
instead of where you started and what

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,839
the real

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,600
business problem was um

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,880
i'm going to skip over this example in

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,000
the sake of time

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,920
um well no i won't all right so real

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,120
quick example from my workplace

00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,200
this is something that i worked on a

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,079
long time ago in my career

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,000
and it wasn't super technical it was a

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,680
etl for a data set that summarized the

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,279
business metric

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:33,360
it was something like take countries

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,720
for every day and count this metric and

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,160
put it into a data set so that our

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,519
executives can like play around with it

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,600
and get a feel for

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,519
uh what's going on in the business it's

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,680
not technically complex

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,000
at all it was very easy to deliver it

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,680
wasn't more than 100 lines of code

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,279
it took three months to deliver so

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,880
that's not great

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,480
and all in all this doesn't seem like a

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,399
great project

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,079
but once it was launched everyone was

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,720
thrilled and i got promoted

00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,600
not very long afterwards so what

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,360
happened there

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,240
how did that how did that non-technical

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:07,120
project lead to these good results

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,880
um and that goes back to the narrative

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,839
the actual difficult part about this

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,680
project

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,040
wasn't the data set that i pushed out it

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,079
was that the questions i were getting

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,760
were kind of confused

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:20,320
and vague and with a lot of urgency so

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,880
when i got these questions you know they

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,240
immediately felt

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,600
i like to use the the metaphor it

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,120
sounded like someone asked me to buy

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,240
them a fridge that they could keep their

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,839
house cold

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,320
and it created this type of like

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,480
skeptical feeling like i don't think

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,399
that's what you want um and it would

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,839
have been easy enough for me to

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,600
answer their requests the way that they

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,720
asked it and then just walk away

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,040
but i knew that that wasn't going to

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,360
make them happy so i took some time

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,079
dug in and framed this problem well once

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,640
i did

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,680
uh the main thing that i that i left

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,519
when i walked away was

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,200
folks were very confident about what was

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,480
solved what wasn't solved what we knew

00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,399
and what we didn't know

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,160
and that like calmed them down that gave

00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:01,040
them a lot of peace of mind

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,399
so what i really sold here was the peace

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,200
of mind that i delivered to the team

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,040
instead of the

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,120
the technical thing that wasn't all that

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:10,160
complex

00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,760
so uh i've got to slip this in so i've i

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,880
said what you want to do what outcomes

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,079
you want to create but i didn't talk

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,680
about like

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,200
what you actually do like what are the

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,480
rituals there's a moment of draw the

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,639
rest of the owl

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,480
with this description so two strategies

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,839
that i use and i still use today

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,920
that are super useful or keeping

00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:28,079
snippets and keeping a brag document

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,240
i'll talk about each of these snippets

00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:32,399
this is a behavior that i picked up when

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,800
i was at google

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,560
it's been super useful and it's morphed

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,920
into my own weird

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,279
type of ritual every week i write down

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,880
what i did what was important

00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,880
and i try to focus on keeping a lot of

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,480
artifacts and keeping a lot of context

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:50,079
this is a really useful tool when you're

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,079
trying to fight recency bias

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,839
be as specific as you can this has been

00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,279
super useful for me if you're only going

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,160
to do one of these two definitely do

00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,399
snippets

00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,200
this is collecting data on yourself and

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,040
what you

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,639
measure you're going to start improving

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,079
this also helps you find work that you

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,959
shouldn't be doing and help you discard

00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,079
it

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,959
the other piece is a brag document um as

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,959
you

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,399
do work you get excited about it but

00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,800
that excitement doesn't

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,560
hold doesn't last right you get more

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,279
work and you try to focus on bigger

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,800
things

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,800
if i look at my work from two years ago

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,880
it's not exciting because it's a problem

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,600
that i've already solved

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,560
this brag document helps capture that

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,160
excitement

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,600
so that later when you're like looking

00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,720
through your work you can be like ah

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,320
this is an index

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,160
of the things that i should be looking

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,440
for in my week reviews or my old

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,680
snippets

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:41,199
this brag doc helps grab that excitement

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:43,680
and helps you share it with other folks

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,040
so the other thing is it's just a nice

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,880
dopamine hit and helps you see your

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,120
progress as a data scientist so

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,240
i recommend you keep it if only for that

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,880
reason

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,480
cool in summary invisible work happens

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,440
get credit for it by telling a clean

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,760
story about

00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,519
what actually happened to your manager

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,959
and you should probably be keeping

00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,480
weekly weekly snippets um i'm going to

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,920
post these slides later today i'm going

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,839
to leave some room for questions it

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,000
looks good about four minutes

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,360
um if we don't get the questions today

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,800
if we don't get to your question or if

00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,000
you have a shower thought later

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:18,800
feel free to email me blog heartrt.com

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,279
um and then the only other note is that

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,000
i'm

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,639
hiring so if you're interested shoot me

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,399
a

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:28,839
resume at csv harderrt.com

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:31,839
cool i'll leave the rest of the room for

00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,839
questions

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,639
fantastic thank you so much for this

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,839
talk ryan i

00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,160
particularly appreciate the reminder for

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,480
us

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:47,040
all to be persistent and unapologetic

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,160
about advocating for ourselves and to

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,839
also

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,880
frame the narratives that we want shared

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,600
in a way that is

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,680
easy for them to be repeated elsewhere

00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,079
by others thank you

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,079
we have one question from tara and i

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,920
encourage you to share other questions

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,120
that you may have using the ask a

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,320
question butter

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,880
button tara asks is there

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,040
value to calculating a return on

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:17,440
investment could be time or

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:19,440
money or is it just busy work

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,600
uh it depends on how close to the money

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,000
you are um

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,720
i've had work where like it's very clear

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,880
how much

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:31,120
uh how much value i produce in dollars

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,480
and then that calculation can make sense

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,680
i find most of the time

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,600
uh we're so far ahead

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,240
of like actually launching a project we

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:43,920
can be in like the research stages or

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,880
we could be in the very early stages of

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,639
building up the product

00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,720
and if that's the case it's really hard

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,720
to make a prediction about how much

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,759
value or how many dollars we'll be

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,199
related to

00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,320
and then that if you don't have dollars

00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,759
it makes it really hard to make that

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,000
calculation work

00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,480
i think it's maybe more valuable to

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,040
think about this as opportunity sizing

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,759
and i just had a blog post about uh how

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,560
we do our

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:09,040
community sizing at mozilla um and there

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:12,079
you look at really high level

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,399
is this work that i'm doing big enough

00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:16,320
to be worth my time and if you can get a

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,959
like even just a rough estimate about

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,959
whether those

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:21,040
line up i think that can be really

00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,079
useful um it's really easy to work on

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,560
stuff that

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:26,160
you know isn't hurting the company but

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:30,160
isn't valuable enough

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,120
to uh to be worth your salary um

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,440
and no one's going to tell you that

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,120
that's not worth working on it becomes a

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,959
good thing to do

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:42,480
great we have plenty more questions ryan

00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:45,680
um i think i'll highlight one by k and k

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,519
asks um what are

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,079
one second so what are your thoughts

00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:52,639
about the challenges of communicating

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:55,199
technical work with a non-technical

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,199
manager

00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,720
yeah that is difficult i've i generally

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,079
uh

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,680
when i'm looking for teams i tend to

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,039
report i try to look to report to

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,520
someone who's worked with data in the

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,959
past

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,199
if you're in a situation where you're

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:13,600
like reporting to someone

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:17,839
who isn't a technical manager um

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:19,039
this this like very clean narrative is

00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,880
way more important

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,559
right because now what you're doing is

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,000
you're taking your technical work

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,240
you're distilling it and explaining it

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,600
to someone who has to be able to tell

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,640
this particular story well and they

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,039
won't be able to like

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,880
iterate on the edges so when they get

00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:36,400
questions they'll have to

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:38,080
ad-lib a little bit so focus really hard

00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,760
on making this narrative clean

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,160
and helping them understand what was

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:46,400
really difficult about your work

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:48,559
um yeah what did that answer the

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,280
question do you think

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:54,240
i think so um and there's a related one

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,400
actually from eric and eric asks uh

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,840
how will you alter any of your

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,640
recommendations specifically for

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:05,600
academia

00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,600
for academia well i think

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,880
uh i haven't worked in academia i

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,840
stopped after my bachelor's

00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,480
so i i've only looked from the outside

00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,360
and

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,039
i think there's still very clear uh

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,039
incentives and getting credit for this

00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:24,240
is still important

00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,679
academia has a very clear uh outline for

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,160
what they want at least from what i can

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,840
tell

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,440
focusing on publishing and getting

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,320
papers out there uh

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,400
so i i'd make sure that you're

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,880
responding to the incentives that they

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,919
are

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:40,480
pushing at you part of this is that

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,200
uh in in the corporate world i found

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,960
that

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,799
companies want one thing and they'll

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,120
reward another and they just kind of

00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:48,160
hope

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:51,120
that we resist this

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,120
we resist this

00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,720
incentive and a lot of folks do in

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,000
academia they're

00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,559
they're telling you what they want i

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,799
think pretty clearly and

00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:02,400
if they're not changing their story then

00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:05,520
it's fine to play to their game

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:09,120
um so they want you to just publish

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,120
