Title: Identifying the who, what, and (sometimes) where of research data sharing at an academic institution
Publication date: 2021-05-20
Playlist: CSVConf 2021
Description: 
	Presenter:  John Borghi

In many areas of academic research, there is a growing emphasis on sharing data and other materials. However, tracking which researchers affiliated with a given institution are sharing, what they are sharing, and what tools they are using to share remains extremely challenging. To help inform the support services offered to affiliated researchers, I attempted to track the research data shared by Stanford Medicine in 2020. In this talk, I will describe the methods I used, the (incomplete but hopefully representative) information I was able to collect, and how this information will be used moving forward. Spoiler alert, I sorted through thousands of journal articles and data availability statements and discovered data in some unexpected places.

>> John: All right. Perfect. Okay. Hi,  everybody. I'm going to talk about identifying  

00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:14,000
static data. Finding data that has been  shared, that is associated with researchers  

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,320
at my academic institution. So, I realized when  I was looking at these slides right now that I  

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,440
did not actually identify the institution. But  I am the manager of research and instruction  

00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,440
at Lane Medical Library at Stanford,  specifically the school of medicine.  

00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:35,760
So, who cares? Why am I interested in  research data underlying publications? 

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,120
Well, there's lots of reasons to be interested in  this kind of data. Reproducibility, you're trying  

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,920
to verify the results, trying to reuse it for  something, maybe throw some algorithms at it,  

00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,640
see what happens. Testing methods, building  hypothesis. Or you could just be trying to  

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,040
learn. You could be trying to navigate through  the data to figure out what the researchers  

00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:02,240
have done. And if you've ever tried to go out and  find this data, you -- you probably noticed that  

00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:08,720
its not particularly straightforward. So, this  slide here is me many having a little bit of fun  

00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,640
at some of the responses that  you might get if you go look for  

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,080
data underlying a scholarly publication. Anything from here, like, here's the  

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:25,040
DOI or the accession number. You can download it.  It's publicly available. Go get it from here. To,  

00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,920
you know, we can maybe send it to you, but  it's really big. Or it's on hard drives  

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,560
that are not in the country. Or it's sensitive  information but we might email it to you kind of  

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:44,240
on the down low. All the way up to, no. It's  not available at all. So, it's a big challenge. 

00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:52,240
The reason I really care about this, in addition  to these issues of reproducibility and reuse and  

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:58,400
things like that is one of the hats they  wear at the library is helping researchers  

00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,640
manage and share their data. So, just to  define kind of my terms here a little bit.  

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,400
So, what I mean by data in this context is  literally just anything that is required to  

00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:13,440
evaluate, reproduce, or build upon whatever  analyses they're talking about or conclusions  

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,600
they're talking about in a paper. Of course,  there's lots of research data that's not  

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:25,200
sort of described in papers. But focusing  today on publication-related data. 

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,640
And then for management and sharing, data  management. It's very jargon-heavy term as John  

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,920
knows. As I've talked to him about. But  it's activities related to data storage,  

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,600
data organization, documentation, communication.  Basically, not only can you find this data,  

00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,640
can you actually use this data? Is it organized?  That kind of thing. And then data sharing in  

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,680
this context is the release of data for  use by others. Very frequently and often  

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,480
at this conference we are talking about open data  sharing where data is made available to everyone. 

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:05,360
But, you know, in the context of sharing data  in an academic medical center kind of setting,  

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,360
often data sharing is a lot more restricted. So,  it's, you know, sharing under certain conditions  

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:22,000
or to certain people or for certain reasons. Okay.  And I want to sort of -- I'm doing this part of  

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,320
my job as I help researchers with this, I often  have lots of questions that are very practical  

00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:33,680
and often verge into the existential. So,  questions like who is actually sharing their data?  

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,160
What kind of data are they sharing? How  are they sharing it? And getting into the  

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:45,840
existential questions, do they know that I  exist? Do they know I'm a resource for them?  

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,680
Anyone who has worked in a setting  like I work in may have come across  

00:03:53,680 --> 00:04:00,160
the idea that researchers have lots of resources  available to them. One of the major obstacles is  

00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,880
getting them to know the resources are  available and taking advantage of them. 

00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:11,840
So, it's a big universe out there. I promised my  4-year-old I would put some of his artwork in the  

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,960
presentation. It's a big universe throughout and  as a data librarian, I'm trying to find needles  

00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:26,720
in very large hay stacks. One of the ways I'm  trying to answer the questions I posed earlier  

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:33,280
is looking beyond Stanford University. Looking at  PubMed Central. Stanford has lots of information  

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:39,600
on what it's researchers are doing and  publication information. But research  

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:46,960
information is ambiguous and scattered across  multiple databases that's hard for me to  

00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:54,000
bring together and easily access. So, one of the  strategies I've taken to answer questions is by  

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,920
looking at PubMed Central. For those not familiar,  PubMed Central is a repository with 7 million  

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,040
biomedical and life sciences articles. It's  distinct from PubMed, the search engine that  

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,120
the librarians or medical librarians  probably visit multiple times a day and  

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,640
many of the biomedical researchers as well.  And why it's useful to me for this purpose,  

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:27,200
it covers articles covered bit NIH public Access  Policy. If your work is funded by the NIH, you  

00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:36,000
have to deposit articles arising from that work in  this repository and the contents of participating  

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,680
journals. So, a lot of open access journals  have their articles archived in this database. 

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,280
And what makes it most useful is that it has  filters to locate articles with the associated  

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:54,160
datasets. Including those with data availability  statements. So, a data availability statement is  

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,120
a simple statement that tells readers where  the work -- or where the data associated with  

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:05,840
related work can be found. So, it can contain  direct links to publicly-available datasets or  

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,760
have some conditions for accessing more restricted  datasets. As I will show examples of, this  

00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:19,840
information can be useful sometimes, and sometimes  it's so ambiguous that it's not useful at all.  

00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:28,320
But it is a good or at least a visible source of  information about what kind of data is available  

00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:34,160
and what kind of data is available  through sort of non-repository means. 

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,640
Okay. So, this -- these are some lightly-edited  examples of data availability statements.  

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,480
I should say at this point I'm not trying  to single out any individual researcher  

00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:49,280
for statements for information they included or  didn't include that their papers. There's a lot of  

00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,400
confusion how to do these properly. But this  is to give you an idea what's out there.  

00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,880
Sometimes you have a sentence that says all of  the data is in this repository. Here's the link.  

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,840
Also see the data used is available upon  reasonable request. Kind of whatever that  

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:13,280
means. But that's the statement that's in there.  Or even things that say we can't make the data  

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,720
available to protect patient confidentiality. Or  the most straightforward statements I've ever seen  

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:26,880
that says this manuscript has no associated data. But they can get more complicated. So, you know,  

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:33,280
the first statement on this slide is essentially  data is not available, but is available. So, data  

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,800
cannot be made available because of privacy  reasons. A very common reason cited in statements  

00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:46,880
coming from, you know, medical centers. But is  available from the corresponding author upon  

00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,040
request. So, it's not available, but if you ask  for it, you'll email it to you. And I try not to  

00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:58,000
think too much about that. Sometimes the data is  scattered across many different repositories and  

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,720
many different mechanisms of access that you'll  have, you know, data in one repository, code on  

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,320
GitHub. Other information that is available on  request. And then I've highlighted in red some  

00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:15,760
very lightly-edited statements where it is really  ambiguous what is going on. So, most of the raw  

00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:21,440
data are presented in the manuscript or supplement  which begs the question, what isn't? And then some  

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:27,440
study data is available. This actually is  the only one that is a verbatim copy from  

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,960
an article. And I'm really just curious how they  are defining every single word in that sentence. 

00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:41,920
Okay. So, that's -- that's kind of the data source  and you can see that it's messy. We are relying on  

00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:49,040
self-report from researchers about where  they're data is. There's also some other  

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,760
limits of -- there's incomplete coverage here.  So, there's about 10 times as many abstracts  

00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:01,120
from authors, as there are from Stanford authors  in PubMed that are availability statements.  

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:10,960
We are looking at a hopefully small sample of a  broader group of papers. So, this is certainly  

00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:15,840
not -- I'm not systemically looking at data across  every single paper coming out of my University. 

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,720
The statements are unstructured and may  not contain all relevant information.  

00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,440
I was having a conversation last week and someone  said, wouldn't it be easier just to look at  

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:31,200
data citations? You could like create algorithms  to crawl that and find that information. And  

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:38,240
that would indeed be easier. But that is, you  know, we get a lot of information from these  

00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:44,720
sort of unstructured statements as well. And this is, you know, just based on my  

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,880
experience teaching data management and doing  research about data management, even the data  

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,360
that is stated to be available in these statements  may not actually be available if you go and look  

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,640
for it on the repository. Or if it is there, it  might not actually be useful. So, lots and lots of  

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:08,000
caveats to this method that I'm about to describe. But here it is. So, I have two regularly updated  

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,360
PubMed central searches running in the background  all of the time. And every week I get new results.  

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:21,680
Which I will describe how I code them in just a  second. But there's, you know, 1422 results as of  

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:29,680
Monday from a search looking at papers published  in 2020. And 540 published in 2021 so far.  

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,120
So, this is kind of the workflow  from there. For the 2020 papers,  

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,320
I will mostly be focusing on these. I  extract the data availability statements  

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,840
from the search. Code the affiliation of  Stanford corresponding authors. Code for  

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,760
how the data is being made available. Where it's  being made available. If it's in a repository.  

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,640
And then for the 2021 papers, I'm going to do  that same thing. But currently what I'm doing  

00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:02,560
is coding the department and then  if they're a School of Medicine  

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,280
person or person affiliated with the School of  Medicine, I send them an email which I will show  

00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:14,160
right here. Which is my way, sort of, of answering  do they know that I exist kind of question? 

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:20,240
So, I'm getting emails -- I'm sending out  emails to people who have made data available.  

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,200
Or at least data that is not unavailable  through this data availability statement  

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,960
kind of idea. And this is just an introduction  to me, the services that my library offers  

00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:37,840
and that kind of thing. And so, I send these out  every Monday. Sometimes it's crickets. Sometimes  

00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,840
as of this week I get some immediate responses  saying that I didn't know that you were here.  

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,840
Didn't know that we had access to these  things. You know, that kind of stuff. 

00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:52,000
Okay. So, for the 2020 kind of corpus  of papers I have gone through and coded  

00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:02,000
1200 of them so far. And for about 92% the data  is not unavailable. There is some mechanism,  

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,480
according to the data availability  statement, for accessing the data. And  

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,520
often, it is researchers making their own data  available. But I also have gone through and coding  

00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:17,120
where they have stated that the data is  like public data that they're reusing. 

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:26,960
And then of those 1094 papers where the  data is not unavailable, where I can't -- or  

00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,840
where I can figure out that there is  some mechanism for getting the data,  

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,160
this is kind of how it breaks down. You'll  notice that these numbers do not add up.  

00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:39,360
There's a lot of data availability statements  that say some of the data is available through  

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,840
this mechanism. Some is available through this  mechanism. For the rest of it, just ask us. 

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:52,480
So, a little under half includes statements  saying that requests can be made to the authors.  

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,840
Some other people say that requests can be made  to other parties. Usually the IRB or some sort  

00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:06,640
of data access committee. About a third say  that in some way data is being made available  

00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,480
through the article itself. Either as a  supplementary material, as source data,  

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,640
underlying figures or just a statement  that says data is available in the article.  

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,840
And the sort of ambiguity around that is something  I'm kind of wrestling on how to deal with.  

00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:26,400
But about half of these statements say some  of the data is available in a repository. 

00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:34,160
And just to speak on sort of the request  to author and supplement thing. This is  

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:39,520
a hour workshop that I give about data sharing  condensed into a single slide. And basically,  

00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:44,640
this is also in the text of the email that I  showed where data sharing upon request is not  

00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:50,640
always a great option. Because contact  information can change as researchers move.  

00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:55,680
And so, getting a hold of a person to actually  give you the data becomes more challenging over  

00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,600
time. There's some pretty good research on  this. And sharing data as a supplementary  

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,360
material is better than not sharing it at all,  I guess. But those materials can be easily  

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:13,120
separated from the article. And it's hard  to kind of get citation information and  

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,720
track information about the datasets. So, generally we encourage folks to  

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,160
put things in a repository. And this is the  breakdown of repositories. Where things are.  

00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:33,520
So, you can see because of the long tail  here, I have included only repositories  

00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:40,320
that have more than one dataset in them from  my sample. And so, a couple of notable things.  

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:50,240
GitHub and websites are very much represented.  Probably because I'm including software related to  

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,600
data in my definition of data. But there's also  lots of people who say, our definition -- our  

00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:02,800
dataset is available on GitHub. And a website is  like literally ranges from somebody's personal  

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:10,080
website to a University website to a collaboration  website. Basically, any kind of website or portal  

00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:15,760
that I can't figure out if there's a underlying  preservation or repository underneath it. 

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:22,640
So, just a couple things to pull out of  this. We have a good representation of  

00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:30,640
general purpose repositories. Each of these is  about 5% of the data. Or each of them on the  

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:37,360
left side is about 5% of data or a little bit  less. But far and away, you know, the most  

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:43,200
common data repository is an NCBI repository,  gene expression omnibus. So, I think we have  

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:52,720
maybe a fifth to a fourth of the total research  data shared out of Stanford through this -- as  

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,640
detected through this mechanism is through one  discipline-specific repository. Or data type  

00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:04,320
specific repository. Which is interesting. So, what is the conclusion of all this?  

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,040
The universe is a little bit clearer for  me. So, this is a slightly less messy  

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:17,440
universe drawing. You know, I have a clearer -- a  somewhat clearer idea of where folks are sharing  

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:23,440
data. I have, you know, a list of faculty  that I have emailed and a list of faculty  

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,560
who are sharing data through certain  mechanisms that I can reach out to.  

00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:31,680
We now have a data source for making internal  decisions about supporting different kinds  

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,840
of repositories and spinning up training  related to different kinds of repositories. 

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,920
And it's just like a really interesting way  of also looking at data sharing over time. So,  

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:47,760
we're looking at two years. I will continue doing  this. I have it on the agenda to look at previous  

00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:54,560
years. But so far it's already yielded some very  interesting results in terms of how people are  

00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:02,160
sharing what they are sharing. And when they are  sharing. And some of the single use repositories  

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:10,400
are things like, you know, Google Drive or  things like that. So, things that I'm really,  

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,280
you know, as a data librarian,  eager to reach out and tell people  

00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,560
to stop doing that as well. Anyway. That is my presentation. Here is my  

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,920
contact information if you have questions.  And I will be on Slack afterwards and  

00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:31,280
I think there is time for questions. >> Yeah. Thank you, John. Many people enjoyed  

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:39,600
the graphic of the excuses. And also enjoyed  August's drawing. Talent in the family.  

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,560
So, one question was really about the stage that  you're doing the analysis. Maybe about, you know,  

00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:50,480
whether or not you can go further upstream.  Like are there places in the process like  

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,800
pre-prints or something elsewhere you can get a  little bit further upstream to help researchers? 

00:17:54,800 --> 00:18:00,720
John: Yeah, this is a lagging indicator. This  is way past the time that really I would want  

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:07,120
to be involved. When I do outreach for people,  please keep me in mind for next time. Let's  

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:14,160
talk about your next project. Pre-prints, we've  started to get some pre-prints into in dataset  

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,600
through the NIH pre-print project.  They're mostly coding-related.  

00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,960
And that's been a little bit helpful.  But I still think that's okay. Like,  

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:30,960
they've already analyzed the data. The -- I think  a completely different approach is needed to get  

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:37,440
earlier. And that's like the more traditional  kind of librarian outreach stuff. Like just  

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,680
outreach to people. Like, come, let me talk  to your lab about data management and sharing  

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,640
throughout the whole process rather than here  at the end. At this point, it's mostly just like  

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,520
