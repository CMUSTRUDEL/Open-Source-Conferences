In many areas of academic research, there is a growing emphasis on sharing data and other materials. However, tracking which researchers affiliated with a given institution are sharing, what they are sharing, and what tools they are using to share remains extremely challenging. To help inform the support services offered to affiliated researchers, I attempted to track the research data shared by Stanford Medicine in 2020. In this talk, I will describe the methods I used, the (incomplete but hopefully representative) information I was able to collect, and how this information will be used moving forward. Spoiler alert, I sorted through thousands of journal articles and data availability statements and discovered data in some unexpected places.
