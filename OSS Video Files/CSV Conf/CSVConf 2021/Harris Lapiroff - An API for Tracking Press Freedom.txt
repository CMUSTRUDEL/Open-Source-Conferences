Title: Harris Lapiroff - An API for Tracking Press Freedom
Publication date: 2021-05-19
Playlist: CSVConf 2021
Description: 
	In 2017, as the Trump administration was ramping up a war of open hostility against the press, a collaborative of press freedom organizations launch a database and website to track aggressions against journalists. The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker records incidents include arrests, border stops, physical assaults, subpoenas, equipment damage, and more. In addition to detailed articles, all four years (and counting) of the Tracker data is made available through an API that can be used to track trends, aggregate incidents related to specific events, and more. We'll show off examples of how the API is already used to power interactive data visualizations and give an overview of how anyone can access and use the data.

Thanks so much. Hi. I'm Harris Lapiroff. I work  for the freedom of the Press Foundation which  

00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,800
is a nonprofit that defends journalists  and whistle blowers through technology,  

00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,960
advocacy and digital security.  I have been working in-house for  

00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,520
FPF for about three years. I worked for them as  a consultant for some three years before that.  

00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,960
So, I have been around for the entire life span of  the project that I'm talking to you about today. 

00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:39,040
So, quick overview of what I'm gonna talk about.  I'm gonna tell you about the US Press Freedom  

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:45,360
Tracker, its history and its purpose. I'm going  to introduce you to its API. And I'm going to  

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:52,480
give you a case study on how we used our data  to draw insights about press freedom violations  

00:00:52,480 --> 00:01:02,560
during Black Lives Matter protests in 2020. In 2017 in a partnership with a couple dozen  

00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:07,840
other press freedom organizations, we  launched the US Press Freedom Tracker.  

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,120
Its purpose is to comprehensively and  systemically document aggressions against  

00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:19,520
press freedom in the United States. While stories  of journalists being attacked and arrested have,  

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,080
of course, been covered in the past, there  was no central repository of them that we  

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,920
could use to answer questions like, how many  journalists were arrested in 2020? Is it more  

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,600
fewer than were arrested in 2019? Or how many  journalists have been subpoenaed this year? 

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,480
And I think in general, we have been quite  successful with this goal. Our reporting is  

00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:48,560
commonly cited among other places in news  stories and amicus briefs in court cases.  

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:57,440
One recent from this year, a journalist, Andrea  Sahouri of the Des Moines Register went to trial  

00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:04,560
after being arrested while covering a protest.  And at the time that happened, a lot of reporters  

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,800
turned to us and our data to find out how common  it was for journalists to face a criminal trial.  

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,160
And the answer is, by the way, it's actually  quite uncommon. Cases are usually dropped  

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,840
before it reaches trial. I think this  was the first one since 2018, I believe. 

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,720
The Tracker organizes incidents into 11  categories. Some of them are easier to  

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,000
be comprehensive than others. For example,  it's pretty clear what qualifies as a leak  

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,520
prosecution or a journalist being arrested. But  we also have categories like chilling statements  

00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,960
which is both a little muddier and a little  more expansive. Where we couldn't possibly  

00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:54,960
be comprehensive, but we think it's important  to cover politicians, people in power saying  

00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:00,720
things that have a chilling effect on journalism. And as you can see, we do also have this catchall  

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,320
category for incidents that we think deserve  coverage but don't fit neatly anywhere else. 

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:18,880
So, each incident that we cover is thoroughly  reported by our staff in the narrative form. But  

00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:24,080
we also think of the Tracker as a database. And  for every incident we cover, we report a bunch  

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,600
of structured data about it. We knew early on  that we wanted to be rigorous in our reporting  

00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:35,440
and provide people a reliable dataset to identify  trends and put particular incidents in context. 

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,400
So, from the beginning, we've had an API through  which people could use the information from our  

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,920
site. As you likely know, an API is the way  to access data from a system. In this case,  

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:54,240
the US Press Freedom Tracker. And our API in  particular doubles both as a way to get an  

00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:00,480
export of the complete contents of the website  or to execute a query for a more specific subset  

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,440
of data. And it can be easily accessed through  a web browser or through any automated script. 

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:16,560
So, actually, after four years of operation we  actually just launched a new API pretty recently.  

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,560
In fact, it was basically yesterday. So, if  there's any sloppiness in my presentation today,  

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,040
it's because I was waiting to see whether  or not we would actually get the new API  

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,640
across the line before delivering it.  So, we did. And you can find that API  

00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:38,160
at the URL there at the top of the screen. You can even visit that in a web browser.  

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,520
Our website is powered by Django, or Django  REST framework which provides a pretty nice  

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:51,120
interface for just browsing the API as a human  using your web browser. If you do visit, you'll  

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:58,080
notice that first URL is really just a holding  page for listing different endpoints. Currently,  

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:04,080
we only have one endpoint that supports fetching  data about incidents. But we do have plans to add  

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,720
a category's endpoint that will let you fetch  data about the different categories as well.  

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,840
So, if you want to just download all of the  incidents right now, you can use that second  

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,560
URL. It will give you a complete dump of all  the thousand plus incidents in our database.  

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:27,120
The default response is JSON, but if you prefer  to get it in CSV, add that CSV to the end.  

00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,880
And as a bonus, that will  be a much smaller file size. 

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:41,840
Our API does also support more complex queries as  I mentioned earlier. We do have some documentation  

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:48,960
for that as pressfreedomtracker.US/data. Here's  a couple examples of this. I don't want to get  

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:55,040
too deep into it because I'm not trying to  get too technical. But as you can see, you can  

00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:00,720
make a query that has a date range that  you want to incidents within. You can also  

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,400
change which fields you're requesting. So, by  default, that includes all of the information  

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,200
which can be quite a lot because it also  includes the write-ups in their complete  

00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:16,560
Richtext formatting. If you don't need all that  information, you can just specify that you need  

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:24,080
the title, city and state of the incidents. If you, you know, want any more examples of  

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:30,640
queries, feel free to ask me later  on in the Slack or during the Q&A. 

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,720
So, as I'm sure everyone remembers, in May  of last year a Black man, George Floyd, was  

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,960
murdered on video by Minneapolis police officer  Derek Chauvin, setting off a month of protests  

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:53,600
throughout the country. While these protests  were clearly a reckoning of race in the US,  

00:06:53,600 --> 00:07:02,160
they were also a flashpoint of press freedom. In  2020, we documented 517 incidents specifically  

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:08,960
at Black Lives Matter protests. And to put that  in a little bit of scale, in a normal year,  

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:16,400
we document fewer than 160 incidents  total. So, this was an unprecedented event. 

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:23,520
Our staff worked around the clock to meticulously  report and document every incident, again, each  

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,160
of these is published on our website and you can  browse the website for these individual reports.  

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,360
But we can also put these incidents into  context by charting the aggregate data.  

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,000
And here you can see that 2020 was a  

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,840
much larger year for aggressions against press  freedom than any of the previous three years. 

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,480
And digging into 2020  specifically, you can see how the  

00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:57,600
press freedom incidents spike in May when  the protests began. And then slowly taper  

00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:03,440
off but don't return to baseline levels as the  protests continue over the course of the year. 

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:15,360
This was a timeline of incidents that I created  for our website. And it actually uses our API  

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:24,240
to provide quite a bit of interactivity. If you  visit the site live, we will provide it later  

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:35,440
on. You can hover over the dots to see what the  incident represents. And call it out by city or  

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,360
who the aggressor was. And I encourage you to  visit the chart and interact with it yourself,  

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:47,680
but I want to show off one particular view of it.  If you ask the drop down to highlight incidents  

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,000
where the assailant was law enforcement, you  can see that the majority of physical attacks  

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,720
on journalists during the protests were  perpetrated by law enforcement officers. 

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:11,200
Here's a map of protests across the country that  was actually put together using our data by a data  

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:22,160
journalist at one of our partner organizations,  the Committee to Protect Journalists. 

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:29,760
And here is a chart that I particularly like. We  took the top ten cities by number of incidents and  

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:36,560
charted them cumulatively over time. And I like  that you can sort of see the narrative of how  

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:43,360
the protests escalated. They sort of started in  Minneapolis in late May and then quickly spread to  

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:49,840
other cities. But I think Portland is particularly  interesting to follow on this chart. Because you  

00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:55,520
can see how a pretty steady stream of aggressions  against journalists covering the protests  

00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:03,840
pretty much immediately followed the deployment  of Homeland Security agents to Portland. 

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:15,120
And finally, this is not specific to the Black  Lives Matter protests, but I did put together  

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:23,200
this heatmap of press freedom incidents over the  four years of Trump's presidency starting on the  

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:30,000
day of his inauguration and ending on the day of  Biden's inauguration. And you can definitely see  

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,160
that the Black Lives Matter protests do show up,  particularly those ones from May of last year.  

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:44,000
Where you have just about a week of -- of a lot  of press freedom activity and sort of continuing  

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:52,080
events over the course of the next several months.  You can also see some dark spots for inauguration  

00:10:52,080 --> 00:11:02,560
day in 2017 as well as election day in 2020 and  January 6th when rioters stormed the Capitol. 

00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,760
All the charts they showed here  are available online. I made them  

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:20,640
using Observable Notebook except for the  one that was made by our partners at CPJ.  

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,320
And if you're a code-oriented  person and you haven't  

00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:29,920
investigated Observable Notebook, I highly  recommend it. It's a very, very cool system.  

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,840
The press freedom tracker is at  pressfreedomtracker.US. If you want to use  

00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:40,960
our data, if you're a journalist with an incident  to report, please get in touch with us. We're  

00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:48,800
super-happy, willing to talk. If you have anything  in our data or want assistance sifting through it,  

00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:55,120
we would be happy to provide that. We want this  information to be widely available, studied and  

00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,400
reported. And we're more than happy to talk  about specific quirks and how it's recorded or  

00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,720
offer advice for analyzing it and just  generally see what people do with it. 

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,720
And finally, feel free to find me personally  on Twitter. My name is Harris Lapiroff,  

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,120
so is my Twitter handle. And now I'm happy  to answer any questions people may have. 

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:22,000
>> Thank you so much, Harris. That was a really  great talk. There were a couple of slides in there  

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,240
that I was going to screenshot. But perhaps I  will just ask you to drop your slides in the  

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,640
Zenodo repository. Harris: I will  

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:38,720
upload to Zenodo and post on Twitter. >> We don't make people do that ahead of time.  

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:47,440
Nobody likes that. I have a question while the  rest of the crowd might be thinking about some  

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:53,360
of their questions. I'm really curious  to hear, you know, what is -- when these  

00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,960
things are happening, obviously, it's  -- there's never a best case scenario.  

00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:02,480
But from your perspective at the Freedom of  the Press Foundation, what are the types of  

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,960
use that you would like to be seeing for this  data to make sure that it has the maximum  

00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:13,680
impact? What are some examples of good uses? Harris: Yeah. I think that's a -- that's a  

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:20,320
great question. I imagine that our editors might  have more of a perspective on that than me. But  

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:26,960
I do think that, you know, we imagine a lot of  the use that we already see it being put to. We  

00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:32,880
want to be basically the resource that you go to  when something is happening with press freedom and  

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:39,440
you want to put it into context. So, you know,  I gave the example of the Andrea Sahouri case  

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:48,160
earlier. Also the example of just seeing how  unprecedented the number of press freedom  

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:54,160
violations at the protests was. You know, it's  something that we really couldn't have put into  

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,440
context without the -- without this data. >> As a person who lives in Portland,  

00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:05,840
that was a -- I mean, that is an accurate  slide. It was really wild here over the summer. 

00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:11,200
Harris: It sounded like it. There were  harrowing reports of people being picked  

00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,600
