Description: 
	In 2017, as the Trump administration was ramping up a war of open hostility against the press, a collaborative of press freedom organizations launch a database and website to track aggressions against journalists. The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker records incidents include arrests, border stops, physical assaults, subpoenas, equipment damage, and more. In addition to detailed articles, all four years (and counting) of the Tracker data is made available through an API that can be used to track trends, aggregate incidents related to specific events, and more. We'll show off examples of how the API is already used to power interactive data visualizations and give an overview of how anyone can access and use the data.
