Title: From tweet to sheet: crowdsourcing a global survey of Open GLAM
Publication date: 2021-05-20
Playlist: CSVConf 2021
Description: 
	Presenters: Dr Andrea Wallace and Douglas McCarthy

Three years ago a simple tweet between friends caught fire, inspiring Douglas and Andrea to start surveying open access in the GLAM (Gallery, Library, Archive, Museum) sector. Since that moment, the tiny acorn of a Google Sheet has matured into a oak tree, growing in scale, complexity and prominence. In this talk, Douglas and Andrea will share the remarkable story of the Open GLAM survey's development and impact. They'll share actionable insight into crowdsourcing and managing data with a global community of researchers, activists, copyright experts and GLAM professionals. Finally, Douglas and Andrea will discuss how they've leveraged the Open GLAM survey into Wikidata and other domains. Twitter: https://twitter.com/CultureDoug + https://twitter.com/AndeeWallace

hi everybody i hope you can see the

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,920
screen clearly and hear me well

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,280
uh thank you katie for that amazing talk

00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,320
just now that's incredible

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,360
um we're really pleased to be here to

00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,680
talk to you

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,600
with you about open access and cultural

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,279
heritage and about how andrea and i in

00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,359
recent years have put together

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,439
a global survey of what we call open

00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,480
glam so without further ado

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,000
let's briefly introduce ourselves andrea

00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,160
over to you

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,399
who are you who am i i ask it every day

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,440
um i'm andrea wallace i'm a senior

00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,000
lecturer in law

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,280
at the university of exeter um a lot of

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,399
my research focuses

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,680
on how cultural heritage institutions

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,399
make their collections available online

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,840
and the intellectual property issues

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,680
around that

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,680
um over to you doug

00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,359
i've been working in cultural heritage

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,120
and museums i've

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,640
focused on copyright and licensing

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,320
almost 20 years now

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,080
and so i'm currently working at

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,000
europeana foundation

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,600
based here speaking to you from the

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,240
netherlands and so

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,000
open access to cultural heritage is real

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,640
passion and interest of mine and it's

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,680
something that

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,680
andrea and i share

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,600
so glam you've seen it in the title but

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,479
in case you're not aware not sure what

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,360
it means

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,040
glam stands for galleries libraries

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,560
archives and museums

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,400
uh it's a useful shorthand and

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,840
it encompasses really the whole world of

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,159
cultural heritage so

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,200
if there are cultural collections museum

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,240
type collections

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,320
that are held in non-strictly glam

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,360
institutions maybe like libraries

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,720
sorry like universities then um those

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,560
can also

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,560
be encompassed can fall into the

00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,840
definition

00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:00,560
so what is open glam um

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,040
we there's actually two parts to this

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,280
question

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,200
open glam is a movement that stands for

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,799
open galleries libraries archives and

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,160
museums and it's looking at digital

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,720
collections and how those are made

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,920
available

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,440
online particularly for reuse by the

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,599
public

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,879
and the second part of that is what does

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,959
open mean

00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,480
because there are often a lot of

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,840
understandings around

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:27,280
open access and open data

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,840
or open glam that don't necessarily

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,840
match on to the international standards

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,280
which require

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,200
materials to be freely accessible usable

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,959
and that can be modified and shared for

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,000
any purpose including commercial

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,840
purposes

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,160
and so that's usually the kicker right

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,360
there it has to be made available for

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,440
commercial reuse

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,200
um and if it's not then it doesn't meet

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,000
the international standards for open

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,160
access

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,680
which means open glam in this instance

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,800
is digital collections that are made

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,800
available online

00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,599
for any purpose whatsoever including

00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,599
commercial reuse

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,640
just over three years ago our mutual

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,879
friend simon tanner

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,680
who's based in london uh put out this

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,400
tweet

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,760
asking for a quick shortlist a few

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,080
examples of why cc0 so that's the

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,879
the legal tool from creative commons for

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,360
full

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,040
liberal open access is great you know

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,560
it's good for museums

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,120
because he wanted to convince the museum

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,799
to go open access so

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,560
simple question and there was a longer

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,680
answer which is has taken over three

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,200
years since

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,360
so in the twitter thread that followed

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,480
andrea and i and a few other kind of

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,120
open glam

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,400
activists and interested people shared a

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,680
few examples

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,920
but we quickly realized that actually

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,560
list of any sort that was even

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,680
reasonably like

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,319
encyclopedic or representative actually

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,480
didn't

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,439
uh didn't exist so we thought well you

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,519
know maybe

00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:03,120
maybe we should make one so

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,280
why did we start what we call the open

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,120
glam survey well

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,799
first of all there was no there was a

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,360
lack of up-to-date information on the

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,280
topic

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,360
i mean there had been a couple of

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,680
surveys i think we've been a

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,440
wikimedia project around open access a

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,720
few years before

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,800
but as with often with projects

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,479
people move on the data gets old really

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,840
really quickly so

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,199
yeah there's nothing up to date there's

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,600
also no shared place they're going to

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,400
see

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,520
and particularly to add relevant data in

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,479
this field

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,400
and i think andrea and i shared a sense

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,160
that there was a perceived

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,240
very anglophone european and north

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,720
american bias in the field that

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,720
open glam was totally dominated by

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,199
national or massive museums

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,240
and so we really want to discover the

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,759
global picture

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,759
of open glam who is the survey for

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,160
well it's for people who want to find

00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,560
and use open content or data

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,360
and of course you know open data in the

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,560
glam space

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,440
is incredibly varied and also

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,520
we wanted something a resource for clans

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,000
who were thinking about open access

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,520
maybe starting it dipping their toe in

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,960
the water or going further with open

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,560
access open data

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,520
and to really understand what their

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:25,840
peers were doing around this topic

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,840
so those are the key motivations

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,639
so um what our survey actually collects

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:36,240
is we kind of start and think about how

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:38,720
glams make this data available

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,520
whether it's digital objects metadata or

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,400
text

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,400
and available for reuse and so we kind

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,759
of start with that idea that um

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,600
obviously there's a lot of objects that

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,600
are held by cultural institutions

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,800
many of those objects have passed into

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,120
the public domain

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,720
which means there's no copyright on them

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,319
there's no copyright restrictions and

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,600
making reproductions and there may be

00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,319
other restrictions that we need to think

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,800
about

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,319
um but of course uh cultural

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,080
institutions have been digitizing those

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,919
and making them available

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,199
so then the question becomes whether or

00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,039
not that reproduction

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,800
that digital copy however we want to

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,120
refer to it um

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,120
is in fact original enough to receive

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,840
its own copyright protection

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,199
so this is where that kind of dynamic of

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,759
power institutions making their

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,800
collections

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:25,360
available online centers so if

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,440
institutions with public domain objects

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,520
digitize those and make those available

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,120
under open standards that's the entry

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,360
point for the survey

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,560
after that we end up looking in to see

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,199
what the right statements are for the

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,240
metadata or any other text around

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,720
some of the content that's been

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,360
available online and we also track the

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,880
specific

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,720
license or label that the materials are

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,319
made available under so kind of going

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,319
back to simon's tweets

00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,000
you know he wanted to know specifically

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,080
what institutions are making things

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,400
available under the cc0

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,440
public domain dedication so even though

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,319
he kept coming up with

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,080
oh no but that institution uses cc by or

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,840
this institution uses the public domain

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,840
mark you know these are the types of

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,120
data points that we find to be useful

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,680
for people who are starting to think

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,120
about

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,120
um doing this either with their own

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,599
collection doing research

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,560
on open glam even users trying to find

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,039
collections

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,840
um located close to them that they can

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,199
reuse

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,199
for any purpose whatsoever

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,280
so how do we go about putting the survey

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,560
together

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:33,759
so the data focus really is

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,720
glance data that focuses on glams data

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,560
made available

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,000
either on their own websites typically

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,960
collections online

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,720
and or a variety of external platforms

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,000
and as andrea said the focus is on

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,400
digital surrogates

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,560
of objects in the public domain where

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,039
any term copyright for the material

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,840
object

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,120
has expired or actually never existed in

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,879
the first place

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,720
and the information from the survey is

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,680
gathered via extensive

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,000
desk research and importantly outreached

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,720
the

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,199
wonderful global gland community so

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,960
thank you

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,520
again to them and that can be via

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:10,400
twitter by email a variety of

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,160
ways that there was a noble open

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,639
community out there who

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,160
put their hand up and let us know when

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,039
we've missed something or something has

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,039
changed so

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,680
an incredibly important part of the

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,680
whole process

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,360
key data points in the survey which at

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,400
its heart is a

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,919
large google sheet we have institution

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,120
name that's always recorded in the

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,440
original language

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,360
the country the institution and the type

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,599
so is that gallery is a library is it a

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,680
university for example

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,880
there are always direct links to the

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,000
open glam

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,760
content and the data including githubs

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,240
and api services

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,920
as andrea mentioned that we specify the

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,240
licenses or the right statements

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,600
for both the digital surrogates and the

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,080
metadata

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,720
and wherever possible we link to the

00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,480
glam's

00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,200
terms of use and their copyright

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,160
policies and finally

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,200
there are wikidata queue ids for every

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,839
institution

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,839
in the survey

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,640
so one of the things that also helps us

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,120
with this

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,800
is going to places that collect this

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,560
information and doing some searches

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,040
within that

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,040
or going straight to data aggregators

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,080
like europeana japan search

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,720
trove and digital new zealand um but we

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,839
also

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:35,040
look at wikimedia commons flickr commons

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,560
cc search sketchfab of course uh

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,399
institutions have been uploading 3d

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,000
collections under open licenses republic

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,600
domain dedications

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,440
um and then hackathons where

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,080
institutions are often

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,360
digitizing or releasing um a small set

00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,880
or a sample of

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,959
data that they've been able to prepare

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,120
for the purpose of a hackathon

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,560
that then becomes part of for example

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,519
the coding davinci

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,120
um kind of initiative where that data

00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,399
set isn't available

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,560
and then of course there's other open

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,680
data portals but the fact that these

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,800
things are maintained

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,360
allow us to sort by the license or the

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,920
label

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,519
and kind of look at the different areas

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,560
where institutions are trying to make

00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,839
things available

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,760
whether that's because there's an

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,560
aggregator you know geographically in

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,560
the area

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,160
or because wikimedia commons provides a

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,399
platform that they can use

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,760
where their own institutional website

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,480
wouldn't be able to support that kind of

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,480
functionality

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,580
the survey has its own and actually more

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,079
than one

00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:38,240
[Music]

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,360
id in wikidata so it's fairly

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,360
extensively

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,040
uh referenced now in wikidata which of

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,760
course and i know this audience knows

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,160
this

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,600
back to front enables a very

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,160
sophisticated

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,360
sparkle queries and other forms of data

00:10:50,160 --> 00:11:00,640
interrogation

00:10:51,360 --> 00:11:03,680
of open glam

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:06,560
and um we started of course with

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,360
about 30 cultural institutions trying to

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,120
think

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,720
oh what's been on our list who have we

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,480
been tracking um

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,760
according to of course that open

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:18,800
standard in march of 2018

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:22,480
and today we now have 1

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:25,680
and 200 cultural institutions but also

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,600
even like government archives or online

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,440
repositories and

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,519
other types of organizations that aren't

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,160
maybe a traditional cultural institution

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,680
universities um but make cultural

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,800
heritage available

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,640
um in you know within the parameters of

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,440
what we're collecting which is like an

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:46,160
incredible amount

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,720
i think we just got very close to 16

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,800
million openly licensed digital objects

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,800
linked to from the survey sheet so i

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,399
guess that's enough to keep most people

00:11:52,800 --> 00:12:00,399
going right

00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:04,480
andrea and so also some of what

00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:08,160
we are doing um is using the wikidata

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,040
um and uh wikimaps to be able to run a

00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,600
query

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,120
so that we can trace the locations of

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,959
each of the institutions that are

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,120
represented on the data sheet

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,639
so you'll see that there are large

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,480
clusters and areas that

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,480
have an aggregator so we have

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,440
representation in

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,399
japan also new zealand um europe with

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:31,600
europeana the united states with dpla

00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:33,920
um and so there's obviously uh

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,360
a benefit to having these aggregators in

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,800
terms of like the representation and

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,399
what it can capture

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,079
um and we know that we're missing things

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,680
too but

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,279
outside of that there are institutions

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,040
doing really creative things in

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,480
india in different countries in south

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,920
america

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,399
where they're starting to dip their toes

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:53,600
in and take smaller approaches to

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,519
specific data sets or initiatives on a

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,680
collections by collections basis

00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,440
and i would say this is across the board

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,760
with what we typically see

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,360
some institutions are adopting an

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,360
all-eligible data approach

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,200
where basically everything that they can

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,360
make available because they have

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,800
either the rights to do that or they

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,760
know that there are no underlying rights

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,240
in the material

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,079
is made available for anyone to use and

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,920
the majority of institutions

00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,760
i would say at least 75 percent of the

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,920
list make things available on a

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,320
collections by collections basis

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,920
which is often because of technology or

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,399
funding or even grant

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,160
obligations that come attached to the

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,000
money that supports the digitization of

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,760
some some of these objects

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,360
so there's a very different and diverse

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,399
approaches being taken

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,399
um all around the world

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,160
and um yes so you can also see of course

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,120
if we zoom in

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,079
that where we have digital trove and

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,839
also

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:54,399
new zealand that the representation is

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,399
there as well

00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:01,120
and in the u.s particularly

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,560
in areas where there are some of the

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,000
larger institutions

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,760
or um really kind of metropolitan areas

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,360
that release information either

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,760
according to their website or

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,000
also through dpla which is digital

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,600
public libraries of america

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,680
and then of course in europe with

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,680
europeana being a

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,160
a data aggregator and doug working there

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:26,240
we always have the latest information

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,240
um from new additions to europeana

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,760
so of course there are many

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,399
possibilities of

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,160
querying filtering interrogating the

00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,480
data that i mentioned

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,160
out of the google sheet itself the open

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,560
glam survey

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,600
you can of course really easily output

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,560
things like this

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,839
pie charts showing country distribution

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,920
so the number of

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,399
open gland institutions per country of

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,839
course it's a global survey

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,920
with their raw numbers and all the

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,240
percentages

00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,959
you can slice and dice the data by

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,000
institution

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:03,760
type which i mentioned earlier so

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,959
here you can see that there's a round

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,360
where just over a third of the

00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:10,160
institutions are museums

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,160
libraries are also significant

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,160
institution type in the survey

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,760
so it's really easy and i very much

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,079
encourage you all

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,199
when you get to the survey to output and

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:22,959
play around with it and

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:24,639
dig into the data and see what you find

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:27,199
and from a copyrighted licensing

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,199
perspective

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:33,120
you can interrogate the data to look at

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,839
say how many institutions are using the

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,800
public domain

00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,519
mark versus cc0 or the no known

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,199
copyright

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:44,320
flavors a right statement versus cc by

00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:45,759
so yeah from a licensing practitioner

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:50,880
copyright research perspective

00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:50,880
i think it's useful andrea

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,440
so um what we've also been learning from

00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,440
this

00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,480
is um some really interesting things

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,959
about the sector

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,160
which we all know but it's allowed us to

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:05,360
kind of reduce

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:08,000
into things that are quantifiable um

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,600
and in a way that we can demonstrate

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,600
some of the socioeconomic

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,519
technical and human infrastructures that

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,440
are required and very expensive to

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,839
support digitization

00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,199
even access how people are accessing and

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,079
the quality of data that's made

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,160
available

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,920
of course the metrics themselves are

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,600
designed by

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,120
areas of the world who see this as a

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,920
priority and

00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,120
um those metrics then control how we are

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,759
able to kind of

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,399
capture different examples and represent

00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,720
them

00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,560
uh within the spreadsheet itself again

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,079
the aggregator distortion effect because

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,800
these are large data sets that come

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,720
forward

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,519
um even with wikimedia commons being

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,480
able to find examples that exist

00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,720
um that then allow us to enter that data

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,680
into the spreadsheet

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,000
and then of course copyright and culture

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,880
and

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,240
the culture of copyright which what that

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,680
kind of

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:03,440
relates to is thinking about areas where

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,240
maybe copyright is actually kind of

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,959
important

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,839
to retain because it restricts access

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,760
and reuse

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:13,679
around materials that necessarily

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,600
aren't appropriate but at the same time

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,360
copyright is not always the best way to

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,000
restrict access to these materials and

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,720
we need to be

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,199
thinking about other ways where we don't

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,959
use copyright is such a blunt tool

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,400
um to kind of tell users what they can

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,160
and can't do with it

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,160
so this culture of copyright is

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,880
something that you know often people say

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,240
oh well let's

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,600
let's just claim copyright in it and

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,720
then people won't be able you know to do

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,400
these things with it but it's not

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,720
necessarily the best answer because

00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,840
copyright has an expiration date

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,520
um and then of course there's a very

00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,880
high barrier to entry

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:49,280
for open access around this an open glam

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,720
because it requires having someone

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,200
within the institution

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,760
or access to someone with the legal

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,240
knowledge

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:59,120
around copyright which is highly

00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,440
specific according to every country

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,960
even changes depending on you know the

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,280
subject matter whether

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,039
you know it can't be film material

00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,120
versus a painting

00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,240
and so having an awareness of all of

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,919
these things to be

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,520
able to even do the copyright clearance

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,919
in order to digitize

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,039
is a huge barrier to entry for cultural

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,039
institutions

00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,080
um because most most people often don't

00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:23,679
have that knowledge

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,559
in-house do you just can i just jump in

00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:28,160
to say you've got

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:30,640
two minutes left thanks joe

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,240
so close to wrapping up uh just some

00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,559
notes on a crowd-sourced approach

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,039
if you are taking this approach yourself

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:39,760
or thinking about it uh here are some of

00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:41,600
andrea anna's reflections um the

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,919
advantage of course that it's agile and

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,120
very

00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,120
low tech you know we just made a

00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,080
spreadsheet we started filling it and

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,919
making it bigger

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,880
we didn't need an it department any kind

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,559
of permissions culture

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,240
it allows you to make incremental

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,559
updates the survey is updated

00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,320
most weeks so you know most people can

00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:01,360
get around a spreadsheet

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:04,640
so it's yeah a reasonably accessible

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,160
way to store and manage data the survey

00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,039
has been community powered as i

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,960
mentioned

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:11,039
and it also avoids this thing of survey

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,280
fatigue like who really needs to be

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:15,280
to get another survey you know the

00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:19,280
response rate is usually super low

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:21,200
so um we can dodge that bullet i hope

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,840
and also this is independent and

00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,320
inclusive it's not owned by an

00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,480
institution

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,520
andrea and i are hopefully can recently

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,160
trusted

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,880
positive actors in this space and it's

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,240
very much a

00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,919
community driven initiative rather than

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,480
being owned by anybody

00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,679
and it's easy to ask for expert help so

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,520
um i've definitely

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,360
got a little bit better at wikidata from

00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,160
almost zero knowledge over the last

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,440
three years

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,200
there are lots of people out there who

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,400
will help you out with

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:53,280
any queries and help that you might need

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,880
the challenges of course is that this

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,799
approach relies on the discoverability

00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,320
of open data we know for example that

00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,799
search engines

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,760
generally don't do a great job of

00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,760
surfacing

00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,760
open access cultural heritage and it

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,840
does require commitment from

00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,039
the lead actors and andrea and i in this

00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,320
case mostly

00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:14,159
to keep it going and to keep it active

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,360
so to read more about the survey i've

00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,240
written a few articles

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,600
on medium here's a link to open glam

00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,559
survey if you want to dig in a bit

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,400
deeper

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:27,440
and we would like to thank you very very

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:27,440
