Publication date: 2021-05-20
Playlist: CSVConf 2021
Description: 
	Presenters: Dr Andrea Wallace and Douglas McCarthy

Three years ago a simple tweet between friends caught fire, inspiring Douglas and Andrea to start surveying open access in the GLAM (Gallery, Library, Archive, Museum) sector. Since that moment, the tiny acorn of a Google Sheet has matured into a oak tree, growing in scale, complexity and prominence. In this talk, Douglas and Andrea will share the remarkable story of the Open GLAM survey's development and impact. They'll share actionable insight into crowdsourcing and managing data with a global community of researchers, activists, copyright experts and GLAM professionals. Finally, Douglas and Andrea will discuss how they've leveraged the Open GLAM survey into Wikidata and other domains. Twitter: https://twitter.com/CultureDoug + https://twitter.com/AndeeWallace
