Title: Using wearables to detect infections: A co-created & community-led pandemic response
Publication date: 2021-05-19
Playlist: CSVConf 2021
Description: 
	Presenter:  Bastian Greshake Tzovaras 

In March 2020 – during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic – a big question popped up in the heads of the data nerds of the Open Humans & Quantified Self community: We are wearing all these sophisticated wearable devices that measure our heart rate, respiratory rate and even sometimes even body temperature - can these things be used to find out when we’re falling sick even before we consciously notice having symptoms? Starting from this initial question a community quickly formed to iteratively and collaboratively create “Quantified Flu” – an open source online-tool to facilitate individual learning and insights at the intersection of early physiological warning signs and self-observed symptoms. The final prototype enables people to report over 15 different symptoms through daily reporting while monitoring physiological signals from a large variety of the most common wearable devices. We’ll not only showcase the final prototype, but also investigate how the open and iterative development process unfolded and how this helped to create a tool that fits the needs of the self-tracking community. We furthermore see how this fit of digital affordances & needs enabled a level of user engagement that’s highly untypical for the “mobile health” space.

Hey, everyone. Glad to be here at csv,conf  again. I want to talk today about how  

00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,280
during the first year of the pandemic  we implemented a way for people to  

00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,320
use their wearables to detect potentially  if they have an infection and more  

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,920
importantly how we build something together to  make this happen. I'm the director of research  

00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,040
for the Open Humans Foundation, which has  people using and gathering their own data. 

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:41,760
Let's start with the things wearables can do.  There's a lot of them, and they have increasingly  

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,840
been more clever in what they can actually track.  Of course, they can track your rest and heart  

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,440
rate. Many do your body temperature as well,  your respiratory rate, sleep duration and  

00:00:51,440 --> 00:01:00,320
quality. A lot of them measure your oxygen  saturation as well. That's already a lot of  

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:09,520
physiology data you can track about yourselves. Last year, they were using this for monitoring  

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:18,560
infections. This was a paper I presented at  a conference, I think, in 2019. It was during  

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:28,960
influenza outbreaks. That was based on data from  2017 and 2018 with around 3,000 participants. The  

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:35,040
metrics tracked through wearables  were things like sleep, sleep quality.  

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:43,440
For some of those variables, it is shown here what  people started to behave and behave differently  

00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:53,840
days before onset of symptoms. The limitation  here is all of this is done on a population‑wide  

00:01:53,840 --> 00:02:00,640
surveillance level and not for individual use. On  average, you might see a difference. You can see  

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,171
when the numbers rise up, but it's not for making  individual predictions. Of course, population‑wide  

00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:14,240
monitoring is pretty cool and interesting. Last year hit. Particularly in March 2020 where  

00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,080
all of a sudden everyone in the world was  experiencing similar things but for COVID.  

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:29,360
UCSF collaborated with people who had wearable  devices. The Scripps Research started their own  

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:45,280
health care data collection and the Stanford  health care innovation lab, and the Robert Koch  

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,960
Institute. It was about getting population‑level  data to reflect population‑wide monitoring. 

00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:00,000
There were some issues there as well. If you  have academic research combined with wearables,  

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:12,640
then you can easily end up having some small  cohort. One study said we have 90% accuracy  

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:20,640
and can anticipate symptoms up to three days  in advance. It disappeared from the university  

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:28,240
website, so maybe, oops, not really. There's  no feedback for the participants. There's  

00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:35,280
no data sharing so no one can reuse it.  There's no support of individuals learning  

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,760
and making sense of their own data, which  is what we're particularly interested in. 

00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:47,120
How can we use wearables for personal science to  do this together? First, what's personal science?  

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,240
Personal science is people using empirical  methods to answer personal questions.  

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,960
If I'm diabetic, is this fiber really  indigestible or will it raise my blood sugar?  

00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:16,240
Does my transitional hormone therapy work? We started a project called the Keating  

00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:23,520
Memorial to support people doing personal science  collectively together. This was in honor of Steven  

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:36,960
Keating, who passed away a year earlier because of  a brain tumor in 2019. He was a donation advocate.  

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:47,440
He collected a ton of data about himself.  He believed the data could be useful and  

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,320
should be shared, if possible. He reminded  us collecting this data doesn't need to be  

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,800
selfish but it can be used for a greater good if  we share data with others and use it collectively.  

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,920
We started doing this memorial, which  included doing weekly calls where people  

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,320
tried to answer their own personal  questions. The three examples I gave  

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:12,640
on the last slide were projects people worked  on, but then the pandemic hit and people lost  

00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:19,360
all time and motivation to work on these topics  and had one larger global question. We all have  

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:31,920
these wearables. Can we see when we're having  an infection? Then we can use it going forward. 

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,720
Collectively, we started brainstorming during the  calls and continued in select conversations to see  

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:45,280
how we could do this. The first prototype we  made for Quantified Flu, we made one for doing  

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:53,680
retrospective investigations of physiological  signals. We already had support for two variables.  

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:06,560
We could very easily make a retrospective  analysis. People could punch in their data and  

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:16,080
get a nice graph, like on the right side. You can  see the line of where you actually noticed falling  

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:22,640
sick. This is an example of my own data because I  remember falling sick on New Year's Eve of 2018.  

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:29,040
You can see my stats going up just a few days  before I actually came down with something.  

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,440
We made a couple of those and started  doing a very small‑scale data analysis.  

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,840
We collectively wanted to see if we can also  see the same signal overall. It turns out for  

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,840
the temperature and the heart rate there seems  to be some kind of signal, which is really nice.  

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,200
Of course, that's not super ideal because first of  all you need to remember when you felt sick in the  

00:06:53,200 --> 00:07:01,520
past. It's really hard. You can go back to your  calendar or your chat messages and try to find  

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,240
out when you told someone you were falling sick,  but that is not really easy to do. Of course,  

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,560
you might want to track more specific symptoms  instead of just knowing did I fall sick on a given  

00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,840
day. Continuous monitoring in general  would just be much more useful. 

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,720
Our community decided to learn from the  best and steal. We went to the academic  

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,320
efforts that were launched at the same time  and were like, what kind of symptoms are these  

00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:32,240
studies trying to track? We started remixing  their symptom reports to unify them into one  

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:39,680
that seemed most useful to our participants  instead of having binary symptom reports.  

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:46,160
We settled for these symptoms on a five‑scale  reporting. People would get a daily email check  

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:57,760
saying, are you feeling sick today? Yes or no?  If you are feeling sick, you get this form. You  

00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:04,080
collect this data. It's easy to collect, but how  do you make sense of it and how do you collect it? 

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,600
We came up with this graph, which converts the  data you provide both in terms of symptom tracking  

00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,000
and physiological data into one graph. In the  heat map top, you can see the symptoms you had.  

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:30,800
In the middle in green, you have comments. Below,  you can see your heart rate, body temperature,  

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,560
respiratory rate, your variables  that you can actually use for this.  

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:44,640
That's really nice. In fact, you can see it easily  and see when you're having an elevated heart rate.  

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,600
The different gray backgrounds show the first  and second standard deviation of the normal  

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,432
median value of your heart rate. You can see if  you have an elevated heart rate compared to what  

00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:05,440
you normally have versus a national average.  There's a lot of value in you collecting data  

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,160
about yourself, which academic studies would  never actually collect. The comment here is ‑‑  

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,880
the person reports, oh, my cough is not related.  I report having cough symptoms, but it's not  

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:28,240
related. I've been smoking more because I'm out of  work. They lost their job because of the pandemic.  

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:36,560
The cough is from smoking at home because they're  not going to work any longer. This data gets  

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:43,280
collected by people. They can use it to make sense  of themselves, and people can share the data.  

00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:48,160
People can opt‑in and say they want to make this  data available for all members of the community  

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:58,720
and anyone. You can go to Quantified Flu's  website. You can download CSVs of all the data.  

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,920
That's the technical implementation  on the very rough level. 

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,840
But I think what's really important to us is this  was not done by me or any of the other individuals  

00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,840
who might somehow do this professionally  but by the community for the community.  

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,560
All this development was done by the  community members of Open Humans and  

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:32,240
just random people who said I want to help. This  included the initial ideation and protocol design,  

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:38,960
iterating the protocol over time, implementing  the tool, like new wearable support,  

00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:45,440
and testing the implementation, of course.  What we did is just coded every single message  

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,800
into different categories, whether about  prototyping, coming up with general ideas,  

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:57,280
or even the implementation of the prototypes. We  can see there's a very nice iterative development  

00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:02,800
going on. After an initial release very early on,  there's a lot of renewed interest in discussing  

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,560
the protocol and prototyping now, which leads  to a new version of the prototype and so on.  

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,280
That's really nice. Many of the things I showed  you were not completely done by any individual  

00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:22,480
person but collectively. Which symptoms tracked  were done collectively. The individualization was  

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:28,960
brainstormed collectively. One master's student  actually implemented it. We met a completely  

00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:36,960
random mobile developer who made an iOS app. We  had no known developer in the community. Someone  

00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,840
found us and was like, oh, yeah, I'm willing  to donate a bunch of time to let you do it. 

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:49,680
Besides this being really cool, what's the benefit  of doing co‑creation? Co‑creation really improves  

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:55,680
the user fit. If you think about how mobile health  applications typically work and how much they're  

00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:02,800
being used, one can see in the academic literature  it's really limited and sustained use. Less than  

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:09,200
2% of users ever return after using your app  once and never provide data from the output.  

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,680
We have over 50% of our users that have  collected data for more than three months.  

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,840
To this day, data is still being collected by  our community and people that are contributing.  

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:31,360
There's a big, big benefit in doing it like this.  Of course, if you are an academic, this iterative  

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,960
design is really problematic from an ethical  oversight point of view because typically, if you  

00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:43,040
want to get institutional review board approval  for your study, then you need to completely tell  

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,720
them what the protocol is. There's no way of  iterating rapidly and doing things differently.  

00:12:53,200 --> 00:13:00,000
If you need to get approval for every single  point along the way, we still wouldn't have  

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:17,360
the first prototype. It's fine if you're doing  it outside of academia. I think we need to find  

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:24,960
new ways for actually doing things together. To sum up what we learned to give a bit of  

00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:30,960
time back, first of all, Quantified Flu is not  about epidemiology, but it's about generating  

00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:37,440
personal insights and learning. If you want  to do it, you can go to quantifiedflu.com.  

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:51,920
You can see if there's any correlation.  Importantly, we see this co‑creation approach  

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:57,360
and this community involvement is a really  high fit to the user needs, which leads to a  

00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:03,360
great continued user engagement. You can opt‑in  to making the data publicly available. There's  

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,320
50 datasets publicly available, which  you can play around with if you want. 

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:19,360
I speak so much of the community. We had a lot  of people involved. Besides me, these people  

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,640
were involved in the initial brainstorming  and thinking about the project and really  

00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:29,260
helped us a lot in getting all the Slack  messages coded to understand how we co‑created.  

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:47,760
Basile was instrumental in making the  heat map. Karolina used Garmin to help us.  

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,640
Of course, there's over 200 users who have  virtually tried it out. Please give it a try. 

00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:04,560
Before I wrap it up, I just want to take 30  seconds to pitch some similar idea where we  

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:13,520
could need your support. A student in our lab is  launching a transgender project called the trans  

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:31,840
biome. Of course, Cis‑women's flora is well‑known.  There's less than a handful of studies for the  

00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:39,840
microbial flora of the vagina, which is  problematic because they can't get proper care.  

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:54,880
This is in support of the trans community  in France in particular to understand what's  

00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,560
the baseline picture. Even that's unknown  right now. If you can help us out with just  

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:08,160
a few dollars to push us over the goal, that would  be much appreciated. Thanks so much. Happy to take  

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,800
any questions. >>  

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:23,920
Thank you so much for the presentation. I  think we have a few moments for a question  

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:32,400
or two if there's any in the chat. If there's not,  I would invite ‑‑ looks like we have a question.  

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,560
Can we differentiate between co‑creating  

00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:50,160
and pandemic conditions? >> BASTIAN: With regard to the participation  

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:56,000
rates, it's hard to say right now, but we  do know there are all the academic studies,  

00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,360
which are going on right now, which don't have  the benefit of being co‑created because they were  

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:08,800
done completely in an academic framework when the  academic researchers set up the design. Once the  

00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:14,640
data is out and the papers are out, we can see how  many participants they enrolled initially and if  

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,320
they got enough data in comparison. They're  both pandemic related, so hopefully we can  

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:26,640
make a comparison of that in the future. >> And unfortunately, that's all the  

00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:34,000
time we have for questions, but I invite everyone  to continue the conversation in the Slack channel,  

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,320
