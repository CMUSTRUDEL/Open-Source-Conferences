Title: Anne Lee Steele - Data visualization & crowdsourced research: experiments in collective storytelling
Publication date: 2021-05-20
Playlist: CSVConf 2021
Description: 
	These days, everyone seems to trying to harness the power of the crowd. Amnesty International’s “Decoders” brings together “digital volunteers to tackle human rights abuses around the world”. Bellingcat crowdsources information for their online investigations, and has transformed their newsroom into an open source project. Amazon’s Mechanical Turk has long altered how research is conducted through their crowdsourcing marketplace. These tools have paved the way for new kinds of journalism and research, where theoretically anyone can contribute to projects from anywhere around the world. However, while crowdsourcing has grown as a source of data, visual storytelling has usually been left out in the process. Online tools like Datawrapper and Tableau have made data visualization easier than ever, but because storytelling with data is computationally expensive – and usually custom-made for the story – the crowdsourcing process has usually been completed before it is turned into a visual design. They don’t usually walk in lockstep with each other. This talk will attempt to bridge this gap, if only just a little. It reviews a project called supply-chains.us, which is building a sustainable open-source database that anyone can contribute to, with an integrated visualization that updates over time. This talk will describe how the project was built, why visual storytelling is important for research, and how open-source projects can be an opportunity for collective storytelling.

cool thank you so much and thank you so

00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,359
much to catherine for that really

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,639
inspiring talk

00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:14,000
um that got me in to the spirit of

00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:17,119
um all things open so um hi everyone i'm

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,320
anne i'm an anthropologist and

00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,039
i i guess a person that has a crush on

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,400
dataviz

00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:27,519
uh and visual storytelling

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,160
i'm also an ex-fellow of the open

00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,480
knowledge

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,399
of fictional theatre um i hope you all

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,239
too

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,840
did yesterday to my fellow fellows

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,680
talking to christian's tools

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,200
um but today i'll actually be talking

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,000
about something a little bit different

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,360
um my co-conspirator miriam matheson and

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,800
i have been working on a project

00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,879
on supply chains for the past couple of

00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,280
months um and today we kind of wanted to

00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,559
talk

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,120
more about the methodology of the

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,879
project and and what it means to kind of

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,160
especially as a researcher to kind of

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,879
try and make something

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,760
more engaging in the process of doing

00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,960
research

00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,800
i'll tell you more about what i mean in

00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,359
a second

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,720
so um over the past couple of months uh

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,040
and really over the past number of

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,240
years um both of us in different ways

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,479
have been focused

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,240
on supply chains and just to have like a

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,159
sense of shared definitions

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,759
supply chains while i put a definition

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,720
here from the ilo

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,439
it's really thought of as kind of

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,759
everything

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,640
something goes through from its raw

00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,640
material

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,759
all the way to its um its final product

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,520
want to push back against that

00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,520
definition a little bit but essentially

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,280
a supply chain is kind of everything

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,799
uh in that process all the industries

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,840
all the people everything

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,360
involved in that you might be more

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,040
familiar of course with these sorts of

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,799
charts right that try and

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,399
kind of take this process that's so

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,520
global that encompasses so many

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,360
different things

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,000
and puts them in much more of a visual

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,240
format makes it a lot easier to digest

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,240
right

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:59,840
but of course if there's anything that

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,200
uh the past year has shown us it's that

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,439
all of these supply chains

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,320
are incredibly vulnerable well we've

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,759
seen so many maps of course about how

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,759
international trade has been totally

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,280
disrupted about how all the supply

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,760
chains for everything that we

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,640
use have been changed because of the

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,120
pandemic

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,840
but then at the same time while we have

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,959
these kind of

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:24,160
big picture ideas of what um

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:27,200
what kopit 19 has done to uh

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:30,959
supply chains as we know them and

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,040
also these photos of very specific um

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,080
instances or specific effects of that

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,959
disruption

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,319
uh i especially really um was honestly

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,560
shocked by these

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,360
huge piles of potatoes that were found

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,920
in

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,800
in for example in idaho here uh when

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,760
there was no

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,599
uh no one to buy their potatoes and so

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,000
it's kind of in many ways it felt like

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,440
we were

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,599
almost going back and forth between

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,040
these very very global uh understandings

00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,599
of what a supply chain is and also

00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,640
these very specific instances of what

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,360
that disruption

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,720
looks like in real time and of course

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,920
alongside all of this

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,319
where a lot of different things

00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,120
happening at the same time uh everything

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,000
from

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,480
uh you know protests and labor movements

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,400
um

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,760
popping up worldwide as these supply

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,879
chains were being disrupted especially

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,519
across the garment

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,640
and delivery industries um but also you

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,959
know unofficial more

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,159
forms of media popping up like farmers

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,920
joining tick tock

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,760
um clearly i'm really into the potato

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,920
photos uh

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,200
and just grabbed a couple of these from

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,280
from twitter and from

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,239
here um they're really kind of again

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,000
rounded these

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,360
global things and very specific

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,200
instances of just

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,959
human experiences and similarly our

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,760
interests kind of collectively

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,400
um really rose throughout the same

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,239
period

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,680
so this is just a screenshot from

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,519
google's uh

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,280
news database and showed that there was

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,319
a really big spike right on this time

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,480
march through may 2020 but that kind of

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,680
ever since then there's overall a larger

00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,439
interest but it goes through these

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,720
oscillations um just like everything

00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:04,080
else especially with

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,480
the news cycle so really

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,080
as uh miriam and i started talking more

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,080
and more uh during this

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,439
time period around this time last last

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,120
year when all these stories were coming

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,280
up we were really thinking okay well

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,199
you know supply chains you know they

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,759
really only become visible to the public

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,120
when they don't work uh as researchers

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,639
you know we've kind of been

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,880
looking at these processes for a long

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,759
time but in a way they they've always

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,560
been vulnerable

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,880
and just enough and just on time is the

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,360
uh

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,240
management mentality behind supply

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,000
chains and

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,759
of course something like this was this

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,560
type of disruption on the global scale

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,960
was perhaps

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,919
bound to happen at some point and of

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,160
course um

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,680
as the kind of last graph showed popular

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,400
popular coverage is very

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,080
cyclical and because of this and the gap

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,400
that we were seeing and kind of what was

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,360
reported on what was put um kind of in

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,720
the news cycle

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,919
was in many ways very different from

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,919
what we were seeing unofficially on

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,199
twitter on social media

00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,880
ask a lot of questions about you know

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,320
who's covered what to say and we were

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,080
wondering if there was any way to bridge

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,639
this gap

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,520
of course researchers always love the

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,479
csvs

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,960
love putting everything into

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:12,240
spreadsheets but these are perhaps

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,240
not as impactful as photographs like

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,560
this

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,560
again just so many potatoes

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,520
so really um when we started talking

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,039
about you know possibility of doing

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,600
something together related to supply

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,039
chains

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,479
we were asking ourselves you know as

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,320
researchers how can we create this

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:33,680
repository of information

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,400
um that is more than just you know a

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,560
collection

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,000
but is also visually engaging that grabs

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,680
people that you know

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,280
impacts you in an emotional way like

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,600
photography like database

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,639
or digital art but is also something

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,960
that we can build

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,320
upon over time that is a sustainable

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,759
resource um

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,360
and is something that you know can be

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,759
something that we can uh

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,360
learn from as we grow over time and give

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,240
us an excuse to learn from

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,199
many others and so the first step kind

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,840
of in this process

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,919
in a lot of ways was us very much kind

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,520
of experimenting with what it meant to

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,680
talk about supply chains to crowdsource

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,319
a bit um we joined this website called

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,479
arena

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,240
and actually funnily enough arena is

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,039
kind of like a social network for more

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,319
visual

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,360
visual work and for link sharing very

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,479
organically

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:23,360
people started to almost like a chain uh

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,000
adding their own research or their own

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,800
stories

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,840
uh to collections of links and resources

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,680
that we were

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,600
um that we were gathering together and

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,080
in many ways kind of got us thinking

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,400
okay

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,160
so you know we hear so much about the

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,280
crowd we hear so much about the

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,880
potential for crowdsourcing um it sounds

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,360
like there's actually other people that

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,199
are interested in this sort of

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,440
research driven but also visual at the

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,759
same time

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,720
second step uh was writing an essay

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,000
together

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,520
about an essay ten sentences that in

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,840
many ways tried to summarize

00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,520
uh years of research uh about supply

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,360
chains in a way that we thought

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,000
might engage humans and not other

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,880
academics and that eventually became the

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,880
open page

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,080
of supply chain staff us i know i

00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,720
haven't talked a bit about the website

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,840
but i

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,840
swear that it's coming

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,520
third step after we kind of tried to

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,280
you know ground ourselves in the

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,360
research that we were doing um we

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,440
thought okay how can we take this out

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,400
in a more active way to to people how

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,000
can we talk

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,000
about something that's so global again

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,639
so big and ground it

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,199
in you know specific instances or

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,120
honestly

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,120
see how people are thinking about it as

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,240
well because perhaps we were too

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:41,280
too deep um too quickly so

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,440
this is a screenshot from the first

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,639
workshop that we ran out mozilla fest

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,400
this past spring back in march um

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,639
really fun really interesting experience

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,840
to just kind of gauge

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,199
how everyone is thinking about these

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,160
different processes we really didn't

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,319
know and

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,599
who to expect of who we were going to

00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,440
chat with and then

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,039
ended up being a bunch of different

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,919
people across a bunch of different

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,560
industries

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,639
that very organically you know when they

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,520
themselves were trying to understand and

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,960
ground

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,560
you know the headlines that they were

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,800
seeing in supply chains and something

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,120
more concrete um

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,720
very much started connecting between all

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,360
their different brainstorms with each

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,759
other

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,479
and this web emerged kind of organically

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,319
over time

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,680
and we kept thinking you know this is

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,240
something that we want to continue

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,280
and so pretty organically from that uh

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,800
we started this

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,320
supply chains reading group where a

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,320
couple of us get together every

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,080
two weeks to talk about either a case

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,039
study or a

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,320
um or a kind of larger theoretical

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,320
reading in a way of

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,599
that help us to understand these sorts

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,600
of complex phenomena

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,720
and for us kind of every step through

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,120
this process

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,839
was very much us trying to you know

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,360
ground

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,600
these processes and something very

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,000
specific but also it felt like together

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,279
we were

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,200
creating a sort of um collectively

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:02,160
creating a kind of story around

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,720
our language um that could help us to

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,440
tell

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,240
a story around supply chains or perhaps

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,560
many other stories

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,160
finally uh we're in this process very

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,120
much in this process right now

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,240
uh but we started kind of transmitting

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,720
all these things that we were

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,240
collecting um from either people's

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,720
individually or all these different

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,080
groups

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,640
into just many many spreadsheets and

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,959
are um very much trying to create like a

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,959
shared language or a way through which

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,240
um again as researchers we could turn

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,360
them into something interesting for

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,959
people

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,040
so i've been a learning experience would

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,920
be team if anyone has any experience

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,760
with this sort of

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,000
translation if you have any tips for us

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:45,279
get in touch

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,360
and then finally um we're right now

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,640
working on kind of these two main focus

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,480
so raw materials is

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,720
and extraction economies is kind of what

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,279
we focus on um while miriam's much more

00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,080
in the transport and shipping arenas

00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,519
um we're right now in the process of

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,760
very organically trying to turn them

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,839
into visual material and for us

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,440
uh in many ways for us kind of

00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,800
redefining what database

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:11,279
is into visualizing information

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,360
in a way that humans will like uh kind

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,640
of change the game for us especially as

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,640
researchers that want to get past

00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:20,160
papers just to grind again in something

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,839
real

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:26,880
uh we these are a couple screenshots um

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,079
from our database that's growing slowly

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,720
over time

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,680
um and we just actually released all of

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,240
these

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,800
sheets open to the public and so if you

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,240
have

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,240
anything that you'd like to input if you

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,519
have any comments please please feel

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,720
free to do so

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,720
very much following in the spirit of

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,360
what katherine is saying i think open

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,079
the openness of the project is really so

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,480
important

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,760
for us um because we've one learned so

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,279
much from all these different public

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,399
events that we've been a part of

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,240
and different people and different

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,440
groups that we've interacted with but at

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,120
the same time

00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,760
um it's definitely something that we

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,760
keep on doing otherwise

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,760
so again i'm going to say this a million

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,680
times late but

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,480
really i think in these sorts of

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,399
projects we want to try and

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,560
go back and forth between these very

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,839
global like big data ideas

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:19,120
trade analytics for example to specific

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,240
individual stories this obviously is a

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,120
mock-up because

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,920
coconuts are not mined and antarctica

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,079
but i think it's

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,839
in many ways it's trying to give you an

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,279
example of what we mean by this where we

00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,120
want to be able to put

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,560
all these different types of material

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,040
about supply chains

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,240
in one place so that can be something

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,240
that you can explore

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,200
that you can discover that you can kind

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,640
of look at over time it also grows over

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,480
time

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,880
and we simply just want to be stewards

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,880
of that

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,040
so just to put it in a different way uh

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,279
mixing the visual

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,240
with the numerical hopefully put

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,160
together will

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,519
create a format for us to you know

00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,040
create more of an inclusive

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:02,160
decentralized way of sharing

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:05,360
stories from and about the supply chain

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,360
um for such a

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,639
like a complex set of industries they're

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,480
also very um

00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:14,160
decentralized and global themselves

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,600
these are a couple of phases we're now

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,480
kind of somewhere between phase one and

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,160
phase two

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,600
uh if you want to join the reading group

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,920
please get in touch we'd love to have

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,519
you

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,480
uh if you have any interest in getting

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,720
involved in either digital art

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,760
do research on supply chains get

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,760
involved in any way

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,680
give us some guidance on the tech side

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,920
please please reach out

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,440
but the goal is eventually to kind of

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,639
you know we began with the technology

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,160
industry

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,720
but really to expand into other

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,120
industries um i showed you all lots of

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,760
photos of potatoes earlier for example

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,000
um

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,279
food is something that's uh something

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,839
we're really interested in

00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,800
expanding to as well but we kind of want

00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,880
to stay away from

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,519
from two things two problems that we see

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,880
with this sort of project

00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:01,040
one is a kind of information glut uh

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,399
neil postman who's a media theorist from

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,320
the late 20th century put this really

00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,560
well when he said

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,079
pre-internet pre-printing press in many

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,160
ways uh we

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,839
suffered collectively from a kind of

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,680
information scarcity

00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,720
but today we have another problem which

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,320
is the opposite which is that we're

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,320
surrounded by too much information

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,360
we're flooded with it therefore we don't

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,800
necessarily know

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,160
what to do with it and so

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,079
especially with something like supply

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,279
chains or even thinking about you know

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,959
the number of headlines we were

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:32,240
surrounded by last year

00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,279
um we wanted to make sure that you know

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,200
the experience

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,880
on supply chains not us would be

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,720
something that's a little bit more

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,480
serendipitous but also not

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,639
overwhelming um it's something that

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,519
people could return back to

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,800
but at the same time doesn't simply turn

00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,320
into a spectacle

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,519
i guess this is again like maybe

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,639
something that comes from the researcher

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,480
instinct but

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,160
i think bell hooks put this really

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,040
wonderfully when she talked about

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,680
the analogy of the classroom where you

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,000
know

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,880
even the most engaged classroom the most

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,800
engaged

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,760
syllabi could be ruined by too large of

00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,560
a size

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,680
and so while we want to you know grow

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,240
and expand

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,680
ultimately the idea is that the quality

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,360
of information the quality of the

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,800
stories the

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,800
types of things that we want to collect

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,160
and sort of into this space we want to

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,920
be really intentional about

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,600
because otherwise it might just become

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,800
another place of entertainment

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,399
and if another person's stories or

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,160
an entire industry stories becomes

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,680
nothing but a spectacle

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,600
does it really help us to care about all

00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,920
of the people or the processes that are

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,120
made

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:39,120
invisible because of it

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,199
yeah so with that in mind this is kind

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,399
of what we were looking to do

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,519
moving forward and ultimately just with

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,600
the goal of

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,600
you know combining visual storytelling

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,440
with crowd source research but making

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,720
sure that it's something that we can

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,120
build on over time

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,760
and making sure that you know ultimately

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,720
the goal

00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,760
is to not only educate but to help

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,360
people

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,040
you know understand these processes a

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,600
little bit more while we ourselves are

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:08,560
learning more about them

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,199
i guess that's all from me if you want

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,240
to reach out

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:14,320
uh feel free to send us an email at our

00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,720
collective email with miriam and i

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,440
um or reach out to me individually over

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,440
email

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,880
i would love to get any questions any

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,680
comments um

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,800
critiques anything at all really miriam

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,639
is also in the chat

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,920
so she'll be able to answer some things

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,920
as well maybe we can

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,320
get her turned in but thanks so much

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,320
everyone

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,079
and thank you so much for that was a

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,800
really really great and interesting talk

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,399
and we have

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,600
four minutes left so i'm just going to

00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,079
roll straight into asking you some

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,680
questions

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,240
if that's okay and the first question is

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,560
has it been

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,279
easy or hard to find data about this

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,399
because

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:52,160
i imagine that some of it's hidden or

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,839
not openly available for commercial

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,839
reasons um

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:03,759
easy or hard and if hard why hard

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:06,000
it's absolutely um so

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,519
so different depending on what part of

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,160
the supply chain that you're looking at

00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,680
so very interestingly i found that there

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,880
was a lot of information

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:17,120
about for example when it came to labor

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,639
on the mining side of things and also

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,639
the manufacturing side of things a lot

00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,360
of investigative reporting going on

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,560
but everything in between so smelting

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,880
refining

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,839
um different parts of the manufacturing

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,120
process

00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:34,160
um a lot of the shipping and

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:37,120
anything related to logistics not very

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,399
reported on um and so we had these huge

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,680
gaps in information

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,279
where literally certain types of

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,560
elements would also be called something

00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,759
else by the time they reached another

00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,720
part of the supply chain

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,800
so half the work i think is trying to

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,480
create a shared language around

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,079
supply chains or at least a language

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,639
that we can operate off of then making a

00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:56,160
database that makes sense

00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,160
but i think actually one of the most

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,040
interesting things was the

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,160
types of information we didn't expect to

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,440
come across

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,760
and i'm going to cite miriam here

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,240
because she uh this always

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,919
comes back to me so she she focuses more

00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,640
so on the logistics shipping side of

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,959
things

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,799
and was telling me about these youtube

00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:18,000
videos and these podcasts

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:19,919
that seaman um the ones who are

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,199
you know operating boats that move

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,919
around the world

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,640
um make about their experience it was

00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,959
like blogging

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,240
so see if their vlogging was really big

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,559
um and it was cool

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,000
because you know as someone that's you

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,559
know reads up a lot of labor

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,880
and extraction seeing you know someone

00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,720
blogging about their work experience

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,640
like in the middle of the pacific i

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,760
think gives you a completely different

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,440
insight into what it's actually like to

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,280
be within that industry and i think it's

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,240
that sort of contradiction

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,440
that we really wanted to um yeah that we

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,840
really wanted to highlight or at least

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,440
put up on equal terms in a lot of ways

00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,880
long answer key questions but thanks so

00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,919
much that was a great one that was a

00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,240
good answer it was

00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,240
really interesting thank you um we've

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,440
got i'm going to ask you a question but

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,120
it's going to be a short answer if

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,720
that's okay and maybe you can

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:10,000
expand on it later in slack so and it's

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,120
it's a question that i have as well

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,960
actually so

00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,400
like who's your intended audience for

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,640
this type of data and

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,520
do you find you think about tailoring it

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,720
towards

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,720
different groups

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,720
i think for for now in the stage that

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,280
we're in

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,520
it's almost like we just want to get as

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:32,320
much information as possible

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,679
but what's been interesting is uh for

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,080
example in the reading group of people

00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,880
who

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,919
join have different ideas of what they

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,520
want to use it for so

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,200
for example there's very much an

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,280
interest in you know this sort of

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,240
collection being used as legal evidence

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,600
for example or like advocacy of evidence

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,600
and i think that that's something

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,520
that we're definitely interested in too

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,160
but i feel like we gotta dig through the

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,799
massive

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,799
