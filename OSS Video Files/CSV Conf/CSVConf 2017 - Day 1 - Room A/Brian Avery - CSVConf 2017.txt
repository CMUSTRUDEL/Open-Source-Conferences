	00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:10,620
so I teach at a small college and what

00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:13,590
Aaron talked about is about teaching

00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:16,349
people who come with the interest in

00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:18,779
using these kinds of tools I try to

00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:20,519
sneak up on them and actually teach them

00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:23,819
the tools before they know they want

00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:26,609
those tools so that's kind of a little

00:00:23,819 --> 00:00:28,979
bit different approach so how many of

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:31,679
you in the room know what Jupiter

00:00:28,979 --> 00:00:36,230
notebooks are I've used them okay pretty

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:39,090
much everybody awesome so that's good

00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:40,560
but really the thing that I kind of want

00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,020
to spend some time talking about is not

00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,120
what they are but how to sneak up on

00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,490
students that probably would avoid your

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,830
class if they knew you were going to try

00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:51,870
to teach them how to code they would run

00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:54,329
somewhere else and not actually want to

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,470
be in that class anymore so I want to

00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:58,110
talk a little bit about the motivation

00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:59,700
for for why I think it's important that

00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:03,320
we do something like you stupid or

00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:05,880
notebooks instead of using other tools

00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,319
before I do that though I want to do

00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,630
acknowledgments people do it at the end

00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:12,600
I always like to do it at the front so

00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:15,179
the Jupiter project is pretty amazing

00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,920
they do this for free right I mean

00:01:15,179 --> 00:01:20,609
that's that's pretty incredible

00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:24,329
it's reads to those of us who use it my

00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:26,280
colleagues Helen who and Sean Raleigh at

00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:29,700
Westminster so everything that I'm

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,840
talking about is a we not an eye and

00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,579
then I'm going to show you some work of

00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,520
some of my students with their

00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:37,200
permission data carpentry I think it's a

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,359
great resource a lot of what I'm going

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,069
to talk about Aaron talked about I'm

00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,619
just sort of backing it down a level

00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:45,090
I'm also Tricia Shepherd is someone who

00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:46,679
develops a lot of materials that I put

00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,499
in Jupiter notebooks and then I've been

00:01:46,679 --> 00:01:52,049
involved in this Tod's project which is

00:01:49,499 --> 00:01:53,700
through the AC and you and that stands

00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:55,799
for teaching to increase diversity and

00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,920
equity in STEM and I'll talk a little

00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:03,149
bit about how I think what what we do is

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,770
data science people and what we're doing

00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:08,310
in an undergraduate institution actually

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:13,050
sort of does address them issues of

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:14,860
equity so why why bother with this stuff

00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:19,030
right what's the what's the issue

00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:21,640
that we have so I was trained in a very

00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:23,920
classic sort of genetics lab I did bench

00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:27,040
work you know I've settled with

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:30,310
computers for a long time but in the

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,020
future this is from a 20-17 report you

00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:33,760
guys know this right but my students

00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:37,090
don't know that they're going to use a

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,830
computer for work no matter what a lot

00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,060
of them that are in science they think

00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:42,970
well I'm just going to go work in a

00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:45,160
physics lab I don't need a computer and

00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,900
that's kind of funny to some of my

00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,270
colleagues who are like you know well in

00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:51,250
the 70s we use computers and physics but

00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:53,500
they come in very often especially

00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:55,239
biologists and neuroscientists they

00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,450
don't think about computers as being a

00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:59,890
big part of what they're doing and so

00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:02,500
part of the job of not saying you're

00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:04,480
required to take a coding class but here

00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,640
are some coding skills and by the way

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,340
don't don't you like it isn't that kind

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,320
of neat look at what you can do and they

00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,610
don't even know they like it until it's

00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,280
too late and then you kind of got them

00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:17,980
hooked and by the way you needed to get

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,940
a good job this came out in nature and

00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:23,530
2017 again talking about things that

00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,600
data carpentry is addressing where

00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:27,880
you're trying to take people who are

00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,190
saying to themselves well why why do I

00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:32,980
need this coding stuff I'm in a ph.d

00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:36,220
program or I'm in science why do I need

00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:38,200
to do this but we can actually bring

00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:40,989
them in and get them the skills that

00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,390
they need and then I end up teaching a

00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:44,350
fair bit of reproducible science this is

00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:47,140
not something that's in the

00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:49,390
undergraduate curriculum maybe you know

00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:51,880
what what that looks like in an

00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:54,340
undergraduate level maybe you don't but

00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:57,040
nobody really teaches this to undergrad

00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:59,230
we haven't done it historically and we

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,360
really need to they're entering this

00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:03,010
world where they can't have a lab

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,810
notebook that's on paper they're

00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:06,670
generating huge amounts of data as

00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:08,980
undergraduates never mind what they have

00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:12,010
to deal with on their own once that once

00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:13,959
they're done and you know idea the

00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:15,850
number of files that I get submitted for

00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:18,640
assignments that are called way worse

00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:20,859
things and came up earlier final final

00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:23,110
final number four right where it's the

00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:24,760
exact same file name that you gave them

00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:26,440
as the assignment and it comes back to

00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,389
you and you don't even know what it is

00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,219
or whose it is or writes over

00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:32,110
I mean it's just being able to teach

00:04:30,219 --> 00:04:35,020
students how to keep track of the data

00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:38,169
that they have and not not mess it all

00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:40,419
up it actually takes a lot of time so

00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:42,360
that's something that is a big issue for

00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:45,669
a lot of them that we try to address

00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:48,699
thinking about equity computer science

00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:51,009
has a problem right we this is in the

00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:53,590
news all the time that tech and computer

00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:55,900
science has some some pretty big

00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:59,379
inequities in the workplace it's true in

00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:03,370
academia it's true in tact so if you

00:04:59,379 --> 00:05:04,870
look at the the numbers you know 57% of

00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:08,830
professional occupations are held by

00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:11,409
women but 20% of CIOs are women how do

00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:13,210
we engage students in a different way

00:05:11,409 --> 00:05:15,520
right the the sort of traditional

00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:18,069
culture of who learns to code has not

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,620
attracted everyone but if instead of

00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:23,229
being about the computer it's about the

00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,389
domain as I found out everybody but me

00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:27,659
calls it that I guess I came from the

00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:29,770
domain so that's sort of how I see it

00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:32,469
but if we can teach them that that

00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:35,259
science has these tools and needs these

00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:37,539
tools then before they know it they're

00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:40,089
actually into computer science or into

00:05:37,539 --> 00:05:42,129
data science so I've been teaching a lot

00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:44,169
of first semester students that come to

00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:46,330
college and they're not interested in

00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:47,529
see us at all I mean if you ask them do

00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:51,279
you want to take a computer science

00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:53,139
class they say no and the idea is that

00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:56,110
if we actually could take some of these

00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:57,430
you know 50% numbers of people coming in

00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,520
the door interested in science

00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:02,050
interested in biology and neuroscience

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:05,710
biology and neuroscience are at least

00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:07,270
50% women compared to things like

00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:10,599
computer science and sometimes

00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:13,389
engineering so I think that again

00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:15,879
sneaking up on people and saying like oh

00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:17,199
well you don't think this is what you're

00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:19,419
interested in but we got to make a bunch

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,189
of graphs I teach a lot of classes that

00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:22,899
you know like we have to make graphs

00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:26,050
because we have data a lot of it's

00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:27,460
actually gathered by the student what

00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,860
tool are we going to use well we could

00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:33,520
use Excel but you made a histogram in

00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:34,990
Excel it's kind of a pain right then

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,580
we've used Google sheets but these

00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:39,279
things have problems so I'll actually

00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:40,720
show you some some of the sort of

00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:42,700
template notebooks

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,620
that we've set up so we hand students

00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,820
these templates that have data in them

00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:47,980
and say here's how you make a histogram

00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:52,080
and then put your data in and see how

00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:55,780
that goes this is just more data about

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:58,030
you know again 57% of bachelor's degree

00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:01,120
recipients or women an 18% are in

00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:03,010
computer science I mean this is an issue

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:07,390
that needs to be addressed and I think

00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:09,460
that addressing it by by putting the

00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:11,860
sort of domain first and then saying oh

00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:13,270
and by the way you need these skills

00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:15,220
here they are in a way that that's

00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:17,650
different

00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:20,230
there's also actual science data on the

00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:23,590
fact that if you have teams of people

00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:27,240
working together that are diverse you

00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:31,120
get better ideas okay this is this is a

00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:33,490
active area of research right now so

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,870
this is again something that that we try

00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:36,430
to support we do a lot of team-based

00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:38,830
learning I'm going to introduce you to a

00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:41,880
paradigm called Pagal which stands for

00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:45,370
process oriented guided inquiry learning

00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:47,380
anyone heard of pair programming yeah

00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:49,300
okay a bunch of people so pair

00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:51,910
programming is something we do as well

00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:55,030
so you pair students up one person

00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:56,470
drives one person navigates but then we

00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:59,470
have teams and the activities are

00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:01,180
actually scaffolded so the idea came out

00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:03,940
before well how do you teach people how

00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:05,680
to learn well one way that we do that is

00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:08,860
we use what's called scaffolding where

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:11,169
you don't just throw people a CSV file

00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:13,419
and say figure it out right analyze this

00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:15,760
data you actually have a whole activity

00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:17,890
set up in our case in a jupiter notebook

00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,290
where what you do is you walk them

00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:23,530
through the steps piece by piece and you

00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:25,510
have them write code or run code modify

00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:28,000
code look at the results and then they

00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:30,220
go through and actually write answers to

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,570
questions that ask them about how did

00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:34,089
that go

00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:36,280
what were the tricky parts what did this

00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:37,719
command do what did that command do what

00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,360
were the arguments and you sort of walk

00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:41,860
them through the thinking processes

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,890
inside a jupiter notebook and so i'll

00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:47,280
show you some examples of that but again

00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:49,900
this this idea that working in teams and

00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,820
working in diverse teams is something

00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,670
that that's really worth it dressing and

00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:56,190
I think doing it in the classroom and

00:08:53,670 --> 00:09:00,120
kind of sneaky way actually works pretty

00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:01,500
well you know studying I think of data

00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,870
and software carbon trees

00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,040
graduate students and postdocs and then

00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:06,540
you think of I'm talking about

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,250
undergraduates and there's this whole

00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:11,730
movement of pushing this down the line

00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:14,100
even more and working with K through 12

00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:16,050
students and this model the the sort of

00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,240
team-based learning kind of things that

00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:21,510
we're doing I have have applications in

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,250
high school for sure okay so this is

00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:26,180
probably not something that I need to

00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:28,470
talk much about so why would we do this

00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:32,070
and I hate bullet point slides but

00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:33,570
there's one so Python and are the two

00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:35,430
big languages we use both at the

00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:37,680
institution that I work at some people

00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:39,690
use are some people use Python we can do

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,790
the same activities in both in two

00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:43,050
different Jupiter notebooks also people

00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:46,470
I'm trying to convert the MATLAB

00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:48,630
holdouts to Python or R but the few that

00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:50,760
won't then there's at least octave and

00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:52,320
I've been experimenting a lot with sage

00:09:50,760 --> 00:10:00,690
math cloud I don't know if you guys know

00:09:52,320 --> 00:10:02,010
staged math cloud it's free and I'll

00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:03,450
show you what that looks like you can

00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:05,190
pay to get it to upgrade and go a little

00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:08,210
faster but it's actually a free online

00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:11,460
cloud tool and it's pretty awesome

00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:14,880
we used anaconda to do a lot of the work

00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:17,070
in Python so here's this idea of

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,990
scaffolding that students don't have to

00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:20,790
write the code they can copy or they can

00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:22,950
run the code they can copy the code they

00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:25,050
can modify it and they can do whatever

00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:27,990
they need to do with it that's something

00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:31,230
we've done a lot of markdown is amazing

00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:32,970
markdown is the best so in the same

00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:36,000
notebook students can write markdown

00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:37,380
they can format equations in latex they

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,580
can do what they need to do and it's

00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:41,580
actually really simple to learn it's

00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:44,340
kind of amazing how fast students pick

00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,780
up on how markdown works I barely even

00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:47,010
have to show them how it works and

00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:49,290
they're off and running and almost no

00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:50,850
one complained which I thought that most

00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:52,260
students were going to kind of freak out

00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:55,970
a little bit about markdown because it

00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:58,380
looks like code right and it's not so

00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:59,460
but most of the advantages I think is

00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:03,000
everybody raised their hand about

00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:07,800
mailboxes you all know why

00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,270
so this a polo project the this

00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,180
team-based sort of active learning

00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:14,640
approach so this is the longest lecture

00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:18,720
I've given the semester as of right now

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:20,490
I never talk in class like this we might

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,750
set something up and just say like hey

00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:23,580
everybody this is what we're doing today

00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,840
and this is why it's important you know

00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,580
today we're going to look at numerical

00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:29,070
methods for approximating things because

00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:31,020
computers can't do integrals and this is

00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:32,790
why it's worthwhile one of the classes

00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:34,980
that I teach is on scientific computing

00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:38,630
in Python so it's everybody from

00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:41,850
biologists and chemists to physicists

00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:42,720
neuroscientists and math majors some of

00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:45,000
them have a little coding experience

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,220
some they'll have none and you know it's

00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,840
all over the map so so we try to pitch

00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,370
some of these mathematical and

00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,320
computational ideas to all these

00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:53,850
different kinds of students and actually

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,330
get them in the notebook and get them

00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:59,040
sort of going and this framework of

00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:01,500
puggle is actually pretty cool there is

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:04,740
a CF specific bogel if anybody's

00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:06,690
actually in computer science it came out

00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:10,620
of chemistry originally but there there

00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:14,040
is a biology there are some biology

00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:16,950
activities it's some of the activities

00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:19,110
are free some are not unfortunately but

00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:23,100
the the surd development cycle is pretty

00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:24,900
interesting to the guided inquiry works

00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:27,060
on this kind of learning cycle where

00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,710
this is part of the scaffolding idea the

00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:31,860
first thing you do is explore something

00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:33,810
you present the students with a table or

00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:37,410
some equation some background today

00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:39,350
we're going to look at DNA and how DNA

00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:42,320
is made into RNA is made into a protein

00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:44,310
background information on that or

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,560
background information on something that

00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:49,290
you might do in in code you might want

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,750
to do a 2d array so you might need to

00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:54,330
introduce numpy and how do you make a 2d

00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,890
array and then you actually have them go

00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:58,320
through and kind of write some of the

00:12:55,890 --> 00:13:00,330
code manipulate some of the the code and

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,130
see how it works you don't tell them how

00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:04,440
it works you let them see how it works

00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:06,120
you let them make break it have errors

00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,160
like Aaron was talking about what does

00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,930
that error message mean right what did

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,690
what did it say what does it now tell

00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:14,130
you oh gee you forgot an argument okay

00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:16,660
what does that argument do why do you

00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:18,370
need it so they kind of invent their own

00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,720
idea of how does this stuff work and

00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:21,730
then you actually get them to apply it

00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,259
so it moves them from something very

00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:25,000
easy something that they just sort of

00:13:23,259 --> 00:13:26,740
kick around a little bit through to

00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,629
something that they then have to kind of

00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,220
figure out how it's put together and

00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:32,199
then you ask them to do it

00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:34,870
so you hand them something and say okay

00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:36,939
well now take this DNA sequence make it

00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:39,519
into RNA and then make a protein out of

00:13:36,939 --> 00:13:44,199
it all on your computer so I'll show you

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:46,269
a few examples of that too so I'm hoping

00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:47,829
to sort of end a little early and I'll

00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:50,470
show you a bunch of examples things

00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:52,389
students have done and and then and

00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:54,100
things we prepare for them but then I'd

00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:56,019
be interested if you all have questions

00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,910
and especially give ideas things that

00:13:56,019 --> 00:13:59,980
you're working on or think you've used

00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:01,029
stupider notebooks for I think that

00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,430
would be kind of neat to have a little

00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:07,720
discussion about that I don't know if

00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:08,800
you can even see that all right I have

00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,829
some of them just brought up as

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:14,009
notebooks as well so as the

00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:16,629
neuroscientist one of the things that I

00:14:14,009 --> 00:14:18,790
wanted to sort of bring to some of the

00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:20,949
students is you know they modeled the

00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:22,660
Nerds potential this is why yourself

00:14:20,949 --> 00:14:25,170
have any electrical activity at all

00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:27,819
so it's a little bit of an explanation

00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:30,160
there's some math so this is pretty

00:14:27,819 --> 00:14:32,259
simple for for students to do some math

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,790
one of the best things I love about

00:14:32,259 --> 00:14:35,920
these notebooks is you can just sort of

00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:37,839
lay it all out I just wrote that you

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,990
format the equations and then we can

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:43,870
give them either values or test cases

00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:45,220
probably the biggest struggle for a lot

00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:47,980
of the students and in some of these

00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:50,170
classes is running test cases of their

00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:52,329
own we give them some test cases for

00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:54,819
their code and then they're like okay

00:14:52,329 --> 00:14:57,250
what now and and sort of training them

00:14:54,819 --> 00:14:58,959
to think about exploring a parameter how

00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:01,089
far should that go should it really be

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,480
ten thousand ten thousand even makes

00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:03,790
sense

00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:06,130
probably not what's the normal range of

00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:08,529
that ion concentration for example or

00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:10,240
that velocity or whatever it is so

00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:12,579
getting students to sort of think about

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,350
running test cases so this is the same

00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:15,610
thing I mean you guys have done enough

00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:17,980
with this that you know this is the

00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:20,439
markdown version and students they're

00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:21,850
really savvy they see them they see the

00:15:20,439 --> 00:15:23,589
nice version and then what do they do

00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:26,079
they click on it and it falls into

00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:27,759
markdown and most of them go ok like I

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,850
can work with that and they figure out

00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:30,259
how it works we

00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:32,209
we provided them with very little

00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:33,949
training on how markdown actually works

00:15:32,209 --> 00:15:37,550
and mostly they just figured it out and

00:15:33,949 --> 00:15:39,350
did it which is pretty cool and then we

00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:41,240
give them some programming tasks so that

00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:43,370
would be sort of a model and sort of

00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,500
this puggle idea where we'd ask them to

00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:47,690
start exploring what does this do and

00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:50,779
how does it work program the math and

00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:52,370
then we give them a task so we did some

00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:53,839
object-oriented programming and we

00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:55,490
wanted them to get practice making a

00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,500
class so they had to make a class called

00:15:55,490 --> 00:16:01,009
a neuron and we're working on

00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:03,110
constructor methods and then we gave

00:16:01,009 --> 00:16:05,569
them values to plug in up at the top for

00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:07,279
sort of one one kind of cell and now

00:16:05,569 --> 00:16:10,190
well see if your class works with these

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:13,430
other so moving from a scientific

00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:15,410
computing context this is an activity I

00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:17,810
do with first semester students who

00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:20,120
literally come in and may not know how

00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:22,250
to make a graph any graph I give them

00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,529
this activity where I give them data and

00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:27,380
just say okay make me a graph and I give

00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:29,389
them no instructions and it produces

00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:31,040
really interesting results there's sort

00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:32,899
of all over the place some people make

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,600
these really nice graphs some people

00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:37,069
make things that I can't even understand

00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,470
and then we go through and have this

00:16:37,069 --> 00:16:41,569
sort of more almost a semester long

00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:44,509
discussion and this is in a genetics

00:16:41,569 --> 00:16:46,399
class for non-science majors and we have

00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:48,110
this discussion about how do you present

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,029
data what do you do with it

00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:52,100
why are there good ways to sort of

00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:53,930
present certain types of data so this

00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:56,139
would again be the sort of the model

00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:58,279
that students would would look at I

00:16:56,139 --> 00:17:00,439
actually often have them sketch graphs

00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:02,240
on paper because that's a good way to

00:17:00,439 --> 00:17:04,429
just get the intuition of what is that

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,959
even going to look like and then they

00:17:04,429 --> 00:17:09,049
have to go through and think about these

00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:11,240
different types of graphs and then I

00:17:09,049 --> 00:17:13,970
actually have them load some data which

00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:16,549
in this case is genetic data so it has

00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:18,439
genotype and some numerical variable and

00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:21,319
then some categorical variables of

00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:23,539
different types and go through and deal

00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:24,980
with this thing in R this is a little

00:17:23,539 --> 00:17:27,709
bit on the high end this is a little

00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:29,419
more advanced for what I would expect a

00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:32,090
first semester college students to be

00:17:29,419 --> 00:17:33,530
able to do and this is would be a mix of

00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:35,480
code that I provide for them and just

00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:37,100
leave and let them run so that they get

00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,610
a sense of what it is and they will

00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,640
often ask

00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:45,470
questions what did this step do why is

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:47,900
that step there why was it necessary and

00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:49,190
then they make histograms and it's kind

00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:53,360
of it's actually kind of amazing how

00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:55,670
hard it is to make histograms but in

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,770
something like our with ggplot or with

00:17:55,670 --> 00:18:00,380
Python with MATLAB it's actually pretty

00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:02,570
easy and then we can go on and make

00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:05,090
stack histograms it's pretty amazing how

00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:08,630
hard it is to make a stack histogram in

00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:11,120
anything but our Python excel I've never

00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:13,460
tried I got too frustrated we used

00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,169
Google sheets a semester ago but you

00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:18,320
can't make a stack histogram or a box

00:18:15,169 --> 00:18:20,450
plot in Google sheets so again they can

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,460
go through and basically pluck this

00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:24,110
stuff out and walk through and make all

00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:26,540
these different kinds of sort of

00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:28,730
representations of the data starting to

00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:31,040
think about what's the distribution look

00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:32,600
like you know and you can do almost

00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,640
anything that you want in this and and

00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:38,330
this one gets kind of advanced in the

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:40,480
end going through making some different

00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:42,860
kind of bar charts and tables and things

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,799
but this is again running in Sage math

00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:47,660
cloud which is free and has actually a

00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:49,669
structure where you can make classes you

00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,630
can actually get your whole class in

00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:53,630
there and they can submit assignments

00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:57,500
and you can evaluate assignments I did a

00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:59,720
Python activity with my colleague Sean

00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:02,690
Raleigh's data science class where that

00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:04,220
entire his entire class was in Sage math

00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:07,130
club and he graded their assignments and

00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:08,540
everything in Sage math class so if

00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:15,010
you're interested in that it works

00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:15,010
pretty well as far as

00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:21,490
[Applause]

00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:24,640
thinking about other examples this one

00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:26,049
kind of broke so the other thing at the

00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,200
end of the scientific computing class

00:19:26,049 --> 00:19:31,809
one thing that we did again trying to

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:35,350
get students to connect what they do in

00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:36,909
science to computing and these are

00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:40,630
juniors and seniors that are from all

00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:42,399
over different types of science we

00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:44,679
basically had them write a report a

00:19:42,399 --> 00:19:49,870
project they had to either make a

00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:52,720
simulation build a model or gather clean

00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:55,240
and visualize the data set and so this

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,720
is a student who was in environmental

00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,460
science

00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:00,460
it's very interested in sort of climate

00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:02,320
data and so they had to write an

00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:04,419
introduction and justify everything so

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,070
this was not a template this is just an

00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:07,899
assignment make a notebook that does

00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:09,520
this and so they didn't have anything to

00:20:07,899 --> 00:20:12,039
start with they'd have a research

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:14,590
question and her research question is

00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:16,510
about temperature and so she went

00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:18,669
through and did all this this in Python

00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:21,159
to get the data set from NOAA to clean

00:20:18,669 --> 00:20:22,809
it and then her goal was to try to map

00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:24,940
it and we've done nothing with

00:20:22,809 --> 00:20:27,490
matplotlib with geographical data

00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:29,770
literally nothing and she went through

00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:34,000
and gathered all this data and analyzed

00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:36,700
at all and then found base map which I

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,950
had never used because I haven't done

00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:42,179
much of geographical data and she made

00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:44,620
this map using latitude and longitude

00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:45,880
and the temperature data from this data

00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:48,490
set and this is a student had no

00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:49,690
computer programming experience at the

00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:52,320
beginning the semester and they

00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:55,149
presented these projects on Monday so

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,860
that's the kind of thing that wants sort

00:20:55,149 --> 00:20:58,809
of given the opportunity to figure out

00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:00,309
how they can connect to it students can

00:20:58,809 --> 00:21:03,159
actually produce some pretty amazing

00:21:00,309 --> 00:21:07,029
things this is a student who was also

00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:09,039
taking a GIS class so she bounced her

00:21:07,029 --> 00:21:11,559
data back and forth between GIS and

00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:14,980
Python and did the sort of data

00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:18,070
gathering from the census data in GIS

00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:21,309
and hers is incredibly long very

00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:23,890
thorough but so and she had this

00:21:21,309 --> 00:21:26,490
hypothesis that basically the distance

00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:30,440
you live from a park would depend on the

00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:32,389
income in your census tract and so

00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,799
sort of idea with the perhaps Salt Lake

00:21:32,389 --> 00:21:36,259
City there were neighborhoods that were

00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:39,139
underserved as far as parks went versus

00:21:36,259 --> 00:21:41,990
had sort of an equitable or a good

00:21:39,139 --> 00:21:44,750
amount of sort of Park area so she had

00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:47,870
to pull in just a lot of data from GIS

00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:50,600
from the Census I mean this is all code

00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:52,580
she wrote entirely on her own she wrote

00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:55,190
multiple methods for all these classes

00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:58,009
and it's kind of amazing I'm not sure I

00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:59,360
understand all that and in the end the

00:21:58,009 --> 00:22:01,490
best thing she did was sort of bounce

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:04,279
back and forth and so she had a bunch of

00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:06,950
her data she graphed it and then she put

00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:11,269
it back in GIS and used GIS to draw the

00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:13,190
map and so again this is a student who

00:22:11,269 --> 00:22:15,769
the other day was like so tell me about

00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:17,659
data science what is that I'm thinking

00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:20,090
about jobs and data science and doing

00:22:17,659 --> 00:22:22,820
something with this sort of geographical

00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:24,230
data and a student who would never have

00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:26,330
said that to me she wouldn't have known

00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:29,559
what data science was I'm a semester

00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:33,769
before so pretty cool

00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:35,600
incredibly thorough and then the last

00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:38,149
project example I'll show you is from a

00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:41,059
student who worked on cell biology who

00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:43,309
you psych it image again not in class at

00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:45,559
all to actually try to ask how many

00:22:43,309 --> 00:22:48,620
outgrowths are there for himself that

00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:52,070
these cells are making neurons stem

00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:54,470
cells and so she had was differentiating

00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:56,389
some neurons from stem cells and she

00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:59,029
wanted to know can I count the number of

00:22:56,389 --> 00:23:01,580
outgrowths so she messed around with a

00:22:59,029 --> 00:23:03,559
bunch of her images so she done a

00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:06,080
biological set of experiments and taking

00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:08,149
these images so this nervous cell the

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,279
stem cell is making neurites all over

00:23:08,149 --> 00:23:12,080
the place it shouldn't do that but she

00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:15,379
wanted to try to quantify how many

00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:17,480
outgrowths are there so she went through

00:23:15,379 --> 00:23:18,980
and processed the images and then she

00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,350
was able to write a function that would

00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:25,129
put a blue dot on each of the outgrowth

00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:26,690
and count them and she did that with a

00:23:25,129 --> 00:23:28,190
bunch of these cells that she had sort

00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:30,559
of flattened the images and made them a

00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:32,120
little bit cleaner and then she threw it

00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:35,840
some really dirty data and it didn't do

00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:38,210
very well and that's fine but it did it

00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,830
did reasonably well and so we have this

00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:41,360
whole conversation about automating

00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:43,129
things and what do you do with these

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,150
files how do you keep track of the

00:23:43,129 --> 00:23:46,190
images before there

00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:48,620
processed after their process all these

00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:50,390
kinds of skills that she probably never

00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:53,390
would have would have dealt with any in

00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:55,190
any other way and again then my favorite

00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:57,020
part of this is it's not just code and

00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:58,790
it's not just that's the sort of stuff

00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:00,560
that they've done in grass there is

00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:02,450
actual text they think about what am I

00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:04,010
going to do with this what does it mean

00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:06,770
scientifically and they can basically

00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:09,770
turn in a research report that has code

00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:12,140
result and their interpretation so

00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:13,550
that's that serve on the end of it with

00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:16,040
students that are a little bit more

00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:18,500
advanced but with the grass - even with

00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:20,810
incoming students they write code they

00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:22,280
think they describe they talk about what

00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:25,310
they've learned all in the same document

00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:27,260
these are HTML they flatten them in HTML

00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:29,080
files and and now they can send them to

00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:31,520
whoever they want to have a look at them

00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:33,410
so I've talked plenty so you guys have

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:36,870
questions or suggestions I'd love
