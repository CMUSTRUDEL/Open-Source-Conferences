thanks Nate hi everyone it is a pleasure

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,459
to be here having been invited all the

00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:14,789
way from Accra Ghana in West Africa

00:00:11,459 --> 00:00:17,369
first time in Portland my talk is titled

00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:19,470
when data collection meets non-technical

00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:24,660
CSO's in low-income areas I know that

00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:26,580
it's a lot but before I dive into that I

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,960
work with open knowledge international

00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,460
and school of data open knowledge

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,800
international used to be open knowledge

00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,170
foundation and what we do we are

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,270
non-for-profit tech organization that

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,370
works with civil society organizations

00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,890
to help them see the value of open data

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,360
in their work but also to help them

00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,540
build the skills and the tools they need

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,940
to do their work and also we helped set

00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:50,340
up the school of data project which is

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:53,579
an initiative to train journalists and

00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:57,059
civil society organizations to use data

00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:59,430
in their work my official title is

00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:02,610
Africa lead but I like to call myself

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:04,680
more of a data plumber because I zip

00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,560
around the African continent working

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,909
with civil society organizations to

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,110
build their open data capacity and

00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:12,390
there's a lot of learning that comes

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:14,640
with that and this is what has led to

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:18,390
this specific talk when we talk about

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,940
open data there's this glamour feel to

00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,890
it data journalism which has value but

00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,299
how does that really look like on the

00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,479
ground particularly when you're talking

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:30,689
about low-income areas and how can we

00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:33,000
talk about the realities and the lessons

00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:36,479
and be able to have a real conversation

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,260
about how to move this forward if you

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:43,229
want to be nerdy or more mathematical my

00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:46,740
top can be solved or described in this

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:51,390
way CSS plus data collection - income -

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:55,979
technical I'd like to acknowledge the

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:58,950
open data for development network which

00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:00,180
fund some of the work that we do which

00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,530
is leading to some of the lessons that

00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,270
we're learning and obviously school of

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:07,920
data you should check them out if you

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:09,780
don't know about them okay before I go

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,370
on it's important to define civil

00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,660
society organization because we tend to

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,790
throw that around a lot without

00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,540
necessarily having a base idea of what

00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:18,799
we're talking about

00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:21,629
some people think it's referring to NGOs

00:02:18,799 --> 00:02:23,219
but based on this definition that is

00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:26,750
coming from a really good report that

00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:29,310
the World Economic Forum put out in 2013

00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:31,079
it's far more than a mere sects are

00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,959
dominated by NGOs when when you're

00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:37,409
talking about civil society they can be

00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:39,930
organized and unorganized groups but the

00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:41,430
expanding across is different both

00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,349
online and offline so we're talking

00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,760
about media organizations you can be

00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:47,040
talking about individuals who are

00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,299
deciding to advocate for specific needs

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,900
you can be talking about faith-based

00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:54,659
organizations you can be talking about

00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:56,730
research groups are they exist in this

00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:59,099
space where they're not necessarily

00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:00,720
government's entities and unnecessarily

00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:02,669
citizens sometimes but they have a

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,069
crucial role to play and that's their

00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:11,099
broad definition that I'll be using for

00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:12,599
this right so when I joined the open

00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:16,560
data movement or when I heard about it

00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:19,200
this was a typical value chain that I

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,750
got to hear about this somebody produces

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,269
data typically the government and then

00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:26,310
there are some entities in between who

00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:29,280
are intermediaries who work with this

00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:32,900
data or who get the data to user groups

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,400
that can be citizens and particularly

00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:37,799
the intermediaries tended to be civil

00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,629
society organizations who are not

00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:41,540
necessarily data producers but we're

00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:44,040
working with this data to turn that into

00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:47,760
insights for advocacy or some value to

00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:50,940
excuses but this is actually evolving

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,129
particularly in low-income areas where

00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:56,040
civil society organizations are moving

00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:59,579
to a data production role and this is

00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:01,859
because of two reasons most of the time

00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:03,629
government does not have the capacity to

00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:05,939
produce the datasets that are relevant

00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:10,590
to civil society organizations for their

00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:13,079
work economic reasons just not a

00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:16,169
willingness to do so but the second

00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:18,090
reason is also citizens or the public

00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:19,590
does not necessarily trust some of the

00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:22,380
datasets that governments are producing

00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:25,440
which is requiring civil society

00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:27,750
organizations to serve us a data

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,500
producer to help verify or to help

00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:33,120
compare the datasets that

00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:35,490
which is a great thing but then the

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,620
challenge that it presents is do civil

00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:41,430
society organizations have the capacity

00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:44,370
to assume this role and over the past

00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:46,050
year we've worked on projects that have

00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:48,750
presented this to us and we're learning

00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:50,520
lessons about what it takes so this talk

00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:52,710
is going to share with you some of the

00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,290
things that we've seen not because we

00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:57,720
have a clear picture but to expose the

00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:59,760
process that exists and then I would

00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,650
love to really hear from other people

00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,870
about your experiences if any of it

00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:05,220
exists and what you think is the way

00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,530
forward when it comes to thinking about

00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,900
this particular attention should be paid

00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:11,430
to low-income areas and the way I

00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,750
describe that is you're thinking about

00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:15,540
areas that are limited in terms of

00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:18,270
resources their definitions in terms of

00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,920
like money socioeconomic status but low

00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:23,250
income areas does not necessarily have

00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:26,750
to be a poor region as defined by any

00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:29,100
walk bank term but it can also be a

00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:31,470
specific area in a rich or wealthy

00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:34,470
country that lacks resources and the

00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:35,850
applications can can be across so the

00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:38,370
first experience I'm going to talk about

00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:39,570
is our first engagement with an

00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,430
organization called the women

00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:45,530
environmental program based in Abuja

00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:47,970
Nigeria they work on women health

00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:49,669
environmental issues and service

00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:52,919
delivery and they've been around for

00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:55,200
twenty years now the value of this

00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:56,160
organization is they engage a lot with

00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,040
the committee and they tend to

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:02,100
understand the core issues so we first

00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:04,410
engaged with them in March 2016 through

00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:07,080
our project that came that they applied

00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:09,930
for and they got a grant for so on our

00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,790
first call John one of the program

00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,980
managers was like David we are going to

00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:16,080
develop a structured questionnaire print

00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:17,669
them in several copies for data

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,460
collectors take you to the field

00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:22,290
administer it when it's completed we're

00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:24,720
going to return the questionnaires and

00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:27,060
then we'll manually input that into the

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,510
computer for analysis I'm like wow John

00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,510
Gray

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,139
to them well-intentioned debt data

00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:38,719
collection is something that they see is

00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:40,719
valuable they buy into the whole open

00:06:38,719 --> 00:06:42,770
data movement and they want to do this

00:06:40,719 --> 00:06:45,229
but then there's a problem with this

00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:47,150
this is so oversimplified and to them

00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:51,170
it's something that you can easily do

00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:53,080
and in my mind this is what I'm thinking

00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:56,180
[Laughter]

00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,529
obviously you have to specially specify

00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,639
the data collection goals which they are

00:06:57,529 --> 00:07:00,409
good at doing because they understand

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,180
the community and then you have to

00:07:00,409 --> 00:07:04,099
design the methodology you have to

00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:06,020
design the questionnaire you have to

00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:07,490
recruit the data collectors you have to

00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:09,409
then train the data collectors you have

00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:10,969
to collect the data you have to store

00:07:09,409 --> 00:07:13,310
the data you have to verify the data you

00:07:10,969 --> 00:07:16,779
have to clean the data anonymize the

00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:21,080
data document the data publish the data

00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:23,419
but you can't tell them this right you

00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:26,389
can expose this to them slowly but you

00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:29,389
cannot tell them this so the first thing

00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:31,249
that we did was we presented them a

00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:33,169
document that fortunately we had created

00:07:31,249 --> 00:07:35,810
at school of data that walks people

00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:38,060
through our mobile data collection and

00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:40,159
it's an easy-to-read document I'll share

00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:42,349
I'll show you that later on in the talk

00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:45,139
and gave them and we didn't have to read

00:07:42,349 --> 00:07:46,370
through and this gives a picture about

00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:47,810
the process and what you should be

00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:49,909
thinking as an organization if you want

00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:52,849
to do data collection and once they were

00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:54,500
done with that the good thing was that

00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:56,689
they were already engaging with the

00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,639
National Statistics office which has

00:07:56,689 --> 00:08:00,860
taken the role of helping them think

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,779
about the methodology which communities

00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,370
do you work with and how do you make

00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:07,460
sure that the data you're collecting

00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:10,219
actually captures what you want it

00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:11,990
wasn't going to be a representative data

00:08:10,219 --> 00:08:14,060
collection process but it was supposed

00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:15,740
to highlight some areas that later on a

00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:18,080
bigger entity like the National

00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:21,889
Statistics office could focus on and tap

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:24,289
into then we went to the designer of the

00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:26,149
questionnaire it's like John can you

00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:28,430
send me the questionnaire that you're

00:08:26,149 --> 00:08:31,699
working on he did he sends me something

00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:33,560
via email and I was asking John can you

00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:37,550
share with me by a Google Docs big

00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:39,050
mistake because they knew about it but

00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,519
they didn't typically use something like

00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:42,090
Google Docs they didn't have a

00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:43,409
collaborative system

00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:45,060
involved they were used to sending

00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:46,620
documents back and forth and that's one

00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,930
of the things we should pay attention to

00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:50,880
as we're going on with this talk so then

00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:52,260
talking to them trying to assist it's

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,720
important that we use something like

00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:56,970
Google Docs because it helps but that

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,500
still wasn't working we did this for

00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:00,420
weeks until I actually went to Nigeria

00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:04,020
and then I show them what the value of

00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:05,730
doing this but after almost a month of

00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:08,850
working back and forth with this we're

00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:11,490
able to design a questionnaire um that

00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:13,920
talks through the flow of how you go

00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:16,020
about asking questions and how you skip

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,339
and technically this is called a schema

00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,740
but you don't tell them this is called a

00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:21,210
schema you try to walk them through and

00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:24,029
I keep on repeating this is because

00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:26,820
sometimes and the reason why I see

00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:29,610
non-technical is we as technical people

00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:31,980
see the value of using technical words

00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,680
and see the value of technical processes

00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:36,180
but when you have non-technical

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,550
individuals institutions coming up and

00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:40,650
being exposed to a process it may not be

00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:42,420
the best way to throw these words to

00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:43,800
them once they get to the end and

00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:47,250
there's tons of value that you can throw

00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:50,760
this in but quickly to run through this

00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:54,780
entire process there was a tool that

00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:56,339
really saved them a lot that ended up

00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,260
making this process a little bit more

00:09:56,339 --> 00:10:01,290
excited and this is koba toolbox as

00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:05,250
anyone helped head of Cobo toolbox okay

00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:07,800
so has anyone head of open data kit okay

00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:10,589
so open data kit is a platform that

00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,330
helps in mobile data collection and was

00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:14,010
built by a team of I believe from

00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:15,930
Harvard and some humanitarian

00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:18,839
organizations and the whole idea of it

00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:23,010
is to make it easy for people to collect

00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:25,280
data using mobile devices and it does a

00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:29,820
really great job to help you design that

00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:34,350
uses some really easy fun Excel based

00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:36,390
formats to do this but Kobo to open data

00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:38,790
kit can be a little bit technical also

00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:41,550
so Kobo toolbox has been built on top of

00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:43,860
open data kit which makes it really easy

00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:45,900
to build your questionnaires to collect

00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:48,450
data deploy it and I'll show that real

00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:51,839
quickly so that save that a lot in terms

00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:55,120
of collecting data storing data being

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:58,749
able to clean data and publish

00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,610
now going to that later on but long

00:10:58,749 --> 00:11:05,529
story short and I can show this real

00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:09,129
quickly is we managed to go through the

00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:10,629
process and the value was working with

00:11:09,129 --> 00:11:12,879
them to understand what they want to

00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:15,910
achieve doing a lot of the technical

00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:17,800
work which we've documented over here so

00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:21,069
you get that by never told them about

00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:23,259
github but working with them to document

00:11:21,069 --> 00:11:27,399
the entire process what other project

00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:29,649
objectives and a very important step was

00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:32,649
verification so the idea of verification

00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:34,959
did not exist necessarily for them but

00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:36,819
letting them understand why it's

00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:39,759
important to verify your data so as you

00:11:36,819 --> 00:11:41,920
can see we've documented what is the

00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:44,889
process how many responses came from the

00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:47,709
each community how many responses came

00:11:44,889 --> 00:11:51,100
from each waterward is to some extent at

00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:53,559
district how many responses came from

00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:55,509
each data collector and thinking through

00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:57,730
some of these validation processes is

00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:59,740
easier for them and then documenting

00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:01,959
things that we change words that were

00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:05,889
spelt wrongly and documents and

00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:07,660
everything because as civil society

00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:10,329
organizations move into the role of data

00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:13,240
collection data should be able to be

00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:14,949
verified if you present this to the

00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,120
Statistics Office saying that this is

00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:18,160
something that should be published

00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,949
having that documentation process is

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,259
important and teaching them how to do

00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:25,059
this in a non-technical way is very

00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:26,740
important so we have all this documented

00:12:25,059 --> 00:12:28,509
so that when they present this people

00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,129
can see what has changed what do they

00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:32,499
collect initially what has change and

00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:34,230
all that is here a long-term goal is

00:12:32,499 --> 00:12:37,660
that they will learn how to use github

00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:41,620
but that's not something that I'm we're

00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:45,059
putting out to them yet this is the

00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:48,689
clean data that we eventually ended up

00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:51,730
get in and again we used open refine

00:12:48,689 --> 00:12:53,350
that was mostly being done by us but not

00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:56,110
by them because they feel that it's also

00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:57,519
a little bit too technical so clean the

00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:59,410
data a little bit show them what has

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,449
been done I'm again through the

00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:04,179
verification and cleaning process and

00:13:01,449 --> 00:13:06,579
then once everything is fine we still

00:13:04,179 --> 00:13:08,499
keep a record of the in open refine you

00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:10,569
have a history and a JSON

00:13:08,499 --> 00:13:13,629
format that is still exist for anyone

00:13:10,569 --> 00:13:15,789
technical to work with the long term

00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:17,379
gold eventually now that the clean data

00:13:15,789 --> 00:13:20,499
is available they were able to go ahead

00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:23,199
and publish reports and a brief that

00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:24,849
undetailed what they've learned which is

00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:28,299
very valuable to them and whenever

00:13:24,849 --> 00:13:30,309
anyone ask them to any show me what you

00:13:28,299 --> 00:13:31,809
see from the report because the data is

00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:33,459
already available they can quickly

00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:37,269
generate something that is some value to

00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:39,039
them so I'm talking about all this

00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:40,929
snippets and I'll talk about some of the

00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:42,489
lessons that we are learning later on

00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:45,609
but it's important to pay attention one

00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:48,189
of the key things is as data collection

00:13:45,609 --> 00:13:49,929
is complicated when you're doing it in

00:13:48,189 --> 00:13:51,519
low-income areas it becomes extra

00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:54,129
complicated when you're doing with

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,779
non-technical CSO's it becomes extra

00:13:54,129 --> 00:13:57,969
extra complicated but it's not

00:13:55,779 --> 00:14:00,189
impossible we need to think about the

00:13:57,969 --> 00:14:02,049
best way to help approach it is because

00:14:00,189 --> 00:14:03,489
civil society organizations are

00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:05,949
increasingly going to play a role and we

00:14:03,489 --> 00:14:09,609
need to embrace them more than to push

00:14:05,949 --> 00:14:12,129
them away the next quick example or

00:14:09,609 --> 00:14:13,839
scenario that I want to talk about has

00:14:12,129 --> 00:14:16,929
to do with advocates for community

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:19,509
alternatives so as opposed to the women

00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:21,039
environmental program they're based in

00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:24,369
Accra Ghana they are less than a year

00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:26,169
old a core team of four people they're

00:14:24,369 --> 00:14:28,179
more tech savvy and the reason why I say

00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:31,809
that is they use the understand what

00:14:28,179 --> 00:14:34,509
Google Docs are they use technology they

00:14:31,809 --> 00:14:36,279
are aware of that and they had already

00:14:34,509 --> 00:14:38,229
been working on their project and what

00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:41,379
they do is they work with communities

00:14:38,229 --> 00:14:45,399
that have access to natural resources

00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:47,409
like gold oil and when that happens to a

00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:48,909
community you have mining companies come

00:14:47,409 --> 00:14:49,799
in and say we want to get you by your

00:14:48,909 --> 00:14:52,839
land

00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:54,789
advocates for community alternative ACA

00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:57,069
what to the communities to understand

00:14:54,789 --> 00:14:59,470
the value of their land and be able to

00:14:57,069 --> 00:15:01,389
provide them with alternatives for a

00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:03,099
better development value so saying that

00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:05,559
don't sell your land because maybe you

00:15:03,099 --> 00:15:07,659
can plant the better crops that will

00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:09,459
bring you money talk about the potential

00:15:07,659 --> 00:15:12,729
long-term detriment to your environment

00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:15,909
but in order to do this they have been

00:15:12,729 --> 00:15:18,970
collecting baseline data on community

00:15:15,909 --> 00:15:20,499
members so they do that what lime do you

00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:21,760
have how much money are you making from

00:15:20,499 --> 00:15:27,040
the crop that your plants and they do

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:29,260
on a six-month basis so one of the

00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,730
things that they mentioned was if we're

00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:33,040
going to do data collection we need to

00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:35,500
have a way of tracking individual

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:38,470
household members and how their

00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:41,140
livelihood is improving and their

00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:42,910
technical and then my technical brain

00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:46,360
comes on and said oh you can use an

00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:48,730
identifier for each person that is great

00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,440
when you are in typically high-income

00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:53,530
areas where people have access maybe

00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:57,250
even national identifies like passports

00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:58,540
or IDs or even email that obviously you

00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,190
are not sharing that email but in your

00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,590
the back of your system you have a way

00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:05,170
of linking different data sets that I've

00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:06,700
been captured at different times when

00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:09,190
you have somebody who is living in an

00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:13,060
area that doesn't have an address

00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:15,490
doesn't have access to email doesn't

00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:18,400
have access or is regularly moving away

00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:19,840
that becomes a problem and we didn't

00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,030
have an answer to that we're saying okay

00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:24,520
maybe we can link your name and your

00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:25,780
date of birth to the household where

00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,790
they are but that wasn't really working

00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:30,010
and that raised the question are we

00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:32,170
really thinking about ways that we can

00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:33,490
deal with scenarios like this and when

00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:34,990
we talk about data collection we make

00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:37,390
some assumptions but we just had

00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:39,610
realized that we didn't necessarily have

00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:42,040
an answer to this problem of what is a

00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:44,950
unique identifier for an individual who

00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:46,260
needs to be tracked in your system over

00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:49,030
a period of time but doesn't necessarily

00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:50,470
reside in a permanent place still

00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:54,100
looking for solutions that anybody asked

00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:55,930
that but there for them by the time we

00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,370
got in there they had we had learned

00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:59,710
more about data collection in low-income

00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:02,410
areas and they use Cobo toolbox also and

00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:04,060
we've been able to build a process for

00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:06,610
them that allows them to use this too in

00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:12,339
an easy way to collect and data and they

00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:14,709
really love it so these are two examples

00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:16,000
that I want to share they're more one

00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:17,949
example that I'm not going to spend more

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,240
time on is we're doing some training in

00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:24,130
Sudan and a journalist was like hi I

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,390
know we're working with governments if I

00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:28,680
don't trust the government can I go

00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:28,680
collect my own data and said no

00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:33,210
but increasingly you're going to have

00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:35,520
individuals who want to be able to do

00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:37,410
this and how can we ensure that they do

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,650
this in a way that makes sense for the

00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:42,630
context that exists so one of the

00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:44,790
lessons that we're learning is we need

00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:47,220
to build simpler tools for low income

00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:50,100
context an example as I'm seeing is

00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:52,550
Cobra tool two boxes help reduce the

00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:55,320
headache of going through that really

00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:58,230
complicated process by making it easier

00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:01,260
for individuals to UM easily create a

00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:02,820
questionnaire on a platform use a simple

00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:05,730
mobile form that doesn't take a lot of

00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:07,890
storage data be able to collect data

00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:09,720
offline and then once you get access to

00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:16,230
click internet connection be able to

00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:17,490
send it to a dashboard most users cannot

00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:19,080
go it alone when it comes to data

00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:21,200
collection so complicated that we need

00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:23,010
to think about potential partnerships so

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,530
what can we tell calls

00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:27,450
media groups National Statistics offices

00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:29,190
Civic tech hubs see a lot of them

00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:30,750
popping up all across the African region

00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:33,540
and they have the capabilities to either

00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:35,400
train or provide access to tools and

00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,720
resources that make it easy academic

00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,000
institutions to think about questions

00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,280
around the unique identifier that I just

00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,790
brought up so that's one way that we can

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,890
approach it internet access to

00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:49,290
affordable reliable internet is a big

00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:51,270
deal currently this is a report that

00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:54,440
recently came out from the Allies for

00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:58,500
affordable Internet and as you can see

00:18:54,440 --> 00:19:01,590
in 2015 to get access to one gigabyte of

00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:03,180
mobile data it's about 15% of an

00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:05,490
individual's income and that's

00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:06,630
ridiculous that's not affordable and the

00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:08,880
reason why this is important is for

00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:11,100
CSU's to tap into a lot of these tools

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,960
that it can use for data collection they

00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:15,240
need to afford internet if they can't

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,550
then it makes it extra complicated and

00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,930
the collaborative process github all

00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:24,300
these things that really make sense for

00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:25,860
them I'm so way forward for us at school

00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:28,290
of data open knowledge we are trying to

00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:30,780
build more tools that are contextualized

00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:33,180
to data collection for the civil society

00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:34,890
organizations so we have one two on

00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:36,540
mobile data collection that I shared

00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:38,070
with Webb in the beginning we're

00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:39,940
building more modules and we are

00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:41,500
interested in working with

00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:43,179
and organizations to build it so that

00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:46,690
it's easy for people to learn about the

00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:48,970
process and get jump into it I'm when

00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:50,879
bedding experts into organizations for

00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:53,200
three to four months to work with them

00:19:50,879 --> 00:19:55,360
it has to be different topics about data

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,450
collection and one of them teaching them

00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,980
the process slow paced doing the work

00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:02,740
for them but also showing them the value

00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:05,169
and how it's done and then obviously as

00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:07,600
I mentioned make internet affordable

00:20:05,169 --> 00:20:09,309
accessible so aligned for affordable

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,289
Internet is doing this but also a cool

00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:13,450
project is called break that is a device

00:20:11,289 --> 00:20:16,570
that makes it easy for you to connect

00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:19,269
several devices to this hub that gives

00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:20,889
you access to Internet and I think the

00:20:19,269 --> 00:20:22,419
last thing I want to share is like to

00:20:20,889 --> 00:20:24,279
document and share the experiences on

00:20:22,419 --> 00:20:26,759
the ground most of the time we ignore

00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:28,990
the low income context and make it seem

00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:30,490
unintentionally that it applies

00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:33,220
everywhere but we need to really think

00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:37,539
about this context and go to share

00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:39,970
skills that will apply to these so I'll

00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:43,570
end with this this is the cool that came

00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:44,980
from the world World Economic Forum

00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:46,899
reported I was talking about is civil

00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:48,490
society has a unique role in fostering

00:20:46,899 --> 00:20:50,500
innovations it has the ability to

00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:52,360
experiment move faster than governments

00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,370
and access and agents of change and

00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:56,110
let's empower them to do this thinking

00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:59,649
about the context that there are upin

00:20:56,110 --> 00:21:00,669
because in this time in this era they

00:20:59,649 --> 00:21:04,070
are going to play an increasing role

00:21:00,669 --> 00:21:10,369
also in reducing data thank you

00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:10,369
