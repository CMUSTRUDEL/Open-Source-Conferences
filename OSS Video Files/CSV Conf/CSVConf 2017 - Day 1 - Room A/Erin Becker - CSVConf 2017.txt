okay can everyone hear me okay it's a

00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,100
pretty small room but yes okay great so

00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,810
this is my first PSB comp I didn't know

00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:15,550
there was a cat theme it's a Portland

00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:17,230
thing or CSB Consing okay all right I'm

00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:19,510
glad to know that the dog lovers are

00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:22,240
also allowed to attend CSV calls oh so

00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:24,310
that's that's good so I'm really excited

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,840
to be here today I've never been to kind

00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:27,310
of this interdisciplinary type of

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,630
conference I'm really excited to have

00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:30,880
the opportunity to talk with all of you

00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:33,160
during the breaks I'm going to be

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,280
talking today about data and software

00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:38,590
carpentry and how we help empower people

00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,600
by teaching them software development

00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:42,070
skills and data analysis skills that

00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,989
they can be more efficient and more

00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:48,430
effective in their work and open up

00:00:43,989 --> 00:00:50,590
career options for themselves software

00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:53,610
data carpentry our nonprofit

00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:56,020
organizations we train people in

00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:59,170
software development and data science

00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:00,910
skills so that they can do the work that

00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:04,030
they need to do more efficiently and

00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:05,829
avoid doing repetitive error-prone tasks

00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:08,229
by hand I'll talk a little bit more

00:01:05,829 --> 00:01:12,340
about how we do that we also help build

00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:14,770
local communities to help people be able

00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:16,299
to continue learning these skills in a

00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:21,700
supportive network after they go through

00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:26,020
our workshops since 2014 we've led over

00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:28,000
850 workshops and taught over 17,000

00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:30,490
learners in every continent except

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,860
Antarctica so if anyone is doing

00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:34,960
research at McMurdo and would like to

00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:36,520
run a workshop please let us know we

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,650
would love to put that on our map and

00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:41,680
you can see that historically we've been

00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:43,420
localized in kind of a few regions but

00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,920
we're working on building our geographic

00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:48,640
spread and I'll talk more about that

00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:51,490
near the end of the talk okay so why do

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:56,439
we do what we do so software carpentry

00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:58,180
was formed in 1998 by Greg Wilson who at

00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:01,060
the time was a professor of computer

00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:04,060
science at the University of Toronto and

00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:06,070
he noticed that even graduating computer

00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:08,500
science students really didn't have the

00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:10,359
skill set that they needed to do

00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,340
software development in kind of an

00:02:10,359 --> 00:02:13,930
industry setting and didn't know the

00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,320
best practices that we're currently in

00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:18,670
use

00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:21,620
for software development and so he

00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:23,570
thought about this and realized that

00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,400
there's just really not good avenues for

00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:27,290
learning these skills in k-12 or at the

00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,080
University and we need to have some

00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:33,680
other way of training people in these

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,290
sorts of skills and since 1998 this is

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,920
obviously only become more important as

00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:41,570
we've built in to so many different

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,350
types of careers and different types of

00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:46,790
jobs the need for using any sort of

00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:48,860
computational skill whether it's

00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:51,560
software development or analyzing data

00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:57,490
of some type so many more jobs now than

00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:57,490
in 1998 require some of these skills so

00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:03,110
and this has also been recognized in

00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:05,210
report after report that comes out of

00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:07,040
NSF and similar reporting agencies so

00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:09,080
you can see that there's this

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,030
recognition that computational science

00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,670
and data science playing recently

00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:16,820
relevant roles start playing taking the

00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:22,220
important roles and that in a recent

00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:24,470
survey over 90 nearly 90% of PI's who

00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:28,450
were funded by the NSF reported that the

00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:31,340
biggest unmet need that they had was

00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:32,870
training training in how to integrate

00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:35,060
their data training and data management

00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:38,300
and that there's this growing data and

00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:40,040
knowledge gap and that we need to offer

00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:42,050
more support for computational training

00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:45,710
to people who are doing these sorts of

00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:47,420
work there's another survey out of the

00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:51,140
barn fanatics resource in Australia back

00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:52,730
in 2013 but asked their users what the

00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:55,160
biggest farm phonetics difficulty was

00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:57,170
and what they could do to help and the

00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,870
biggest brands maddox difficulty that

00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:01,820
people were facing by far was lack of

00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:04,760
expertise the lack of knowledge and how

00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:07,010
to conduct these types of analyses and

00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,440
training and the most useful things that

00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:11,960
could be done was was offer training and

00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:14,560
you'll notice that this far surpasses

00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:16,609
funding so it's not very often that

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,310
something is more important than funding

00:04:16,609 --> 00:04:21,530
but people recognize that the ability to

00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:23,000
do these types of things is the most

00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:25,160
limiting factor in the work that they're

00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,960
trying to do so the question then

00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,569
becomes

00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:31,000
as we're scaling up her ability to

00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:33,910
produce this data and as we're creating

00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,400
more and more jobs that require the use

00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:38,560
of these types of skills how do we also

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,630
scale the training how do we make more

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:44,680
and more people who have the skills to

00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:48,160
do these new types of jobs thus offering

00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:51,310
data carpentry tackle this by building

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:55,180
up communities for learning these skills

00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:58,900
we run hands-on intensive workshops

00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:01,840
where learners have many many

00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,190
opportunities to practice learning these

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,130
technologies I'll talk about which

00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:09,009
technologies in a little bit our

00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:11,160
workshops are all led by instructors who

00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:15,910
volunteer their time to work with us

00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:17,949
they go through a hands-on training in

00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:21,159
pedagogy and evidence-based teaching

00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:23,590
practices they all learn how the

00:05:21,159 --> 00:05:27,849
research says to teach computational

00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:29,500
skills I'll talk more about that we use

00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:30,970
lesson materials that are

00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,430
collaboratively developed by our

00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:36,370
community so they continuously improve

00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:38,710
and are continuously updated for use in

00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:41,590
our lessons they're also open anyone can

00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:44,349
use them for anything they want and we

00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:45,909
also work to to create and support local

00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:47,229
communities for people to continue

00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:49,870
learning after they go through our

00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:53,050
workshops so on talk a little bit more

00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:55,870
about how our workshops work they're

00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:59,349
generally two days and they're very full

00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:01,840
action-packed days they're extremely

00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:03,310
hands-on every learner has their laptop

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,750
and they're actively typing along with

00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:07,509
the instructor as they go through

00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:09,099
learning all of these things our

00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:12,490
instructors go through this training

00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:15,070
program that teaches them not just how

00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:18,190
to teach computational skills in general

00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:21,159
but also how to create a motivating

00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:23,860
environment how to be supportive how to

00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:26,860
deal with learner frustration how to

00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:29,770
create good assessments that will help

00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:31,930
learners assess their own knowledge and

00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:35,080
one of the things that we use in our

00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:36,969
workshops that is really simple but also

00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,600
gets people really excited is post-it

00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:41,850
notes so anyone here been to software

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,860
workshop okay raise your hand if you

00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:45,480
love post-it notes yes

00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,610
everybody has been a software Dedecker

00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:51,540
free workshop loves post-it notes and

00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:53,280
these are used by our learners in the

00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:55,410
workshops to signal to the instructors

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,750
when they're having trouble and then the

00:06:55,410 --> 00:07:00,630
instructors can send over what we call

00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:02,610
helpers who are people who haven't gone

00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:04,770
through instructor training but are out

00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:06,840
their workshops and can offer more

00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:08,610
one-on-one interaction with individual

00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,080
learners and if you're interested in

00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:11,640
learning more about how we post it notes

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,830
you should read this blog post I wrote

00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:16,880
about post-it notes and how awesome they

00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:20,430
are and I also talked a little bit about

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,930
the importance in our part of creating a

00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:24,060
friendly learning environments all of

00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:27,090
our instructors go through training on

00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:29,400
how to be supportive and how to avoid

00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:30,900
using dismissive language which can be a

00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,900
real barrier when people are trying to

00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:37,670
learn technical skills and we know that

00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:41,220
we can't teach everything in two days

00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:44,220
but what we try to do instead is give

00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,570
people a beginning toolkit a set of

00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,520
tools that they can use the minute they

00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:50,460
walk out the door that they can apply in

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,220
their own research or work and this

00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:55,530
helps reduce the barrier for them for

00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:58,560
further learning we also try to give

00:07:55,530 --> 00:08:00,750
them skills that they can manage errors

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,870
in their own work how do you how do you

00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:05,010
deal with coming across error messages

00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,750
how do you deal with reading

00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:08,130
documentation those are the skills that

00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:11,850
you really need in order to continue

00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:14,460
learning and we also try to give them a

00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:18,600
preview of what possible to motivate

00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:19,850
them to learn these these tools so talk

00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:23,010
a little bit more about our curriculum

00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:25,620
software carpentry focuses on best

00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:28,140
practices for software development they

00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:32,030
are domain agnostic in the sense that

00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:34,169
all of the workshops are intended to be

00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:35,669
applicable to learners in all different

00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:36,960
fields as long as they're doing some

00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:40,440
sort of software development practice

00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:43,110
they focus on teaching command line

00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,510
through the UNIX shell version control

00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:47,890
with git and github so that learners can

00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:50,890
manage their projects and

00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:52,810
have to have things like CSV console is

00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:57,310
it gives me comfort in three Portland

00:08:52,810 --> 00:09:01,510
copy and they also do some some

00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:04,360
programming in either Python or our data

00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:07,779
carpentry at data carpentry we are

00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:10,120
focused on teaching people how to work

00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:12,040
effectively with the data that they have

00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,510
and because data is highly

00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,820
contextualized that means that our

00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:19,120
lessons are more domain-specific so we

00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:22,690
choose data set that learners can relate

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,279
to that they will see the connections to

00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:25,899
their own work so that the tools that

00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:29,350
they learn they can immediately start

00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:31,990
applying to their own research we teach

00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:35,709
how to how to organize your data how to

00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:37,720
clean your data in reproducible ways and

00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:40,630
also do data analysis and visualization

00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:43,089
with again either R or Python and we

00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:46,480
actually just yesterday had our first

00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:49,930
official lesson release of our ecology

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,220
based workshops which are actually even

00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:53,260
though they use an ecology data set

00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,550
there are most generalized workshop in

00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:57,850
that they can be used with anyone who

00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:59,680
uses tabular type data sets so that

00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:01,449
button for publication just got pushed

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:05,740
yesterday so I'm very excited about that

00:10:01,449 --> 00:10:07,029
and I'll talk more about our lesson

00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:12,880
development as we get to the end of the

00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:14,589
talk so that's our curriculum but our

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,980
workshop goals don't just focus on

00:10:14,589 --> 00:10:19,660
teaching a specific set of tools because

00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:22,089
we recognize that the tools are going to

00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:25,089
change right and people need to learn

00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:30,160
how to learn new tools as they go about

00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:33,699
their work so really we teach people how

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:38,320
to build their confidence in learning

00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:41,140
these types of tools we know that a lack

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,610
of confidence is really the one of the

00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:46,209
most important factors in determining

00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:49,449
whether people continue to persevere and

00:10:46,209 --> 00:10:52,180
learning a new skill so we teach self

00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:54,880
confidence we teach error management how

00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:56,170
to get yourself out of problems when

00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,449
you're you're learning new technical

00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:00,740
skills and we also help encourage people

00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:04,310
to continue learning by building up

00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:09,170
a community and having a very positive

00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:11,360
learning experience the instructors that

00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:14,810
we train go through a two-day training

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:17,149
program it's focused on pedagogical

00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:19,160
techniques we don't teach get we don't

00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:20,870
teach show we don't teach are in our

00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,700
instructor training we expect our

00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:25,760
instructors to come in knowing the

00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:27,680
skills that they'll be teaching but we

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,330
teach them how to do formative

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,430
assessment and we teach them how to use

00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:37,839
motivating language and we teach them

00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:41,209
how to how to give good interactive

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,560
lessons we have over 900 instructors

00:11:41,209 --> 00:11:44,510
that we've trained again on six

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,430
continents if anyone's working and I've

00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:51,020
been working in Antartica please let us

00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:53,720
know our curriculum like I said before

00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:55,790
is collaboratively developed all of our

00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,800
900 instructors at some point or another

00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:59,899
have contributed to one of our lessons

00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:03,440
it's actually a requirement for becoming

00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:04,730
an instructor and then of course once

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,040
they're done with their instructor

00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:08,270
trainings they often go on to continue

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,990
to be involved with curriculum

00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:13,370
development and this ensures that the

00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:15,740
lessons are not only continuously

00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:17,839
improved but also stay up to date with

00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:20,500
changes in the tools and changes in what

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:24,260
people are actually using in their work

00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:25,940
so our curriculum I think is really

00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:28,279
great but the most important thing I

00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:30,800
think about software and data carpentry

00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:34,399
is the community that we've built up so

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:37,160
we have a very active community of

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:39,290
instructors and curriculum developers

00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:42,079
and other people who are involved who

00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:44,060
are excited about sharing software

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:46,520
development skills and data skills and

00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:49,640
we have different avenues that these

00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:51,920
people interact and so for example we

00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,570
run a mentoring program that helps on

00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,060
board our new instructors and get them

00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:58,880
integrated into the community helps them

00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:00,410
plan their first workshop and helps them

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,029
go through the curriculum and make sure

00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:04,279
that they're comfortable with all the

00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:06,980
steps in the workshops with their

00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:08,900
teaching we run weekly discussion groups

00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:11,089
where instructors all around the world

00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,620
get together virtually and discuss

00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:13,680
lessons that they've learned from

00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,620
teaching and they

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:19,460
and tricks and those are always really

00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:23,640
really fun to lead and to be a part of

00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:26,460
we also run monthly community calls that

00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:28,470
are focused on issues relevant to our

00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:31,080
community so we just had a community

00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:32,430
call about our windows installer which I

00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,959
actually wasn't part of but apparently

00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:37,649
it was a big controversy about which

00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:39,149
windows installer we use so there was a

00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:42,720
great really productive community call

00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:45,779
about that we also have a very active

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,399
email list that people talk about the

00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:51,720
tools and technologies they talk about

00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:54,120
job opportunities and also instructors

00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,370
our instructors often travel to other

00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,810
institutions to teach so they told us

00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:00,020
that this helps them build up their

00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:01,560
network and helps them get a lot of

00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:03,570
connections with those other

00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:06,959
institutions and brought in their career

00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:08,339
paths you might be thinking well that

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,779
sounds really cool but how do we know

00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:12,480
that we're actually having any impact on

00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:14,399
our learners so we've done both short

00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,890
term so immediately after the workshop

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,200
and long term at least six months after

00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:22,830
you take a workshop follow up surveys

00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:25,110
but give us evidence that the learners

00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:26,459
are not only learning the skills but

00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:28,230
they're putting them into practice and

00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:29,790
they're continuing to learn them after

00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:36,630
the workshop and I'll show a little bit

00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:37,890
of that data but first and this is

00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:41,610
really important people actually like

00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:42,959
the workshops so people tell us that the

00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:44,190
workshop was worth their time and that

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,850
they would recommend this workshop to a

00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,800
friend or colleague

00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:48,900
which is great it means our workshops

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:52,050
are always booked up within a couple of

00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:54,029
days of opening and there's a really

00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:56,790
high demand and people really enjoy

00:14:54,029 --> 00:15:00,600
coming coming to the workshop but beyond

00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:03,690
that they actually tell us that they use

00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:06,450
the tools after they go out of the

00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:09,899
workshop so on the left you'll see

00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:10,950
people self-ratings their use of the

00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:14,190
tools that we teach in the workshop

00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:16,020
before and six months after and you'll

00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:19,350
see that a greater proportion of them

00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:22,650
use them daily or weekly and did before

00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:26,040
the workshop they also tell us that

00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:26,970
they're more confident in using the

00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:30,899
tools and more

00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:33,300
wouldn't means more willing to learn so

00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:35,430
that that's really important if we

00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,660
weren't affecting their confidence even

00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:39,480
if we were teaching them a small set of

00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:42,269
tools they wouldn't be able to learn

00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,889
more tools as they go forward so I think

00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:45,350
the confidence that is even more

00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:48,149
important

00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:49,680
people love our instructors so this is

00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:52,560
just a word cloud of their instructor

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,720
ratings you can see that they say they

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,470
really do love our instructors and I

00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:01,170
think that's great

00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:02,160
so they've done Likert data so explain a

00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:06,629
little bit about how to read this

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:08,910
graphic on the right hand side or agree

00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:10,740
or strongly agree to Likert scale items

00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:13,079
on the left is disagree or strongly

00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,730
disagree and so you can see that at

00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:18,689
least six months after the workshop and

00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:20,550
longer people are very positively rating

00:16:18,689 --> 00:16:22,560
the atmosphere of the workshop the

00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:25,079
utility of the material that was in the

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,019
workshop they still would recommend us

00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:29,699
to a friend that's the third one down

00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:32,970
they've learned great useful skills it

00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:34,410
was worth their time and and there was

00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:38,220
great information provided at the

00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:40,920
workshop so that's a little bit of an

00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:42,480
overview about what we've done so far I

00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:45,089
want to spend just a minute talking

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,980
about where we're headed in the future

00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:50,639
what the next steps are for our

00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:54,029
community one of the things that we're

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:57,269
working to do more is supporting

00:16:54,029 --> 00:17:00,029
learners after they finish workshops so

00:16:57,269 --> 00:17:02,540
we have some communities that have

00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:04,709
really built up these great

00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:07,079
organizations where they get together

00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:09,449
every week or every month and continue

00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:11,189
learning the skills that were presented

00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:13,110
in the workshop and we haven't built

00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:15,209
that at scale yet but we're really

00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:17,130
hoping to be able to develop a pathway

00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:18,480
to help people build those local

00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:21,150
communities and continue to support

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,860
their learners we're also expanding our

00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:25,470
mentorship program to include more

00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:28,470
individualized one-on-one mentoring so

00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:29,700
we launched a mentoring program a couple

00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:31,169
of months ago now and people are

00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,120
reporting really good outcomes from that

00:17:31,169 --> 00:17:36,570
so we'll have some data for that to

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:39,090
follow up in a few months we are working

00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:41,490
to expand our disciplinary reach

00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:44,399
so I told you we just published our

00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:46,049
ecology materials we have a genomics

00:17:44,399 --> 00:17:48,659
workshop that we offer

00:17:46,049 --> 00:17:50,970
it's currently in the process of

00:17:48,659 --> 00:17:52,409
becoming officially published we're

00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:54,240
hoping for that in the next couple of

00:17:52,409 --> 00:17:55,769
months and then towards the end of the

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,360
year and going into the beginning of

00:17:55,769 --> 00:18:00,330
next year we're hoping to also publish

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:02,820
our geospatial data workshop and a

00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:05,309
social sciences workshop which is in

00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:07,350
active development now and then I

00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:10,259
mentioned briefly that we were working

00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:12,899
to expand our geographic reach so the

00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:15,749
two areas that were actively working to

00:18:12,899 --> 00:18:17,940
grow in we've run a couple of instructor

00:18:15,749 --> 00:18:20,399
training events in South Africa which

00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:22,740
served instructors from a number of

00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:26,340
southern Africa countries and we're now

00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:29,549
working to develop partnerships and run

00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:34,440
workshops in 11 countries in Africa over

00:18:29,549 --> 00:18:36,299
the next year we also are looking to

00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,740
expand in Latin America so it'd be very

00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:39,299
excited to talk with anyone who has

00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:43,710
connections with communities in Latin

00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:46,769
America as we continue to grow alright

00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:47,850
so this end was a little quote so

00:18:46,769 --> 00:18:50,759
there's a quote that says if you want to

00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:53,549
go fast go alone but if you want to go

00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:54,990
far go together and so we try to do it

00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:57,169
software and data carpentry and I think

00:18:54,990 --> 00:19:00,419
we do really well is we help people

00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:03,059
continue their learning journey by

00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:05,549
building up a supportive community so

00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:08,299
that we all have that support and build

00:19:05,549 --> 00:19:10,769
that confidence to continue our learning

00:19:08,299 --> 00:19:12,450
so the next question you should have is

00:19:10,769 --> 00:19:14,490
how do I bring software carpentry to my

00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:16,409
institution so I'd be happy to talk to

00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:17,999
you about that Tracy the executive

00:19:16,409 --> 00:19:20,220
director of data carpentry is also here

00:19:17,999 --> 00:19:21,600
Tracy can you wave so either one of us

00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,190

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,990
workshop or instructor training going at

00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:27,480
