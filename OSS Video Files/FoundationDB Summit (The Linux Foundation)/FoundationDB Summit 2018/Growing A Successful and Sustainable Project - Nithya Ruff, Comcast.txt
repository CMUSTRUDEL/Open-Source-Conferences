Title: Growing A Successful and Sustainable Project - Nithya Ruff, Comcast
Publication date: 2018-12-14
Playlist: FoundationDB Summit 2018
Description: 
	The basis for many open source projects is to solve a problem and deliver value.  But the growth and adoption comes from the way the project is setup for positive governance, community growth and sustainability.  Nithya will talk about the elements needed to set up a community for growth and opening doors to new contributors.

so what I'd like to share is what does

00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:09,050
it take to take all this energy and this

00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:11,940
positivity that we have today as a

00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:13,769
brand-new project and how do we sustain

00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,740
it how do we make sure that this project

00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:19,109
is here 10 years from now 15 years from

00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:22,710
now and that it's successful and it's a

00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:25,500
thriving community and my name is nithya

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:28,320
ruff I'm a mother

00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,939
technology strategist for Comcast I run

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,570
the open source program office at

00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:37,469
Comcast I consider myself a pragmatist

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:39,000
and not you know pure idealist on one

00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:42,989
side or the other and and that's

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,059
important in shaping my talk I'm really

00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:47,280
passionate about the fact that companies

00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:50,399
should really work outside of their

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,500
sphere to innovate and not just you know

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,140
inside the company innovation comes from

00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,510
everywhere an open source in fact allows

00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:01,079
us to collaborate and innovate with

00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:03,719
people all over the world I advocate for

00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,519
inclusion in technology in various

00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:09,570
forums I sit on the board of the Linux

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:12,450
Foundation and represent diversity I I

00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:15,560
consider myself a woman of color she

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:18,930
heard that's the classification I go by

00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,939
so let me get to my talk after

00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,680
introducing myself and Dave luster thank

00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:26,310
you so much for inviting me it's

00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:29,460
fantastic to be here so my question to

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:33,990
all of you is is organic growth of a

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:36,979
project good for a project and what I

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:40,829
mean is you know sometimes we think

00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:42,720
organic natural it's good you know

00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:44,970
there's nothing added it's not

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,950
manipulated it's not changed it's not

00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:50,189
planned it just grows by itself

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:52,710
naturally and that's a good thing I

00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:56,040
contend that for food maybe it is a good

00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:57,540
thing right because on organic food for

00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,579
the most part I think most of us will

00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,530
say organic food is a good thing it's

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:05,189
pure it's clean in its unadulterated

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:08,160
it's untouched and it's healthy but I

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:10,920
also contend that organic open source is

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,319
yet another thing and perhaps it's not

00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:16,349
so good to have organic Oh

00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:18,689
source and what I mean by that is just

00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:22,349
letting open source kind of grow by

00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:24,599
itself project for example without you

00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:28,439
know some amount of thought and care and

00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:31,489
intention and and many times we have

00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:34,650
very long held beliefs in open source

00:02:31,489 --> 00:02:36,659
that really hinder us from growing a

00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,900
project or sustaining a project

00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:43,109
successfully we often get trapped by our

00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:45,329
own thinking and we tend to think you

00:02:43,109 --> 00:02:47,879
know if it's good it'll just grow by

00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:49,709
itself so I'd like to kind of challenge

00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:52,859
some of those myths that we all believe

00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:55,680
in not all of you maybe but some people

00:02:52,859 --> 00:02:58,109
do and and then kind of talk about what

00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,760
it really takes to be a successful

00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:05,189
project to sustain a successful project

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,230
so one of the myths that we all tend to

00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:09,829
some sense sometimes subscribe is that

00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:13,409
if they build if we build they will come

00:03:09,829 --> 00:03:15,719
that if we build a good project that you

00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:18,269
know people will discover it people will

00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:20,250
flock to it will start using it and it

00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:22,829
starts kind of organically growing and

00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:25,530
it becomes magical and it you know just

00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:28,259
grows perhaps it was true you know about

00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:29,519
15 20 years ago in the beginning days of

00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:32,069
open source when there were very very

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,250
few projects right and you know all of

00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:37,949
us have heard the famous story of

00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:40,019
leanness is email and you know the world

00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:42,299
kind of said okay we'll get involved in

00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:45,239
linux and soon you know linux became a

00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:48,060
big big project but it's not always the

00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:50,939
case today for example there are about

00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:53,250
seventy two million repos just on github

00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:55,889
and then you know i haven't even looked

00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:58,979
into SourceForge and get lab and other

00:03:55,889 --> 00:04:00,810
places so when you have this kind of

00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:04,079
paradox of choice and then there'll be

00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:05,669
hundreds of database projects alone many

00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:08,699
different libraries for doing a certain

00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:10,829
thing and you kind of then say gosh how

00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:13,049
the heck do we communicate to someone

00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:15,269
that we are here especially as a

00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:17,849
brand-new project and how do we make

00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:20,190
sure that people get involved whether as

00:04:17,849 --> 00:04:24,150
users or as contributors or committers

00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:26,320
etc so what happens is today it no

00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:29,050
longer is sufficient to

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,930
create a project and tell your friends

00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:34,240
and then you know it takes off you have

00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:36,670
to create awareness in fact marketing

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,150
has become quite a science now in

00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:42,040
open-source you've got to create a brand

00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:44,620
awareness for the project you've got to

00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:47,020
tweet you've got to have blogs you've

00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:49,600
got to go speak at conferences you've

00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:51,940
got to have of course a logo and you've

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,760
got to have stickers and you know all of

00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:57,670
that good stuff and and and that's what

00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,350
it takes these days to go out and

00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:02,980
actually create a Venice for your

00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:05,290
project the second thing one often hears

00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:07,840
is that open-source is quite different

00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:09,780
you know planning is for companies

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,330
planning is for commercial projects

00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:16,260
open-source needs to be natural and

00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:20,650
organic and you know goodness and

00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:23,170
sometimes we tend to think that it's it

00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:26,470
doesn't need the kind of intention or

00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:29,710
planning that projects in the company

00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:31,840
and commercial space do the key

00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:34,420
questions though when you that you would

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,540
ask an open source and in commercial

00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:41,680
projects is often the same every project

00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:44,560
needs to have a goal every project needs

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,260
to ask why do we exist what problem are

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,600
we solving who cares about this

00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:53,530
particular problem and how do we then

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,390
reach that target audience and you know

00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:58,660
how do we welcome this target audience

00:05:55,390 --> 00:06:00,580
and you also need to ask a bunch of

00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:03,160
other questions what kind of license to

00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:05,890
be used because what kind of behavior

00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:08,860
are we looking for from our contributors

00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:09,970
and from our developers that want to get

00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:13,050
engaged in this program

00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:16,180
do we want to CLA or not what kind of

00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:18,940
legal documents we do we need for this

00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:21,670
project and very often in the early days

00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:25,090
of open source many developers were

00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:27,940
quite well-versed in licenses and

00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:30,460
licensing information but today we often

00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:33,160
don't spend time learning about licenses

00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:35,560
or you know what the intent of each

00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:38,320
license is and what kind of behaviors it

00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,310
can create you know if I use a GPL what

00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,310
happens if I you

00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:44,650
and apache2 what happens what do I want

00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:47,680
do I want corporate developers getting

00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:49,120
involved or do I want contributions back

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,520
into the project they don't want

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:55,060
contributions to be you know hidden away

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,620
by people who make the changes so you

00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:02,110
got to think through some of this before

00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:04,690
you launch a project and you also have a

00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:07,330
choice these days in the early days of

00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:10,510
open-source projects were often you know

00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:13,420
standalone and today you have the

00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:15,640
benefit of foundations you have the

00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:17,230
Apache foundation you have the club's

00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:19,150
foundation you have the software freedom

00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:21,970
Conservancy you have the Linux

00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:24,360
Foundation you have multiple homes for

00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:28,300
these projects to be housed in and

00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:30,880
projects in the foundations often get an

00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:33,610
umbrella of benefits whether it's legal

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:37,410
advice or business development marketing

00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:38,530
or events or other kinds of support and

00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:41,170
sustainance

00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:44,740
and more importantly it gets a neutral

00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:46,660
home for instance when I look at some of

00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:49,660
the projects that we've created at

00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:51,490
Comcast there are pros and cons to

00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:55,510
hosting it ourselves at the Comcast

00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:57,190
github i/o and then sometimes it makes a

00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:58,630
lot more sense for us to host it at the

00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:01,210
Apache foundation or the Linux

00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:03,640
Foundation and we've often done that

00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:06,400
because we wanted to provide a neutral

00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:09,970
home we wanted to make it grow you know

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:12,970
differently and sometimes you know the

00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:16,500
company a single company glow may not be

00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:19,120
beneficial for for the project itself

00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:22,480
the third myth that I often come across

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,940
is good coders will you know figure

00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,830
things out you don't need any onboarding

00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:29,980
you don't need any documentation you

00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:31,630
don't need any help and this used to

00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:33,670
happen particularly in the embedded

00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:37,750
space I used to be in the embedded space

00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:39,940
I worked in the octo project and Yocto

00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,980
is a distribution builder that allows

00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:44,350
people to build their own custom

00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:47,950
distributions and we often used to say

00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:49,600
hey you know if he's not smart enough or

00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:51,520
if she's not smart enough to figure this

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,090
out then they don't deserve to be in the

00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,540
project

00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:57,160
and you know they don't need any

00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:59,710
documentation they can figure this out

00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:02,500
and maybe it was right in those days

00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:06,220
when you know the pool of developers was

00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:08,140
very little but today you find that

00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,420
there are a couple of different reasons

00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:13,770
why you need to make sure that you have

00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:17,650
good onboarding good documentation good

00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:21,970
structure for the project one you often

00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:24,700
find that 75% of projects on github have

00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:26,200
one or less maintained errs and and

00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,360
often these maintained errs are bearing

00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,640
the burden of the entire project and

00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:33,250
they're often burning out and they have

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:36,190
no help and they have no support and if

00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:37,870
they choose to leave or god forbid you

00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:40,779
know you think about the bus problem

00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:44,140
right they get hit by a bus then what do

00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:46,240
you do and you do need to make sure that

00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:48,610
you have succession planning and you

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,300
have at least different roles in the

00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:54,339
project and you have people working on

00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:57,490
you know maintaining the project beyond

00:09:54,339 --> 00:09:59,710
the main maintainer the main person who

00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:02,890
started the project so that's one very

00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:05,670
very big reason why you need to create

00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:07,390
documentation create structure create

00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:10,540
standardization of you know what's

00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:12,970
happening in the project the second is a

00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:15,070
lot of new industries are coming into

00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:18,610
open source these days finance

00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:20,410
healthcare even us from a media and

00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:23,620
entertainment perspective via recent

00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:27,339
entrants into open source and in the

00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:29,320
last 10-15 years so you find that a lot

00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:32,920
of new people and then new college

00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:35,350
students coming out also I find that a

00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:37,540
lot of us if you are underrepresented in

00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:40,780
open source in the past and you're now

00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:43,780
entering open source you struggle to get

00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:46,480
through a project because some projects

00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:49,360
are just not documented well they're

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,920
just not welcoming and if we are to grow

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,900
open source and if we are to sustain

00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:55,630
open source and if we are to continue to

00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:58,150
have you know people enter this business

00:10:55,630 --> 00:11:00,610
and this you know culture that we've

00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:03,130
created we do need to make sure that

00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:05,490
it's easy and welcoming and it's well

00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:05,490
documented

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:15,640
the next myth that I often hear and this

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:19,780
is happening a lot which is you know

00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:21,670
open source is not necessarily the right

00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:24,400
place for me to solve security

00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:27,640
reliability and scalability issues its

00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:29,740
it'll be done by the user you know when

00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:32,260
they start using it they'll do the

00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:33,850
testing they'll do the patching then

00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:37,210
they'll work and make sure that it's

00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:39,790
scalable in their organization and very

00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:41,500
often we kind of say you know it's only

00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:44,260
necessary for us to work on the

00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:46,170
functionality and then the users can

00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:49,440
worry about you know all of these things

00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:52,660
but it's not necessarily true anymore

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:55,150
you find that as we use open source from

00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:58,210
abroad broadly we need to really build

00:11:55,150 --> 00:12:00,970
in more security into open source and

00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:03,430
best practices around reliability and

00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:06,310
scale upfront and cannot be an

00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:09,700
afterthought in fact some projects have

00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:12,720
been born in data centers such as

00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:16,450
Facebook's data center or Comcast's or

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:19,350
say googles and then released into the

00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:21,640
open and they come with some of those

00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:24,640
prerequisites built in because they've

00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:27,250
been tested and tried in the data

00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:30,480
centers of those organizations so it

00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:34,180
really is important that organizations

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:37,120
especially projects take on some of

00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:39,430
these some of this work in up front

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:43,840
rather than leaving it for users to do

00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:45,760
and you find that you know foundations

00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:48,370
like the Linux Foundation for example

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,830
has started projects like the core

00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:54,130
infrastructure initiative whose job it

00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:57,160
is to create best practices for security

00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:58,690
and also to review security practices

00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,690
for projects that are under their

00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:04,060
umbrella and to help them to create

00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:05,740
better practices and to they also do

00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:08,440
badging they do reviews of your

00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:11,050
practices etc so there is help there for

00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:16,750
projects to build this into their

00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:19,000
projects this one is often also cited

00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:22,150
that open source is really

00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,860
about people who are serious about

00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:26,770
solving a problem it's about passion

00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:28,210
it's about enthusiasm and that if you

00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:31,000
build too much structure too much

00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:33,970
process too much planning that it kills

00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,930
it and that you know open source to grow

00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:39,670
should be left alone on the other hand

00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:43,060
some of the successful projects have

00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:46,180
seen including the conference namesake

00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:48,160
which is kubernetes really was created

00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:51,310
with a lot of structure and planning in

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,590
mind including you know different groups

00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:56,410
sub groups and the community and how the

00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:58,780
communication will take place and how it

00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:01,330
will scale and you know how planning

00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:04,090
happens how commercial companies will

00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:07,120
use it and and then mirror in open

00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:09,880
source um you know vice versa etc and so

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,010
when you have structure it it actually

00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,660
allows for more improvisation and it

00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:16,210
allows for more experimentation because

00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:17,590
some things are codified some things I

00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:20,710
documented some things are well

00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:23,620
understood and so you can actually play

00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:28,600
with it change it modify it and and keep

00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:31,270
moving it forward as needed good

00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:35,410
projects live forever and this is

00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:37,900
something that I've heard also or we

00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:40,120
don't even remember you know that

00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,740
projects have a life cycle and projects

00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:44,530
have you know a certain amount of time

00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:46,990
that they live or they need some

00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:49,330
intervention in between and we just kind

00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:51,370
of you know give birth to the project

00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:53,850
and then just think that it'll grow and

00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:57,550
it'll keep you know moving forward and

00:14:53,850 --> 00:15:00,670
what I find is that projects actually go

00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:03,820
through a life cycle there's a launch

00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:07,510
period where you have to do a great deal

00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:09,250
of awareness building perhaps a lot of

00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:11,920
course correction adjustment you're

00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:15,580
putting some initial components in place

00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:17,530
you know governance etc and then it goes

00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:20,020
through a commercialization period where

00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:21,970
perhaps you know companies are using it

00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,440
companies are basing their commercial

00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:26,650
products upon it there's a commercial

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:29,020
ecosystem that's developing around it it

00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:32,080
becomes a much more thriving community

00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:32,860
and this is often one of the peaks where

00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,620
the

00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:37,960
the project is extremely popular and

00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:40,390
then it starts going down in terms of

00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:43,930
you know it is reached everywhere it

00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:46,780
needs to reach and it's gotten a lot of

00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:48,940
traction and it's more in the sustaining

00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:50,560
and the maintaining mode and the kind of

00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:52,360
activities during the sustaining and

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,860
maintaining mode are quite different

00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,440
than you would do during

00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:58,180
commercialization or launch you probably

00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,690
reduce your marketing you're probably

00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:04,120
doing more case studies you're probably

00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:07,360
you know doing more to kind of continue

00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:09,250
the momentum of this project and things

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,140
of that nature and then there's the

00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:13,600
sunset mode where you actually put the

00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:15,460
you know the project to bed because

00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,890
perhaps there's a newer and better

00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:20,200
project that's come into being but you

00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:21,790
still need to worry about all of the

00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:24,790
users who are dependent upon the project

00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:26,880
how do I make sure that they can still

00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:30,430
continue to use it but that we are not

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:32,830
spending so much time and money you know

00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:36,190
maintaining this project because it now

00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:40,240
is is self-sustaining and it just needs

00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:42,490
you know minimal support and work what

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,350
you learn from this really what I have

00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:47,350
learned least is that project

00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:50,050
sustainability really requires intent

00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:53,440
and it also requires goals it requires

00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:55,990
constant monitoring of where you are and

00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:59,590
which phase of the project and what you

00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:02,260
need to do to make it go successfully or

00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:04,000
you need to provide the right level of

00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:08,980
support for the right phase of the

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,680
project so I know I'm going much faster

00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:15,430
than I expected Dave so that I'll give

00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:18,280
you guys some time back it's really in

00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:20,500
tension and planning that's needed in

00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:23,980
order to sustain and grow open source

00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:26,830
it's not just beliefs it's not just you

00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:31,060
know give birth to it and then it'll

00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:32,350
just grow by itself we do need to market

00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:36,790
a project

00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:40,510
you cannot just you know let it sit on a

00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:42,850
github in among 72 million repos you

00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:44,170
need to have a strategy you need to

00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:46,390
understand what the goal of the project

00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:49,210
is who it needs to reach how it

00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:51,460
to reach them you know whether it's a

00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:54,520
small project or it's meant to be

00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:57,130
ubiquitous and reach as many people as

00:17:54,520 --> 00:18:00,070
possible the kinds of users it needs to

00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:03,400
reach we do need to worry about culture

00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:06,250
everything from how we onboard people

00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:09,820
how we make the project more inviting

00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:12,940
more inclusive to how we communicate how

00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:14,410
we are transparent in the project to who

00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:17,770
takes care of the project what the

00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:20,340
succession plan for the project is and

00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:23,650
the culture becomes extremely important

00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:25,570
and you know best practices there are a

00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:28,420
lot of best practices for scalability

00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:30,790
reliability and security and we need to

00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:32,740
adopt those as a project you don't need

00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:34,480
to invent everything yourself you don't

00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:36,760
need to create everything yourself but

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:40,320
you do need to follow those practices

00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:43,840
and frankly if you have a good structure

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:47,230
of the main core elements of the project

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:49,630
then it becomes easier to improvise its

00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:51,760
it becomes easier to transition the

00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:54,910
project to other maintained errs and

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:57,940
developers and it also allows us to

00:18:54,910 --> 00:19:01,360
sustain the project if we have a good

00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:05,290
plan in place for the various phases of

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:07,720
a project when I look at foundation DB

00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:10,990
and I just did a very quick look at

00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:13,660
foundation DB I find that you guys have

00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:17,200
put a really fantastic you know plan in

00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:19,180
place and there is a real commitment to

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,000
community over code and I think that's

00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:23,950
that's really terrific because at the

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,470
end of the day a project is made up of

00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:28,810
people and people are the ones who

00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:31,630
create code and people are the ones who

00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:34,060
create innovation and if we take care of

00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:36,100
the people then good code follows and I

00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:38,140
think that's a great practice that the

00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:40,210
Apache foundation speaks very

00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:41,020
passionately about and and I'm a big

00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:43,750
believer in that

00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:46,150
I love the fact that you guys have a

00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:49,390
great code of conduct and code of

00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:52,030
conduct is not to discourage people but

00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:54,610
it's mainly to say this is how we'll

00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:56,470
conduct ourselves as a as a team this is

00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:59,290
we will be very respectful of each other

00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:00,310
and we will be inclusive of people in

00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:03,220
this project

00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:05,410
and and this kind of a summit where

00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:07,300
people can come face-to-face and talk to

00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:10,180
each other develop relationships is so

00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:12,520
so important because we often are

00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:15,730
working remotely we are often working on

00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:18,090
email and so I find that when I come to

00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:20,890
one of these events and I have a

00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:22,900
relationship that's built on meeting the

00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:26,440
person looking at them eye to eye or

00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:28,210
having a meal together it's often so

00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:31,510
much easier to get work done remotely

00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:33,100
then if I never knew the person and I

00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:36,340
just have to deal with them you know

00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:37,810
remotely all the time I love the fact

00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,880
that there are so many communication

00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:42,460
forums and it's transparent and it's

00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,560
laid out nicely and you've provided for

00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:47,590
structure you provided for tools you've

00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:49,240
provided for ways for teams to engage on

00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:52,450
the foundation level as well as the

00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:56,710
add-on levels I like the fact that it's

00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:59,980
in a neutral home and you know while yes

00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:03,460
Apple is is the big benefactor behind

00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:06,100
the project it's nice to know that it'll

00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:07,990
be sustained and it it's ongoing and

00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:11,560
that you know everyone can get involved

00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:13,630
in the project and I think you guys

00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,610
chose to do a light governance to begin

00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:18,130
with which which makes sense because

00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:20,620
you're saying I don't know which way

00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:22,540
it'll go and what else we need to put in

00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:24,700
place so we'll start with the light

00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:28,750
governance and then we'll add and change

00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:31,450
as needed and as we move forward and you

00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:33,220
know being on github and and providing

00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:36,250
some of the tools and some of the other

00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:39,940
documentation the are the onboarding

00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:42,220
guide etc is is fantastic so I thought

00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:44,560
that you guys have already put a lot of

00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:47,500
great elements in place to create a

00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:50,800
sustaining and a successful project and

00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:52,090
just to kind of end the talk if you want

00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,610
to look at some of the projects that

00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:58,000
we've put together it's at Comcast at

00:21:54,610 --> 00:22:01,570
github do we've hosted some there and

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,480
some we've kind of donated to Apache and

00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:07,960
then some sit you know outside of the

00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:11,290
company again to kind of see where is

00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:13,420
the best home for the project and you

00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:13,660
can see what we're doing from an open

00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:18,460
sore

00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:20,830
perspective at that place and those are

00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:22,870
some of the attributions in and I hope

00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:25,660
I've given you some some of my thoughts

00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:28,210
around why some of the organic

00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:30,520
mechanisms that we often believe in on

00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:32,830
some of the beliefs that we have are not

00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:35,320
always the right ones and that we need

00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:37,300
to actually do planning actually

00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:40,570
understand goals actually understand

00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:45,480
intention when we want to create a

00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:45,480
successful project thank you

00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:50,190
