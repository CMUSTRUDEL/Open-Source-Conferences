Title: FoundationDB Document Layer - Bhaskar Muppana, Apple
Publication date: 2018-12-14
Playlist: FoundationDB Summit 2018
Description: 
	Document Layer is a stateless micro server on top of FoundationDB that allows management of JSON documents at large scale. It exposes the traits of FoundationDB through document data model, such as fully ordered documents, consistent indexes and serializable transactions. It does all this while maintaining wire compatibility with MongoDB® API. As the compatibility is done at wire level, existing MongoDB® tools and drivers work seem less. In this talk, we explore how FoundationDB core strengths play well together with Document data model to make it easier to use and reliable database.
