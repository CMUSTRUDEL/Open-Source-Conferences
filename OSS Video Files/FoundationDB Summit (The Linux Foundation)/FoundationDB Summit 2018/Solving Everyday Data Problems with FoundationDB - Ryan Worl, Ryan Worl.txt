Title: Solving Everyday Data Problems with FoundationDB - Ryan Worl, Ryan Worl
Publication date: 2018-12-14
Playlist: FoundationDB Summit 2018
Description: 
	Ryan will demonstrate how FoundationDB can be applied to solve real business problems today and how to map common infrastructure components like logs, tables, and indexes into a cohesive system within FoundationDB. His example applies these techniques to a problem ClickFunnels was facing in mid-2018, which required scanning millions of end-user data points for each of their tens of thousands of customers multiple times per hour. Through custom bitmap indexes built on top of FoundationDB, queries which simply wouldn't finish now take milliseconds, which enables new use cases never thought possible.
