welcome everyone as dave said my name is

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:09,840
Ben Collins I'm project lead for

00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:15,719
foundation TB so so let me tell you a

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:16,949
story um it's your 2010 I reconnected

00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:19,590
and some acquaintances from high school

00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:22,260
actually and they told me they were

00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,369
starting this new database startup so

00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,109
they were telling me all about it

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:26,400
honestly you know they told me that it

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:28,500
was gonna be this amazing thing this

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,119
great project and they told me you know

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,009
they've been working on it almost a year

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:34,079
they've made great progress it was

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,630
really pretty far along they paid down a

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,980
bunch of the technical risk and you know

00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,180
it was it seemed like a pretty sure

00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:43,500
thing and that's that's what they told

00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:45,059
me so um I just for the kind I mean I

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,399
had a pretty good job honestly a great

00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:50,370
projects good people so but but I I quit

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:53,850
this job I was gonna join the startup so

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:57,870
super excited first day I worked in the

00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:59,489
we're working the founders uh house so I

00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,570
go there I you know I said I'm like

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:03,899
alright let's get hacking let's get

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:05,780
going on this super psyched up uh and

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:11,100
they they look at me and they say then

00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:14,220
there's no database so ah as you can

00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:17,130
imagine I'm all taken aback they say but

00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:21,000
good news we have a simulation of a

00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:23,939
database so now you know I'm skeptical

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,310
of what this might mean and I'm like

00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:28,350
well you know that's pretty cool but you

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,240
guys have been at this for like almost a

00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,880
year like this is this is what you have

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,159
they're like no no no we actually we

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,009
wrote a programming language first and

00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:41,040
then the simulation right so I feel like

00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:43,140
pretty skeptical about that but but

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,700
anyway uh as you can tell the project

00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,079
has come a long way since then we

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,079
actually did build the database

00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:54,180
so let me that that's the story of how I

00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:57,810
got involved in the foundation Evie let

00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:59,850
me tell you a little bit more like why

00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,670
was it that at that time

00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:06,509
we wanted to do that work build those

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:09,720
tools and look into where we've got data

00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:12,150
storage needed to be years from then so

00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,260
so this really gets us back to the in

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,959
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,370
to the sort of whole sequel verse into a

00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:19,290
sequel debate I mean really this was

00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:24,689
like the beginnings of it cap theorem

00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:26,370
all that stuff right so the technology

00:02:24,689 --> 00:02:29,220
obviously leading up to this time as

00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:33,989
many of you know right was the sequel

00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:36,510
database sequel databases super powerful

00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:38,879
obviously very mature technology around

00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:42,209
since the 70s right they did a very

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,980
powerful query language but also maybe

00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:46,470
more importantly very powerful

00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,180
concurrency model today is through acid

00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:50,400
transactions it made it easy for the

00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:54,389
developers to write correct an efficient

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,980
code right let's go well but there was a

00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:58,500
fatal flaw right and that these

00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:00,359
databases did not themselves scale right

00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,639
at that time is becoming very clear that

00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:04,920
we needed scale really you know shops

00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:07,859
projects of all sizes needed to scale

00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:10,200
past that single machine and this gives

00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:12,209
rise of the whole note sequel movement

00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:17,449
right so no sequel was all about taking

00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:20,310
that one machine and scaling it out so

00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:23,730
there were a lot of different projects

00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:25,829
in this area and we got scale right we

00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:28,049
achieved this but a great cost right

00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:29,910
these projects did away with a lot of

00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:34,400
the consistency that had made sequel

00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:37,079
systems so powerful and in doing so

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:41,699
given up a number of the advantages that

00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:44,879
we knew would lead to easy program

00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:46,760
against those systems so when we set out

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,799
to build this we were trying to thought

00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,510
we knew we needed the scale we also felt

00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:53,459
strongly we needed this consistency

00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:55,230
right so we wanted to take a system that

00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:59,099
brought these many nodes and put them

00:03:55,230 --> 00:04:02,069
back into a consistent system the

00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:03,690
question then was what type of database

00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:06,359
wouldn't we build right at the time

00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:08,040
there were graph databases and column

00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:11,069
family databases document databases all

00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,079
sorts of things when we thought about it

00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:15,209
we realized we didn't really want to be

00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:17,190
limited to a single data model but

00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:20,639
instead we wanted to have access to many

00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:22,770
different data models right and so the

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,889
approach that we took was to build a

00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:30,370
single simple API at the lowest level

00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:33,879
this key value store API with the option

00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:36,009
of adding on top of it layers of it

00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:39,310
would let more advanced data model be

00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:42,310
built right so like graph or document

00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:44,650
maybe even sequel itself right so that's

00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:46,300
sort of the design of the server layer

00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:48,909
now what does this mean for you if

00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,919
you're an app developer right this

00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:53,110
higher level of consistency means your

00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:55,240
app can be written in a simpler more

00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:57,669
efficient way and when it's on top of

00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,379
these higher consistency systems it can

00:04:57,669 --> 00:05:01,569
be written in a stateless manner so that

00:04:59,379 --> 00:05:03,129
it scales well right if it's some

00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:06,490
containerized environment it's like that

00:05:03,129 --> 00:05:13,090
right he's a stateless app is easier to

00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:15,419
scale so that's the sort of philosophy

00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:17,469
of the foundation in the ecosystem um

00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:19,509
you know one thing I'll note before

00:05:17,469 --> 00:05:21,389
moving on you know when we started this

00:05:19,509 --> 00:05:23,830
project there was a lot of skepticism

00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:25,569
about this approach at all really you

00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:28,779
know people actually said that it was

00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:30,550
impossible to build this distributed

00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:33,189
consistent system that was really the

00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:35,979
prevailing thought at the time you know

00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:38,259
we ended up being able to build this and

00:05:35,979 --> 00:05:40,719
I but I think it's interesting to note

00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:42,599
that the community has really moved in

00:05:40,719 --> 00:05:45,099
this direction the wider industry right

00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:47,199
lots of systems are adding consistent

00:05:45,099 --> 00:05:48,849
features and its really interesting to

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,339
note that a lot of the major public

00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:53,229
clouds are differentiating based on some

00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:56,620
scalable and consistent data store so

00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:58,449
you know I think um those years ago when

00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:00,099
we were planning this you know we looked

00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:04,000
forward and saw we wanted the scale and

00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:06,870
we needed this consistency all right so

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,219
that's my intro to foundation you me so

00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:10,719
let's fast forward to today where are we

00:06:09,219 --> 00:06:12,399
you know Dave said a few of these things

00:06:10,719 --> 00:06:14,110
we're super excited thank you for

00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:15,669
spending your Monday with the rest of

00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:17,189
the foundation in the community I really

00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:22,060
appreciate it

00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:25,060
we are you know there's a lot of

00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:27,129
momentum eight months in we have as I

00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:29,439
checked the other day 56 separate

00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:31,990
contributors in the key value store so

00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:33,819
some of those obviously are from the

00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:35,529
major production shops a foundation you

00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:38,289
me but there's a lot of new people in

00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:40,130
the project a lot of folks who are just

00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:42,860
getting into the project

00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:47,300
maybe even doing this on their own so a

00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:49,640
lot of a lot of involvement um you know

00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,440
I think at the end of the day the thing

00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:54,740
that I really want everyone here to get

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:58,310
out of it is to have some way that they

00:06:54,740 --> 00:07:00,290
can be more involved in the community

00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:01,970
and in the project right we're gonna

00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:03,890
hear a lot of talks on different topics

00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:06,140
and Dave touched on some of them enough

00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:07,520
and I'm gonna go a little bit deeper but

00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,960
I think that you know it's a mature

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,140
project but it's still one that's just

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,220
sort of starting out in the open and

00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:15,860
there's a lot of great ways to get

00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:17,870
involved so I hope that when we're done

00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:20,470
everyone has some new idea in their mind

00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:26,270
about about how they can make that

00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:30,200
reality for them I want to talk about a

00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:31,970
couple projects that have made some had

00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,670
some good movement since we open source

00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:35,560
I can't mention all of them obviously

00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:38,240
there's been a lot of different

00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,400
improvements a lot of projects with

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,890
findings and you know improvements in

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,180
memory storage and all sorts of things

00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:46,640
but I've chosen three that I think

00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:48,440
really unlocks something for foundation

00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:52,460
TV today but also like as we look

00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:54,020
forward going into the future right the

00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:56,900
first one I've got to mention is

00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:58,190
document layer right this if you haven't

00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,910
seen already please check it out this

00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:03,500
one open source under two weeks ago I'm

00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:06,950
very excited about it

00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:09,080
if you're someone who is looking to get

00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:13,010
involved with foundation to be as a user

00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:15,320
it could not be simpler right um let me

00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:16,910
describe a little bit right the original

00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,470
theory what I talked about was it we

00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:20,960
would have this key value store as a

00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:23,300
base and that build layers on top of it

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:27,440
right and the document layer exposes the

00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:29,840
MongoDB API so this really makes it easy

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,240
for folks to get involved in terms of

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,729
using it you can use stock drivers

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,310
but also like I have to tell you this

00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:39,919
whole layer is only twelve thousand

00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:42,500
lines of code right that's not much

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:45,170
given that it's an entirely new data

00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:47,510
store built in top of only a key value

00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:49,580
store right so the document data model

00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:53,270
so it's a great place to get involved in

00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:55,430
terms of using but also in terms of

00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:56,840
contributing to the project right

00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:58,430
Bhaskar was gonna talk about that a

00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,290
little bit more later in the day

00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:03,080
but this is I think this is a really

00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:05,240
exciting step for the project in the

00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,920
community because as I said earlier kind

00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,800
of the philosophy was this key value

00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:12,620
store with data modeling layers on top

00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,760
of it and I think this is the first one

00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,080
to enter the foundation give me a

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:20,930
project that's a real general-purpose

00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:25,070
layer like this so really exciting the

00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:27,890
next is the Redwood storage engine you

00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:29,780
know it might seem like a storage in and

00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:31,310
something kind of like at the the back

00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:34,040
of the date you know something that

00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:36,260
maybe isn't too important in terms of

00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:39,440
how a database works for the user but

00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:40,910
but really red one is gonna unlock a

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,190
number of things as we move into the

00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:46,550
future right so it's already an

00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:48,260
experimental version on master so you

00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:49,970
can check it out and play around with it

00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:52,130
right there's things that it adds today

00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:53,750
in terms of prefix compression and other

00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:55,460
things but as we look forward I think

00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:58,040
it's gonna unlock a bunch of performance

00:09:55,460 --> 00:10:02,000
it's the first custom-built storage

00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:04,070
engine for foundation TV so it's

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,720
designed around the unique requirements

00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:08,690
and Steve is going to talk some more

00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,710
about that later in the day but I think

00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:11,330
that's gonna unlock a number of things

00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:13,580
performance wise but maybe even more

00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:15,560
importantly if you're used to using

00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:18,290
foundation TV you know that read

00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:21,290
transactions have to it can only last

00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:24,500
for a shorter period of time and that

00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:26,560
means that what a client can read in any

00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,820
given transaction is limited by that

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:32,030
redwood is going to add on disk

00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:34,310
versioning to data so that re

00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:36,320
transactions can scan through enormous

00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:37,790
amounts of the database at once so

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,920
giving it'll unlock a number of

00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:41,360
analytics type use cases where you can

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,310
read through the entire database at a

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,320
consistent version and get it get one

00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:47,210
picture of everything so you know I'm

00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,120
really excited about this right there's

00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:51,410
new capabilities in a distributed sense

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:55,870
new performance and we're gonna along so

00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:55,870
this I think is a big it's a big deal oh

00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:02,510
the next thing I want to talk about you

00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:05,150
know if you saw the release of version 6

00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:05,910
a few weeks ago you saw a mention of

00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:09,960
multi region

00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:12,180
eh-eh really this is a collection of

00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:16,110
features that went in it's not really

00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:20,990
exactly one specific feature but

00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:23,610
multi-region H a unlocks a bunch of

00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:26,840
capabilities of moving your database out

00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:30,720
of a single data center right the

00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:33,060
simplifying premise we're working under

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,530
when we started the project was that

00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,210
every node in the cluster sort of had

00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:39,000
equal access to every other node like it

00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:40,950
was a homogeneous network right and so

00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,170
these new features basically taken so

00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:46,080
that the database from a single region

00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:49,470
can move out to multiple regions and add

00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:52,460
to availability but also add to how your

00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:55,440
data can be accessed right so

00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:58,110
enterprises want data that a database

00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,970
that can handle region failures but also

00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:03,360
want data closer the edges to bring it

00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:04,650
closer to the customers so you know Evan

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,720
will talk about this later in the day

00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:11,040
but it's not it's not a fully finished

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:15,000
area right there's a number of ways it

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:16,560
can be used in version 6 so there's but

00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,420
there's major new features like the log

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,690
routers and async logs and things like

00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:23,340
that and there's a number of companies

00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:25,380
that are working on foundation TV

00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:27,600
they're adding features in this area so

00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:30,750
so I think multi-region and H a features

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,320
are going to be really important over

00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,320
the next little while

00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:43,800
so foundation ub isn't really just about

00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,330
the code right as we've been mentioning

00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:49,410
already a bunch it's really about the

00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:51,590
community and the community is gonna be

00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:53,430
involved evolving along with the code

00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:55,590
one thing that we're gonna be starting

00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:58,320
soon that i want to mention is having

00:12:55,590 --> 00:13:01,230
open developer meetings where the

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:04,350
contributors and committers are you know

00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:05,910
discussing upcoming features it'll be I

00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:08,910
think a window into the prioritization

00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:10,680
that so that folks who are either

00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:12,510
looking to use foundation to be in

00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:14,400
production or looking to contribute to

00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:16,530
it will have a better idea of what

00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,390
things are upcoming and the other

00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:21,810
priorities of people developing on the

00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:24,750
core you know I what should come out of

00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:27,690
that I hope is that there'll be some

00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:30,600
more open road maps right in terms of

00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:32,040
understanding the things that are how

00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:38,640
the foundation is going to evolve in the

00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:42,540
near term so let me talk a little bit

00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:44,610
about you know these are the today's

00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:46,650
talks as Dave mentioned fall into some

00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:48,090
categories you know and as I said I'm

00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:49,650
really hoping that these talks spark

00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:52,440
your imagination in terms of ways you

00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:54,150
can be involved right so nobody talks

00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,280
about the key value store in terms of

00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:57,540
like how it's actually built and how it

00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,900
scales and where it's going in the

00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:01,230
future

00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:02,850
and so if you want to be involved in

00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:04,860
contributing at that level these dogs

00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:07,710
are gonna be hopefully interesting to

00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:09,600
you you know the next thing is about

00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:12,300
layers how to build them how to do

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:16,290
general data modeling I think you know

00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:18,210
foundation DB has a lot of room to keep

00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:21,090
being expanded into the future to be

00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:22,320
extended through layers and I think if

00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:24,480
you're looking to be involved in the

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,880
project this is a really great area so

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,550
some of the talks will be directed at

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:32,090
specific data modeling layers but also

00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:34,290
some of them will be more general about

00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:37,290
about data modeling on top of the key

00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:40,020
value store in general so those could be

00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:42,030
good talks for you and the last would be

00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:43,530
operations right so everyone at the end

00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:47,310
needs to run foundation evey in

00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:49,710
production right so there's a lot of

00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:50,910
experience so far from a few places

00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:53,040
about this

00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:54,600
and so I think that this will be

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:58,470
something that'll be pretty widely

00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,580
applicable so there's obvious ways to

00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:01,380
get involved in terms of contributing

00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:03,209
code I just wanted to throw out a few

00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,980
more things in terms of you know if you

00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:06,959
weren't ready to dive in and work on the

00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:09,240
code of the project really like the

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:11,190
community is bigger than just things

00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,709
that compile into the binaries right so

00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:16,320
if you're running in a production which

00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:18,450
I know a lot of people are like writing

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,279
up your successful experience with

00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:22,079
running and on a certain cloud provider

00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:23,190
or on-premise or what-have-you however

00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,100
the things that you've hit that have

00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:28,410
worked well or some you know pitfalls

00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:30,720
now that is always going to move the

00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:34,110
community forward some benchmarking

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,490
right this is another thing benchmarking

00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:38,010
a distributed database is actually

00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:39,600
pretty tricky so this is not something

00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:42,180
that I'm suggesting is gonna be very

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,160
easy but I think can move us forward you

00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:46,709
know when a lot of people are evaluating

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,480
foundation TV for their use case that

00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:52,410
one thing they want to right away is is

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,970
it gonna handle the workload so you know

00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,380
I think this is it this is an area where

00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:58,440
people can definitely get involved was

00:15:55,380 --> 00:16:03,060
the key value store one of the layers go

00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:05,250
with some benchmarking and of course you

00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:06,990
know I'm getting involved in some of the

00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:09,839
document layer but also just simply

00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:10,800
interacting on the forums right like you

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,270
may not feel like you know everything

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,680
about Foundation to me I don't know

00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:15,839
everything about fun is unique but

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,670
participating on the forums will help

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:24,200
you learn some more and will definitely

00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:26,490
move the community forward so okay the

00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,410
thanks everyone obviously for spending

00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:29,910
your Monday with us um I know a number

00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:32,040
of you please feel free to come and

00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:33,240
introduce yourself to me I'd be happy to

00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:38,540
answer whatever questions you might have

00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:38,540
