Title: Running FDB at scale at Wavefront - Matthew Zeier + Mike McMahon, VMware
Publication date: 2018-12-14
Playlist: FoundationDB Summit 2018
Description: 
	Wavefront has been running FoundationDB in production for years. Our fleet consists of 500 instances of FoundationDB spanning 35 Wavefront clusters. About 400 of those are running FoundationDB as both memory & ssd systems.

Wavefront Ops will show how we manage FoundationDB at scale, including automatically provisioning new clusters, expanding/contracting existing clusters and how we replace an entire FoundationDB fleet. 

Weâ€™ll include a live demo showing how we use Terraform to quickly add capacity and how we use Ansible to manage exclusions (or replace an entire running fleet).

The discussion will also cover the architecture design of a single Fdb instance, including disk layouts and instance store caching that enable us to achieve memory write rates of 800KHz and ssd write rates of 70KHz.
