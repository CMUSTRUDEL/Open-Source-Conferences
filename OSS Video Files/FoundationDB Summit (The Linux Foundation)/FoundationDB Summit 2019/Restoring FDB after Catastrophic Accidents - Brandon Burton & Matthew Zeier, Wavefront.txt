	Restoring FDB after Catastrophic Accidents - Brandon Burton & Matthew Zeier, Wavefront

How do you backup (and restore) a multi-petabyte FoundationDB cluster? How do you do it when you've suffered a catastrophic event?




We'll cover three real-world examples of failures and how we recovered from them, including tips we wish we knew. Some will involve FDBDR and others will involve Linux filesystem snapshots and as an added bonus some tricks too, in near real-time, duplicate a running production cluster elsewhere.
