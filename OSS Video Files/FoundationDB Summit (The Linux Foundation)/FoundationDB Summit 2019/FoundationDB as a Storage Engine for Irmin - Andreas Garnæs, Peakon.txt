	FoundationDB as a Storage Engine for Irmin - Andreas Garnæs, Peakon

Irmin is an open-source distributed database built on the same principles as Git. Like Git, Irmin provides snapshotting, branching and merging operations over storage and can communicate via Git both on-disk and remotely.

Further, Irmin is highly configurable and offers pluggable storage engines. FoundationDB has proven to be a very attractive option in this regard, due to its reliability, strong atomicity guarantees and rich feature set, such as watches. This has resulted in `irmin-fdb`, a storage engine for Irmin based on FoundationDB. `irmin-fdb` can be perceived as a layer, that allows you to interact with FoundationDB in yet another mode.

Irmin is implemented in OCaml, a strongly typed functional language. Developing `irmin-fdb` thus required developing a FoundationCB client for OCaml.
