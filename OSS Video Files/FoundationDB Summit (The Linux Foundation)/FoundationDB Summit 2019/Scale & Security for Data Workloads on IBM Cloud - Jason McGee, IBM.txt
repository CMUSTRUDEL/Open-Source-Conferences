	Scale & Security for Data Workloads on IBM Cloud - Jason McGee, IBM 

Every containerized app needs scalable and secure data. In this talk, you’ll hear about our container journey. When IBM began moving workloads to Kubernetes, scale and security were our foremost necessities. Today, we manage 16,000+ clusters on our public cloud. And those clusters are driving some immense workloads, such as The Weather Company's 25 billion forecasts a day. Kubernetes clusters provide multiple tools to handle elasticity: worker pools, pod autoscaling, and Knative serverless compute, to name a few.  But scale is only part of our story. Financial Services and Healthcare companies also trust IBM Cloud with sensitive persistent data. These companies leverage our automated expertise of cloud services for patching, vulnerability detection, network isolation, and encryption, so they're free to focus on apps.  With years of running enterprise workloads in our public cloud, open-source tools like FoundationDB and OpenShift are the kind of secure and scalable technologies our users count on.
