	NuGraph: GraphDB as a Cloud Service Built Upon JanusGraph and FoundationDB - Jun Li & Hieu Nguyen, eBay 

In eBay, we have many applications that require Graph Databases to capture and update business insights from diverse data sources and have insights consumed at real-time. Often such data is sensitive and requires secure protection. Some of these applications can have billions of nodes and billions of edges.  We have built a GraphDB cloud service called NuGraph, which is based on JanusGraph. FoundationDB is chosen as the JanusGraph’s storage plugin, because of its high-performance and distributed transaction support. We will present our GraphDB architecture, and focus on how we deploy and manage FoundationDB in Kubernetes, how we improve JansGraph query performance in a cross-data center environment, how we bulk load the graph into FoundationDB with its transactional support, and how we secure the 3-tier cloud service with limited security support from FoundationDB.
