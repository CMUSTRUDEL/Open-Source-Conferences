	FoundationDB Record Layer: Open Source Structured Storage on FoundationDB - Nicholas Schiefer, Apple 

The FoundationDB Record Layer is an Apache-licensed open source library for managing record-oriented data stores with semantics similar to a relational database on top of the FoundationDB key-value store. It provides a lightweight, highly extensible way to store structured data, including tools for schema management and a rich set of query and indexing features. The Record Layer is a stateless library built for massively multi-tenant cloud environments with a number of features that make it uniquely suited to hosting a large number of databases. As the most mature FoundationDB layer, the Record Layer is a core component of CloudKit, Apple's cloud structured storage system. The Record layer is actively developed by a team at Apple and has a variety of ongoing projects with opportunities for community members to contribute
