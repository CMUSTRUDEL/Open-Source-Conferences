	Meta-Data Caching and Record Store Scalability - Alec Grieser, Apple 

One common pattern for applications and layers on top of FDB is to store meta-data about the current schema in the database so that schema changes can be applied transactionally with data updates. But while this is useful and sometimes vital for ensuring that the data and schema do not drift out of sync, constant reads to a single meta-data key can be a performance bottleneck that can limit the total scale of a single data store. Using features included in FoundationDB 6.1, the Record Layer was able to add a caching mechanism for schema meta-data that still provided fully transactional updates and allowed us to push past that limit.
