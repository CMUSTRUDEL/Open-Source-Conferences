	Building a Performant Configuration-Store Layer - Guarav Agarwal, VMware

Frequently, one needs an “ordered-log” model that has the characteristic of appending to the End of the key-space. For example, one such use-case is to model a “change-log” table, that maintains an ordered-history of changes that are happening to some other data/state. Typically, in FDB, this model is implemented by prefixing the change-keys with VersionStamp, to provide a strong ordering between change records.

However, this creates write-hotspots due to the inherent concentration of new rows to a specific shard at any given time.

We would like to present a technique that can help solve this problem by avoiding this severe concentration of keys, while still preserving the desired ordering, at the cost of some overhead at read-time, and some conflicts at write time. The conflicts could possibly be solved with potential enhancement in FDB core (https://bit.ly/2M6twot).
