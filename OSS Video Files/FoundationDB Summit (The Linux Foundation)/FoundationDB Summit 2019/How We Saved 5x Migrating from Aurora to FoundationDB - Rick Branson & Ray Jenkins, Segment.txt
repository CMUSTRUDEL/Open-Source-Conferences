	How We Saved 5x Migrating from Aurora to FoundationDB - Rick Branson & Ray Jenkins, SegmentÂ 

Segment is on a journey to help companies better understand their customers. A key piece of the Segment solution involves near real-time translation of customer interactions into models of customer Personas. This is the story of how Segment selected FoundationDB to power a critical part of this infrastructure, the identity resolution system.

In this talk, we'll discuss how and why we selected FoundationDB. We'll cover Segment's identity resolution system architecture and how FoundationDB has enabled Segment to deliver Personas modeling at a 5x cost reduction. Finally, we'll discuss the benefits of migrating away from AWS Aurora and the specific operational challenges we faced and how we overcame them.
