Description: 
	Evaluation of FoundationDB in Financial Services - Alok Madhukar, Rishabh Maheshwari & Subramaniam Ramamoorthi, Goldman Sachs

Within Goldman Sachs we have an in-house data database for trading and risk management called SecDB. SecDB is the single system that captures all risk artifacts for the firm and is the backbone for pricing and risk.

SecDB is a distributed in-memory blob-store with multiple write-masters that spread across regions. There is a custom synchronization protocol to replay transactions between different write masters. The system is eventually consistent and the trade model is designed to be conflict-free in most of the cases. SecDB was built more than 25 years back when nothing like it existed in the market. As the industry landscape is changing, we need to re-design our systems to be future-ready As we evaluated multiple options, we found FoundationDB to be a good match for many of our use cases. In our talk and paper, weâ€™ll discuss good, bad and ugly of FoundationDB for our use-cases.
