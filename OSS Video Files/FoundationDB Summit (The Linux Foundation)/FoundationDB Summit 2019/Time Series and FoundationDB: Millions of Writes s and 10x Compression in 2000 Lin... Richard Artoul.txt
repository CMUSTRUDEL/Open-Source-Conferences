Description: 
	Time Series and FoundationDB: Millions of Writes/s and 10x Compression in 2000 Lines of Go - Richard Artoul, Uber 

Richard spent the last two years developing a time series database called M3DB that was designed from the ground up (including a custom storage engine) to address the issue of ingesting and compressing million of time series values per second.

In this talk, Richard will revisit the original problem that M3DB was designed for, but from a new perspective. Could M3DB have been built on top of FoundationDB instead?

Over the course of the talk, Richard will walk participants through the process of designing a distributed system on top of FoundationDB that ingests millions of data points per second and achieves industry-standard levels of compression, all in less than 2,000 lines of Go.

The talk will include detailed implementation details such as code samples, architecture diagrams, and an overview of how the FoundationDB key/values were structured.
