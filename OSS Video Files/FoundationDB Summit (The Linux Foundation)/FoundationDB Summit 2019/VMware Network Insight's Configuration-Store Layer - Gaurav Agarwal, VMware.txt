Description: 
	VMware Network Insight's Configuration-Store Layer - Gaurav Agarwal, VMware 

This talk introduces the heterogeneous infrastructure stack in an enterprise product and the motivation towards consolidating it into FDB - starting from a PostgreSQL based configuration time-series store.

It will outline our journey as we progressed from evaluating FDB’s concepts and guarantees, developing frameworks and practices for modeling relational tables as KV-ranges, to using advanced FDB concepts like VersionStamp, Conflicts, GRV-Cache, Locality, to build tighter and performant models; and challenges such as higher latencies, transaction/row size and time limits, and their impact on design choices.

We will describe our tooling and integrations to get visibility into (a) application layer’s interactions with FDB, (b) areas for optimization (c) health of FDB cluster. We will discuss the challenges when troubleshooting FDB, and possible enhancements that could simplify it.
