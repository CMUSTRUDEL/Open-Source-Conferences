	Performance Profiling in FoundationDB - Diego Didona, IBM Research Zurich

Understanding the performance of a system is paramount to identify which components and functions need to be improved to obtain better performance.  In this talk, we will present how we use the Linux performance analysis tools, e.g., perf, to analyze the performance of FoundationDB. Specifically, we will describe how we use these tools to identify performance bottlenecks and areas for potential performance improvements within FoundationDB. We will use concrete examples taken from the analysis of both the client library and components of the server, e.g., the new Redwood storage engine.
