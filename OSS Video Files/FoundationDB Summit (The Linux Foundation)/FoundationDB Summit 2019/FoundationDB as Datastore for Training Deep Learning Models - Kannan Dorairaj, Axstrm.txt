	FoundationDB as Datastore for Training Deep Learning Models - Kannan Dorairaj, Axstrm 

Axstrm is a data services and solutions company focused on building data stores for computer vision, deep learning, artificial intelligence, and analytics solutions. We have been using FoundationDB as our go-to database for our custom data stores. We will be going over a real-life scenario to build self-trained micro models from dynamically distributed data coming in from different sources and trained to do a specific objective. In the process of taking FoundationDB to mainstream we have developed a structured methodology to monitor and maintain FoundationDB in production environments.
