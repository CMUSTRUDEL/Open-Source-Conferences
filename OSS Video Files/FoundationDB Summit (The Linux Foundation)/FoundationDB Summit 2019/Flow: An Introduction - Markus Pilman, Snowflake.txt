	Flow: An Introduction - Markus Pilman, Snowflake

Flow is the programming language FoundationDB is implemented in. It brings an actor-based concurrency model to C++. Flow is specifically optimized two write I/O heavy, highly concurrent software.

This talk is meant for people who either are interested in contributing code to core FoundationDB, want to be able to read FoundationDBâ€™s source code, are interested in distributed systems and want to evaluate whether Flow could be a good choice for them, or just want to learn a cool new language. You will learn how to write simple actors, how the underlying code works, and what the most common pitfalls are people encounter when writing in Flow.
