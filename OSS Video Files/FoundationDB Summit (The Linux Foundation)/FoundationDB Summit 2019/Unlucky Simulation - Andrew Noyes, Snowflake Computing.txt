Description: 
	Unlucky Simulation - Andrew Noyes, Snowflake Computing 

Foundationdb's correctness testing involves using a fair PRNG in a simulation to make decisions that the application cannot control such as when messages get delivered, when machines reboot, and when processes crash. The idea is that with a sufficiently large number of simulations we achieve adequate code coverage. However, most of these simulations do not actually increase code coverage.

In this talk, we evaluate the use of a coverage-guided fuzzer as a "random" number generator for simulation and compare the compute resources required for catching rare bugs.
