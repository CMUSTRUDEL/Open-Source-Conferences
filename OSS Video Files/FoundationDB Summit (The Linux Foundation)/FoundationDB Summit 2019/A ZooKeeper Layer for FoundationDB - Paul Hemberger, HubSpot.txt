	A ZooKeeper Layer for FoundationDB - Paul Hemberger, HubSpot

ZooKeeper plays a central role in coordinating many distributed systems. It is also itself a distributed system and can be pushed to its scaling limits, particularly with high write volume.

Can we simplify operations by replacing yet another system with FoundationDB?

What happens to system design when clients have access to a ZooKeeper ensemble that is easily scaled? And offers not just sequential consistency across replicas, but strict serializability?

This talk will examine the building blocks of a proof-of-concept ZooKeeper layer for FDB. First, we'll compare the data models, consistency guarantees, and watch semantics of ZK vs FDB. Then, we'll dig into the specifics of how to emulate ZK by leveraging the Directory Layer for the data model, changefeeds for ZK watches, and evaluate different approaches to essential components like ephemeral nodes and session management.
