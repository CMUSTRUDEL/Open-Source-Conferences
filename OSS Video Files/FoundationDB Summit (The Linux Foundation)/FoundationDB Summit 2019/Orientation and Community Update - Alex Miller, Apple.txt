00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,460
pieces of our schedule that I wanted to

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:31,529
walk through first so we have our little

00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,180
mini orientation session first and then

00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,399
project and dealt with issues or PRS and

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,379

very nice to meet you so for today we

are currently here in the main track

00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,820
this is ballroom five and we are here to

00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:03,989
listen about the good things coming in

00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:05,610
the future there is a place in this

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:07,890
schedule where we split into two groups

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,200
half the time we are a one track event

00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,150
half the time we are a two track event I

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,840
claim that this averages out to a one

00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:18,270
and a half track event case studies and

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,990
real-world FTB will be occurring in this

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:23,909
room again ballroom number five FDB

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:26,310
internals and building layers will be

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:29,340
occurring in ballroom eight ballroom

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:31,439
eight is out the doors to the left go

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,840
essentially through this wall through

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,659
the next wall over those of you that are

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,100
astute listeners and can do subtraction

00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:39,540
will realize that i've given you two

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,430
rooms over for a number that's three

00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,990
away don't worry about it ballroom six

00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:48,299
is behind me i did not write these

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:51,210
numbers it is what it is with these two

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:53,490
sections of two tracks we have four

00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,020
experiences that are available today for

00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:57,030
anyone that has not gone through the

00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,649
schedule in detail and made up their

00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:02,399
mind of where to already be let me offer

00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:04,469
some suggestions if you are here and you

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,890
are new to foundation DB then this is

00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:09,599
the room for you you will get case

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:13,019
studies which is

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:15,420
the stories of problems where FTB was a

00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:17,489
good solution and then you will stay for

00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,840
real-world FTB of hearing about people's

00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:20,639
real production deployments of

00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,639
foundation to be how to run them and

00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:24,930
what you'll need to them if you are here

00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:27,959
as a person who is interested in

00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:29,760
development than the other room is for

00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:31,769
you you'll get to hear details of

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,540
foundation to be internals and then of

00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:35,730
the details of writing layers on top of

00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,530
foundation to be these talks will assume

00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:41,430
some familiarity with foundation to be

00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:43,980
already if you're only interested in

00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:45,629
layers development and 40 minutes of

00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,799
storage engine talks probably isn't

00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:50,760
going to meaningfully change your life

00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:52,469
then stay in this room learn how users

00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,180
will likely try and use your layer and

00:02:52,469 --> 00:02:57,239
then head to the other room to get the

00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:59,189
wonderful collective layers wisdom if

00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,139
you're here with an SRE or operations

00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:03,030
hat on then you'll want some knowledge

00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:06,689
of how foundation to be works internally

00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:11,790
and then come back for the real tales of

00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:14,129
production deployments we have two

00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:16,470
lengthy breaks in our lunch and a

00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:18,569
reception this was done very

00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:21,090
intentionally our wonderful presenters

00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:23,400
have prepared information packed

00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:26,729
presentations for you but there's

00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,590
tremendously more information and

00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:32,159
stories about foundation to be in the

00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:35,519
heads of everyone around you this room

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:37,409
has more collective foundation DB

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,069
knowledge than anywhere else in the

00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:42,150
world right now

00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:44,549
I implore you to leave your table of

00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,989
safety the table that you sat down with

00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:47,579
all of the people that you came here

00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:50,489
with and you already know everyone

00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:54,479
around you and venture out and meet new

00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:57,209
people and talk to them so to facilitate

00:03:54,479 --> 00:04:00,139
this happening during breaks I will be

00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:03,299
over there I am your social coordinator

00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:05,609
for the majority of you in this room we

00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:08,039
have already met or I will recognize you

00:04:05,609 --> 00:04:10,139
from the forums this means that I am in

00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:11,909
a position where for any question or

00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:14,189
curiosity that you may have

00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:16,919
I can likely point you to the best

00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:20,820
person or people to talk to to get

00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:24,090
answers please come ask me otherwise I

00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:26,860
will be lonely in my corner

00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:28,150
we will also have two other ways to

00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,400
engage with others at this conference

00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:32,340
for each talk I will be opening a thread

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,720
for its ended discussion on the forums I

00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:36,250
added this which I did not post you to

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,810
the technical difficulties that you saw

00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:41,950
earlier I will do immediately after my

00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:43,630
talk ends but the goal of this is so

00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:45,100
that the informations are the

00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,450
presentations that you see today will

00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:49,000
not just be a one-way information

00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:50,250
transfer but can be the beginning of a

00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
conversation

00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:56,770
in addition open land is a chat platform

00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,900
that not only has a pre-existing

00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:02,410
foundation TV channel with over 300

00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:05,229
members but is also a company based on

00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:07,060
foundation DB their CTO Steve Korsakov

00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:11,770
is here today is one of our presenters

00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:14,830
in the real world f DB track to return

00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:16,750
to today there the other parts are a

00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:19,120
series of short talks and words from our

00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:22,180
sponsor Ustream lightning talks we end

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,919
the day again in this room ballroom 5 to

00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:27,610
hear our takeaway summary presentations

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:31,240
and then we have our reception and

00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:34,120
that's to summon thank you to all of our

00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:36,340
presenters who spent the long hours

00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,570
preparing and rehearsing your slides for

00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:40,539
the wonderful presentations that you'll

00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:42,400
see today thank you to our sponsors for

00:05:40,539 --> 00:05:44,890
supporting the existence of this event

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,460
and thank you to all of you for coming

00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:52,770
and being wonderful members of our

00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:57,130
community so let's talk about community

00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:58,600
I've gone back through all of the forum

00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:00,010
posts that have been made and everything

00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,620
that shows up when you search github for

00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:04,479
a foundation DB and tried to put

00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:08,050
together a list of everything that

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:10,450
happened up to and including the

00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:13,750
foundation to be 2018 summit and then

00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:15,639
between the 2018 summit and now if I

00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:17,080
missed anyone's project or a company

00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:18,100
list or anything is wrong in this list

00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,130
I'm terribly sorry

00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:23,200
I gave in a good effort I will leave

00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:26,080
this slide up for a while as a free

00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:29,410
vision test to everyone so don't worry

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,030
too much there's there's two parts of

00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:34,050
this slide that I would like to

00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:36,249
highlight upon the open sourcing our

00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:38,049
community did a fantastic

00:06:36,249 --> 00:06:39,309
job of going through and filling in

00:06:38,049 --> 00:06:43,739
bindings and you see this massive

00:06:39,309 --> 00:06:46,029
bindings list under 2018 summer I

00:06:43,739 --> 00:06:48,609
particularly enjoyed finding the few

00:06:46,029 --> 00:06:51,909
repos that were from like 2014 and 2015

00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:53,079
that then about within a week after the

00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:55,299
open sourcing happened immediately

00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:58,979
updated to the new version which was

00:06:55,299 --> 00:06:58,979
both very timely and very impressive

00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:03,369
since the 2018 summit you'll see that

00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:05,559
like there's continued to be good work

00:07:03,369 --> 00:07:11,769
on bindings being done but there's also

00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:13,929
been this explosion of layers and with

00:07:11,769 --> 00:07:16,049
the problem of how to talk to foundation

00:07:13,929 --> 00:07:19,539
to be solved people are now free to go

00:07:16,049 --> 00:07:22,619
work on more complex use cases and

00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:26,079
actually trying to solve real problems

00:07:22,619 --> 00:07:27,610
second is that there is a significant

00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:29,679
increase in the number of companies that

00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:32,159
are here to talk to you about their

00:07:29,679 --> 00:07:35,019
foundation to be usage or evaluation

00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:36,899
eBay open land IBM Cloud Eckstrom

00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:40,239
Dillman sacks are all here to do that

00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:41,949
triggering my LinkedIn searches or by

00:07:40,239 --> 00:07:46,059
LinkedIn watches for the foundation

00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:47,919
amici board our segment and branch who

00:07:46,059 --> 00:07:49,419
are also recruiting an iron core

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:53,259
foundation to be related rules wink wink

00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:55,209
I am really happy to see both personal

00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:58,349
projects and corporate involvement in

00:07:55,209 --> 00:08:01,619
foundation to be increasing over time I

00:07:58,349 --> 00:08:05,099
also think that this slide highlights a

00:08:01,619 --> 00:08:07,779
couple problems that we need to work on

00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:10,419
how many of you knew that these projects

00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:13,869
existed like if I hid this slide could

00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:15,579
you recreate it and like no I could not

00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:16,929
either I had to spend time going through

00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:19,179
and trying to compile this and it was

00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:22,809
surprised by some of the results so I

00:08:19,179 --> 00:08:25,959
think there's two important tasks that

00:08:22,809 --> 00:08:27,429
all of you can help with if we're going

00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:29,860
to get everyone in the world to use

00:08:27,429 --> 00:08:31,659
foundation DB then we need some social

00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:35,199
proof that foundation to be is a good

00:08:31,659 --> 00:08:37,269
thing and if we're going to get people

00:08:35,199 --> 00:08:38,769
to be contributing and reusing and

00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:40,599
giving back to the community then we

00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:42,579
need better organizations so that we can

00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:46,220
actually discover and reuse these

00:08:42,579 --> 00:08:48,950
projects so

00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:51,980
for social proof using foundation to be

00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:54,110
is an investment for any database using

00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:55,670
anything as an investment if it's a

00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:57,860
personal project it's an investment of

00:08:55,670 --> 00:09:00,500
time if it's a corporation it's an

00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:02,090
investment of money anyone looking at

00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,040
foundation to be and wondering if they

00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:05,930
should try it out will want to know who

00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,550
is using foundation to be how are they

00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:09,830
using foundation to be and most

00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:14,960
importantly how can i replicate their

00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:16,850
success for myself our real-world FTB

00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:19,190
track is a good step in this direction

00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:21,650
we have four talks all focusing on

00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:24,830
details of real uses your foundation to

00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:26,770
be having a wider list of who always

00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:29,170
using foundation to be would be great

00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:32,230
detailed posts like those made by

00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:34,640
snowflake wavefront and ski vault on the

00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:36,080
details of like exactly how they're

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,570
using foundation to be and what problems

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,340
that is solved are even better please

00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:42,920
consider turning your use cases and

00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:46,280
solutions into blog posts forum threads

00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,780
talks like whatever gets the word out if

00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,980
you'd like any help in doing so please

00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:54,080
feel free to reach out

00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:57,230
I think our organization problem can be

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,050
solved by better indexing and thus I'd

00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:02,240
like to introduce the awesome list a

00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:04,250
community maintained official endorsed

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,500
index of all foundation be related

00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:10,340
projects and posts getting content

00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:14,050
either code or posts online is key but

00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:16,280
making it findable amplifies its effect

00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:18,140
other communities seem to solve this

00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:21,740
before and I think copying their ideas

00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:25,190
is fantastic so Leopold chaebol or Leah

00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:27,130
luck on github started and added most of

00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:29,810
the content for an awesome list already

00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:30,980
he has generously agreed to or he

00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:33,680
generously transferred it to the

00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:36,260
foundation B organization Thank You Leah

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,480
pool and I hope for this to become the

00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:42,320
index that you can use to check and see

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:44,240
what projects exist these are its turn

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,460
headings it already has a lot of good

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,110
content please add more improve the

00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:51,070
structure added something we've missed

00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:53,660
if it's an improvement to all merging

00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:54,290
but seriously like I have high hopes for

00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:56,180
this list

00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:57,530
I think amplifying and promoting the

00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,720
wonderful work that our community is

00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:03,250
already doing is

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,420
Vital there's one other change for our

00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,790
community that I'd like to highlight

00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:09,430
which is a seemingly minor refactoring

00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:11,290
of categories on the forms the document

00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:14,439
layer and record layer were repented

00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:16,600
under a new using layers category well

00:11:14,439 --> 00:11:18,129
this might seem minor it is an

00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:22,120
incredibly important change to me

00:11:18,129 --> 00:11:25,829
because it now allows people to ask

00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:33,069
questions about layers that are not the

00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:34,930
record layer nor document layer a steady

00:11:33,069 --> 00:11:36,730
stream of questions on some layer shows

00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:38,259
an interest in the project and shows the

00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:40,689
common pitfalls and how to resolve them

00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:42,759
as members of our community have

00:11:40,689 --> 00:11:44,680
released more fantastic projects over

00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:46,750
time and particularly with accelerating

00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:49,569
layers work I'd like to make sure that

00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:51,250
there's nothing blocking or other layers

00:11:49,569 --> 00:11:54,100
from receiving the same level of support

00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:58,269
as our document layer and record layers

00:11:54,100 --> 00:12:00,160
have received and there's of course a

00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:01,839
tremendous number of additional things

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,519
that could be done to promote foundation

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,379
to B's adoption and improve life for the

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,819
community we've had a brainstorming

00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:08,350
session before which is what this more

00:12:06,819 --> 00:12:11,610
difficult vision test of a slide is

00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:14,350
which I only have to mean there's

00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:16,420
there's a tremendous amount of impactful

00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:18,430
low-hanging fruit if you are interested

00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:20,709
in helping but don't know what to do

00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:24,720
please reach out there are more tasks

00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:32,819
than I know what to do with please help

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:32,819
