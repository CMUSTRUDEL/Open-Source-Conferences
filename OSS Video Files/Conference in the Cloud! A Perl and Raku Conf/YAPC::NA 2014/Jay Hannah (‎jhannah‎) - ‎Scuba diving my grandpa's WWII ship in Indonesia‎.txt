Title: Jay Hannah (‎jhannah‎) - ‎Scuba diving my grandpa's WWII ship in Indonesia‎
Publication date: 2014-06-24
Playlist: YAPC::NA 2014
Description: 
	My grandfather served in the US Navy during World War II. His ship was sunk by the Japanese. He then spent 3.5 years as a Prisoner of War on the Burma-Thai Death Railway ("The Bridge on The River Kwai").

If all goes well, this summer I'll be scuba diving the wreck / grave site.

I can also talk about our Indiegogo crowd-funding efforts.

ninety-five as I remember them but these

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:32,250
are my grandparents circa nineteen forty

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,799
six long before I was born before my

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:38,329
mother was born my grandfather to me

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:43,710
because it is us mangy been a partner

00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:47,970
there's hanging upon color around once

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:51,140
as was i does i realize them preston 40

00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:51,140
I'm not as young as I used to be

00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:08,110
grack circuit board this ship this is

00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:10,660
the USS Houston CA 30 according to an

00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:13,990
excellent but the ship goes by James be

00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:16,360
born pitcher or when the crew learned

00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:19,000
the Japanese considered her a priority

00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,490
target in World War two and it already

00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,860
reported her as being sunk they pointed

00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:27,760
to finding the galloping ghost of the

00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:32,200
outpost if you soon in here you can see

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,850
her to perverts these are 8 inch 55

00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:37,420
caliber guns there's six of them up

00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:39,790
front those u-turns and then midship

00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:41,769
this is really fascinating feature of

00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:46,530
the Houston you can see that there's 4

00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:49,540
SOC seagull Scout observation seaplanes

00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:51,130
world war two least were launched off of

00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:53,620
very small catapults by today's

00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:56,019
standards and then they would recover

00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:58,600
them they land in the sea and recover

00:02:56,019 --> 00:02:59,920
them with cranes and put the back so

00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,610
there were two on each side here you can

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:06,420
see the left her charger starboard and I

00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:10,000
was never the Navy's of starter and

00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:15,510
organic left of course is the port side

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:20,350
big the right there Houston perry did

00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:24,220
1061 man crew and my grandpa's in this

00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:28,329
photo somewhere copy of this song in my

00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:30,850
town my grandparents home forever entire

00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:32,380
time 40 novel barn I stared at it

00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:34,390
hundreds of times with my grand would

00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:36,670
never knew where he was this picture

00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:41,860
that's where were you grandpa are you

00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:43,690
sitting on what is this one and I can't

00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:47,910
possibly be justice to all the history

00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:53,549
here here's two books I've got six books

00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:53,549
here's two of them so they're not strong

00:03:54,170 --> 00:04:04,739
luckily Pearl Harbor was attacked my

00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:07,680
grandpa's ship was at sea the surviving

00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:09,659
ships after the Pearl Harbor attack are

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:14,939
now massively outnumbered by the

00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:16,829
japanese pacific ocean so the united

00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:21,109
states at war with a vastly superior

00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:21,109
force and I Grampa the Sun one of those

00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:29,820
if we pass word three months to the end

00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:32,130
of the story the USS Houston was sunk in

00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:34,229
the Battle Sunda Strait at this location

00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:37,680
and this location will become important

00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:40,259
later because if we get to this part of

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,120
the time I've got lots of slides to

00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:49,590
houston to eight seventy years later and

00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:52,050
didn't be there in August has tons of

00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:54,590
information about the final battle so

00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:58,199
the United States Australia benevolence

00:04:54,590 --> 00:05:00,240
one side Japan Gator and they were

00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:03,150
massively outnumbered in the final

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:07,380
battle so it was three votes on the left

00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:12,889
there you can see then on the right lots

00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:12,889
more stuff they were they weren't go

00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:22,070
there's our before the timeline if

00:05:16,409 --> 00:05:24,990
you're into this sort of guy that shows

00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:26,880
military fact thank you probably don't

00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:30,919
rattle ships and we're running about

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,919
when the engagements and almost all this

00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:40,860
ah group fought alongside the HMS Perth

00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:45,880
Australia

00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:49,210
son just after midnight I'm 20 minutes

00:05:45,880 --> 00:06:05,370
late Houston same right here so if I

00:05:49,210 --> 00:06:10,540
shouldn't ask the current a sunk bear

00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:14,710
696 men 1,000 were killed 368 survived

00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:16,540
including my grandfather these are five

00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:19,330
of the ships that were lost in the

00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:23,560
battle of the Java Sea the larger battle

00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:26,200
and these are the the sorts of newspaper

00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,690
articles that my grandparents are sorry

00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:32,610
my great-grandparents had about their

00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:38,800
now missing son lots of families were

00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:41,230
concerned in Iowa in central us here's a

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,910
letter a full year has passed the US

00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:46,530
Navy sends a letter to my

00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:50,230
great-grandparents this contingent that

00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:51,880
my mom has us this contains no useful

00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:55,720
information other than my grandfather's

00:06:51,880 --> 00:07:00,280
official status is still missing I doubt

00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:03,520
they found that much comfort but that's

00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:09,760
all they knew 100 Iowans are missing in

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:12,330
action in the Pacific Fleet these are

00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,330
farm boys

00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,650
so back home that no idea what was going

00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,880
on what happened to their son years

00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:23,389
later they eventually receive

00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:27,169
information that where they now are

00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:29,060
there alive many of them and they're

00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:31,600
working the burma tide death railway and

00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:34,220
i visited this location two years ago

00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:38,270
you can go there there's museums and you

00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:44,690
can see a lot of the original artifacts

00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:50,260
in the original line the conditions were

00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:50,260
inhumane the death toll was massive and

00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:57,620
there's lots of awful photos and I won't

00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:02,419
show you those this gives you just a

00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:03,500
feel for how my grandfather lived for

00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:10,490
about three and a half years as a

00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:13,160
prisoner of war the American and the

00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:17,120
Allied deaths were a small percentage of

00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:20,300
the locals most of the people that died

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:25,849
there were from Malaysia from Burma and

00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:27,349
then the British so a lot of times going

00:08:25,849 --> 00:08:30,080
to the reunions you hear the American

00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:34,820
story the local story in terms of

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:36,979
numbers was was far greater they made a

00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,510
movie about my grandpa's his time as a

00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:41,900
prisoner of war the bridge on the river

00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:48,500
kwai so you can check that out this was

00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:50,390
made in 1957 eventually news reaches

00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:53,510
iowa that the japanese are holding POWs

00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:55,220
alive that's my grandfather you might

00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:57,470
recognize that photo from earlier this

00:08:55,220 --> 00:09:00,370
is the only photo that they ran in the

00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:05,570
Burlington Iowa newspaper over and over

00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:08,959
when they had information and he was

00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:11,390
reported safe held by the by the

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:14,029
Japanese as a poww which was obviously

00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:16,450
fantastic news after not knowing what

00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:16,450
was going on

00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:24,220
so eventually Japan surrenders my

00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:26,890
grandfather returns to Iowa my

00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:29,440
grandparents are married my mother is

00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:32,530
born my parents are married i'm bored

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:36,910
and it just makes you realize what a

00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:39,460
long fragile fortunate and my case story

00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:46,260
of survival allows me to talk to you

00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:46,260
today so that's it sorry about that

00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:52,300
jumping way ahead to last year i was

00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:55,530
cruising around the internet which I

00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:58,510
tend to do because I'm a computer geek

00:09:55,530 --> 00:10:03,040
minding my own business and I run across

00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:06,850
this photo this is some dude touching my

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:10,390
grandpa's boat in the Java Sea I'm like

00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:12,250
what I had no idea that this was humanly

00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:14,290
possible I didn't know where she where

00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,850
the boat was I didn't know how deep it

00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:19,600
was I didn't know squat about scuba

00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:21,160
diving six years before I had gone to

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,660
Australia and how it works in

00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,910
Australia's you can do what's called a

00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,900
resort certification and so basically if

00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:28,300
you're game and you're willing to give

00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:30,010
them money they will give you a half day

00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,080
class they will throw you in a swimming

00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:33,610
pool with scuba gear on if you don't

00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,080
drown in the swimming pool they will

00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:37,060
take you out on the Great Barrier Reef's

00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:42,220
and you can dive for a while it's

00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:43,570
awesome so check that out the you can

00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,220
just be snorkeling if you're more

00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:48,760
comfortable on the surface and the fish

00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:50,440
are just fantastic in Australia and if

00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,210
you're not from Nebraska if you're from

00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:55,890
Florida there's lots of great

00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:59,140
opportunities to see stuff in the in the

00:10:55,890 --> 00:11:00,339
local waters in Nebraska not so good we

00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,990
end up in rock quarries and the

00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:05,530
visibility is about this far with all

00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:08,080
our gear on so it's more training to go

00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:10,330
somewhere nice oh I've got my dive

00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,620
Nebraska shirt on which i think is

00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:13,660
hilarious i don't know if anyone else

00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:15,430
finds this hilarious but i'm a member of

00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:19,210
what's called the landlocked scuba club

00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:21,610
I've got another t-shirt it's a guy in

00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:23,530
scuba gear riding a tractor through a

00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:28,850
cornfield so

00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:30,470
Nebraska so who is this guy I had no

00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:32,930
idea who's this guy was and how he's

00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:34,370
touching my and I you know like so I

00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:36,350
emailed him and then I called him and

00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:38,900
I'm like hey I don't know squat about

00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:42,080
what's going on you know last year is

00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:44,300
this possible like could I work up to

00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:47,030
you know for my bucket list in the next

00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:49,670
40 years can I somehow work up to being

00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:52,100
able to touch my grandpa's boat and he's

00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:53,690
like well because he's a Navy diver so

00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,390
he's got hundreds of dives all over the

00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:57,860
world and he's like what you want to do

00:11:56,390 --> 00:12:01,040
is you want to go get your open water

00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:03,740
certification and you just start slow

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,480
and then if that goes good fly down to

00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:07,310
Florida and what we'll do because you

00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,170
don't have any chance to practice in a

00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:11,500
lot of the conditions that will be over

00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:14,180
there eventually whatever here you go

00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,650
well practice current diving right

00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,460
because there is there are no currents

00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:18,950
unless you want to go in the Missouri

00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:23,030
River which you do not want to dive in

00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:25,430
the Missouri River so what that what

00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:26,960
that entails is you take a real like a

00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:29,750
big fishing line and you attach it to

00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:31,790
your side and you tie off two things and

00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:34,070
then as your surfacing you're flying up

00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:35,270
like a kite at a crazy angle and you

00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:38,630
know it'll be fine you get used to it

00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:45,770
it's no big deal I'm like really okay

00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:49,130
and I've got 50 photos of of the state

00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:50,840
of the Houston and I've got all this

00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:52,220
gear here and i'll take a look your next

00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:55,340
door if you guys want to you know see

00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:59,000
the gear or we could talk about like

00:12:55,340 --> 00:13:00,470
basic diving 101 and where you start and

00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,610
how the stuff works i don't know if

00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:10,610
anybody has you need so i can talk about

00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:14,720
puking and tampa four days ago yeah so

00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:17,960
the the Houston she's a big ship right

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,430
and she's sitting on her side and she's

00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:23,300
a little bit buried in the sand but not

00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:26,630
too much and you can touch her at 60

00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:29,990
foot of depth off the surface yeah

00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:31,970
and she's about 60 feet thick so 120

00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:35,090
feet you can get to her bottom but

00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:37,100
that's really outside the range of a

00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:39,650
recreational diver certification like

00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:42,530
myself so usually more serious guys will

00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:45,350
go do that the US Navy actually just

00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:48,050
posted a trip that they did where they

00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:50,810
did survey was side scanning sonar and

00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:53,210
then they took divers down there to

00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:56,360
actually a survey the wreck and the

00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:58,220
state of the wreck so that was Jerry

00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:02,030
Ranger and he's done four dives in the

00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:03,950
Houston and they've done a lot of really

00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:09,230
informal surveying so what they do is

00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:12,140
they take over a huge what are those

00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:14,030
called the the schematics of the ship

00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:16,760
and then they mark the sections that are

00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:19,280
missing right and sections are missing

00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:22,330
because she's sitting in sea water for

00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:26,210
80 years or because salvage ships are

00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:29,750
actively salvaging steel got photos of

00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:32,330
that too unfortunately I mean these are

00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:33,860
grave sites and so it's it's very

00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:36,400
unfortunate that some people are pulling

00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:39,140
it up just for the scrap metal value and

00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:41,540
on the Perth the sister ship that she

00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:44,030
fought with they're actually now using

00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:46,400
dynamite to blow up parts of the ship to

00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:48,140
bring steelo to the surface which

00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:52,520
obviously the families the Australian

00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:55,460
families are not happy about so at about

00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:57,710
60 foot my plan is to just touch the

00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:00,470
boat and that will be the end of my

00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:02,510
adventure but it's 10 days on the dive

00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:06,830
boat over there and I'm about 12 dives

00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:08,480
into my career and I just found out in

00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:12,200
Tampa that I may have seasickness

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:14,630
problems so I found out so taken

00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:17,240
Dramamine apparently helps me a lot and

00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:19,610
in July I'll be diving quite a bit but

00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:21,980
not at depth and not off of rocking

00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:24,530
boats so it could be that I will have

00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:26,810
one day on the dive boat and then spend

00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:29,020
the rest of the time in the resort so we

00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:32,660
will see how it goes wish me luck

00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:34,580
there's a web sites and blogs and things

00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:38,600
that you can follow if you want to keep

00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:40,720
track so 60 foot is not bad the maximum

00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:43,010
depth I've done is 62 feet

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,769
the visibility as you can see is not

00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:47,600
great so this is called turbid water

00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:49,820
when there's a bunch of junk up in the

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,519
water and I've got cool flashlights and

00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:53,930
stuff that I can show you and it's wide

00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:57,200
beam narrow beam and depending on how

00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:58,550
much stuff is in the water you have to

00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,920
be careful how you use the flashlight

00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:03,470
because the reflection of the light off

00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:06,440
of the the junk in the water actually

00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:07,640
makes visibility worse so you flip you

00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,480
know you flip around with the light

00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:13,760
settings to try to see what's going on I

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,680
was not comfortable with the idea of low

00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:18,470
visibility at all which I didn't know

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:22,399
until I was in a rock quarry in low

00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:24,529
visibility and so I took night and

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,860
limited visibility diving classes and

00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:30,290
now I'm super excited about night diving

00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:32,000
a night diving work is you got lights on

00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:37,130
and I've seen these cool videos where

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:39,620
they sink all of these mega beam lights

00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:41,720
to the bottom so now there's tons of

00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:45,020
light shooting up from the bottom and

00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:47,690
that brings all the plankton and and

00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:51,260
when all the plankton are there all of

00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:53,810
the Rays these massive manta rays are

00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:55,610
attracted to plankin so they come in so

00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:59,329
now you've got a dozen of these massive

00:16:55,610 --> 00:17:01,070
raised swimming around in circles with

00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:03,829
scuba divers all along the bottom with

00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:06,919
their lights on and then snorkelers up

00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:09,439
top shining their lights down and it's

00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:11,449
quite a thing to see so the videos I

00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,270
could show you the video ISM or link to

00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:16,220
the videos of night diving so now I've

00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:18,350
gone from terrified of night diving and

00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:21,829
limited visibility to super excited

00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:24,439
about doing that in Clearwater the

00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:27,230
Houston is not in Clearwater the Houston

00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:29,600
is in very turbid water depending on the

00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:31,490
day as the visibility's not great but

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:35,150
I'm doing all these practice diving's at

00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:38,570
night in this much visibility and some

00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:41,300
of the training that I've done was in

00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:43,940
such low visibility that my instructor

00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:45,200
was here I was holding on to him this

00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,730
doesn't sound fun I don't think I'm

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,500
convincing anyone to try scuba diving

00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:51,140
but this is intentionally not fun so

00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,880
that I get used to it I'm holding on to

00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:55,100
my instructor and for him to

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,810
tell me that it's time to do whatever

00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:59,840
drill yes the signal which drill were

00:17:56,810 --> 00:18:02,210
working on he gets in my face about this

00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:06,440
close and signals the drill right and

00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:08,060
then I do the drill and then he goes to

00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,400
the other guy because he's got the other

00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:12,860
student in his right hand and me in his

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,930
left hand etc so I don't recommend

00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:17,210
coming to Nebraska to scuba dive there's

00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:20,570
much better places to scuba dive in the

00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:25,280
world so according to this I have two

00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:27,680
minutes left am I still ok this is Jerry

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:31,370
Ranger Brad's on the left but Jerry's

00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:32,870
the guy I went down to Florida and doped

00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:34,790
with him unfortunately every time I

00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:38,030
Floyd to Florida or hurricane rolls in

00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:40,370
and our dive boats got canceled so we

00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:42,530
ended up in a freshwater spring right

00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:44,150
which is about depth 65 feet until it

00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:48,650
turns into cave diving which I will

00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:52,220
never do cave diving is crazy but the

00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:54,410
temperature was very low in vortex

00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:58,220
springs near Pensacola Florida if

00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:59,660
anyone's been out there but Jerry is

00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,160
great jerry has walked me through a ton

00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,990
of the stuff and he's the dive leader

00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:05,510
who's been to the Houston three times

00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:07,460
and now four times I found out after I

00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:08,960
called him I got in touch with Jerry and

00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,190
asked him all these you know novice

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:16,070
questions about hey what would it take

00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:19,750
to whatever and he thought he retired he

00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:22,760
thought he was done diving until a grand

00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:26,570
parents re a grandson of a survivor off

00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:28,700
the Houston said hey what would it take

00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:31,400
for me to work up to this and he came

00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:33,680
out of retirement for there's actually

00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,900
six of us going over but part of his

00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:38,360
motivation for coming out of retirement

00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:40,580
was that to try to keep the dive team

00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:43,360
you know going so that hopefully we can

00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,360
protect that I've said

00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:53,080
august twenty-third is when I land in

00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:58,660
Jakarta and then it's about a two and a

00:19:53,080 --> 00:20:02,740
half yep yep no sweat is that I'm done

00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:04,030
or I'm over time I'm over time so anyway

00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,830
I'm going to take all this gear next

00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:08,920
door if you want to come and hang out

00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:11,700
and see the gear and thank you very much

00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,700
