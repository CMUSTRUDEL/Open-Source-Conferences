00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:28,029

00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:30,250
to see some really cool pearl coat it

00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:32,559

00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:35,110
going to talk about how to engage the

00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:40,800
foundation how to plan workshops how to

00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:44,260

bar I'm Heath bear I am the chairman of

00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:52,420
the conference's committee for the pearl

00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,729
kind of gets funneled up through my

00:00:55,629 --> 00:01:03,550
committee you need to get hold of me

00:00:57,729 --> 00:01:05,470
it's there's my email alright so my

00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:08,590
organization is responsible for helping

00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:12,220
people kind of plan their workshops in

00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:14,080

00:01:25,149 --> 00:01:29,320
right here we go do you really need to

00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:33,039
engage the foundation absolutely not

00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:34,750
right so you could do your own workshop

00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:37,149
you can have your workshop at work you

00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:39,640
can do whatever you'd like but if you

00:01:37,149 --> 00:01:41,469
have need help fund raising if you need

00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,450
help with sponsorship if you need help

00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:46,390
contracts you need help with insurance

00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:48,640
right the foundation is there to help so

00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:56,969
no you don't need you don't need me or

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:59,200
any of anybody else okay so we try to

00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:01,030
make sure our insurance is listed on

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,039
every state that we have yap see in and

00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:04,119
the next yap seas that are coming we try

00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:07,270
to make sure our insurance is up-to-date

00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:10,330
so we cover the insurance for your venue

00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:17,190
most venues like this will require proof

00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:19,710
of insurance right also with your budget

00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:21,330
we will help you kind of determine what

00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:25,020
your budget is help you plan some things

00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:27,060
out we also offer bootstrapping so if

00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,740
you have a little workshop first time

00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,240
through you have a good clean budget

00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,280
you're looking at a couple of thousand

00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,510
bucks whatever that you need your budget

00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,390

00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:39,950
cover your costs we can help said about

00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,950

okay so you want to start you want to

00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,270
have your own workshop right so how do

00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:53,780
you start so you need a team of people

00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:56,190
you need a reason to have your workshop

00:02:53,780 --> 00:03:06,030

this last line right so you're the one

00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,000
that came up with the idea to run the

00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:26,720
workshop so that means you are in charge

00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,720

00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:08,850
go the last one do you really know what

00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:11,380
you're doing you really want to have a

00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:13,450
bioinformatics workshop but you have no

00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:17,230
idea what it is you really want to do

00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:19,390
that now let's see what else is good on

00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:20,350
here yeah your budget you're going to

00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:23,170
need to know how much it's going to cost

00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:27,510
and what do you actually want to teach

00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:27,510
people so those are all good things

00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:34,920
alright so money how are you going to

00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:36,690
get the money is it going to be free

00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,980
right so some people say you know what

00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:39,180
I'm going to do a free workshop I'm

00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,230
going to get some local speakers we're

00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,610
going to talk about some really cool

00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,540
things we're not going to have food

00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,590
we're not going to have coffee we're

00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,570
just going to get the other hang out

00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:48,720
great you don't need TP f you don't need

00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:50,100
anything don't worry about it if you do

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,750
need some money are you going to collect

00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,600
it locally maybe your pro monger group

00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:56,580
has dues that you pay into I don't know

00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,560
so maybe you could use some local money

00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:02,340
or if you need TPF to sponsor you we can

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:05,520
be there to sponsor you but right here

00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:09,540
if TPI don't you realize fine print here

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:12,180
if TPF manages your money TPF keeps the

00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:14,940
unspent funds all right and puts them

00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:16,050
towards your workshop again if we are

00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,700
going to have it again or other

00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:26,190
workshops but it's up to the discretion

00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:27,330
of the foundation all right so I'm going

00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,920

00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:09,430
find some money all right so this is so

00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:11,080
you have you you have a city the city is

00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:14,980
awesome the city is great you really

00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:17,740
want it there right you need to find

00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:20,350
usually you need to find an inn do you

00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:25,180
have open source club in a Cena

00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:27,010
university that you can talk to ya how

00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:30,130
are the network services yeah I kind of

00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:31,990
iffy right what well people there's some

00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,460
people that have run workshops and yep

00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:35,110
sees it will actually go a week ahead of

00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,970
time and we'll sit in the area and check

00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:40,080
the Wi-Fi do some uploads and downloads

00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:42,010
see how city how things r it work

00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,440
alright so there's the insurance thing

00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:46,180
again I should probably scratch that

00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,650
line I think really if you need

00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:50,830
insurance then you need to go through

00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:54,430
TPF I mean I guess you could buy your

00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:56,470
own but it I know it seems like a waste

00:10:54,430 --> 00:11:00,540
of time to try to file for your own

00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:00,540
insurance but yes it did your call

00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:06,160
accidentals so I'm up here speaking and

00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:09,100
my mic goes crazy and electrocutes me

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,460
right so the the hotel doesn't want to

00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,460
be sued

00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:19,240
do I universities charge a lot less all

00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:21,880
right so they could so for those playing

00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:27,130
at home do do universities charge less

00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:29,500
than other the public facilities so if

00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:30,910
you are a if you don't have anything to

00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,470
do with the university you have no in at

00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:34,720
the University right the university is

00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:38,080
going to charge you vastly more than a

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:42,270
commercial institution yes if you do

00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,270
have an in if you do have friends if you

00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:57,810
yes so yes amenities yes correct yes

00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:08,530
right sure dislike this facility here we

00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:16,720
have to use their catering part of the

00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:19,380
contract yes yeah yes yes yes we have

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:23,020
yeah you want PDFs we got Excel whatever

00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:24,880
I think go you'll have to drop us an

00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:28,800
email for us that I don't know if we put

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,800
them online anywhere yeah

00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:43,140
so mm-hmm but there's also a guy that's

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:46,520
been put together by passing yes yeah we

00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:49,230
have a whole google folder full of stuff

00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,790
including a think there's a 10 year old

00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:52,290
pot out there somewhere that somebody

00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:54,270
wrote about how to write a yap see back

00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:59,670
in like early two thousand so yeah

00:12:54,270 --> 00:13:01,410
that's all out there oh yeah there's a

00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:02,970
there's a good one right there will your

00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:04,470
rooms be rented after hours we've been

00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:06,570
dinged with that a few times you know we

00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:08,070
plan a bad movie night we're all excited

00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:12,060
about it then come to find out we have

00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:17,010
to be out by six right so yeah just got

00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:18,570
to be careful all right there we go

00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:20,550
somebody mentioned this so here's snacks

00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:22,980
and food right so are you going to

00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:26,460
provide food how are you going to deal

00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:27,690
with dietary restrictions what are you

00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:30,780
going to do with all your leftover food

00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:33,510
like the DC pearl monger workshop that I

00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:36,350
was just that right we ended up with the

00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:38,160
whole lot of food left over right so

00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:39,360
what are you going to do with it are you

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,290
just going to send it home with people

00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,240
you're going to find a homeless shelter

00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:46,920
to donate it to who's going to take the

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:49,200
food when do you need to know the final

00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,700
food count and can you bring food into a

00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,700
location so if you're dealing with a

00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:55,200
venue like a hotel normally nine times

00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,400
out of ten you have to use their food

00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,200
services unless they're really cool

00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:02,820
about it they want you to use their

00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:04,380
services final food count is on going to

00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:07,650
be on the contract that you sign with

00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:09,270
your venue usually like 10 to 14 days

00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:10,890
prior that they're going to want to know

00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:14,130
how many people are going to be eaten

00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:16,260
food so you have to be on top of your

00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:18,390
registration you have to set your early

00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:19,710
bird prices far far enough out that

00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:21,780
you're going to get people excited and

00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:23,490
you have to set a deadline asst so I

00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:25,680
mean you have all these timelines that

00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:28,810
you have to meet for all to for all your

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,910
contracts yep

00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:44,520
there's a little fudge factor like plus

00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:44,520
or minus ten percent so yeah

00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,460
so do you always a debris bow that's

00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:52,410
over your room like if you use the

00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:54,720
catering from them okay if you use the

00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:56,610
hotels catering they'll take care of all

00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,960
the extra left over food all the poppet

00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:59,640
they take care of everything you don't

00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,680
have to worry about it if you run out to

00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:03,090
your local grocery store your wholesale

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,440
club and you're buying cases of food

00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:06,440
then you're gonna have to deal with it

00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:18,740
just possible about so an example that

00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:31,770
would be suppose by three cases of code

00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:35,700
coca-cola to suppose suppose your body

00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:37,440
in cases of soda and there's a case of a

00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:39,480
half left when the conference is over

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,980
just because you pay for it doesn't need

00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:44,580
to necessarily i'll let you take it with

00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:48,420
you yes site you have to talk to them in

00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:49,980
and be clear about what the agreement is

00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:52,660
with the leftovers when you're done a

00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:55,040
lot of places they won't let you

00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:56,240
yep so it's all on your contract you

00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:06,130
just have to understand your contract

00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:09,710
and you better read it yeah collectors

00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:13,750
exactly yes we have lawyer services for

00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:17,870
evaluating contracts we do not involve

00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:20,330
attorneys for evaluating venue contracts

00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:24,050
okay unless unless there's a specific

00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:25,910
reason okay but what we will do is you

00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:29,150
know send it to a bunch of people and

00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:32,270
have everybody you know over previous

00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:33,500
organizing all right so for all you for

00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:35,300
everybody following at home I keep

00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:37,100
throwing it over to Dan or treasurer

00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:39,140
who's probably off camera so I just

00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:43,370
wanted to give you guys a heads up all

00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:44,930
right okay yeah this may sound silly

00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:48,320
question but it's kind of important to

00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:50,840
be if we have to go a litigator at a

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:59,360
hotel mm-hmm can be someone anything

00:16:50,840 --> 00:17:01,160
such as coffee no yep no no yes well you

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,170
can do you there coffee upgrades I've

00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:07,709
found but did you guys actually bring in

00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:13,079
coffee down ok so we negotiate with

00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:15,299
hotels this report workshop and the for

00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:21,209
us Cotton's always the deal brokered and

00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:24,329
so tradition that we do but typically

00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:28,549
what will happen is you have to be

00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:31,200
really careful about coffee because we

00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:34,470
negotiated with one hotel that said oh

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,120
yeah we will give you fresh coffee and

00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:41,279
what they meant is fresh brewed coffee

00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:44,190
not first ground coffee but sometimes

00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:46,500
you can get away with saying okay this

00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:49,200
is really important to us we want the

00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,659
coffee from this place or something like

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,090
that and they won't let you bring it in

00:17:51,659 --> 00:17:55,950
but for an extra feet they'll go pick it

00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:58,110
up put it and use the coffee that you

00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:01,790
want

00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:01,790
that's what our kids were

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:17,410
very wanted yep yep there we go so a

00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:20,140
couple of extra things right so plan

00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:22,750
morning coffee pearl people love coffee

00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,919
more than breakfast at nine times out of

00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:26,169
ten they really like breakfast too

00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,870
though I'm also plan to have a soda

00:18:26,169 --> 00:18:31,510
water break people usually have two

00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:33,370
drinks each so you have 50 people make

00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:41,590
sure you buy a hundred hundred things to

00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:45,309
drink right it was it so is it a gallon

00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:48,250
so usually buy coffee and gallons and is

00:18:45,309 --> 00:19:00,280
there a was it 10 people per gallon I

00:18:48,250 --> 00:19:09,760
think it's 10 per gallon roughly coffee

00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:12,880
mm-hmm yes all right so you're pricing

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,740
right so okay so set your pricing to

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:19,240
cover your costs try to break even

00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:21,280
please try to break even we're not here

00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,140
to get rich we're here to make pearl

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,929
awesome we're here to make / people

00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:27,429
excited about pearl so try to figure out

00:19:25,929 --> 00:19:29,549
what your costs are going to be then

00:19:27,429 --> 00:19:33,790
charge accordingly to cover your costs

00:19:29,549 --> 00:19:35,919
are you going to have early bird rates

00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:37,510
to try to get people excited like yep

00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,150
see this year we had early bird and we

00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:42,309
had a regular so do you set an early

00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:47,140
bird rate to try to get people purchased

00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:51,130
early so you can set your contracts and

00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:54,010
then expect the unexpected venues like

00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:57,850
to ding you with all sorts of things

00:19:54,010 --> 00:20:01,000
that you'd never expect so be careful be

00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:05,049
wary plan for ten to twenty percent over

00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,850
overspend so sometimes they'll charge

00:20:05,049 --> 00:20:09,820
you for Wi-Fi sometimes they'll charge

00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:11,970
you for cables right so you got to be

00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,970
careful

00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,580
alright recruiting your speakers all

00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:19,130
right what do you get what's your

00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:22,560
workshop or conference going to be about

00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:24,600
now so he was mentioning you know what

00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:27,410
he wants to have a scientific one right

00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:30,060
so you probably need scientific speakers

00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:33,780
right here's the one that I really like

00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:35,040
who's who's your draw all right if

00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:37,230
you're going to have an awesome workshop

00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:39,540
then get one person that would be just

00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:41,100
awesome and you work on them as hard as

00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:42,330
you can and you get them to come in so

00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:47,250
you could draw people in from the

00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:49,740
community right last-ditch effort log

00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:59,340
into the IRC channel and say help me

00:20:49,740 --> 00:21:02,270
help me come talk at my workshop yeah

00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:02,270
there you go

00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:11,400
alright so once you get your

00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:12,960
registration open announce it on IRC

00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,570
announcing on proton org facebook

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,310
twitter linkedin local websites local

00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:21,330
newspapers great idea announced

00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:23,010
announced announced so i wish we would

00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:26,510
have followed this slide a little better

00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:29,760
but there you go hit all of your major

00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:31,920
news outlets if you can I actually like

00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,420
the local newspaper we've done that a

00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,590
few times we've had some good success

00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:36,180
with like your local underground

00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:40,730
newspaper things like that they usually

00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:40,730
won't charge you too much for an ad so

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:58,470
sometimes alright be awesome so you

00:21:55,770 --> 00:22:01,620
betcha she's going to be speaking right

00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:06,150
in about an hour from now so yes just

00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:07,470
try to be awesome but don't panic all

00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:09,270
right this next slide is pretty awesome

00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:10,770
all right so y'all probably seen this

00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:14,120
slide before I've shown this a couple of

00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:16,590
times okay so this is a graph of

00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:18,960
registration versus time up to your

00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:22,770
workshop or conference this was yap see

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,420
in austin right so here down here we're

00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:25,710
stressing you know nobody's comin

00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:27,390
nobody's come and nobody's going to be

00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:29,400
here we're trying to sign contracts

00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:32,820
nothing all of a sudden this early bird

00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:34,920
ended okay alright so we got a whole

00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:37,320
bunch of people so you know we're moving

00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:40,290
along and then down here I think that

00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:41,820
was like blocks of P blocks of

00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:43,110
registrations that companies were buying

00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:45,690
and things that came in at the very end

00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:50,430
and then you're done right so realize

00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:51,660
that like forty percent of the time left

00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:57,540
into your workshop is when everybody

00:22:51,660 --> 00:23:00,230
registers so you will stress out I think

00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:00,230
that's pretty cool graph

00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:05,840
not yet all right so this is a couple of

00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:09,290
new slides I've never presented these

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:12,230
are pretty great okay and I wanted to

00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:13,790
come up with a great workshop idea so

00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:19,030
here's where Portland's coming in right

00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:22,430
you ready guys all right okay Coffee pw

00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:25,280

00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:34,040

00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:40,310
mentioned to me that they would love to

00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:43,340

00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:46,130

00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:49,070
workshop in the same city that they're

00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:51,680

why aren't we doing it so right there is

00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:13,309
a great example of how if you just look

00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:15,169
at what's going on in the community

00:25:13,309 --> 00:25:20,990
look at what's going on in IT you can

00:25:15,169 --> 00:25:24,499
plan workshops okay well how much well

00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:25,820
you know what Damien Paul and Pierce

00:25:24,499 --> 00:25:27,379

get them excited about Pearl can you eat

00:25:49,580 --> 00:26:03,110
500 bucks okay i think that people don't

00:25:58,549 --> 00:26:05,360
because they're afraid of Oscar okay

00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:09,350

are resources available to us than we

00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:12,500
would normally we try really hard to get

00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:13,970
Damien to come to Yap see but it costs a

00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:20,169
lot but he's going to be an oz con why

00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:20,169
not utilize it yeah so

00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:37,240
great let's do it okay well yeah there

00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:44,030
better be some extra services okay okay

00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:45,590
right okay so i highly recommend anybody

00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:48,410
that wants to run yep see they try

00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:51,740
running a pearl workshop first right get

00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:53,180
your feet wet right because you think

00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:54,560
you know what you you can you think you

00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:57,470
can actually handle running a yap see

00:28:54,560 --> 00:29:00,020
you yeah you will learn it is rough it

00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:07,880
is yes some of the hardest few months of

00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:09,080
your life it correct yes yeah alright so

00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,470
let's go over a few things about how you

00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:13,850
can actually run a gap see all right so

00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:16,490
you need to plan for four to five

00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:19,310
hundred people alright so I think we're

00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:21,320
about 300 or so this time round but last

00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:23,810
year we are over 400 so you got a plan

00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:25,760
for four to five hundred people you will

00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:32,020
be spending over a hundred thousand

00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:35,750
dollars correct hopefully with

00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:37,970
attendance purchases sponsorship right

00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:39,950
we've been doing very well and getting

00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:42,560
the money back but plan to spend a

00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:46,070
hundred thousand dollars right playing

00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:49,480
for the 8020 rule eighty percent spot

00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:52,010
80,000 sponsorship 20,000 registration

00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:55,520
this year our registration was much

00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:57,550
higher than that but that's a good 8020

00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,550
rule

00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:05,860
alright so here's we're changing things

00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:10,030
up a little bit again we used to do a

00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:11,260
call for bid where your pearl monger

00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:13,390
group would sit down you would write

00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:15,640
down hey I wanted to this city this is

00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:17,320
my budget here's where I want to do yada

00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:20,260
yada yada and you would submit this for

00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:23,890
25 page document about your plan your

00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:27,549
bid your location and everything doesn't

00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:30,730
work so well anymore so we're changing

00:30:27,549 --> 00:30:33,100
things we're actually now starting to

00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:35,799
stack locations up we want to have the

00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:38,679
next five to seven years of locations in

00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:41,799
a list we're going to start maybe

00:30:38,679 --> 00:30:46,720
putting out some calls all right well

00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:49,690
maybe put out some does it RoR know what

00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:53,679
was the local calls for businesses to

00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:55,390
put in bids do you remember with those

00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,950
not so where we were thinking about

00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:58,720
going to each of the cities and asking

00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:00,789
the Better Business Bureau of those

00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:03,909
cities to put out a call for us looking

00:31:00,789 --> 00:31:06,640
for facilities okay they have you ever

00:31:03,909 --> 00:31:10,419
thought yap see Vegas would be cool no

00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:11,770
how about yaps in New York maybe there's

00:31:10,419 --> 00:31:14,860
a lot of industry I think gaps in New

00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:16,780
York would be awesome okay so we're now

00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:19,360
doing calls for locations looking for

00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:24,030
cities where we could go and make make a

00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:24,030
big a big mark for Pearl

00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:30,020
correct

00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:40,200
so what was it Yap see Asheville was run

00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:41,999
by a virtual pearl monger group that

00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,649
they did a they wanted to go to

00:31:41,999 --> 00:31:45,299
Asheville so they put out a call for

00:31:43,649 --> 00:31:47,070
location to a couple of vendors in

00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:48,869
Asheville they got a good bid and we

00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:52,490
went there but it was still a pearl

00:31:48,869 --> 00:31:52,490
monger group that was responsible for

00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,700
yes

00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:04,320
alright so here's kind of what we're

00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:06,180
switching up so we're moving away from

00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:09,410
the local p.m. group that's responsible

00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:11,820
from everything to TPF is going to be

00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:14,690
putting out all the bids so we get a

00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:18,420
city TPF will be working on getting bids

00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:21,090
heavy lifting all the contracts right

00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:22,800
signing all the paperwork we're going to

00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:26,040
be working on a five to seven-year plan

00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:27,990
of all the awesome cities right so some

00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:31,910
of the awesome cities that we have we've

00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:36,120
been talking about well so Portland la

00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:38,450
DC New York and Milwaukee some of the

00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:45,090
some cities we've been talking about

00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:47,300
Boston there you go no all right then

00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:49,440
you think Denver you think it work okay

00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:58,980
yeah Colorado Springs would be pretty

00:32:49,440 --> 00:33:01,410
cool heathered yeah yeah well okay we

00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:03,360
been to Toronto it was fun I guess we

00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:06,290
could go back we went to Chicago a few

00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:12,240
times so yeah we go way back to Toronto

00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:15,900
yeah exactly yeah yeah maybe so we're

00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:17,760
looking for we're looking for cities

00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:21,090
that have good IT communities and very

00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:23,760
poor poor pearl monger groups okay

00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:25,680
because we want to enter energized the

00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,600
pearl we don't want to walk into a great

00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:29,790
Pro monger group and kill them much or

00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:37,040
rather go in and try to energize the

00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:41,000
Pearl communities exactly what's that

00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:41,000
yeah yeah

00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:45,740
so that's kind of what we're doing so

00:33:44,299 --> 00:33:47,570
there's been a lot of questions this

00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:49,520
year you know why wasn't there a call

00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:51,710
for bid that was put out a few months

00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:53,630
ago while we're now doing more of the

00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:55,429
locations were basically building the

00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:59,890
city's and then we're going to building

00:33:55,429 --> 00:34:01,910
the yep seas around those so does that

00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:03,260
that's kind of the plan that we're

00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:06,309
shooting at for now does anybody have

00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:06,309

great IT people send it and we'll pass

00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:34,730
it on okay okay so getting back to the

00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:38,960
app so yes you can plan Yap sees all

00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:41,240
right it is hard there are lots of us

00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:44,330

committee we've run yap sees we have

00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:57,410
experience with the AB C's so we're

around to help it is very worthwhile but

00:34:57,410 --> 00:35:07,310
and you will remember it yes alright so

00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:10,790
we do need new ideas we do need new

00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:23,030
whatever so we need people to help okay

00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:24,560
so to conclude running a workshop can be

00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:26,450
done it's very rewarding for you and for

00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:30,700
your attendees but just remember all

00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:35,860

okay so email me find me talk to me

00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:40,190
right so there's some ideas we've talked

00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:42,580
about with some workshops with some gaps

00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:44,660
use some conference stuff find me

00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:45,800
anybody want to talk about any of it i

00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,940
know that you mentioned yours does

00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,530
anybody want to talk about their city

00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:51,110
talk about what you could do so my

00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:53,450
slides are over and we now have 25

00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:56,900
minutes left so i was trying to hit 40

00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:58,790
minutes i did 35 minutes so I'm okay

00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:01,750
anybody want to talk about locations

00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:01,750
want to talk about things yeah

00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:15,070
we don't know about that you're expected

00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:16,450
to provide all right so so let's go over

00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:21,550
what a template of a conference should

00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:23,080
look like Tom there are the the way

00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:26,920
they're people that expect certain

00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:29,260
things from now on right so an arrival

00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,850
dinner would be nice this year there

00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:32,020
wasn't such a rival dinner but maybe we

00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:33,550
should be saying you know what every

00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:36,580
conference needs to have some type of an

00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:41,970
arrival dinner people are expecting

00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:49,270
breakfast and coffee gotchas though I

00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:51,730
get I always go back to okay well what

00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:54,340
do you want to do like this there are

00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:56,290
live broadcasting is that what you want

00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:57,400
to do do you wanted to say you know what

00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:58,660
we're not gonna live broadcast anything

00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,740
we're not gonna record anything we're

00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:02,770
not going to worry about it just can be

00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:04,870
laptop projector screen done right so

00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:06,370
you have to decide what I what's the

00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:08,800
technology that you want to use at your

00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:10,330
conference yeah you're always going to

00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,460
run in with gotchas with IT there's

00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:17,380
always ghosts right so things fail

00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:20,740
things don't work don't you let it

00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:21,430
charge infer Jack sweet i'm gonna buy my

00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:25,630
own

00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:30,450
now he has projectors yep significant

00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:30,450
you could do that and to the hotel

00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:38,480
yeah four yep see in Columbus we bought

00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:40,970
three digital camcorders and the tripods

00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,070
and everything and we had USB external

00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:45,290
drives we were dumping out to every time

00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:46,460
we had a break so those cameras are

00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:48,710
still floating around so if you actually

00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:54,140
want to run a workshop we have hardware

00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:56,890
that you can we can ship to you so it's

00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:59,890
that kind of answer your question yeah

00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:59,890
yep

00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:10,380
I guess some men use their Wi-Fi stuff

00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:13,050
right bringing her up that's just like

00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:16,560
the t-shirt like the distribution you

00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:19,290
getting it food ever pop for 50 people

00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:22,440
with the distribution in terms of what

00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:23,220
you buy of each so you're always going

00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,710
to have people that are going to

00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:27,330
complain about t-shirts you'll have

00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:29,610
women that will complain that there's no

00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:31,320
female t-shirts so you're going to have

00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:33,390
to figure out okay well how many female

00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:35,580
t-shirts you have to bide Use Act I mean

00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:37,800
by all means use act for your conference

00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:39,480
planning and stuff there's a t-shirt

00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,280
engine and in there where people can

00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:43,770
pick the sizes that they want but you

00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,840
better order exactly and you better know

00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:47,190
who gets what because people will take

00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:51,900
t-shirts from you and then you have

00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:54,300
people that are pissed off so the other

00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:57,000
gotchas basically it's all the little

00:38:54,300 --> 00:39:00,750
fine define nitty-gritty stuff you know

00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:05,010
you're the food food charges Wi-Fi

00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:07,050
charges laying out power run into the

00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:11,160
store to buy power if you have to buy

00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:12,690
cables node and you know it do you have

00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:18,720
any gotchas that you can think up for

00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:20,650
ppw well I think in general yeah Mark

00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:23,680
Thomas is a talk about

00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:25,779
red flats okay where he talks about Perl

00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:29,380
code and as soon as they see something

00:39:25,779 --> 00:39:31,119
it's a red flag there's a problem and my

00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:34,329
red flag when I'm dealing with the venue

00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:36,490
is the word standard anytime they tell

00:39:34,329 --> 00:39:37,779
you that something is standard they're

00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:46,289
just making it up because there are no

00:39:37,779 --> 00:39:52,569
standards example the coffee shirt or

00:39:46,289 --> 00:39:54,849
Wi-Fi mm well in that excess is a good

00:39:52,569 --> 00:39:57,400
example oh it's it's standard it it

00:39:54,849 --> 00:40:03,250
works great okay I mean their problem

00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:09,960
that yeah with a for internet appliances

00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:12,700
each yes uh-huh to us right mm-hmm

00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:14,349
projectors are another example of

00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:18,779
something that you know they might call

00:40:14,349 --> 00:40:22,990
standard I I think one venue that had

00:40:18,779 --> 00:40:26,859
had a stage with a luta stirring up of a

00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:29,319
stage okay but then they had that I

00:40:26,859 --> 00:40:32,289
rented the projector and I think that i

00:40:29,319 --> 00:40:34,599
read in the screen well they brought in

00:40:32,289 --> 00:40:36,819
a projector and put the screen put it

00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:39,369
run in a separate screen and put it up

00:40:36,819 --> 00:40:40,569
on a wall and I said well okay can I

00:40:39,369 --> 00:40:42,880
just projected up on the screen of the

00:40:40,569 --> 00:40:43,960
stage I said oh no no that's not that's

00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,580
not part of the stand

00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:48,980
and you want to use the stage with the

00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:54,470
screen or a built-in that'll cost you

00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:55,880
yeah uh-huh let me at the business for

00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:58,610
them they do whatever they can to make

00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:00,170
money so so when you Scott relocation

00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:03,830
anything you think you might want to use

00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:07,910
you better ask yes yes don't ever assume

00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:09,950
anything correct all right well does

00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:10,910
anybody else have any other questions we

00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:12,200
got a little bit of time left do you

00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:14,750
want to talk about anything else I know

00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:16,430
that you had an idea for a workshop I'd

00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:21,140
say eyes they go for tell me just try it

00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:24,590
good yeah I think I think your comment

00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:26,210
about other powers is changing since it

00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:30,070
sounds like when you're kind of taking

00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:30,070
the bump key change from destroying

00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:37,620
change other Rick mm-hmm

00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:40,800
we change it so now right so it's a

00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:42,600
process we actually if you come with a

00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,980
clean budget we could say you know what

00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:46,110
we can find you here are the

00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:47,340
sponsorships for you already you don't

00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:48,570
have to go look for the money you don't

00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:50,250
have to worry about any of that now you

00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:52,380
can work on your workshop you can plan

00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:53,550
it you get all excited and run it you

00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,720
don't have to worry about the funding

00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:56,610
you don't worry about the contracts you

00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:59,910
don't to worry about the insurance which

00:41:56,610 --> 00:42:02,070
are kind of help yeah hopefully it'll

00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:04,290
allow people to get more excited about

00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:17,970
running workshops themselves right

00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:21,870
that's kind of the hope yeah but I know

00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:23,520
this too far already happening we're

00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:27,260
going to be interested if Elmo say hey

00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,260
you're this burger

00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:33,540
you know not necessarily this work with

00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:36,150
other content before what a gap see is

00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:38,700
going you know yeah off the group is a

00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:40,440
lot of this but to say hey we've got

00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:41,940
five or six people that are coming in

00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,470
that are interested in helping is that

00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:47,250
something that those that are sitting

00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:49,260
here yeah it's one of the problems we

00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:50,400
have autism there's a number of us who

00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:52,320
may be interested in putting on a

00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,240
workshop and some of us are found out

00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,950
and check for factors and occasional

00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:58,020
vehicle spurts and activity on mill on

00:42:55,950 --> 00:43:00,420
the family list but nobody has ever

00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:02,820
stood stepped up and sort of just taking

00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:04,230
the lead and so there's there's a dozen

00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:06,150
people willing to coming to put a little

00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:08,340
bit of a hand and some people went on

00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:10,800
done some research in some areas you can

00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:14,640
you get a mentor yeah that's what the

00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:16,859
high res no way to go ahead firstly I

00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:19,080
would turn this around and ellen's pro

00:43:16,859 --> 00:43:21,869
foundation say what would it cost them a

00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:23,760
professional organizer come in and talk

00:43:21,869 --> 00:43:26,010
to the local people where someone local

00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,990
doesn't have to take lead or take point

00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:35,160
we just need a project manager I mean

00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:37,980
right so for us yes so we are evaluating

00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:39,480
what we can and cannot pay for we are

00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:41,250
evaluating if we should do it in-house

00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:43,260
or do it outside what we are trying to

00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:45,089
do those we're trying to say okay tell

00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:47,400
us you're excited about your city right

00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:50,040
let us put out some calls for some

00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:51,839
people to find a venue for you if we can

00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,820
find a good clean venue that has some

00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:55,140
good times right we can go ahead and

00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:57,480
work on the contract for you and your

00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:59,580
responsibility is find the speakers get

00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:01,380
some of the ideas right maybe start

00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:03,240
working on sponsorship working on trying

00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:05,880
to get excitement built in the community

00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:07,950
you guys do all the fun stuff TPF does

00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:10,800
all the heavy lifting stuff that's where

00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:12,300
we're trying to go because I think y'all

00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,890
don't want to do any of the conference

00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:16,290
planning stuff you just want to be have

00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:18,450
fun right it's not the general idea I

00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:20,820
would want to

00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:24,119
planters don't have to be a person who's

00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:30,329
tracking all of the details and chasing

00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:33,380
all the kids even just having a

00:44:30,329 --> 00:44:36,510
spreadsheet you guys aren't had that but

00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:38,180
we help empty it but before somebody

00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:41,150
wants to step into enables you

00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:44,720
too looks like they need to be the

00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:46,250
leader of aquatic manager great that it

00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,290
takes care of all that stuff you know

00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:49,970
it's a different kind of yeah it's of

00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:51,650
other organizations on with the most

00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:54,290
important person in that organization is

00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:58,630
the secretary yeah keep me on task about

00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:58,630
counted everything works pretty prom yes

00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:05,170
right hand perfect was important do that

00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:10,100
but you know they obviously want the

00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:12,890
visibility that that they all get but I

00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:14,710
think something mark crystal brother

00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:17,120
product Lisa Hartman the studies like

00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:18,920
maybe nice as I could checklist right in

00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:22,610
terms of what the tests like you don't

00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:25,520
do tasks being built has gazed oh okay I

00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:26,600
mean yep we could come up we could come

00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,460
up with a checklist or even a

00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:30,440
spreadsheet did you start filling in and

00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:34,850
a pre fills other things for you use

00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:36,110
your other ideas yep yep but I think

00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:39,830
there's there's a cool thing here that's

00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:41,270
being missed and he touched on very

00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:45,410
early on his slides and he's talking

00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:47,510
about having a vision and I would

00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:50,440
encourage you first of all running a

00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:55,060
pearl workshop this is far more fun than

00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:57,069
Oh amen yes it's not that spawns like

00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:59,470
where my favorite workshops as well I

00:45:57,069 --> 00:46:02,920
think before ovw was frozen for China

00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:04,420
because it was small I mean especially

00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:06,220
its I'm single track you just sit down

00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:08,859
and just watch toss you know I'm

00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:11,170
thinking about as an attendee little

00:46:08,859 --> 00:46:13,930
shorter it's like it just happens yeah I

00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:15,910
would advise you though if you're

00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:19,540
looking at building a girl workshop

00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:21,970
don't look at it as making a mini gap

00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:23,920
see right okay it doesn't have to look

00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:25,690
like yeah see right it doesn't have to

00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,730
have tablecloths it doesn't have to have

00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:29,650
the things that you get at a yab see

00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:32,170
make it your own mission if you guys

00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:34,990
want to just spend an evening in order

00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:36,940
pizza and have some talks do it right

00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:39,880
you know it doesn't there's no rules

00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:41,140
there right exactly or is it in New to

00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:45,089
the coffee shop where they have a back

00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:45,089
room yep

00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:52,340
for those who have done a lot of

00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:55,350
workshops as it is there any significant

00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:57,480
difference as far as whether you have a

00:46:55,350 --> 00:47:00,920
weekend or a weekday as far as

00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,920
attendance and success rates

00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:04,069
you see anything you are like a couple

00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:06,079
of you

00:47:04,069 --> 00:47:08,449
works better than this is Stan maybe a

00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:10,789
week days is there is there anything

00:47:08,449 --> 00:47:12,469
event in the timing there that tends to

00:47:10,789 --> 00:47:16,459
work better or small River smaller

00:47:12,469 --> 00:47:17,329
merchants okay so if you're if you can

00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:19,219
have people that are going to be

00:47:17,329 --> 00:47:21,319
traveling in it probably should be a

00:47:19,219 --> 00:47:22,819
Saturday if you're going to try to do

00:47:21,319 --> 00:47:26,569
local and you're going to do business

00:47:22,819 --> 00:47:28,670
oriented a weekday would probably work

00:47:26,569 --> 00:47:29,989
so what is your vision what do you want

00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:31,699
to do what do you want people will learn

00:47:29,989 --> 00:47:33,319
who do you want to come if it's all

00:47:31,699 --> 00:47:35,089
local guys do it during the week during

00:47:33,319 --> 00:47:37,459
do it an evening right all right

00:47:35,089 --> 00:47:40,190
bringing a guest speaker that just does

00:47:37,459 --> 00:47:42,319
one talk it's some night during the week

00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:45,199
right so that could be a workshop is

00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:48,680
having one guy commits if you're if

00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:50,180
you're holding it on a weekend that used

00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:52,160
to work for lucky because they don't

00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:56,680
work on weekends now however you're also

00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:59,930
excluding everybody that observes shop

00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:03,589
on the other hand if you're holding it

00:47:59,930 --> 00:48:05,299
at a university most likely the time

00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:08,150
that they're renting rooms available for

00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:12,049
you is on the weekend especially it's

00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:13,860
during the school year yep halfway

00:48:12,049 --> 00:48:16,800
through school

00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:21,810
a lot of community colleges for

00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:28,610
everything and so I do that experiment

00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:28,610
I'm cool yeah and so fortunately the

00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:34,569
sponsors us even though I is nothing

00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:37,569
whatsoever

00:48:34,569 --> 00:48:37,569
monthly

00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:41,660
which is always happen

00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:47,049
it's only your Saturday's to some things

00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:49,440
and somebody else so you have to get

00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:49,440
overconfident

00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:56,470
people love 34 people love other people

00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:56,470
love

00:48:57,060 --> 00:49:04,150
let's have a hackathon work on something

00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:07,170
and other people love a presentation

00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:07,170
scene three presentations

00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:20,110
people always claim guess one thing I

00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:21,850
see of ice and then conferences is that

00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:23,980
they have a theme but it never really

00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:26,410
see that being carried out okay is there

00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:28,720
a pro or con to Geneva does not make any

00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:32,350
sense a theme is nothing is for sure

00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:34,840
okay so your your your theme should be

00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:36,580
and a reflection of your audience right

00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,690
so if you're going to have a scientific

00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:39,100
thing you're gonna have a bunch of

00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:42,040
scientists there you're going to be

00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:48,610
doing science stuff that your theme but

00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:50,530
see well it's like okay does it really I

00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:55,420
mean we have filter but pythons and

00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:57,130
science but it's like of the symptom but

00:49:55,420 --> 00:50:00,460
I want to kind of start that taco what'd

00:49:57,130 --> 00:50:03,000
you do and since I were confusing off

00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:04,900
with me if I can introduce grad students

00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,970
relevant help you with some blue

00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:08,650
teammate code yes you must must never

00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:10,510
but prolite be able to help me but I was

00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:12,610
also thinking well I also along the

00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:14,230
local resource group that would just

00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:16,090
talk about anything source that's all

00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:18,030
they let's open up to and anything

00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:20,580
scientific program and

00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:23,520
as just getting people talk to each

00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:25,800
other across disciplines and values so I

00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:27,360
guess to add to that a Yap serially will

00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:29,010
never have a Fame there's so many people

00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:30,960
with so many tracks doing so many things

00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:32,640
you may have a track theme but you're

00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,980
not gonna have a cap see conference

00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:36,860
theme so sometimes the themes get lost

00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:39,960
in the AB C's but in workshops you can

00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:43,110
mmhmm yeah it's a big way to also the

00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:45,270
video traps is that something that

00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:48,990
people seem to appreciate or is it a

00:50:45,270 --> 00:50:50,010
track kind of all right so this will be
