Description: 
	Making your own beer and wine is actually quite easy. We're pretty new at it ourselves but have managed to successfully brew drinkable beverages. We're brewing 1-2 gallon batches of beer in our tiny NYC kitchen and also making fruit and honey wines. You don't need a lot of space or fancy equipment. We'll walk through the process (with pictures) and make equipment recommendations as well as give tips based on our experiences. If you're lucky (and we're allowed) we might even bring samples (assuming the samples last until the time of the talk).

if you can't cook you can homebrew I

00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:11,250
mean you can write um I mean it's just

00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:14,460
it's experimentation just the worst

00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,780
thing about that will happen that I've

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,580
heard can happen is like the bottles

00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,130
exploding from over carbonation but

00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,600
that's the worst of it I mean it's a

00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,010
little surprise so surprising the local

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,900
you know what happens in the middle of

00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,119
the night particularly it can be a

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,189
little disconcerting it wasn't actually

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,500
yet that it wasn't that the cap came off

00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:34,020
it was at the next right just too yeah

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:37,500
it's surprisingly loud noise when it's

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,270
inside closet right and the most recent

00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,610
thing I've brood is a cider because of

00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,219
apple tree and just time Dallas juice

00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,289
why no Megan fun site or more often than

00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:47,309
not and that's pretty easy because all

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:48,600
you do is you take the apple trees

00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:50,850
throwed in their distress room brewers

00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,510
yeast in the bucket leave it for a month

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:56,789
think of fine I had a guy who's standing

00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,739
in the room though making a batch of

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:03,110
what he called it moving melon that

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:05,850
tasted like paint nail polish remover

00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:13,170
horrid I mean I've had a lot of beers in

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:15,689
my life and this is the worst the

00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,580
problem with it was is that the boil

00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:18,990
called for adding cantaloupe to it

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,360
during the boil and then you pitch it

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,590
after you to get rid of it after that my

00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,560
roommate and I decided to go ahead and

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:28,080
keep it in during the resting period the

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,790
problem is is that when cantaloupe gets

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,159
overly ripe it produces what is it

00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:35,310
wasn't a spurt Ament was as acetone

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,229
acetone so after the two weeks I will

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,240
say the carbonation was there the body

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:40,350
was there and had full acing all the

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,000
characteristics of the beer were there

00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,329
including the flavor which was nail

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,329
polish

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:52,119
no it was supposed to be a yeah yeah it

00:01:50,409 --> 00:01:53,560
was just a simple recipe and just that

00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:55,570
you got to remember that there's simple

00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,909
things that you screw up will work

00:01:55,570 --> 00:02:00,009
forever i did a my most recent one I've

00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:02,110
been trying to do is a a double IPA

00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:03,880
cider so you get a little bit of

00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:05,350
bitterness and all that and I added a

00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:08,340
little too much because I was trying to

00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:10,539
up the bitter on it so edit the Rhine of

00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,150
grapefruit into it and the entire thing

00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:16,390
came out like just bitter grapefruit

00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:18,670
like you got stood up on prom bitter not

00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:20,890
sweet at all it was just it was pretty

00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:22,450
bad we barely so I let it sit for a

00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,819
while and it's at so long until I

00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:27,459
accidentally left the lid off and it

00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:29,200
spread all over Adams kitchen floor and

00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:30,519
that's the other thing i will say that

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,260
if you can get a whole if you have a

00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:34,300
small kitchen or anything like that only

00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:36,700
thing better is somebody else's kitchen

00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,200
that is the greatest place to homebrew

00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,880
if you can have a neighbor like three

00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,160
houses down that way you don't have to

00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,840
deal with the closet or the mess or

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,840
anything else it's the greatest place of

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,630
homebrew yeah my biggest problem lately

00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:52,600
is the fact that I live there's a great

00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:54,640
brewery on my way to and from work so I

00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,799
like I told these guys have been telling

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,810
people like when they opened I want a

00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:00,430
kegerator from them and I just fill it

00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:02,950
with their beer so it's like I have no

00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,329
incentive to make beer but I still did

00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,820
because I like to do it you know I mean

00:03:04,329 --> 00:03:09,160
and that's things you can make any beer

00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:11,019
you want if you can think up the idea go

00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,780
for it i mean i prefer less bitter beers

00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:20,079
john reverse quadruples and crazy stuff

00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:21,730
but tasty peers yeah i know that there's

00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:23,850
a ton of brewers and if you talk i mean

00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:28,090
like if you get a hold of them even sam

00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:29,650
calagione the dogfish head he will sit

00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,690
down and talk beer with you and all that

00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:33,489
I've had conversations with one of the

00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,540
bigger breweries in Florida came into

00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:35,980
the restaurant doing a bit of thing like

00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:40,359
that I was talking to him about how to

00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:42,459
make my double IPA cider not prom bitter

00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:43,690
and he's like alright here's a couple of

00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:44,850
facts you need to worry about and stuff

00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,230
like that and they're more than

00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,910
if you have any home during

00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:50,490
conversations find your local brewery

00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:52,530
that's got here that you like walk in

00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:54,120
and you will talk to everybody behind

00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:56,430
the bar because all of them have some

00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:01,020
stupid story yeah I don't know because

00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:12,500
they're all birds usually yeah so hi I'm

00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:15,630
John thank you so until you my last name

00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:18,900
so similarly to Joe I did some home

00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:20,700
brewing and like 97 98 and kind of fell

00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:26,550
out of it but I wasn't that into cooking

00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:29,040
at the time and yeah I I did my graduate

00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:31,410
thesis on sacré my sis service yay which

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:35,460
is baker's yeast which is also brewers

00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:37,530
yeast but the the thing that I kind of

00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,420
fell out of doing it was I didn't really

00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:42,060
have the time to invest in getting good

00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:44,960
enough at it so the the problem was I

00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:47,870
can make beer it was alright but I

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:51,060
costed it out at one point it was like

00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:53,010
this is not really any cheaper than just

00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,690
buying beer and it's a whole lot more

00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,980
work and I wasn't enjoying it but I have

00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,870
been thinking about getting back into it

00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,310
because I've been cooking more one of

00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:01,230
the appealing things is that like all

00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:04,220
you said it is more like cooking as

00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:06,630
opposed to baking right I hate to bake

00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:08,880
because baking is fiddly and you have to

00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:10,470
get everything like exactly right or it

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,930
doesn't work whereas with cooking you

00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:16,470
can just be like that looks like it

00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:20,280
needs some more oregano so brewing is a

00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:23,340
little bit more like that yeah well

00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,260
that's all I'd say I'm like to say

00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:27,240
winemaking the cycles are so much

00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:28,500
further the cycles are a lot shorter and

00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,790
I mean the one other thing I wanted to

00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:33,450
say was if you're considering getting

00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:37,230
into this try to do something darker

00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:39,630
first because it's a lot easier to hide

00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:41,640
your mistakes and that don't go out and

00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,729
try to make like an American adjunct

00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,830
lager

00:05:42,729 --> 00:05:47,110
bruges ups are others they say useless

00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:49,389
mr. beers because only like two gallons

00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:53,169
and you can get you can talk to like

00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:56,949
your brew shops and all that we have in

00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:58,930
Sanford has studied kits just for the

00:05:56,949 --> 00:06:00,520
mr. here so you just throw it I have to

00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:02,529
come with it because nobody wants to

00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,120
make that horrible don't know but you

00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:06,189
can get like the fresh hops and a lot of

00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,900
the bigger breweries they do that one

00:06:06,189 --> 00:06:09,759
first will be like two gallants because

00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,650
it's a lot easier to pawn it off with

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,169
your friends two gallons of beer and

00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:16,659
five gallons with the beer here and at

00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:18,729
Brooklyn brew shop does the kits and so

00:06:16,659 --> 00:06:20,770
even once you buy that initial one oh

00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:22,659
thanks and so even with Brooklyn brew

00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:26,020
shop once you buy that initial kit with

00:06:22,659 --> 00:06:29,169
the car carbide car but carboy I can

00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:31,120
remember what that word is I know Curt

00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:33,819
with the carboy with with with the

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,710
carboy you can get like sort of refill

00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:37,300
kits and it's nice because then you can

00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:39,099
try out different styles of beer without

00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,569
having to make the investment of going

00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:42,460
to your beer shop like following a

00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:44,379
recipe and you know getting all the

00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,969
grains there are a couple things I guess

00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:48,009
we haven't really talked much about like

00:06:45,969 --> 00:06:49,740
the beer making process I mean we're

00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:52,330
just gonna actually say something oh

00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:57,490
really yes plz like and then you can

00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:59,759
talk about just again as somebody who

00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:02,800
has had microbiology sort of training

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,479
don't do the get some apple cider and

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,039
chuckie stand it thing cuz you're going

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:09,999
to grow something that will make you

00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:11,080
very unhappy you have a decent chance of

00:07:09,999 --> 00:07:12,339
growing something that's going to make

00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,749
you very unhappy and you're going to

00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:17,050
spend a lot of time in a small room in

00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:18,639
your house it so it is important when

00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,889
you're doing this to be aware that you

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,529
know you need to be Terry but you don't

00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:25,770
have to sanitary well you the people

00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:27,399
that I've seen that homebrew seriously

00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:28,839
and I don't remember what it's called

00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:32,229
there's a solution that's basically a

00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:34,569
dilute dilute bleach solution yeah where

00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:37,689
it you just basically are just spraying

00:07:34,569 --> 00:07:39,370
that constantly on everything yes mr.

00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:42,070
straws

00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:44,139
by the very homebrew buttons in the late

00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:46,770
nineties my wife is probably my friend

00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:49,270
Bertie starts up she was one of Brewers

00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:54,760
black many starts it went bust when one

00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:56,949
of the compounds don't look okay her

00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:59,199
description of it is basically if you if

00:07:56,949 --> 00:08:03,220
only going to brewing if you're really

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:05,050
ran keen on cleaning yes yes that's

00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:07,330
actually that's what such presentations

00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:09,400
Lindy that's here in general like I mean

00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:10,690
most of my job is on the Argentine three

00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,280
days a week ninety percent of it and

00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,660
stuff can attain to this ninety percent

00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:16,180
of your job is cleaning something

00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,560
polishing a glass and then maybe taking

00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:20,260
an order from somebody because all

00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:22,300
you're gonna have to do is just um so

00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:24,760
what's with brewing it is like the

00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:27,340
sterilization is very important or sorry

00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:29,289
sanitation I apologize Brooklyn brew

00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,940
shop also has like little packets of a

00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:32,890
sanitizer and so what we usually do is

00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:41,320
we make the solution and then you just

00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:43,599
dip your equipment in it yeah well it's

00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,610
not it's right like you can like I said

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,650
with I mean remember that you're going

00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:49,600
to be introducing you're going to be

00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:51,370
introducing stuff into it that's going

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,910
to take over you just want to try to

00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:57,040
avoid having the the unsavory stuff be

00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:58,870
able to live and exist in that

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:09,100
environment as well so you don't have to

00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:10,959
be like like hospital clean yeah yeah so

00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,880
like the the basic and I'm trying to I

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,380
was trying to find online of Brooklyn

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,300
Brewery like or Brooklyn brew shop they

00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:17,680
have a nice little picture guide and

00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,779
they have a little tutorial on their

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,150
website a little video that walks you

00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:24,310
through the basics of what you do when

00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:25,600
you're making beer but essentially and I

00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:27,640
might be skipping a step here but

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,709
essentially you've got you get your

00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,839
grains which is the flavor of your beer

00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:33,310
and that's going to be your food and you

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,500
I believe you bring that to a certain

00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:37,060
temperature and it's really important at

00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:40,330
that stage like you have it I think for

00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:41,800
like an hour yeah it depends on the beer

00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:44,440
you're making

00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:46,990
even easier right with like the syrups

00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:49,330
yeah that's a nice people when they get

00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:51,550
their start homebrewing they start with

00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:54,610
the malt services basically instead of

00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:57,459
you takin them the malt and extract now

00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:58,360
the sugar out of it they do that for you

00:09:57,459 --> 00:09:59,890
and then they can concentrate because

00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,040
you know it's stupid to ship water so

00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:04,510
you get this small syrup with different

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,610
multimeric teristics and you can throw

00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:08,709
in hops which you know so yeah I put up

00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:10,570
by putting grains except if you don't do

00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:13,209
the whole yeah all great burden which is

00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:14,649
kind of like pinnacle oh well so yeah so

00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:16,990
you're great so yeah if you are doing

00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:18,550
grain at that stage is called the mash I

00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:19,959
believe that's right yeah it's called

00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:21,459
the mash you maintain it at a certain

00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:24,100
temperature if you get it too hot you'll

00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:28,690
cook the grain and so the yeast won't or

00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:30,820
yeah cooked the enzymes yeah and so yeah

00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:33,850
so then write the yeast won't be able to

00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:35,290
there won't be anything left yeah now if

00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:38,649
you have it too cold then you don't

00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:40,420
release yeah the other thing to note is

00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:42,399
that when you have green for your mash

00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:43,720
typically you go to a brew shop or

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:48,959
online and you'll need to crack the

00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:51,010
grain in order to any brutality yeah

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,510
yeah but that's just something to be

00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:55,029
aware there is a little bit of process

00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:56,440
with processing the grain but

00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:58,000
essentially you're doing this pre step

00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,740
and so when we talk about the mash oh

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,910
how are we doing on time its tensile

00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:06,399
okay all right okay yeah so you know so

00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:08,740
that's your mash stage and then when you

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:14,020
add and then when do you add the hops at

00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:17,470
various races then you great you have a

00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:19,149
word so the work yes so you drain so

00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:20,950
after you do the smash and this big pot

00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:22,540
you strain it and that's where I was

00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:25,240
saying like we just had this tiny little

00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:27,160
strainer for our kitchen you know so you

00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,810
you really want to get something larger

00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,250
amazon has some good stuff brewery

00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:31,779
supplies do but you want a bit of a

00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,399
something larger and like some kind of a

00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:35,740
large plastic bucket or something you

00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:37,899
can strain into so then you've got you

00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:42,480
know basically your yeah your beer water

00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:47,519
your pre beer the word

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:51,300
or then you boil it not yet put the

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:55,260
Hawks in and then you add the hops yeah

00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:57,540
then you cool it down and then you dump

00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:00,120
it into the carboy than you love pitch

00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:01,560
these the quote so for cooling this is

00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,760
kind of neat we picked up a lot of times

00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,620
they'll tell you to put it in a sink

00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,690
full of ice we actually picked up this

00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:08,519
cool copper tube that hooks into the

00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:10,230
sink so you screw it into the sink and

00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:16,230
then you run cold water and it's a coil

00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:19,440
that you you yeah winner because I don't

00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:21,000
have a chiller great ine and you can get

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,010
them and ours is pretty small and it

00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,170
actually fits into a large stock pot so

00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:27,660
even for smaller like one or two gallon

00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:29,760
bruise you can find stuff that's small

00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,050
enough just check the measurements on

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,470
everything to make sure that it's going

00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:38,760
to fit but that's pretty much it one

00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:40,620
gadget is really big coffee urns out

00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,810
that you know the electric a variety

00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:45,180
preferably lovastatin set the

00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:46,769
temperature those are indispensable and

00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:49,199
you know you talking find a good will

00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:51,959
shuffle similar for a song yeah we use

00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:53,670
the community now that's not as it's not

00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:56,490
as obvious of

00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:59,100
so turn it off the door back on and then

00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:00,750
finally you know I like I also make one

00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:03,660
and I kind of wine is actually a lot

00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:05,340
easier to make than beer right let's

00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:08,640
make one you go eat anything yeah just

00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:10,230
drinks yes you get y le pega de over

00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:12,540
there is going to finish back and fill

00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:15,720
it with fruit and then you would

00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:18,180
describe the cheese from it in a bucket

00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,070
and then you pretty much just pitch the

00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:22,290
east and I usually follow recipes so you

00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:25,500
put different types of towels and you

00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:27,390
display a sterilization to kill any wild

00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,830
beasts that might be in it and I mean

00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:31,590
and then you just let said I need some

00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:33,630
blackberry wine in December no but yeah

00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:34,980
it was in December and so it's still

00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:36,480
sitting it's going to sit for a year

00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,760
that's the only thing that is a

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,410
disadvantage of wine or mead making is

00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,630
it's a similar process you just don't

00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:45,060
use heat and it's got to age that's

00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:49,710
amore slow equities society would be run

00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:51,660
definitely great for faster books and

00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:53,760
you can mediate and sumption yeah yeah

00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:56,310
its transportation yes ratification

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:59,190
public so you can ferment anything I

00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:01,230
mean I mean cuz like moonshine I mean

00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:03,450
you can do whatever you want I mean

00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:06,150
you're crazy enough one subject to the

00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:08,300
laws whatever jurisdiction you happen to

00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,300
be in

00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:14,630
nobody's moonshine is just per minute

00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:17,930
sugar than it is still it's what

00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:20,540
moonshine really yeah that's the best

00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:21,650
part might be illegal depending on where

00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,000
you are but if you are making your own

00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:24,650
wine and save the wine doesn't come

00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,270
actually good that is always an option

00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:28,490
of what to do with it I haven't tried it

00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:29,660
with beer can you distill you you can

00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:32,029
just adjust and I did this an

00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,770
accidentally once it's called up he's

00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:36,320
just a ligand ooh yay it was like ice

00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:37,700
box this makes me take a beer freeze it

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:43,400
throw away the water and throw away the

00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:48,350
ice mother bruza do it up to community

00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:49,580
in edinboro brewdog actually made the

00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,870
other worlds strongest beer that's how

00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:53,029
they did it when they may tactical

00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:54,920
nuclear penguin they took the the ice

00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:56,690
off of it they I screwed it and then

00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,300
when they had to beat the Krauts again

00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:00,650
for sink the bismark they took just more

00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:03,170
of the ice out and that's actually how

00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:06,220
they made end a history even it's so

00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:08,390
it's basically it it's literally it's

00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:11,360
disbeliever installation because you're

00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:14,690
not skip good and plenty space because

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,890
and chem customs and excise rules save

00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:18,710
it to be distilled it has to be you

00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:20,540
still use mr. right right really work on

00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:24,730
that definition of distilled but now I

00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:27,589
mean it's dear it's a legitimate it's

00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:29,570
it's but it's a legitimate it's no it's

00:15:27,589 --> 00:15:32,630
a legitimate traditional beer style a

00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:34,400
nice boxer there are even there are

00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,930
styles of beer where it's open fermented

00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,910
where instead of pitching the yeast you

00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:40,360
just set it outside whatever happens

00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:43,810
have had fun and that's a classic felt

00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:46,850
Celtic failures ljq vocal damn excuses

00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:48,050
yeah I was really those are just you get

00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:50,360
like that's what I do with my sliders

00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:53,270
because it gets this George Clinton

00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,620
amounts of funk in it is awesome so you

00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,900
give these like weird flavors if you

00:15:54,620 --> 00:16:01,420
have no idea where they came from

00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:01,420
another to the yeast speaka de to start

00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:05,420
something

00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:07,880
to mention two major different styles of

00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:10,010
yeast ultimatum vs. Foreman right there

00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,530
are lagers loveliness forces alias

00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:14,180
loggers are you need a cold near

00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:15,680
freezing place to hang them out because

00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:17,690
that's what lagering does because the

cents of fine sure oh and another thing

00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,740
is you out of my yard and you have a

00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:21,590
garden you have space you can grow hops

00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:25,400
really really easily everything I'm us

00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:27,429
except for one can grow Hoss well that

00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,600
depends on how well to go to the moon is

00:19:27,429 --> 00:19:31,610
