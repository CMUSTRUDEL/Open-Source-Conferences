	00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:15,790
again welcome making flying robots to

00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:18,640
your bidding this I my name is Tim

00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:22,090
Murray and I'm a web developer on my day

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:25,840
job oh my github / monks info you can

00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:27,730
find me and I work for a company called

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,289
double prime we do mostly web

00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,990
development and we are hiring we do

00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:33,760
telecommuting any of the dark green

00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:36,550
states we offer telecommuting

00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,070
opportunities we do a lot of pearl a

00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:40,269
little bit of Drupal as well and I was

00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:43,150
told today we were looking for

00:00:40,269 --> 00:00:45,070
information architect in particular so

00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:47,080
if you know anybody like that come see

00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:51,339
me if you just interested in developing

00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:53,470
in general there you go so just to give

00:00:51,339 --> 00:00:57,610
you a quick taste this is the ar.drone

00:00:53,470 --> 00:01:02,979
up here and it makes its own little

00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:04,869
Wi-Fi ad hoc network and I've I'll just

00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:16,930
have to connect it here not to do that

00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:19,200
for my setup what to get out of the talk

00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,200
here

00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:24,900
always do the setup before you start

00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,670
talking

00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,040
right now I'll just get an IP address

00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,900
off of this I've named mine bane of cats

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:37,950
because my cat is absolutely terrified

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:39,330
whenever this takes off there we go so

00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,520
now it's connected and we've got this

00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:44,070
UAV shell and we can load up the

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,380
ar.drone library with just the l option

00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:49,470
this is designed to work with a bunch of

00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:51,440
different types of UAVs so right now the

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:54,990
air drone is the main one that

00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:57,080
implemented so now it's all connected

00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:05,250
and it's loaded up the right library and

00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:07,950
we can start the video until we got a

00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,890
nice real-time video stream there and

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:20,700
I'll just go over and start on a

00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:24,530
joystick then we can just fly it around

00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,530
with that easy on the real

00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:39,000
it's all that's a lot of fun so that's

00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:48,330
the easy way of doing it here I get back

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:49,650
to my right slide okay so we're not

00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:51,600
going to be talking about is the

00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,910
military type drones there's a lot of

00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:58,140
uses for uavs that are coming out

00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:59,370
besides just military use starting may

00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,770
be the most obvious one aerial

00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:05,210
photography this is a nice shot taken of

00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:08,700
Madison where we had yap see in 2012 and

00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:10,560
so getting a commercial pilot to go up

00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,720
in a Cessna or something like that take

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,780
a picture that's thousands of dollars

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,430
this you could probably do you could buy

00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,440
the whole platform for as much as you're

00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:23,520
going to pay a private Pyle a commercial

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:26,310
pilot to do that so another thing

00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,990
storm-chasing you can this is a design

00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:31,290
to fly right into tornadoes or

00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:37,680
hurricanes and get data much safer for

00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:41,790
the pilot obviously beer delivery very

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:45,480
important one this was a bar in england

00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:47,040
and they're right on a beach and they

00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,140
decided that they're going to do this

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,390
little promotional thing where they'll

00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:53,550
fly a full quarter barrel yes that is a

00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:56,250
full quarter barrel they are not empty

00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:58,739
one they have this octocopter doing it

00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,450
so apply either like a six pack per

00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:04,410
quarter barrel right out to you on the

00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:08,220
beach anti-poaching this is flying

00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:10,800
around in africa looking for rhino

00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:14,520
poachers so that can inform the

00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:16,080
authorities about where they are terrain

00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,000
mapping this is a particular type of

00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:20,100
aerial photography so this is called

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,500
lidar and it gives you this very

00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:27,630
accurate topographical map of any region

00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:30,930
search and rescue so you could swarm a

00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:33,469
bunch of these in a forest and search

00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:37,400
for somebody who's missing

00:04:33,469 --> 00:04:39,960
agriculture for laying down water seeds

00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,839
fertilizer very accurately and very

00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,729
cheaply or scaring the cat which is

00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:47,099
always my favorite one this is our

00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:48,779
phantom at home and as soon as one of

00:04:47,099 --> 00:04:50,219
these takes off he just darts from the

00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:55,550
room and you don't see him again for

00:04:50,219 --> 00:04:59,699
three days so just for the United States

00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:03,240
our rules for model aircraft are has to

00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:05,819
be below 400 feet people tend to break

00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,069
that one all the time to be honest the

00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:11,039
ar.drone here since that's Wi-Fi you're

00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:13,469
limited to whatever range Wi-Fi i'll

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:17,240
give you but it's pretty easy to boost

00:05:13,469 --> 00:05:19,710
signal beyond that don't it's illegal

00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,779
stay away from populated areas and other

00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:24,059
full-sized aircraft if you're live

00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:26,339
anywhere near an airport you probably

00:05:24,059 --> 00:05:29,370
don't want to be flying this at least

00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:32,159
not above tree level if nothing else it

00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:35,969
has to be non-commercial there's very

00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:37,830
little allowance for commercial model

00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:40,289
aircraft like this in the United States

00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:42,360
there are waivers that you could get if

00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:44,879
you have a project attached to a local

00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,729
government private citizens are probably

00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:50,039
not going to get those on their own

00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:52,740
there are scheduled to be new rules to

00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:54,899
come out in 2015 we really hope they've

00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,069
already hit some snags on that one so we

00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:58,499
really don't know when it's going to

00:05:56,069 --> 00:06:01,399
happen or what form it's going to take

00:05:58,499 --> 00:06:01,399
so who knows

00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:09,230
so looking at the air growing itself

00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:12,660
it's a quadcopter and if you look back

00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:15,420
to the history of helicopters and other

00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,980
vehicles like this these have been

00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:19,620
around for about a hundred years now the

00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:22,470
reason you haven't seen them until now

00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:26,010
is because they're not stable on their

00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:27,750
own so if one propeller is a little bit

00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:30,090
faster than another that will throw it

00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,410
off it's one side is weighted slightly

00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:34,500
more than other that I'll throw it off

00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:38,220
and you have to have some kind of

00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:39,900
onboard system to stabilize it with

00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,850
today's microcontrollers and

00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:44,760
accelerometers and gyroscopes getting

00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:46,500
very cheap these are now a viable kind

00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:50,790
of aircraft and it's become very very

00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:52,440
popular among the hobbyists so it's got

00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:55,140
indoor and outdoor halls I've got the

00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:58,590
indoor Hall here I the outdoor one would

00:06:55,140 --> 00:07:01,530
not fit in my luggage so the indoor one

00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:04,380
has styrofoam covering over the rotors

00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:07,440
so if you bump into anything it's all

00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:10,350
safe now like I said before it creates

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,730
this little ad hoc network there are

00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:13,800
ways you can get it on an open access

00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:16,950
point it won't connect to any kind of

00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:20,400
encrypted access point at all but

00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:22,230
there's ways you can do it on the inside

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,450
there is a USB connector and the

00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:26,550
official ways to use that from the

00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:29,430
company are that you can save a video to

00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:32,100
the flash drive they also sell a GPS

00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:35,060
accessory that will give you GPS

00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:39,450
coordinates over the navigation channel

00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:41,010
I don't know of any real hacks of that

00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:42,630
people have been thinking of doing

00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:44,220
things like attaching nerf guns and you

00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:47,340
could fire it using the USB connector or

00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:49,320
something like that I assume that if

00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:51,690
this was easy and straightforward it

00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:53,190
would have been done already so I don't

00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:57,120
know of any good way to do that

00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:58,860
unfortunately there's also forward and

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,940
bottom cameras the forward camera is

00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:05,010
720p the bottom camera is less than that

00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:08,450
it's mostly just for seeing what's below

00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:10,440
you and you just kind of land with it

00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:14,460
there's also on the bottom is an

00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:18,530
ultrasonic sensor that can be used it

00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:18,530
keeps its altitude pretty well using

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,370
so there's also a bunch of built-in

00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:28,850
maneuvers that it's all on the drone

00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:32,920
itself you can reconnect here and show

00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:32,920
you a few of them

00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:49,620
trying to keep it away from the screen

00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:49,620
I'm not the best pilot to be honest

00:08:53,930 --> 00:09:01,490
there you go hey you can just do

00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:03,640
commands like clip left but very popular

00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:06,670
to do when you got guests coming over

00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:14,870
and saying here look at my drone and oh

00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:19,610
that's awesome so there's a bunch of

00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:27,800
different commands like that that yeah

00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:30,290
we gotta get back in my slides area and

00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:33,980
they also have a couple other ones like

00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:36,050
they're real weird names like theta 20

00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:38,690
degrees y'all they call a roll pitch and

00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:44,540
yaw they have like theta and Phi instead

00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:46,640
I don't know why but they're in there so

00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:49,520
I'm bored you will find it's actually a

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,560
Linux system well running a ball out of

00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,209
busybox utilities and you can telnet

00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,130
right into this sucker there's no

00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:57,410
password there's no security on this at

00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:59,209
all if you wanted to steal somebody's

00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:01,160
all of you got laptops here you could

00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:09,529
hack right into this but please don't

00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:10,640
put and not likely but yeah you can tell

00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:19,820
that right into it there's no password

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:23,150
and so you you can get it so the flight

00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:26,839
controls go over UDP nav data also comes

00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:28,880
back at you over UDP the video for the 2

00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:31,310
point 0 drone comes over TCP the

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,200
original one version 1 actually had its

00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:34,910
own little UDP thing I have not

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,190
implemented that and I don't really

00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:40,250
intend to if somebody else wants to do

00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:42,700
that I'm all for it but I don't plan on

00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,700
doing it myself

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:52,670
oh right yep okay so you have a pilot it

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,829
wants control nav data and video and we

00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:58,970
can do real-time video streams like I

00:10:54,829 --> 00:11:02,630
showed you before and it takes a model

00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:05,029
much like dbi that you have different

00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:07,070
drivers that can all work with the same

00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:10,190
system so you can control many different

00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:13,519
types of UAVs with it so at the moment

00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:15,550
we have the air drone implemented and

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,800
also the Wampus rover which is a little

00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:21,290
RC car of my own that I designed I'd

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,850
really like to see more be implemented

00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:24,139
in the future because there's all sorts

00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:28,040
of different control interfaces out

00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:29,810
there and the structure of this is the

00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,760
driver implements a lot of low-level

00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:33,199
details so if you looked at the driver

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,750
for the air drone you'd see things like

00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:37,220
80 ref and 80 config and it doesn't

00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:39,740
really make a lot of sense unless you've

00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:42,410
gone through their dev manual but then

00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:44,750
the control is a much higher level

00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:47,240
interface where you have takeoff yaw

00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:50,750
pitch roll makes a lot more sense that's

00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:58,069
what's intended to be very much the same

00:11:50,750 --> 00:12:00,649
between different types of UAVs so we

00:11:58,069 --> 00:12:03,680
used lots and lots of any event in this

00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:06,800
and there's a few different reasons for

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,630
that the there needs to be a new command

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,819
sent every 30 milliseconds or it stops

00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:12,620
which means that if it hits the edge of

00:12:10,819 --> 00:12:14,329
your lab Wi-Fi range it's just going to

00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:18,440
hover they're so pretty safe in that

00:12:14,329 --> 00:12:20,779
regard so we use any event to set up

00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:23,120
that timer and it's also very handy for

00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:24,470
the non-blocking i/o the nav data and

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,139
the video stream are both handled that

00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:28,819
way and what I'd like to see for events

00:12:27,139 --> 00:12:30,800
in the future is something like you can

00:12:28,819 --> 00:12:32,959
increase the throttle to lift it up

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:37,720
until you're at this altitude so can you

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:37,720
get it to respond to events that way

00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,930
basics of flight dynamics this is a

00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:48,660
little chart you'll see I'm pretty much

00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:52,320
any kind of flight talk Oh roll yeah I

00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:56,300
can pick it up here and show you so roll

00:12:52,320 --> 00:13:00,840
goes this way y'all will be around and

00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:02,070
then pitch back and forth one thing you

00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:05,130
know if you had an airplane like this

00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:07,320
thrust would go forward thrust on this

00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:09,810
is going to be up and down another thing

00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,730
is that the more energy you use doing

00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:14,010
that the less energy it's going to have

00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:20,010
from maneuvering around since it's using

00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:23,910
the same propellers for that like go

00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:25,830
haywire ok so just getting into some of

00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:28,050
the code here this is the driver that

00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:30,870
you're just giving it the IP address

00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:32,430
that you want this is going to be the

00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:33,930
default so you don't even have to pass

00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:35,910
that if you don't want to and then you

00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:41,010
just tell it to connect over that IP

00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:43,530
address I highly recommend using the

00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:46,050
control event version of it that will

00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:48,030
set up for you that little timer loop

00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:49,350
that sends at over 30 milliseconds it's

00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:52,620
going to do that it's going to make your

00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:54,210
life easier and a lot of other ways but

00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:56,580
we just pass it the driver we made

00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:59,190
before and then till two in it the event

00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:01,070
loop and CV here is going to be the

00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:04,620
condition bar that comes from any event

00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:07,100
the event object here is actually an

00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:10,320
easy event which I'll show in just a bit

00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:14,180
it's just a little interface over any

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,180
event that makes certain things easier

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:21,480
so this is easy event this helps

00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:27,510
particularly with adding these timers

00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:29,880
and instead of on a raw any event you

00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:32,670
would have if you wanted to start one

00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:34,980
timer and when that finishes go do some

00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:37,680
do another time or after that you'd have

00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:44,100
to nest those down with this interface

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:46,120
instead we have this little queuing so

00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:49,780
it just cascades one into the next

00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:52,520
so what this timer is saying is after 10

00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:55,010
milliseconds we're going to call this

00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:59,540
callback so that's going to be a takeoff

00:14:55,010 --> 00:15:01,700
10 milliseconds after reconnect and ten

00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:03,050
thousand milliseconds ten seconds later

00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:06,740
we're just going to land so it's just

00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:08,120
kind of an elevator program and then

00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:11,120
down here we just have our book eating

00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:13,760
of a vent loop and this starts the event

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,930
loop running and thus end here once it

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:20,840
gets here it's going to stop the whole

00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:33,880
program so i can show you the example of

00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:33,880
that so here in the first demo flight

00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:38,900
show this so we connecting to the host

00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:41,570
they're setting up the easy event object

00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:43,130
and here we get that control setting up

00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:47,660
the event loop for that and then we have

00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:52,950
our timers down here yeah so we can just

00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:59,870
run this quick there we go

00:15:52,950 --> 00:16:12,810
and like 10 seconds later hopefully

00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:14,790
there it goes alright so we showed you

00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:17,040
earlier that little UAV shell and that's

00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:18,920
just a much easier way if you just want

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,270
to mess around with it a little bit

00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:23,280
especially with joystick and doing video

00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:24,960
output more complicated things that are

00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,970
going to go through an event there you

00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:31,260
want more of your own little script

00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:33,270
running but it will load up whatever

00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:36,090
library you have so there's Wampus rover

00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:39,300
as well but this is AR Drone and there's

00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:42,170
a nav interface that I should show you

00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,170
that quick

00:16:48,579 --> 00:16:53,649
so it's just this little sdl output and

00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:57,160
it's getting right off the drone here

00:16:53,649 --> 00:17:01,019
you can see the lines moving oh that and

00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:01,019
you got battery life to is really nice

00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:07,360
yeah it does kind of automatically cut

00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:14,640
off once the better it gets to a certain

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:14,640
level so keep it I on that so

00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:22,990
we can dump the video to a file this

00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:27,100
would be have path to a file after the

00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:28,990
argument here start video that gives you

00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:31,030
the real time output there's a couple of

00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:33,010
different ways to do that if you want to

00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:34,930
be compatible with the video you have to

00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:38,350
pass this to parameter it's kind of the

00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:41,530
older way to doing things I'll get into

00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:45,040
why that is in a little while just for

00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:51,040
now take my word for it so what do you

00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:59,530
do if it goes horribly wrong I'll just

00:17:51,040 --> 00:18:04,120
take it off here and lift her up now if

00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:06,610
this is just flying out of control what

00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:09,130
you you have to go make it go upside

00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:10,870
down somehow and when that happens it's

00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:12,760
going to detect it and it's going to

00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:17,140
shut it all off so if i just take it

00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:21,910
like this just kills it and if i try to

00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:24,190
do anything now it's not going to

00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:25,270
respond you can do whatever you want

00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:31,540
there it's not going to work you have to

00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:35,860
call this emergency toggle and now it

00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:37,510
will be able to take off again so just a

00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:41,460
very safety feature as a consumer

00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:41,460
product this is very safe

00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:53,890
so program me a longer flight I'll show

00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:56,050
you this one so this we have all the

00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:57,550
same kind of bookkeeping up here don't

00:18:56,050 --> 00:19:02,020
worry about that so if you look at these

00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:04,180
timers though just getting a little bit

00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:06,880
more complicated we have the same sort

00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:10,030
of take off after 10 milliseconds for

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:13,510
the first one the second one we're going

00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:15,130
to every 10 seconds we're going to yaw

00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:18,340
to the left negative one is going to be

00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:20,500
yah to the left in this one because it

00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:24,940
takes numbers between negative one and

00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:27,970
one for all the commands there and we're

00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:29,830
going to pitch downward point five so

00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:32,320
that's going to pitch it forward and

00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:38,200
that makes it go like that for

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:41,820
quadcopter and then we'll roll for a bit

00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:45,100
and then after that it's hovering land

00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:47,830
so I don't entirely know all the time

00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:49,690
where this script actually ends it up so

00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:55,870
people towards the front might need to

00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:57,610
duck I'll try to follow it around here

00:19:55,870 --> 00:20:08,500
I'm just going to get it away from the

00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:11,830
screen okay I'll try to flip it if it

00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:15,310
gets out of control here

00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:15,310
family people

00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:30,320
that shouldn't head towards the screen I

00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:34,100
don't want to pay for it so video

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:35,899
subsystem as far as I know Pearl has the

00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:38,690
only third-party library that will

00:20:35,899 --> 00:20:41,840
really handle real time output of the

00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:44,210
video system without cheating there is a

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,640
big one called node copter for kno jes

00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:49,070
that will output it has a plugin for

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,740
this to output to a browser and that the

00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:54,019
browser takes the fancy new html5 video

00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:58,429
tags it can display the video that way

00:20:54,019 --> 00:21:01,490
personally I think that's cheating what

00:20:58,429 --> 00:21:03,620
we do is it has what's called a pavé

00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:07,039
header which just tells us things like

00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:10,010
checksum the length of the frame some

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:11,330
other kind of boilerplate type stuff so

00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:14,049
we parse that out and we've now we've

00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:18,110
got our h.264 frame issues exposed

00:21:14,049 --> 00:21:19,610
compression for video that you'd use on

00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:22,279
blu-ray players a lot of streaming

00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:25,850
websites will use that same sort of

00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:28,389
thing it'll then pass it into ffmpeg

00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:31,279
this is part is all implemented in C and

00:21:28,389 --> 00:21:32,990
that gives us the y UV channel now I

00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:34,669
have probably a lot of web developers in

00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:37,100
here so we'd probably worked with RGB

00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:40,279
before why you these just a different

00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:41,840
kind of weight of encoding color I'm not

00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:45,320
very good with color theory I can't

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:48,080
totally explain it out to you but just

00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:51,139
trust me on that one and then we got

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:53,750
that all that y UV pixel data and we can

00:21:51,139 --> 00:21:56,870
throw that up on an SD l window and then

00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:58,960
we've got our real-time output now what

00:21:56,870 --> 00:22:03,889
I really like to see in the future is

00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:06,620
linking this into opencv opencv gives us

00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:09,529
some really powerful image manipulation

00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:13,159
things like detecting faces or other

00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:15,169
objects we can also draw on it so if you

00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:17,149
want to make a game that like you had

00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:19,220
two of these and you want to have them

00:22:17,149 --> 00:22:21,110
dog fight or whatever you can make that

00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:22,700
sort of game where it would detect the

00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:24,440
other one and you have a targeting

00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:26,179
reticle and you have all your data up on

00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:29,559
the screen that's what I really wanted

00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:29,559
to do with this haven't got

00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:36,800
so this is just the Oh more graphical

00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:39,890
description what I was talking about for

00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:41,930
so air drone video here we'll get data

00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:44,690
in from the drone that gives us our

00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:47,390
h.264 print and that can be passed off

00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:50,960
to anything that implements this h.264

00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:53,330
handler roll file dump we'll just dump

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:56,090
that to a file which is nice enough you

00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:59,330
can then take that file and use the

00:22:56,090 --> 00:23:02,270
ffmpeg command-line tool use that to put

00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:05,060
into an avi or whatever you want that's

00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:08,810
a little boring though h.264 decoder

00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:13,670
actually links into ffmpeg that gets us

00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:17,660
our y UV data nsdl video then we'll

00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:19,280
actually throw that up on stl window and

00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:21,080
then where we would put this in in the

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:24,590
future is implement this raw handler

00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:27,380
here for an open CV converter and then

00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:30,740
we passed that off and we can do opencv

00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:32,360
handler a different role for doing

00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:35,060
object detection or throwing up on

00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:37,730
windows or doing drawing commands can

00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:39,500
all be in here and that ends up here and

00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:41,270
that will take the place of the sdl

00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:48,170
window because open CD can do the

00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:50,210
display on its own so if you remember I

00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:52,010
told you a little bit earlier there's

00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:53,540
that command for starting video when you

00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:55,910
pass parameters to it to start in

00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:58,280
different ways so there's a couple of

00:23:55,910 --> 00:24:00,230
different ways that I experimented with

00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,730
to do it the first way and most obvious

00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:03,680
way is everything is in one process

00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:05,330
you're getting taking care of the

00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:07,790
joystick and sending commands and

00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:10,940
getting nav data and processing video

00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:14,180
all that happens in one cpu core one

00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:16,640
process which if you have fast enough

00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:19,340
cpu it's no big prawn no not a big issue

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,650
I don't have a particularly fast laptop

00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:23,420
and it seems to do this okay but I'd

00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:26,380
really like to be able to take advantage

00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:30,500
of all those newfangled multi-core CPUs

00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:33,200
so the first thing i tried was to pipe

00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:38,780
the video stream to a separate process

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:40,340
and this worked but i found there was a

00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:43,279
slight lag to it

00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:47,690
and so I didn't really consider that to

00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:50,179
be acceptable my second thing was that

00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:54,230
there's a master process that opens up

00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:56,750
all the all the networking channels like

00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:58,970
you'd expect but then you use the UNIX

00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:01,010
trick of all these file handles are just

00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:02,840
numbers down below you can pass that

00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:05,480
number the file no to a different

00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:07,039
process it can reopen it on its end and

00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:10,159
then it's processing the video stream

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:12,500
that works very well as long as that's

00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,480
the only thing you're doing if you

00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:16,760
wanted to dump to the file on top of

00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,250
that that separate process would have to

00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:23,330
take care of that it won't do it at it

00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:25,820
so because the master process no longer

00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:30,700
has control over that networking stream

00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:30,700
so it can't pass anything to that file

00:25:31,539 --> 00:25:38,960
so that's a by default this file know

00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:45,049
will be used so you'll have to deal with

00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:46,549
that yeah if you want to do both now

00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:52,460
getting into something a little

00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:56,000
different lumbus rover was something I

00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:58,460
started I had this RC car just sitting

00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,169
in my basement taking up space and I

00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:04,820
thought I should like do something with

00:26:00,169 --> 00:26:06,770
this and what I came up with was the

00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:09,649
Wampus rover and it's a combination of

00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:12,320
Raspberry Pi and that's running the purl

00:26:09,649 --> 00:26:14,299
side of thing and then Arduino will

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,220
communicate with the servos and the

00:26:14,299 --> 00:26:19,760
reason for that separation is that

00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:21,649
arduino has very nice libraries for

00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,570
connecting two servos electronic speed

00:26:21,649 --> 00:26:25,580
controllers it's also much more real

00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:28,820
time whereas the Raspberry Pi is running

00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:31,039
Linux and if linux decides it wants to

00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:33,350
write to a log file for the next two

00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:36,260
minutes your process just has to deal

00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:38,240
with that so that's not going to really

00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:39,919
work especially since I want to do kind

00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,929
of the same thing for a quadcopter you

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:44,419
imagine i'm going to write to a log file

00:26:41,929 --> 00:26:48,320
and now i'm flying into the law not

00:26:44,419 --> 00:26:50,559
going to work and so the Raspberry Pi

00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,980
end of it does kind of the heavy lifting

00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:56,610
since it's a Linux it can work

00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:58,770
any Wi-Fi adapter out there that linux

00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:01,440
will run and raspberry pi alpha is a

00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:04,790
very nice camera module haven't totally

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:08,610
gotten that part all the kinks working

00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:12,780
but it can stream the video back to the

00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:14,220
client and then kind of the main goal to

00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:16,410
be honest of this was not really to

00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:19,440
build a rover so much as decoupling the

00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:22,110
internals on you a pilot I started out

00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,520
writing this without trying not to make

00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:26,240
too many assumptions about the ar.drone

00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:29,640
but inevitably they all snuck in and

00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:32,760
doing this changed a lot of the code

00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:34,890
internally so that you can use either

00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:39,660
one it doesn't care which one you're

00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:41,640
actually using and we're I'm probably

00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:44,790
going to end up going with this is I'm

00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:47,510
just starting up a new hackerspace back

00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:49,710
in madison wisconsin my hometown and

00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:52,350
we're starting up these power wheels

00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:54,900
racing and we just gutted this one out

00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:56,429
and i don't know if you've been to the

00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:58,830
Maker Faires where they do the power

00:27:56,429 --> 00:28:01,830
wheels racing but this will probably run

00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:08,370
much the same internals that we used on

00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:12,330
the low RC car so things you can do in

00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:13,740
the future there's two different

00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:15,870
libraries if you want to do like a

00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:17,400
wiimote type thing two different

00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:20,790
libraries up on the see Pam that'll hook

00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:22,590
into that I fiddle around with them a

00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:27,000
little bit myself I couldn't quite get

00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:28,620
it to behave itself but I don't think

00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,380
they're actually specific to linux

00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:33,210
despite the name here I think they the

00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:34,980
libraries themselves will compile on

00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:38,070
Windows I don't know about the cpn

00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:40,559
modules but if you wanted to do a remote

00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:44,340
control like that those would be the way

00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:45,990
to do it google voice recognition this

00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:48,419
seems to have changed over the years a

00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:50,669
couple times but it's not an official

00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:53,880
API but the basic idea is you send a

00:28:50,669 --> 00:28:57,020
flac to this one yuri that google has

00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:59,429
and then it gives you back some json all

00:28:57,020 --> 00:29:00,940
potential things that you might have

00:28:59,429 --> 00:29:04,030
said in that flak

00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:06,190
I don't know that there's a peril module

00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:08,350
made for this so if you're looking for

00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:12,730
inspiration for a new perl module there

00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:14,590
you go another cool thing automatic

00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:16,600
stitching of images from bottom camera

00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:22,270
this will probably be a little easier

00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:23,800
with the opencv i think it has some

00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:27,030
things to stitch together images but the

00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:30,570
idea is you're just flying along

00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:32,880
below you and it will automatically make

00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:36,390
those into one big picture all the same

00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:39,210
time I'd also really like to see this on

00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:42,060
Android since Pearl 520 can compile an

00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:43,530
Android now and just really getting

00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:47,970
started on that so I don't know if it

00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:49,230
has everything we need to do that but in

00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:51,120
the future I really want to see these

00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:53,930
running on Android phones and even

00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:56,250
getting that video l put on there and

00:29:53,930 --> 00:30:00,480
because right now your only real option

00:29:56,250 --> 00:30:02,820
is Java than their other things people

00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,640
have hacked on this this is a Taser so

00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:07,430
you see this is the outdoor hall and

00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:10,260
these two aluminum strips here whenever

00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:13,260
skin touches these two it gives you a

00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:15,030
little shocked so what you do is you go

00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:16,410
fly these in parks and chase your

00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:23,190
friends around if they're not fast

00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:25,650
enough they get sotted some people have

00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:30,510
noted controlling them over Twitter I

00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:34,320
think this is a terrible idea but if you

00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:37,680
want to try it there go ahead a few

00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:41,490
other hacks this is how you would can to

00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:43,680
connect to an unsecured access point you

00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:45,270
have to kill the dhcp server on board

00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:47,790
since whatever access point you have

00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:50,010
probably already has a dhcp server kill

00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:54,000
that and then you just tell it to

00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:57,930
connect to this SSID and you feel it a

00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,580
static IP address on it the thing is

00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:01,530
you'll have to do this every time you

00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:05,370
restart it so every time you put in a

00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:09,660
new battery there is a way to get that

00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:11,400
to script it at startup um they will

00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:13,610
tell you that you void your warranty if

00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:17,850
you mess with the startup scripts so

00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:20,340
whatever extending the Wi-Fi range is a

00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:22,620
very popular one some people have also

00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:25,440
put in their own 2.4 gigahertz radios

00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:29,600
that's basically what they would use for

00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:32,190
more serious RC helicopters these days

00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:34,179
and that can get one and a half to two a

00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:37,269
nap mile or kilometer range

00:31:34,179 --> 00:31:41,049
and you won't be able to get the video

00:31:37,269 --> 00:31:43,659
output at that of course but does give

00:31:41,049 --> 00:31:47,429
you a very nice range this is something

00:31:43,659 --> 00:31:49,720
that the same company is coming out this

00:31:47,429 --> 00:31:52,570
they just announce it a few months ago

00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:54,129
and should be out this Christmas don't

00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:57,299
know how much it's going to cost her if

00:31:54,129 --> 00:32:00,820
its interface is anything like what the

00:31:57,299 --> 00:32:02,830
current AR drones like I'm really hoping

00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:05,080
they completely do away with everything

00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:07,600
they've done and re implement it because

00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:11,950
they made some very poor choices on some

00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:13,509
of the internal implementations and this

00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:18,309
is a very good opportunity to fix all

00:32:13,509 --> 00:32:20,649
that as far as I'm concerned and this is

00:32:18,309 --> 00:32:24,369
a much more serious quadcopter this is

00:32:20,649 --> 00:32:28,509
an ardupilot frame ardupilot is an

00:32:24,369 --> 00:32:31,269
arduino based autopilot and this is one

00:32:28,509 --> 00:32:34,570
that you can give it a series of GPS

00:32:31,269 --> 00:32:38,590
coordinates so fly here here here here

00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:41,740
and you can just let it go and there you

00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:44,679
so this is if you want to do a serious

00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:46,869
commercial UAV this is probably what you

00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:52,679
would use this is mostly a toy it's a

00:32:46,869 --> 00:32:52,679
lot of fun but it's a toy so questions

00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:19,970
um and that sugar oh so you have some

00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:30,930
way of telling it to move well you're

00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:33,460
just moving around yes yes

00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:36,340
yes that would definitely be something

00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:45,700
that opencv would be needed for on that

00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:51,460
would be very very cool no it's very

00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:55,330
much put running all the commands for

00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:57,220
y'all pitch roll right on your system it

00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:59,110
doesn't really have the intelligence to

00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:00,820
do things on its own no I think it does

00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:03,250
have is those built-in maneuvers like

00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:09,760
flipping and waving a couple of those

00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:13,350
those it does on its own but some people

00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:17,020
have started on some custom firmwares

00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:18,580
that has promised along those lines but

00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:20,320
it's just getting started because I

00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:26,620
don't think it was cracked all that long

00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:28,840
ago so I think it'll lift it but it's a

00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:36,419
matter of kayaking to its electronics I

00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:41,419
guess yeah all the songs down yesterday

00:34:36,419 --> 00:34:45,059
approximately sideways um not for this

00:34:41,419 --> 00:34:49,849
since again this is just a toy ardupilot

00:34:45,059 --> 00:34:49,849
would definitely be along those lines

00:34:51,409 --> 00:35:04,589
either one yeah ardupilot gives you a

00:34:56,909 --> 00:35:05,700
lot more options that way okay okay i'm

00:35:04,589 --> 00:35:07,950
going to be around i'm going to be

00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:09,119
mostly in the hardware hackathon so if

00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:11,760
you want to play around with it just

00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:15,440
duck come see me in there i'll spend a

00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,440
lot of time in there so thank

00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,220
