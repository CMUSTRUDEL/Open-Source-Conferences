Title: Kevin Metcalf - ‎student Perl code, head-desk injuries, and you‎
Publication date: 2014-06-24
Playlist: YAPC::NA 2014
Description: 
	Last year's hilarious talk - update with this year's mistakes, too! Beginning students make beginner mistakes, just like the rest of us. Sometimes comical, sometimes painful, bad code can teach us as much as good code - sometimes more. From eq vs == to fork() while fork(), learn what not to do - preferably before you do it.

(Kevin Metcalf teaches Perl at De Anza College in Cupertino, CA, where he also works as a system administrator.)

you

00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:21,360
equals key twice what you didn't you may

00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,070
run across something like that but

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,450
eventually you know rather rapidly you

00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:27,410
stop making that mistake and you move on

00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:30,240
to this one what's the problem here

00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:33,450
numeric equivalency right when we're not

00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:35,160
testing the correct equivalency now you

00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,660
may be surprised to find out that this

00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,850
is a mistake I still make with some

00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,980
regularity and before you think how can

00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:42,600
anyone with brain activity of love

00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:46,170
mayonnaise make this mistake with any

00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:48,720
frequency the answer is half of my job

00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,450
involves writing pearl and then for the

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:56,280
other half of my job I have to write

00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:58,530
anyone guess PHP yeah where you don't

00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,510
have necessarily that same kind of

00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:03,270
distinction there so it happens to me

00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:05,370
and I tend to go rather easy on students

00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,380
who make that mistake in the first few

00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:09,930
weeks of class so what can we take away

00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:12,630
from this you know a little bit of a

00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:16,110
discussion about eq versus equal equal

00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:19,350
versus equal well come away knowing

00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:21,660
about humility right know your place if

00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:24,330
you are a senior programmer and you work

00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:27,090
with junior programmers you're allowed

00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:29,430
to be fallible that's okay you're

00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:31,200
allowed to tell them hey look this is a

00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:33,480
mistake I made don't make this mistake

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,180
that's how everyone becomes a better

00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:38,480
programmer and you know the fact of the

00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:41,220
matter is anyone can make a typo

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,959
sometimes when you make a typo it's not

00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:45,690
necessarily going to be seen by a lot of

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,600
people other times when you make a typo

00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:53,640
it may end up being seen by a lot of

00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:54,989
people so those are the basics let's

00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,980
talk a little bit about control flow

00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:58,580
these tend to be slightly more

00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:02,580
entertaining um here's an interesting

00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:06,720
submission that I got how many of you

00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:10,670
are fans of the unless else if else way

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:13,410
of doing things some of you are yeah

00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:15,750
when it's really late at night and I'm

00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:19,500
grading I really don't like getting some

00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:24,650
machines like this I call this the wait

00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,650
what way of doing things but I also

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,840
hahahaha yes Benden / 06 if that'll make

00:04:29,289 --> 00:04:34,389
my grading easier I got this one in a

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,919
final exam submission I'll give you a

00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:38,650
second to wrap your head around that one

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:41,500
ah the main problem here is i graded

00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:43,180
this on a small screen it was not

00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,190
written on a small screen and thus I was

00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:48,009
grading what you're seeing and it was

00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:49,990
all those fancy little clothes braces

00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:53,650
that helped me figure out that this is

00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:56,650
really just one long conditional actual

00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:59,199
leaf but yeah there are a lot of

00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:01,870
problems within less in nested levels of

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,910
if forget about the efficiency thing for

00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:06,180
now let's talk about knowing when it's

00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:09,400
the right time to deal with abstraction

00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:11,349
right if you find yourself with lots of

00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,199
levels of nesting to think about

00:05:11,349 --> 00:05:16,419
abstracting it's probably okay now if

00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:18,580
you're like me and you have these you

00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:21,250
know weird looking tab stop kinds of

00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:24,490
things that are going on know that some

00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:26,680
people tend to use for spaces for tab

00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,729
stops other people use eight spaces how

00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,010
many of you have read pearl best

00:05:27,729 --> 00:05:32,650
practices right what's the

00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:34,240
recommendation for literal spaces now

00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:36,909
I'm not going to tell you you have to do

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,229
for literal spaces that's a philosophy

00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:40,510
kind of choice that you can make on your

00:05:38,229 --> 00:05:43,419
own but at least walk away from this

00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:45,909
knowing it's probably not a good idea to

00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:48,010
assume that your replacement will be

00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:50,800
editing your code on the same side

00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:52,810
screen that you wrote it on or using the

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,110
same number of tabs but so just be aware

00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:59,259
of things like that this was another

00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:09,909
interesting example that I got what's

00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:14,229
going on here we have decided we really

00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:16,240
like tabs it's it's not necessarily

00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:18,639
doing what you would anticipate it's

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,349
going to be doing on the first one yes I

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:24,009
actually got that submission from a

00:06:20,349 --> 00:06:28,479
student you may think I'm kidding but no

00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:33,449
so what about this one who sees a

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:33,449
problem here what's the problem

00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:39,810
yeah you've got an unattainable else

00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,250
people never actually get there now a

00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:43,169
lot of times people say stuff like this

00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:44,940
and they go oh it's not like anyone's

00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:47,190
ever going to do something like that in

00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,930
production the problem is there are ways

00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:55,160
to put that in production that are not

00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:55,160
always obvious what are we doing here

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,050
what if you're on Windows you might end

00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:02,310
up with negative bids on certain

00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:04,740
versions of Windows under certain

00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:07,349
circumstances so yeah this is one of

00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,750
those times when you know you don't

00:07:07,349 --> 00:07:11,190
necessarily get an error message but the

00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:14,490
code might not be doing what you

00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:16,349
expected it to do the worst thing that

00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:18,210
you would run across here though is when

00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:20,960
you get the follow up assignment that

00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:23,699
says okay in the event that you fail to

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,800
actually fork let's do something

00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:28,380
differently and then you go in and you

00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,050
add all of that functionality where you

00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:35,340
think it should go but it turns out to

00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:36,870
never actually get there so yeah that's

00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,789
one of those cases where paying

00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:42,060
attention to your control flow can

00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:44,130
sometimes be really important so some of

00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:46,710
you may worry that a student who writes

00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:48,960
code like this would never be able to

00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:51,210
write a program that could be marketable

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,740
right anything that these people right

00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:55,889
there's no way you could actually sell

00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:58,050
that but I am here to tell you that if I

00:07:55,889 --> 00:08:02,610
I am here to tell you that there is a

00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:07,320
market for absolutely anything in this

00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:11,520
world I am not joking there is a market

00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:18,060
for absolutely anything do you believe

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:20,099
me yet Wow so yeah that's control flow

00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:24,750
now let's move on to some stuff I call

00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:26,639
wait why I'm still not sure what that

00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:29,099
sign is I've had two people tell me what

00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,889
it says and I'd still don't get it so at

00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:33,240
the risk of being somewhat politically

00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:34,649
incorrect I'll show you some of the

00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,690
other code examples I've got from

00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:40,200
students and we can talk about some of

00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:43,469
them so sometimes students submit

00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:46,580
assignments when they expect they are

00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:51,630
accomplishing something somewhat clever

00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:53,850
what are we doing here we've created a

00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:56,940
subroutine called print with new line

00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:59,370
that Prince whatever you pass it sort of

00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,780
and adds a new line but it doesn't

00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:02,310
actually print everything that you pass

00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:05,580
it just part of what you're passing it

00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:08,040
right there's two kinds of abstraction

00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,900
there's over abstraction and under

00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,100
abstraction now beginning front well

00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,020
there's actually more types than that

00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,880
but we'll go with that for now beginning

00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,710
programmers tend to fall into the under

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,990
abstraction category you'll have in

00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:21,060
nested levels of kind of thing and you

00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:22,950
know that sort of happens but a lot of

00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:25,380
times advanced programmers like to over

00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:27,240
abstract things or prematurely abstract

00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:34,590
things and stuff like that why is over

00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:36,960
abstraction bad well yeah you may not

00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:38,850
end up needing it and now somebody else

00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,770
has to try and fix your code and they

00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:43,020
have to figure out why why is this

00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:45,630
abstracted because there must be some

00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:47,490
reason right so I can't unobstructed or

00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:49,620
I might break something so yeah it's

00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:50,910
sometimes a good exhibit about that kind

00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,190
of stuff so if we go back to the code

00:09:50,910 --> 00:10:00,810
here what is the proper way to handle

00:09:53,190 --> 00:10:02,280
this it use modern pearls say ya know

00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:03,660
clearly the correct thing to do here is

00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:07,530
to shift the variable off of an

00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:10,170
underscore now that was one of those

00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:12,720
places you were supposed to laugh that

00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:16,070
particular comment much like both under

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:20,130
abstraction and over abstraction well oh

00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:23,700
nevermind I'm not even gonna say it

00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:27,240
alright so what about those times when

00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:30,060
you want to tell your successor why you

00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:34,890
did something in a certain way how do we

00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:36,480
accomplish this what do we use I don't

00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:38,520
know what you use I use documentation

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,400
this is how I come up with with figuring

00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:44,790
this out and my general rule of them is

00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:48,110
when in doubt document and if you've got

00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:50,700
way too much documentation make it funny

00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:53,580
just sort of it now I understand not

00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:56,580
everything needs to be documented right

00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:58,560
there are some times that you just don't

00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,699
need to put it out there and there are

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,980
some people

00:10:59,699 --> 00:11:05,819
don't like to be told that they need to

00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:07,559
document things and you know I'm not

00:11:05,819 --> 00:11:09,419
going to sit here and tell you you have

00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:10,799
to document everything instead I will

00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:12,989
show you what my students have

00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:15,230
documented and we'll see maybe what we

00:11:12,989 --> 00:11:18,629
can come away from from this with so

00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:22,169
here's a particular comment i got in an

00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:25,559
assignment submitted how many of you

00:11:22,169 --> 00:11:27,389
have used this code yeah how many of you

00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:30,449
wrote socket communications before we

00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:32,699
auto flush things right same way after

00:11:30,449 --> 00:11:34,739
having a somewhat lengthy discussion

00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:36,839
with Randall I basically decided that

00:11:34,739 --> 00:11:39,299
this particular comment submitted by a

00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:41,189
student was in fact an appropriate way

00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:43,919
to document this function that's that's

00:11:41,189 --> 00:11:45,869
perfectly acceptable you know I'm okay

00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:47,249
with pearl golf if you are but the fact

00:11:45,869 --> 00:11:50,839
of the matter is maybe it's witchcraft

00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:53,040
right I got this one sometimes

00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:55,829
documentation gives you a little bit of

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,839
insight into the psyche of the coder at

00:11:55,829 --> 00:12:01,379
the time that the document was written

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:04,949
right you know sometimes they struggle

00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:07,559
with things and yeah it's as it as a

00:12:04,949 --> 00:12:09,509
teacher of the language getting a

00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:12,269
comment like this actually gives me a

00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:13,919
little bit of insight into how I'm doing

00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:16,399
as a teacher so I sort of like to see

00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:18,539
these but from the standpoint of a

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:21,149
programmer who's about to push something

00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:23,699
into production perhaps this is not the

00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:26,359
most appropriate use of the comment

00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:29,339
space that you could have there now I

00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:30,989
actually require my students to document

00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:34,799
certain things and occasionally I get

00:12:30,989 --> 00:12:36,029
documentation like this so sockaddr end

00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:43,439
does something with the port and

00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:46,709
modified server address okay thanks okay

00:12:43,439 --> 00:12:49,049
this documentation may not be needed and

00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:51,929
it sort of leads me to this concept of

00:12:49,049 --> 00:12:55,019
documenting the why and not necessarily

00:12:51,929 --> 00:12:57,389
the what if you know what I mean it's

00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:59,689
like if I already have that particular

00:12:57,389 --> 00:13:04,199
line of code your comment is unnecessary

00:12:59,689 --> 00:13:08,789
it's like bacon fries ok I have bacon I

00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:10,209
don't need bacon fries none of you guys

00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:13,029
like bacon apparently I'm

00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:14,259
I thought this was a fairly good example

00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:15,610
but you know it's one of those things

00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:16,990
where sometimes you run across the

00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:18,639
comments you're expecting one thing you

00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:20,379
get something else it's not a good idea

00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:24,660
to give people something they're not

00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:27,459
expecting that just tends not to

00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:30,899
generate the appropriate response from

00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:33,220
people is unnecessarily upsetting so

00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:36,069
occasionally the comments I get from

00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:39,459
students are more notes to me then they

00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:40,689
are notes to future self I tend to

00:13:39,459 --> 00:13:42,369
recommend if you're going to write a

00:13:40,689 --> 00:13:43,660
comment write it for yourself several

00:13:42,369 --> 00:13:44,800
years from now when you're trying to

00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:47,559
figure out what on earth you were

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,949
attempting to accomplish but there are

00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:52,569
those cases where writing documentation

00:13:49,949 --> 00:13:54,759
even for somebody else gives you a

00:13:52,569 --> 00:13:56,319
little bit more insight into your code I

00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:58,869
really wish I could have blown this

00:13:56,319 --> 00:14:01,929
slide up to show you but it's a rather

00:13:58,869 --> 00:14:05,050
lengthy reason why this individual is

00:14:01,929 --> 00:14:07,179
not actually doing a particular bit of

00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:08,290
code and he goes on and on and on and on

00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,970
until he gets the very end he says

00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:11,350
they'll come to think of it I could have

00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:13,660
implemented that something in the time

00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:15,759
it took me to type this comment so

00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:18,490
occasionally we get insights into our

00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:21,240
code from our own documentation that's

00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:24,309
not a bad thing anybody ever felt that

00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:26,860
documentation can substitute for some

00:14:24,309 --> 00:14:28,420
level of planning and get you to the

00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,730
point where you realize there's a better

00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:32,559
way to accomplish something right yeah

00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:34,439
so you know it's not a bad idea when in

00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:36,339
doubt document in paragraph but but

00:14:34,439 --> 00:14:38,799
sometimes there are parts of your code

00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:43,019
where you really don't expect people to

00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:45,670
go what's the classic example of this

00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:47,290
your object oriented code right you want

00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:48,819
people to be using the objects but you

00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:50,139
don't necessarily want people going in

00:14:48,819 --> 00:14:52,199
and mucking around with the inner bits

00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:54,509
of the object well in that case

00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:58,019
sometimes people will introduce

00:14:54,509 --> 00:15:01,629
documentation into that area that

00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:03,730
perhaps okay this is an interesting way

00:15:01,629 --> 00:15:05,860
to accomplish that if you don't know

00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:07,299
what bless does probably you shouldn't

00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:09,639
be monkeying around in the constructor

00:15:07,299 --> 00:15:12,009
anyway so okay I'll give you I'll give

00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:14,429
you at least a smiley face when i return

00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:17,559
your assignment for something like that

00:15:14,429 --> 00:15:22,269
but not giving documentation when it's

00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:23,320
necessary that i don't like i ran across

00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:25,120
this exam

00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:34,030
full who can tell me real quick what

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:36,160
it's doing right so here's what's going

00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:38,380
on they decided they were going to

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,090
choose a very appropriate a variable

00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:42,190
name here to make it easier no this is

00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:44,140
from a tic-tac-toe game and what they've

00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:46,930
done is they've created a hash that

00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:49,960
map's a numeric representation of the

00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:52,120
board to the row and column index of the

00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,020
array in which you can find the value

00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:58,830
which is stored in the two-dimensional

00:15:53,020 --> 00:16:01,090
array right I submit that perhaps

00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:03,520
formatting this slightly differently

00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:06,190
could have been really useful how about

00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:08,140
formatting at three by three or even one

00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:10,480
long line or something that would have

00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:11,650
made it line up better yeah that took me

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,680
a while to figure it out now this is a

00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:17,080
digression and I understand that if you

00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:19,150
ever get to the point where you have to

00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,590
write code for a professor or for

00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:23,170
somebody who's going to be reviewing it

00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:24,970
later on bear in mind my interest in the

00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:27,580
line of code that you have written goes

00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:29,890
down exponentially proportionate to the

00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:32,920
time it takes me to figure out what that

00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:34,900
code was attempting to accomplish if it

00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:37,330
takes me five minutes to unravel one

00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:41,530
line of your code I'm not all that

00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:43,420
interested in giving you an a just put

00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:46,450
the laughs at that point they took it

00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:47,830
she like no you're a scary terrible

00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:49,870
professor I'm not going to take your

00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:51,910
class that's okay we could keep do that

00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:53,560
so some of my colleagues tell their

00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:55,630
students just write self documenting

00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,370
code your code shouldn't need any

00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:59,230
documents and I know that there are some

00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:01,090
places where self documenting code is

00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:03,220
what they're expected to do the reason I

00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:05,530
require documentation is that not every

00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:07,060
place says self documenting code is the

00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:08,980
right thing so I want students to have

00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:10,810
actually been exposed to documentation

00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:15,670
before they get a job where they're

00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:18,820
expected to do it now my big problem

00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:22,000
though with self documenting code is the

00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:24,760
kind of documentation within the code

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,010
that I get from students it ends up not

00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:30,720
actually being code that's easily self

00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:34,240
documented and at best it's like

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:36,790
directly relationally ironic to

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,230
something and you never quite figure out

00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:41,850
what it is they're attempting to

00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:44,260
accomplish with that bit of code and so

00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:46,450
documentation really should be all about

00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:48,340
telling you why you're attempting to

00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:53,590
accomplish something not what it is

00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:56,700
you're attempting to accomplish no I

00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:56,700
can't I don't remember what I said

00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:00,270
anyway so

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,440
makes it a little bit easier for people

00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:11,179
who are reading it later on if you're

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,000
not talking about comments in the code

00:18:11,179 --> 00:18:15,799
give funny examples if you're interested

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,940
in what that looks like read the camel

00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:19,100
book there's all sorts of them in there

00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:22,190
I chuckle of that all the time but the

00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:25,130
fact of the matter is if you can't

00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:27,200
figure out what a particular bit of code

00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:29,720
is doing in such a way that it's easy to

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:33,340
document it perhaps the better solution

00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:37,039
is to refactor whatever that thing is

00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:48,020
because let's face it planning is a good

00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:52,700
thing I have to assume that was done on

00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:55,490
purpose otherwise I'm going to have an

00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:58,610
existential crisis so let's move on to

00:18:55,490 --> 00:19:00,740
communicating clearly my father taught

00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:03,260
English for 35 years before he retired

00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:05,780
from the public school system and he

00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:09,740
instilled in me this concept that

00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:13,640
dangling modifiers are dangerous and his

00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:15,950
classic example of this was a particular

00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,840
thing that he read that said having many

00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:23,450
dangerous curves she drove carefully

00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:25,520
down the mountain road I'm not sure

00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:30,049
you're conveying what you meant to

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:32,419
convey in that statement so in as much

00:19:30,049 --> 00:19:35,780
as it happens in English it also kind of

00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:38,120
happens in Perl but continuing on with

00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:40,039
the English example I had a student who

00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:42,950
came up to me after class one time and

00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:44,240
said what is the deck of cards because

00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:46,490
we were going to be talking about an

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,990
algorithm that shuffles cards and then

00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:49,520
deals at hand and she said what the deck

00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:50,809
of cards it took me a while to

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,980
understand what she was saying she was

00:19:50,809 --> 00:19:54,799
pretty fresh off the boat it was an

00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:58,549
international student and I actually

00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:59,900
keep in my in my laptop case a deck of

00:19:58,549 --> 00:20:01,159
cards because sometimes I get on the

00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,320
plane and I need to play solitaire or

00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:04,549
something to amuse myself and so I went

00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,080
and I got them and I said this is a deck

00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:07,880
of cards they look like this you can

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,370
build deal things and she said what is

00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,929
that can I see that I thought something

00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:13,700
was a language barrier but it turns out

00:20:11,929 --> 00:20:17,540
where she came from she had actually

00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:18,919
never seen them and so I had to at some

00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:21,919
point at some level

00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:23,299
explain what card games are and what a

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,549
deck of cards is and what are they

00:20:23,299 --> 00:20:27,590
consist of and things like that but it

00:20:25,549 --> 00:20:30,080
made jumping into the exercise quite a

00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:32,509
bit harder than I expected it was going

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,100
to be and so now that same assignment

00:20:32,509 --> 00:20:35,720
includes at the top if you're unfamiliar

00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,070
with a deck of cards here's the

00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,269
wikipedia entry for this here's the

00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:40,249
likka pedia entry for poker you know

00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:42,590
things like that it's just sort of a way

00:20:40,249 --> 00:20:45,980
of figuring out assumptions i didn't

00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:48,139
know i was making right but then you've

00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:50,509
got the other students not the ones that

00:20:48,139 --> 00:20:52,369
don't know what a deck of cards is but

00:20:50,509 --> 00:20:54,289
the other ones it turns out one of my

00:20:52,369 --> 00:20:57,590
students was a professional poker player

00:20:54,289 --> 00:20:59,809
and he was not happy with a simple

00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:01,929
shuffle algorithm he decided he wanted

00:20:59,809 --> 00:21:05,210
to ride an algorithm that would do a

00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:06,679
realistic casino casino shuffle and so

00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:07,940
he went through the trouble of doing it

00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:09,980
and it had appropriate levels of

00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:11,499
abstraction and it turned out to be it

00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:13,909
turned out to be a really interesting

00:21:11,499 --> 00:21:15,950
assignment that he's submitted but you

00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:17,029
know you question your assumptions maybe

00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:18,950
you think people are at a certain level

00:21:17,029 --> 00:21:20,539
some of them are going to be below that

00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:22,940
level some of them are going to be above

00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:25,759
that level so when you're attempting to

00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:28,909
communicate to the user what it is you

00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:32,059
want the user to do I recommend being

00:21:28,909 --> 00:21:34,489
very concise and very precise in what it

00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:37,909
is your expectations and assumptions are

00:21:34,489 --> 00:21:39,649
so another example we were doing

00:21:37,909 --> 00:21:40,970
client-server communications and one of

00:21:39,649 --> 00:21:42,950
the things I told the student they could

00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:45,559
do was to run a server on the machine

00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:47,539
and then try and tell that to that port

00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:48,980
if you can connect that tells you at

00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:50,419
least the thing is running on that port

00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:52,669
it's just sort of a convenient way to do

00:21:50,419 --> 00:21:54,559
your troubleshooting so the student

00:21:52,669 --> 00:21:56,210
opened up the linux laptop ran the

00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,980
server program on the laptop and then

00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:59,090
ssh Dover to the server where they're

00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:02,359
supposed to be running all their coat

00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:04,879
and said telnet localhost and could not

00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:07,009
figure out why they couldn't see it and

00:22:04,879 --> 00:22:09,679
I had to explain that local host doesn't

00:22:07,009 --> 00:22:11,779
mean the machine local to your hands

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,359
it's the machine local to the code

00:22:11,779 --> 00:22:15,679
wherever it happens to be running she's

00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:18,139
like oh so I have to give it my IP

00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:22,159
address so tell that 192 no no no no no

00:22:18,139 --> 00:22:24,139
no this is not the appropriate SSH out

00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,179
and run the server on the server and

00:22:24,139 --> 00:22:29,059
then ssh out onto the server in town

00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:31,249
that localhost and that just caused all

00:22:29,059 --> 00:22:32,580
sorts of confusion now the prerequisite

00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:35,760
for this class in

00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:37,169
the unix class so in theory the

00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,120
assumption should have been appropriate

00:22:37,169 --> 00:22:40,649
that a student should know about these

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,659
kinds of things but you know sometimes

00:22:40,649 --> 00:22:43,740
people slip through the cracks or they

00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:45,440
don't actually learn something in a

00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:48,179
class that you expect them to learn so I

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:58,470
learned very quickly to question

00:22:48,179 --> 00:23:02,580
assumptions so yeah the question is what

00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:04,830
type of cat is this so anyway so let's

00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:06,210
talk about formatting I had a particular

00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:07,500
assignment that I submitted to the

00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:08,760
students and I said you have to do X

00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,769
they said ok I got a bunch of

00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,970
assignments back I would run the code it

00:23:10,769 --> 00:23:12,899
would take a second or two to run and

00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:14,159
then it would come back and it would

00:23:12,899 --> 00:23:15,990
give me my prompt and I could grade what

00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:19,289
they were doing so I ran one students

00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:21,000
example and I waited and I waited and it

00:23:19,289 --> 00:23:21,990
never actually came back that's all my

00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,010
cloud I'm gonna go do something else so

00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:24,090
I went to do something else when I came

00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:27,210
back and it was still sitting there and

00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:29,760
I'm like why don't I have a command oh I

00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:30,929
do have a command prompt you just didn't

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,679
put a new line at the end of your

00:23:30,929 --> 00:23:37,289
program so I didn't see the even a

00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:39,690
single character in your feedback to the

00:23:37,289 --> 00:23:40,980
user can make a difference between

00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:43,889
whether something is simple to

00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:45,840
understand or somewhat more complex to

00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:47,370
understand when you get to the point

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,760
that you want to communicate clearly

00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:52,799
about how you want the user to interact

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,570
with your program might be a good idea

00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:57,690
to think about things like that test it

00:23:54,570 --> 00:24:00,659
with various things what about user

00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:02,850
feedback well sometimes when you're

00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:05,669
grading a whole bunch of assignments the

00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:08,399
way you get user feedback from the

00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:10,500
program can surprise you a little bit I

00:24:08,399 --> 00:24:12,510
was not expecting zoid-zoid Berg in the

00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,889
middle of a timeout routine but I got it

00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:15,779
you know that's okay that was kind of

00:24:13,889 --> 00:24:19,289
funny but when you're choosing file

00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:21,990
names that's a problem see I didn't used

00:24:19,289 --> 00:24:24,210
to care about file names I used to tell

00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:25,529
my students just call it whatever you

00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:27,149
want as long as you upload it to the

00:24:25,529 --> 00:24:29,399
system under your account I can I can

00:24:27,149 --> 00:24:31,649
find it and then one assignment came

00:24:29,399 --> 00:24:33,120
back and only one person bothered to

00:24:31,649 --> 00:24:34,710
include their name in their assignment

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,970
and they were all sitting on my machine

00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:37,559
while I was trying to grade them and

00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:40,679
there was no comment saying who did what

00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:41,850
or anything so I eventually was able to

00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:43,139
figure it out by you know

00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:43,850
cross-referencing thing in the course

00:24:43,139 --> 00:24:45,679
management

00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:47,990
and where they actually uploaded

00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:49,220
everything but I decided since they were

00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:52,010
going to give me such a hard time

00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:55,850
figuring out who had what I would return

00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:57,620
their grades in a similar manner so when

00:24:55,850 --> 00:25:00,710
I came back I wrote all their grades on

00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:02,419
the board and I said have fun they said

00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:10,179
how do we know who's great is who I said

00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:14,390
how do I know his assignment issues and

00:25:10,179 --> 00:25:17,809
what we all learned that day was don't

00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:19,940
make your colleagues become evil that's

00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:21,770
a bad idea I guess what I'm trying to

00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:24,220
say is be mindful of others be

00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:27,289
considerate be somewhat compassionate

00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:29,919
don't make people evil more to the point

00:25:27,289 --> 00:25:32,870
don't make people ask for directions

00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:35,570
that's not always the right thing to do

00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:41,030
it just makes them turn a little bit

00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:43,820
evil that may be my favorite slide of

00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:45,350
all I like that one so learning to

00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:47,409
communicate clearly don't make

00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:49,669
assumptions that's a pretty good one

00:25:47,409 --> 00:25:52,190
here's a tip if you're writing a unix

00:25:49,669 --> 00:25:55,070
utility that dies i recommend dying with

00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:57,830
usage as opposed to just dying with

00:25:55,070 --> 00:26:02,809
insult that's not necessarily the

00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:05,929
appropriate way to handle that see i had

00:26:02,809 --> 00:26:07,730
a student who decided he was going to

00:26:05,929 --> 00:26:10,280
submit 10 late assignments altogether

00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:11,330
the day before the final okay fine i'll

00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,740
go through and grade them and as I'm

00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:15,980
grading them I get to this one and I see

00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:18,080
yeah maybe not the best way to tell me

00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:20,360
which lab that was and what I'm supposed

00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,940
to be doing well let's move on to

00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:24,500
efficiency what's my time looking like

00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:27,260
oh well we're doing great okay so

00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:29,000
efficiency there are other talks that

00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:30,320
are all about efficiency and some of

00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,720
them are really really good about

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,070
efficiency and most of those people are

00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,200
way better at efficiency than I will

00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:38,570
ever be so I will tell you about certain

00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:40,760
kinds of efficiency to avoid in the

00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:42,220
sense that somebody once submitted an

00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:45,380
assignment to me where they did not

00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:48,919
here's one of my surprising ones that I

00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:52,159
got in back to that tic-tac-toe example

00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:53,179
I told people pick a random spot for

00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,919
your you know you're going to have a

00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:56,480
user play tic-tac-toe with you pick a

00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:58,400
random spot you know

00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,080
but that spot has to not have a move

00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,299
already in it it can't be an excerpt oh

00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,190
already okay so here's the algorithm

00:27:02,299 --> 00:27:05,690
they came up with pick a random spot and

00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:08,570
see if there's something there if not do

00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:12,380
it again now when you only have nine

00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:14,900
things to check and let's say there's

00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:16,760
already eight moves it's pretty obvious

00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:18,320
what the last one should be and you may

00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,120
cycle a few times but the fact of the

00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,770
matter is it's going to appear to the

00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:23,990
user as though this all happened

00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:27,140
instantaneously but what happens if you

00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:29,900
have nine billion records and you use an

00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:31,760
algorithm like this it's probably not

00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:39,919
going to look instantaneous to the user

00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:52,370
I'm just guessing on that one so what's

00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:54,380
that off by 1139 good that you didn't

00:27:52,370 --> 00:28:01,070
actually want to put something in one of

00:27:54,380 --> 00:28:02,750
the spots I gather yeah yeah even if

00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:04,130
there's something else there I actually

00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:05,120
got someone's code who did just that

00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:12,500
they didn't care whether there was

00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:18,410
something there or not that's true that

00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:22,100
that would take a long time yeah I was

00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:23,600
not let you wish yeah so here's another

00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,940
particular part of efficiency that we

00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:29,030
were talking about now I assigned a

00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:31,640
program where we were going to sort of

00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:34,040
monitor what was happening with top in

00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:36,260
another window and see how clients

00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:38,299
server in or around sorry how forking

00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:41,030
works with you know processes and how

00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:42,350
these things work out and so okay we're

00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:44,179
going to go ahead and we're going to die

00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:46,549
if we can't fork but if the process ID

00:28:44,179 --> 00:28:50,240
is zero then what does that tell us

00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:53,000
about this particular branch we're the

00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,320
child process right because kid pit is

00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,120
zero so we're going to kill off the

00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,990
child and then we're going to sleep and

00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,460
then the parents going to spawn another

00:28:56,990 --> 00:29:01,580
child so this is how we were supposed to

00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:03,710
be doing things well one of the students

00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:04,820
who submitted an assignment did

00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:07,520
something a little bit differently

00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:09,940
bouncing code online and submitted it

00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,940
like that

00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:19,250
what's going to happen now fork bomb

00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:21,080
yeah they were really surprised when

00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:23,300
this one didn't work out quite the way

00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:25,700
they were expecting and they said how

00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,720
come when i run my script for a few

00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,820
minutes it looks like things are

00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:32,630
happening but then my terminal session

00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:34,610
hangs yeah the reason your terminal

00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:37,220
session hangs is that we set a fairly

00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:41,570
low proc limit on the server because you

00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:43,190
might do something like this so yeah the

00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:44,930
other side of that i came across was one

00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:46,340
of my students who said well but i don't

00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:49,370
have to worry about that i'm on OS 10

00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:52,670
you can't fork bomb OS 10 i said oh

00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:54,950
really do a pearl dashi for quark he's

00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:57,350
like okay and what he didn't remember

00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:59,810
was that on his laptop at the terminal

00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:01,640
he was logged in this route and he ran

00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:04,460
that code guess what his laptop did

00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:06,350
after that nothing that's exactly what

00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:09,500
it did after that he couldn't get the

00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:11,960
mouse to me he got nothing did you did

00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:15,080
yeah that was a hard power off on that

00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:16,730
one so efficiency even one character or

00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:20,120
two can make a huge difference in

00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:23,980
efficiency so let's see conclusions are

00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:27,110
we out of time yet no should we be yes

00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:28,070
what's that 20 minutes wow you guys

00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:30,050
going to have all sorts of free time

00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:31,370
after this one so you can ask me any

00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:34,160
kind of questions you most okay so

00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:39,620
conclusions thank you for letting me

00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:41,270
vent I enjoyed doing it be patient with

00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:43,460
people who are submitting code that's

00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:47,180
maybe not at the level of your code

00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:48,350
that's okay be kind to people be humbled

00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:50,960
when you're interacting with people that

00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:55,400
submit code use your coding powers for

00:30:50,960 --> 00:31:00,710
good rather than for evil and I hope

00:30:55,400 --> 00:31:04,630
that at some level I've sort of changed

00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:07,550
your perspective about a few things

00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:09,320
because the first time you try and do

00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:14,350
something even if it's a relatively

00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:14,350
simple task it's possible to mess it up

00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:20,820
that was a big poster in a train station

00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:23,870
it's hard to see when you blow it up

00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:26,190
they just move the pages around but yeah

00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:35,760
don't leave your co-workers looking for

00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:37,470
a paddle so questions they don't know

00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,570
that idiom they don't get the joke okay

00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:42,390
I'm sorry it was the best I could come

00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:48,799
up with for an ending to that time no

00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:48,799
questions okay well thanks

00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,780
