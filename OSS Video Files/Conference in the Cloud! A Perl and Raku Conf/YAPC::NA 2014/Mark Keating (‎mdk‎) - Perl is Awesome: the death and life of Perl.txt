Title: Mark Keating (‎mdk‎) - Perl is Awesome: the death and life of Perl
Publication date: 2014-06-23
Playlist: YAPC::NA 2014
Description: 
	Once again the blakey folk that lurk around comment posts, dubious statistical sites and social media beartraps that litter the internet have called forth the demise of Perl. It was so sudden, yet drawn out. Apparent when you close one eye and look at the figures upside down hanging from a train in a Budapest station.

In this keynote Mark will take a look at some other figures and arguments that support his statement the 'death and life of Perl'.

After a vague roll in the stats we will take a look at the elements that actually breathe continual life into Perl and together we will discover why Mark thinks Perl is Awesome.

There will be flippancy, slight surrealism, the occasional jibe, and humour extracted from the mean streets of Halton.

Aimed at everyone but for the conference neophyte a gentle introduction to the three days of talks. Be there, there could be bribes.

for that just a quick thing about the

00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:13,420
lightning talks

00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,010
advertisements in between the speakers

00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:18,029
so if you have something to advertise

00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:21,640
like I know a good place for lunch or

00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:23,650
we're hiring or we're having a BA or

00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,509
whatever else you have to say in between

00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,980
the speakers wander up close and then

00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:28,210
you'll be using this microphone while

00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:31,869
they're playing with their computers

00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:33,610
there but that's still two hours away

00:00:31,869 --> 00:00:36,630
right now we're gonna worry about our

00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:42,010
first speaker and I need to say that I

00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:43,810
you should be worried but I do not where

00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:47,520
the current yap c badge at the current

00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:51,120
yap see I switch today I'm wearing

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,730
Chicago number one in 2006 and

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:57,700
Copenhagen from 2008 I will be switching

00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:59,950
at lunch and at the afternoon snack each

00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:01,540
day I have nine different sets eight

00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:03,820
teen yap seats so you'll want to wander

00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,989
by and see me a couple times a day to

00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,030
see what I'm wearing

00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:08,799
however I'm not the only one who's

00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:11,290
making a bold fashion choice of this

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:14,020
direction somebody brought more than

00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:16,630
enough shoes that he can switch and have

00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:25,179
different shoes every day and in the

00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:27,880
evening here he is he is the wild man of

00:01:25,179 --> 00:01:32,490
Shadowcat who's held in check only by

00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,490
the calm reasonable zone of Matt's route

00:01:34,899 --> 00:01:39,710
the leader of the enlightened pearl

00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,770
organization that does such neat things

00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:44,450
is sending a newbie to some conferences

00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:46,460
the organizer of several conferences

00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:51,700
including London pearl workshop the

00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:51,700
dynamic languages and the QA hackathons

00:01:53,660 --> 00:02:02,060
marque the minute of the TPF here he is

00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:02,060
marketing

00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:38,489
so no copyright claim

00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:40,590
this year top no problem so when

00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:42,510
somebody comes on give them a big whoop

00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:44,310
this year give them a big cheer every

00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:46,080
single speaker every single room that's

00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,190
all I want to hear is all you guys

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,590
cheering so come on let's practice it

00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:56,269
you an audience you are in America

00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,269
that's what you gonna do if I say hi

00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:03,030
okay so hands up if you're new to a pill

00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:04,680
event called hands up but we shy

00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,970
Oh be shy you wouldn't need to a pill

00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,200
event okay this is aimed at you

00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,959
everybody else

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,010
take take this along for the ride I

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,019
don't really care about them that much

00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:15,930
it's not if there's something for them

00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:17,340
as well so you might have me feel longer

00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,660
than you think this morning cuz I spoke

00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,780
to Larry already and he said you know

00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:24,450
you can run over I've got nothing you

00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:27,720
know what the hell you like so it's fine

00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:29,310
I'm here for a while there's been one or

00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,019
two rumors of bribery about this talk

00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:34,220
already

00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:36,090
now this is spurious I'm above reproach

00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:39,269
that doesn't happen

00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:40,019
those rumors that have an IRC nothing to

00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:42,150
do with me

00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:45,000
there's no agreed price for getting a

00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:47,489
young name into this keynote I would not

00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,660
do that this is Corey Watson he's an

00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:53,819
absolutely superb low Corey's in town

00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,200
with a company credit card and I want

00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:56,100
you to go to him say Kareem you're

00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,079
fantastic a man

00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:03,480
I understand you're hiring so we're dead

00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:06,540
we're declining in fact we're deceased

00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,519
we are no more it seems to be we have

00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,769
expired and gone to meet our maker we're

00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:13,170
a stiff the rest of life we rest in

00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:15,389
peace we're pushing up the daisies our

00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:18,209
metabolic processes are bleed in this

00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:19,859
theory the twig we kicked the book if we

00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:21,510
shuffle off this mortal coil run down

00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:24,360
the curtain enjoying the breeding choir

00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:28,470
invisible and when Italia did that

00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:32,010
happen well I'm gonna blame slashed up

00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:34,950
okay of about 2005 and I'm gonna give

00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:36,729
you a date 2005 favorite 2005 slash that

00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:38,919
said pearls dead

00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:41,889
selectfrom died but from we got killed

00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:43,779
and we went on our own rarely because

00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:48,009
flash that also told us that sea was

00:04:43,779 --> 00:04:50,529
dead Bhd was dead solaris was dead but

00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:54,249
that we really wishful thinking units

00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:56,830
was also dead quite a lot of things are

00:04:54,249 --> 00:04:59,229
being killed on slaughter they seem to

00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:01,259
have a a bit of a history of say

00:04:59,229 --> 00:05:04,569
something's dead are dying

00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:07,719
which is really neat because um slash

00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:09,669
thought was and is written in Perl so

00:05:07,719 --> 00:05:13,479
that's kind of interesting not only that

00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:18,550
they used as their data nat craft which

00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:20,770
is written in Perl and running on BSD so

00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:23,020
that's interesting to me because what

00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:25,389
you saying to me is we used to dead

00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:28,120
things to determine that those dead

00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:30,699
things with that using the dead thing to

00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,229
analyze the usage of the dead thing and

00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:34,960
then we allowed people to comment on

00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:39,610
that dead thing being dead with a dead

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:41,020
thing speaking volumes for the level of

00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:43,180
research that was done by slash start

00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:46,360
there I think people sometimes declare

00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:49,060
some dead is they don't use it and over

00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,370
here in Poland we were so happy we

00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,050
didn't table is behave rather oddly to

00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,819
this actually we didn't know mostly

00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:56,499
angry some people are still frothing we

00:05:54,819 --> 00:05:57,909
don't let them out they're still taking

00:05:56,499 --> 00:06:00,279
the Librium and sitting in the corner

00:05:57,909 --> 00:06:03,249
wondering where the language texts of a

00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:05,110
lot of people got very responsive then

00:06:03,249 --> 00:06:06,490
we got resigned then we got sad then we

00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:09,610
started to ignore it we weren't for the

00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:12,490
stages of grief I said the language

00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:15,430
didn't die but I know what you're gonna

00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:17,319
say now I'm gonna say prove it well I'm

00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:18,819
gonna say comfortably and I think now

00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:20,259
he's gonna bump you up I'm not gonna ask

00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:21,729
him really but why are you gonna back me

00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:23,740
up and say that Perl is more like a

00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:26,379
natural language than it is a computer

00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:28,419
language so let's use natural languages

00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:30,459
to get you because we can do that

00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:34,360
natural languages can be declared dead

00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:36,759
Latin was no native speakers no growth

00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,559
in native speakers no evolution of the

00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:40,389
language and you can't even count things

00:06:38,559 --> 00:06:42,249
like well she's not alive the language

00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:43,779
is not actually evolving they have no

00:06:42,249 --> 00:06:45,159
modern words they don't have computer

00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:46,389
they don't have gramophone they don't

00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:47,360
have it's my round it's not that

00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:53,389
evolving language

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:54,620
I have Welsh family there now dead did

00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:58,129
that go on the internet are you

00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:59,930
censoring me life no oh crap okay so we

00:06:58,129 --> 00:07:01,669
can look at how we can prove that pill

00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:05,840
is not dead perhaps let's look at see

00:07:01,669 --> 00:07:07,009
Pam and I brought some stats because I

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,229
think I'm going to show you guys some

00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:12,050
graphs you know Dan didn't bring any

00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:14,389
I've got them all so this is the number

00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:17,319
of Sipan releases each year and that

00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:20,870
number shows a steady increase

00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:24,349
interesting number of distributions per

00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:25,699
year again steady increase may not be

00:07:24,349 --> 00:07:27,469
the new releases that could be

00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:31,129
re-releases but it's still a steady

00:07:27,469 --> 00:07:32,719
increase and I can't be like looking at

00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:34,310
figures so this is kind of an odd one

00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:36,110
this is January February we looked at

00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:39,349
this one because I was a big jump in

00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:40,639
2008 only about butts so I don't know

00:07:39,349 --> 00:07:43,690
what happened in 2008 that was one

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:46,819
really crappy Christmas obviously

00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:48,650
Christmas 2007 that was really terrible

00:07:46,819 --> 00:07:53,659
for most seepin authors they just did

00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:56,240
code so another important stat activity

00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:59,330
number people do releases each year is

00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,370
increasing it was once growing by 200

00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:03,889
each year now it's growing by about 50

00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:05,419
each year but that's more people doing

00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:09,080
more releases each year

00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:11,330
Stella growth number posts I'm not she's

00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:15,529
Yeti we have an unusual start here so

00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:17,419
1999 looks fantastic however no dates

00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:20,839
done till 1999

00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:22,009
that's 1995 to 1989 that's why it lists

00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:24,080
have done fantastic we can ignore that

00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:28,190
one pause sign ups are steady each year

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:31,360
and that means new people each year and

00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:33,680
I like this graph because it's crazy ass

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:37,880
so what we have there is a list of the

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:40,310
most active authors on Sipan and over

00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:42,260
time number of releases but we can see

00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:45,350
that the most active people become more

00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:47,870
active over time in this problem dead

00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:51,329
language I got actually all the question

00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:53,730
now did are we vampires

00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:56,369
because we died and we're becoming more

00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:59,279
prolific and we're growing our numbers

00:08:56,369 --> 00:09:01,170
that's fun prison and we're feeding off

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:04,019
other languages like the sick creatures

00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:06,959
of the night that's it that's about it

00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:08,999
kind of fits leaving the dried of hosts

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,679
of other languages in our wake as we

00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:16,110
spread our darkness across the globe

00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:19,049
okay but these this is not compelling

00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:21,119
enough I hear you say numbers so pause

00:09:19,049 --> 00:09:23,910
numbers and if you don't know what C

00:09:21,119 --> 00:09:25,769
pentesters is C pen testers test every

00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:28,079
upload to C panel against every

00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:30,329
distribution against every operating

00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:32,369
system I got some real mega stars over

00:09:30,329 --> 00:09:34,379
there so crisp rim but Williams bingos

00:09:32,369 --> 00:09:36,509
has done about a million tests on his

00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:40,110
own now clearly he automated some of

00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:42,809
that you know a million tests manually

00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:45,899
not gonna happen well unless he really

00:09:42,809 --> 00:09:47,489
got into life so there's eleven thousand

00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:49,949
two hundred eighty two pars accounts

00:09:47,489 --> 00:09:52,470
amount unfortunately nearly 5,000 of

00:09:49,949 --> 00:09:53,910
those nobody's uploaded doesn't mean

00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:55,860
they haven't committed to another

00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:58,079
project just at the gut none of their

00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:00,689
own but that does mean that sits and a

00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:01,919
half thousand people ah on cpanel and

00:10:00,689 --> 00:10:02,309
prolific with parse accounts at the

00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:04,709
moment

00:10:02,309 --> 00:10:07,579
and they've uploaded a hundred and two

00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:09,839
thousand releases so that's not too bad

00:10:07,579 --> 00:10:11,790
bad trip thirty thousand of those are

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,069
original there's two hundred twenty

00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:15,809
thousand on cpanel back pan and if

00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:18,179
you're not familiar were at back pennies

00:10:15,809 --> 00:10:20,839
it's the area where we send C pump

00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:23,069
modules to well become zombies I guess

00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:24,239
let's keep that one dead metaphor going

00:10:23,069 --> 00:10:25,889
that's where that zombies are that's

00:10:24,239 --> 00:10:28,769
where our army of children that we

00:10:25,889 --> 00:10:30,779
release on the world out longer this

00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:32,279
includes the dark pan and every time I

00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:35,389
ask people having the dark pan is they

00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:37,739
do this they go on it's about ten times

00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:39,209
it could be two times it could be 200

00:10:37,739 --> 00:10:40,829
times but they go it's ten times the

00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:42,929
scientists if it's not ten times the

00:10:40,829 --> 00:10:46,199
center nobody knows the size of dark pan

00:10:42,929 --> 00:10:47,639
that's why it's dark pan however because

00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:49,919
we will need a number there's ten times

00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:53,459
the size so that there's 2.2 million in

00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:55,410
the world number you know I can't

00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:59,129
falsify usually you'd think I work for

00:10:55,410 --> 00:11:01,470
other web statistic companies so this is

00:10:59,129 --> 00:11:03,569
unique leases to see pan and back pan

00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:04,620
and that's the total number were deleted

00:11:03,569 --> 00:11:07,410
releases now of a

00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:09,150
only on backpal know what you're saying

00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:11,640
now and I'm saying it with you we need a

00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:14,070
few more graphs mark with God don't want

00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:16,320
to see these graphs either lovely so I

00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:18,300
won't show you now redline Arthur's blue

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,390
line distros little letters at the

00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:23,640
bottom that's months and what we have is

00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:26,640
the number of Arthur's each month who

00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:31,380
release the distro so we got 2004 to

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:34,110
2007 6 to 7 widget discos three to four

00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:36,270
hundred authors two thousand seven to

00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:39,300
ten six hundred to a thousand distros

00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:41,970
over formed at Arthur's 2010 to fourteen

00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:44,460
we have it between 1000 and 1200 discos

00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:48,120
from forum good authors and that's the

00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:52,110
latest one so February 2014 that takes

00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:55,920
us up to so I'm gonna question the

00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:58,590
definition of this word dead so 2005

00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:01,200
February we had three hundred and nine

00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:04,920
authors in that month released 562

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:08,670
distros and in 2014 nine years after our

00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:11,220
demise we have forgiven 45 authors who

00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:13,050
released 2056 distros that's in that

00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:16,020
month from dune 45 office there's more

00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:19,680
authors than that so we got more

00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:21,870
effective two times to work by 1.5 times

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,180
the people really questioning how you

00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:26,760
define dead in that context because

00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:28,440
that's not dead we should however be

00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,990
careful our young allies numbers let's

00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,420
think of our heyday apparently pills

00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:36,090
heyday was the year 2000 that was nice

00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:38,130
pill 5.8 was happily dancing for the

00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:40,050
world Larry started a new and ambitious

00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:44,760
project to keep his mustache under

00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:47,220
control at our heyday there were 118

00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:50,790
authors who released the Hunger neat one

00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:54,600
dish shows so were four five times more

00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:56,310
than our heyday I really am starting to

00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:00,030
question the word heyday and its

00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:01,860
definition in this context now so at

00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:04,500
this moment I'm gonna crank Neil Bowers

00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:06,990
who did a lot of the polling into Sipan

00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,460
for me because you know how I'm lazy I

00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:10,470
wanted the figures I didn't want to go

00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,520
and get those figures so Neil did all

00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,780
the work for me we found some very

00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,100
interesting stuff and he's gonna be

00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:16,260
talking more about all the interesting

00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,410
little things I found especially 2008 we

00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:20,470
were calling huh

00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:22,779
what the hell and I'm really gonna

00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:24,939
polling people now it was 2007 a bad

00:13:22,779 --> 00:13:27,849
Christmas to sleep on authors did your

00:13:24,939 --> 00:13:29,139
work or you all went to your families

00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:31,179
and went I'm not going to talk to them

00:13:29,139 --> 00:13:33,999
I'm just gonna sit here in Coto or down

00:13:31,179 --> 00:13:36,879
holiday because I want to know why that

00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:41,889
figure changes so I wish I thought that

00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:44,319
this title a lot of pill hate these days

00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:46,209
seems to stem from this wonderful web

00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:49,720
service I think people keeping alive the

00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:52,059
pillage dead meme is this service and a

00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,559
couple of months ago a journalist was

00:13:52,059 --> 00:13:55,389
write an article and yet another piece

00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:56,499
of article information came from TOB

00:13:55,389 --> 00:14:00,039
that said pearlies dead

00:13:56,499 --> 00:14:02,470
he had the figures and so I generally

00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:04,149
contact me he said we need a quote from

00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:06,039
the Pearl Foundation and I said sure we

00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:08,169
love doing games with you there what

00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:09,699
sort of audience do you have what sort

00:14:08,169 --> 00:14:11,259
of length do you want the quote what

00:14:09,699 --> 00:14:13,269
timely I've got to write it in he said

00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:17,039
oh you've got 24 hours the audience is

00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:17,039
the Internet so I went okay

00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:27,970
there you go Robert so I gave it a

00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:29,680
particularly bad quote and at that time

00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:32,709
Tim burns pointed out these three

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,149
articles he'd wrote to me that he'd done

00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:36,190
a bit of research and we're talking to

00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:39,940
people including the people at TOB about

00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:42,520
their service and he makes a couple of

00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:46,990
interesting statements this is quite

00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:49,209
compelling so gob assumes this search

00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:51,970
equals popularity if you search for

00:14:49,209 --> 00:14:54,070
through programming that will reveal the

00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:56,410
popularity of through programming in the

00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:57,730
world it does not matter that the

00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:00,070
program is doing through programming

00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:02,230
will never search for it or anything

00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:05,080
like that but it will reveal it clearly

00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:06,880
and we can all go yet close to tacos and

00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:09,580
not only that it's equal across every

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,529
language because those two stats are

00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:13,870
comparable and that's what it assumes

00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:15,760
now it's fairly easy to pick holes in

00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:18,820
those assumptions but it goes a bit

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:21,070
further you see TOB can be gained and

00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:23,170
the Delfy community did this in 2008

00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:24,940
they've got their star edge they gained

00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:27,130
the numbers not only that I hope you

00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:29,079
seem to think that was a bonus so we're

00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:32,860
going to say to you now let's put the

00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:35,790
dark pang numbers in to see Connor so

00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:38,680
we've got 2.2 million releases on Sipan

00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:41,560
and there's there's at least 60,000

00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:43,990
arthur's on Sipan you think if we don't

00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,790
name them I wish would have actually

00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:47,320
known that information I could have made

00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:48,910
some comic book they said well the virus

00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,589
the value of using a service this

00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:52,360
service to make deductions when it's

00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:54,220
based on Aven assumption is really open

00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,360
to the corruption of data really calls

00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:58,260
into question the veracity of any

00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:02,079
statistic gained from it however I said

00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:04,390
we have Perl I'm Ashley peak or

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:06,520
something similar look up Tim's articles

00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:07,899
they're really really interesting you

00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,270
can just google his name in Google

00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:13,050
TOB on Tim's here at the conference so

00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:13,050
say hi to Tim

00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:19,650
so Ovid also pointed out another problem

00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:23,640
we have with looking at statistics this

00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:26,250
way and how we read graphs and trends so

00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:27,810
take this for instance if I said Firefox

00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:30,570
is 20% less popular would you assume

00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:32,850
Firefox was dead and all dying no you

00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:36,870
wouldn't you might say things like well

00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:39,270
it's lost market share it's a wider

00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:41,400
field that it's competing in and it's

00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:43,830
losing competitive mindshare that's a

00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:46,050
nice term and it's a term you should use

00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:48,020
that's what we've done but when it's not

00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:52,800
dead or dying and actually you know

00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:55,020
leave a week you should follow Ovid by

00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,820
the way on social media and on his blog

00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:59,310
she took quite an interesting style of

00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:02,670
talking is very conservative reflective

00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:06,180
which doesn't match his politics but he

00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:08,010
does have a very very Placid way so

00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:11,010
there is a downward trend in Perl though

00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:11,910
and that's in jobs Perl job requests you

00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:15,600
wouldn't think so you're here because

00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:17,750
apparently everybody's hiring yeah Chris

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:21,660
is hiring you're hiring ie Chris

00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:23,189
eventually see Chris is hiring so

00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:26,069
there's a downward trend in new Perl

00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:31,380
jobs under rush avian preserve wrote a

00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:33,000
very radical what she basically stated

00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:36,540
is that there's a market that's tipped

00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,910
towards experts and experience and this

00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:40,470
creates a very big problem of anybody

00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:43,650
trying to not only enter that market

00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:46,590
without that expertise but also people

00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:51,660
trying to buy Perl developers without

00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:55,290
work where the interesting where the

00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:56,940
cost of doing so it's too high they saw

00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:58,710
there needs to be more startups more

00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:00,840
young people a very culture that's

00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:02,550
fostered in the community and I think by

00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,680
that we mean not focused on and obsessed

00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:07,080
about because then we're in the corner

00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,520
with the Librium again however it's not

00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,560
all bad news because I did some more

00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:13,280
stat do want more graphs I can see you

00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,280
looking at me going

00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:19,590
so I'm gonna give you more graphs

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:21,030
clearly McGrath's thank you like I don't

00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:23,340
pay these people you won't be bear

00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:25,950
you're in my talk now

00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:29,100
so on this graph we can see the decline

00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:30,870
in pull jobs however the same graph will

00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:33,149
show you the the number of jobs so far

00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:35,399
for ios and android and they're really

00:18:33,149 --> 00:18:38,249
damn groovy and we got mugged of your

00:18:35,399 --> 00:18:39,779
question then so there's an interesting

00:18:38,249 --> 00:18:41,429
snap doesn't really mean anything but

00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:42,690
it's an interesting start they stumble

00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:46,710
request for pull jobs than there is for

00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:48,179
people come to us jobs and from what I

00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,320
hear you know you're gonna be an iOS

00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:50,610
developer these days because then you

00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,779
can put a single app on the App Store

00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:52,740
and you'll be a single developer and

00:18:51,779 --> 00:18:54,149
then you'll have a team and then

00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:56,399
suddenly your candy crush or something

00:18:54,149 --> 00:18:59,759
on Facebook will buy you for a billion

00:18:56,399 --> 00:19:01,440
dollars that's nice I understand

00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:04,379
everybody's market plan now isn't it

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,090
build an app whatever call it crappy

00:19:04,379 --> 00:19:10,649
common and then the hope Facebook buys

00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:12,149
it for a billion dollars if you compare

00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,710
it to other dynamic languages let's

00:19:12,149 --> 00:19:15,090
stick with in our own languages though

00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:17,850
you'll see that all of us follow the

00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:19,740
same sort of trends Python seems to be

00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:21,240
breaking that trend a little bit however

00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:24,240
that's gonna be an interesting trend

00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:27,720
once Google moves away from them which

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,429
they are doing so the biggest one there

00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:33,869
is look at the look at this changing

00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:36,659
Java Java is dropped by half so Java is

00:19:33,869 --> 00:19:41,220
lost 50% of their jobs so Java it's dead

00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:43,499
y'all no it's not but it's not dead and

00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:45,600
you could say from the same graph will

00:19:43,499 --> 00:19:47,279
tell you that apparently so is Ruby is

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,980
dead because they got the same decline

00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:52,379
them action the same graph star this is

00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:55,139
the problem we reading graphs so

00:19:52,379 --> 00:19:57,600
conclusions for the statin analysis fest

00:19:55,139 --> 00:19:59,940
of this wonderful talk well first of all

00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,970
joining us in the not quite living but

00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:05,879
still very actively mobile dead is world

00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:08,039
war slashed up TOB

00:20:05,879 --> 00:20:10,860
he's been filmed by Martin Scorsese and

00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:13,049
will be souring Robert De Niro and will

00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:15,840
have no doubt violent scenes and there's

00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:19,420
a certain level of moist teenage crush

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:21,860
about pearl because

00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:24,320
because apparently we're with vampires

00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:27,560
and I kind of like that so let's talk

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:31,940
about our own death now so we covered

00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:33,290
death great now we're alive so let's we

00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:35,600
could put it the language now and talk

00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:36,950
about the language however as lots of

00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,290
people can be talking about language and

00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:40,580
their language stuff this week that's

00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:44,060
not what I'm going to talk about

00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:45,830
Shadowcat love pills we started off as a

00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:48,170
pill shop we're still a pill shop all

00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:49,580
our clients mostly used pill we use some

00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:51,470
other languages to do specific things

00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:52,790
but we generally use pearl and if

00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:56,360
there's a solution in pill we use that

00:20:52,790 --> 00:21:01,190
solution generally if it's written well

00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:03,530
enough put a slight set parenthesis

00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:05,660
around the end of that sentence extract

00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:07,520
in the Megan I didn't say it but we

00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:09,050
started in business there we considered

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,810
this they say somebody asked us would

00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:14,150
you use pill because for a lot of our

00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:15,860
clients the same language in the front

00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:18,560
end in the back end is actually quite

00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:20,450
good so javascript presents a better

00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,710
model that way and they use a lot of

00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:23,510
JavaScript in their front end

00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:25,070
some of me we use javascript in the back

00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:27,740
end that we slum and Hammer with Perl

00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:29,270
until it worked properly but we still

00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:30,520
work with it so we could be example

00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:35,870
script sharp

00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:38,840
except for so chap here circled the back

00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:42,350
this is David Oswald David moved back to

00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:43,880
Utah from California in 2013 he was a

00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:46,370
member of his local Pearl Mongoose group

00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,960
in California goes to Utah finds that

00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:51,500
it's long I'm going a little bit so he's

00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:53,390
helped to set up reviving it sets up ten

00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:55,760
meetings a year and they avoid two

00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:57,290
months they avoid Christmas because you

00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,170
know family and everybody Taylor like

00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:01,820
pull modules and avoids the Utah open

00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:05,360
west conference because they're you know

00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:06,710
they all attend night instead they've

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,270
attracted old members back to the group

00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:09,800
they've attracted some new members to

00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:10,550
the group they hold meetings that mojo

00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,920
bluehost

00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:14,390
who are wonderful sponsors and they get

00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,070
sponsored food from them and they hope

00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:17,630
technical presentations I'm sure they

00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:19,370
probably consume one or two rubber

00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:23,060
nectars now David's not here so he

00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:24,500
doesn't tell me a beer now they also

00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:28,100
participate in the open West Conference

00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:31,070
as I said when he went back there told

00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:33,320
pretty much didn't have a presence 2013

00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:34,490
they had a day devoted to pill and got

00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,860
themselves some talks on it

00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:38,810
this year they felt the track for three

00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:40,190
days with Perl they had there were

00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:42,320
Minnie Pearl confidence inside a much

00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:43,190
bigger conference and introduced pill to

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,780
a whole lot of people who thought

00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:46,790
apparently we were dead there were

00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:49,760
between twelve and seventy five people

00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:51,020
at every single talk they also got Mark

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,650
Jason Dominus to come in and do a

00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:56,060
workshop and detox under I'd be right

00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:57,350
for us you know I've actually seen this

00:22:56,060 --> 00:23:01,400
guy present and I've never seen him

00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:03,710
upright Damien Conway has appeared for

00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,060
them because thing was in town so as he

00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:06,440
always does he appears at his local

00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:07,070
pearl Mongoose group because they meet a

00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,920
sweet guy

00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:18,350
and they wanna hold a Yahtzee Ivan next

00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:21,080
year in the year after and this is

00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:21,980
Bangkok p.m. and last month they held

00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:25,400
the first-ever

00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:27,410
pearl moon his meeting in Ireland last

00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,120
month enlightened pearl organization

00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:30,740
received an application for her send the

00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,450
newbie program for one of them to come

00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:34,700
to Europe but he actually said I prefer

00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:36,440
to go to Asia yaki Asia even though you

00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,870
don't from the program there because

00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:42,590
then I can see how a Yap she is run in

00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:44,720
Asia and hold a pearl mongers meeting in

00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:48,380
Thailand in the poem on this event in

00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,670
Thailand not entirely sure I can resist

00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:51,620
that I'm gonna have to find some money

00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:54,730
for him and send him to a

00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:57,350
Yap see Asia and this is Cluj p.m.

00:23:54,730 --> 00:24:00,410
they're pretty much they're sponsored by

00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:02,150
one big company in Cluj called Eva's on

00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:03,740
who do a great amount for that local

00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:06,920
community and they're a really nice

00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:08,240
company they drank quite high supporting

00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:10,640
and caring of their staff and what they

00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,280
want their staff to do they hold three

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,320
mini conferences each year Eva's on

00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:17,030
sponsor guest speakers in their first

00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:19,730
year they Mudd fills for their opening

00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:22,100
got Matt to come along then they got me

00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:24,050
to go along and for the second year they

00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:27,710
went we one less crazy let's get Reba

00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:30,800
sushi to go along and so yeah and after

00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:33,130
the wonder that was us for I think they

00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,870
really seriously needed a break

00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:36,430
the after somebody nice and ilysm Wendy

00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:40,030
came for their second birthday

00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:41,440
now give me some of their numbers they

00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:45,700
have a hundred and eighty-five people

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:49,870
include our pian that's attend their

00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:53,170
meetings and mini conferences they've

00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:56,320
doubled in size in two years they've

00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:59,170
given 47 talks are their events but

00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,760
average of eight per them they've hosted

00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:04,330
guest speakers from 8 different

00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:07,950
countries and they've had attendees from

00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:09,670
8 different countries interesting core

00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:11,320
collisional figures there but they're

00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:14,980
actually different PS speakers in

00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:16,180
different countries I think 25 percent

00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,860
of all the people who attended the last

00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:20,980
mini conference with brand new to that

00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:24,310
event so they grew 50 people at the last

00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:26,530
event and they also have a really groovy

00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:29,230
symbol that happens to be a vampire

00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:33,060
because you know Romania Carpathian

00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:37,540
Mountains dracool so that's really ice

00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:39,340
so meta see Pam can you spot the

00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:40,990
original logo these are all logos from

00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:43,540
the logo competition if you can spot the

00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:47,800
original logo you win a prize that the

00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:49,660
girls gonna order so original idea for

00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:51,070
the meta Sipan started in the

00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:54,070
conversation between all the folders and

00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:55,570
mark juban ville they were just a mobile

00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:58,270
application because that's what

00:25:55,570 --> 00:26:01,030
everybody wanted in 2010 and they called

00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:03,640
it icy pan their idea was to present the

00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:06,190
latest in depth documentation from Sipan

00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,690
for offline usage and as they developed

00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:09,430
this idea they thought hang on this is a

00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:12,430
slightly bigger task than we first

00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:13,960
imagined so we thought oh right ok it's

00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:16,270
a web service and that's not gonna be

00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:18,100
difficult to provide so they had a

00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:19,450
conversation with Philip Smith and

00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,860
decide you wanna use elastic search

00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:22,150
because it's brand-new and groovy and

00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,230
you know when you're starting a new

00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:24,730
project you always start with all the

00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:26,650
new newest things that's never going to

00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:29,620
cause a problem and you wouldn't ever

00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:31,770
have a larger than anticipated indexing

00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,770
issue

00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:35,330
it was sponsored on the flight by the

00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:36,410
local Pearl manga groups they knew they

00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:38,900
didn't need to do something more than

00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:40,310
free hosting so they got a lot of money

00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:42,440
from the local mangas group of free

00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:45,200
minion and the very badly named Sipan

00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:47,540
happy was born to this day that is

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,890
actually the name of the of the thing

00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:50,240
and they really wished that a call to

00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:53,360
Metta Sipan from the start

00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,460
oh I've completed the Appy that was his

00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,530
side mark came along he built a Java

00:26:55,460 --> 00:27:00,350
Script search service on top of it and

00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:02,720
stopped meta Sipan Gerard was born this

00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:04,400
was given some Twitter icons and people

00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,930
were left alone as they say to kick the

00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,210
tires or in other words to make it

00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:11,450
follow her at rapid speed but however

00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:11,840
this was done by December 2010 so in two

00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:14,480
months

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:16,340
they went from their idea to their

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,070
service and we had met the Sipan in two

00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:21,470
months and then thankfully in 2011 more

00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:23,900
each come along um orange completely

00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:25,790
gutted the whole of the code we were a

00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:28,130
load of the elasticsearch and then he

00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:30,830
also rebuilt the meta C Panda org as a

00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:34,220
site wrapper on top of the upper happy

00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:35,780
for the google Summer of Code and that's

00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:38,480
where mr. C pan comes from an idea

00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:40,790
between two pearl mongers a few more of

00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,980
those that threw money in one committed

00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:44,600
volunteer who really they just went wow

00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:48,710
he's really really committed to young

00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:51,140
give you lots of work to do it's really

00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:52,160
grown there's a competition for a logo

00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,750
that was sponsored by the enlightened

00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,850
pearl organization there's been a lot of

00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:58,580
generous sponsorship and they have a

00:27:55,850 --> 00:28:00,980
hundred contributors to the core over

00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:03,440
there and they've been sponsored by all

00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:04,700
of these people and some of these people

00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,040
have got continuous pumps and the big

00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:10,010
one in the center gives them a stupidly

00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:13,170
big server to play with which makes it

00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:15,730
fast and reliable fish

00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:17,890
so they've matured improved though I was

00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:20,160
looking for more help this year they've

00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:22,950
got the students as part of Nome

00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:25,870
but genome is actually always pronounced

00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:30,550
is that right because Dan said genome is

00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:31,720
it genome was no good no it's good

00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:34,390
nobody got a pronounce the G there

00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:36,490
Africa okay no problem good and also in

00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:38,200
the cubicle somewhere code so yeah heard

00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:40,809
of this you must have heard of this

00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:43,180
everybody's heard of this right so just

00:28:40,809 --> 00:28:44,650
pull weekly and this is jabber and now

00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:47,800
he owes me a bit even though he didn't

00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:50,020
turn up he had a conversation in July of

00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:53,050
2011 with Cayman about the JavaScript

00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:55,720
weekly and on the first of August he

00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:59,080
launched the Perl weekly and in two days

00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:02,290
he had two new subscribers in two months

00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:04,240
he had two thousand subscribers around

00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:05,740
issue 78 I think his brain finally

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:10,270
fizzled out and he added a new component

00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:12,400
which was a second editor that gives us

00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:14,500
also a second person to work on the

00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:17,320
thing so Gabbar can take a holiday but

00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:19,030
as always I had people submit so submit

00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:22,270
Corrections this guys submits quite a

00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:23,710
lot of them I've even submit the son and

00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:25,210
now we've been about five and a half

00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:28,120
thousand subscribers to it

00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:30,970
the PO weekly is a digest it takes all

00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:33,670
of the broad spread of pearl information

00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:36,220
and goes right digest it down to some

00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:37,630
core components it's led by an editor so

00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:40,120
whatever they consider an important is

00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:41,590
there but that's fine because you're

00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:43,809
still getting the digesting you're still

00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:45,070
getting pointed to places and there were

00:29:43,809 --> 00:29:46,540
two of them we do it and they do that

00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:49,179
job well they've passed a hundred and

00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:50,980
fifty editions and it'll be their

00:29:49,179 --> 00:29:52,120
anniversary pretty soon in fact the

00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:54,309
first of August will be their third

00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,720
anniversary it's very easy to work out

00:29:54,309 --> 00:29:58,000
well thirty we count that way

00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:01,330
secondly we count otherwise it depends

00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,190
how you Carol I say third so successful

00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:06,580
pull projects different focuses

00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:08,980
different teams different committees but

00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:10,809
they do a similar job they satisfy a

00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:12,309
need or a requirement unless traction

00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:14,170
niche but there are so a common bond or

00:30:12,309 --> 00:30:16,440
glue between lots of different

00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:18,660
developers and people

00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,490
so I actually could have chosen from all

00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:23,280
of these different ones so Rikuo

00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:24,930
malicious D bit catalyst dancin MooMoo

00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,820
devil declare test pol pod plaque

00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:29,160
captain I can he sold a lot of people in

00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:30,900
all of those ones - I chose those two

00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,710
because they were nicely contrasting in

00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:33,240
what they do

00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:35,580
one of them is a code project and the

00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:38,250
other ones and I've new project and I

00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:39,840
really like looking at this site so I

00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:41,310
recommend you go here you look at the

00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,280
bottom column of this there's a little

00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:46,440
tiny animated map of Sipan and I like

00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:53,970
this place and you should go and look at

00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:56,940
it or perhaps you should wait for this

00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:58,740
to crash we're just gonna wait for my

00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:01,410
computer to crash now I'm gonna blame

00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:07,700
John John that's your fault what did you

00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:07,700
do - man damn it Stevie

00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:13,999
you know he had troubles with his laptop

00:31:11,509 --> 00:31:19,129
last year and I didn't so he's just I

00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:20,330
just inherited the wrong so I think you

00:31:19,129 --> 00:31:22,549
all know who this is because if he'd

00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:24,529
been up here once today and you all

00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:26,269
should really thank him he's banished

00:31:24,529 --> 00:31:29,330
the man he's in the central part of the

00:31:26,269 --> 00:31:31,999
machine and enables you to be here he

00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:36,369
said I'm the treasurer and that's all he

00:31:31,999 --> 00:31:39,169
said I hold the money in show graphs

00:31:36,369 --> 00:31:41,330
Dan's a graduate of the University of

00:31:39,169 --> 00:31:43,429
Pittsburgh where in this world

00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:45,559
he's worked at the same company since

00:31:43,429 --> 00:31:47,899
he's graduated that cool company though

00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:49,519
they do a lot for Pell they sponsor Perl

00:31:47,899 --> 00:31:51,950
events they give service to the Perl

00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:54,019
Foundation their pair networks and

00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:55,700
that's really enjoyed working for them

00:31:54,019 --> 00:31:57,200
and while he's been Weibull to work for

00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,899
them they were also I think been a very

00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,369
supportive of him because he's also

00:31:58,899 --> 00:32:03,799
aside from depth at treasure a bit

00:32:01,369 --> 00:32:05,779
he started the Pittsburgh pearl workshop

00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:07,429
and he's been helping to organize that

00:32:05,779 --> 00:32:09,559
ever since he was asked about your

00:32:07,429 --> 00:32:12,230
organizing team for a yak see five years

00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:14,629
ago and that was really successful of

00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:16,190
them and as treasurer of the pearl

00:32:14,629 --> 00:32:18,619
foundation he does a lot of talking to

00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:20,720
you people has to prepare reports which

00:32:18,619 --> 00:32:22,309
is actually really quite difficult and

00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,210
he creates a yearly report that he

00:32:22,309 --> 00:32:24,859
prints out and he created that

00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:26,899
sponsorship but better that you are

00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:29,359
taking away he put all the work into

00:32:26,899 --> 00:32:30,980
that really and you know what he does a

00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:32,210
bit more his auto active in his local

00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:33,739
community I don't know how he finds the

00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:35,690
time obviously pair networks let him

00:32:33,739 --> 00:32:37,489
have a lot of time off because it's also

00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:40,879
a prominent and keen member of the local

00:32:37,489 --> 00:32:42,730
Scout movement and a father and I have

00:32:40,879 --> 00:32:45,139
two small kids that's a full-time job

00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:49,009
doing all the stuff that Dan does as

00:32:45,139 --> 00:32:49,850
well I'm having two kids wow you have to

00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:52,879
be impressed by it

00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:54,559
so when you see done don't just think

00:32:52,879 --> 00:32:56,379
about there's that man who said that we

00:32:54,559 --> 00:33:00,889
should take this sponsorship perspective

00:32:56,379 --> 00:33:02,359
smile with him say hi because he's

00:33:00,889 --> 00:33:04,100
actually generally happy to meet people

00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:04,999
it'd be glad if you're happy it would

00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:07,580
glad that you're having a great time

00:33:04,999 --> 00:33:10,639
here and he'll be happier knowing that

00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:12,889
it's all working well so the gute was on

00:33:10,639 --> 00:33:16,220
record I mentioned and last year we took

00:33:12,889 --> 00:33:18,200
a hiatus to you if if you know about it

00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:19,460
then you know about it if you don't we

00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,530
don't we don't talk about as I go into

00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,970
Vegas we

00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:24,760
go to last year's beautiful summer code

00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:26,710
but what happened there stays there this

00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:28,390
year we have some great students so this

00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:31,120
is Bart and he's working on the KITT

00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:32,620
compiler for more vm and he's doing that

00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,880
with Jonathan Winton I found out

00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:37,320
yesterday the journal from Worthington

00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,320
is only 28 years old

00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:47,650
Jonathan is only 28 years old

00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:53,110
dude he's done some serious partying in

00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:55,810
his time vampire longer than the rest of

00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:57,100
us there's tricky he's done pirate

00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:59,050
improved performance and method

00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:00,760
signatures and Ronnie's helping him move

00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:02,050
that I love what spell checker was doing

00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:08,050
through all these things I was typing in

00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:11,530
so this is really Durban this is Phillip

00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:14,320
and he did lwp HTTP module his SSL

00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:15,820
support and frogs Tobias is helping him

00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,100
with that PI mention him and then

00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:21,610
there's a guy called Francois offers

00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:23,440
let's go he's called stole blocks but

00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:25,210
he's doing functional enticements and

00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,820
developing of new features for Google at

00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:29,560
home I don't even know what that means

00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:31,750
I've read it to myself several times I

00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:33,010
still can't pass that sentence but

00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:34,630
Moodle is helping me move out and

00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:37,990
obviously it's doing him a world of good

00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:39,940
and this is talena and she's doing meta

00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:43,800
Sipan web a twisting book Fitz is happy

00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:43,800
and Olaf is helping her with that

00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:47,150
but they're not the only people there's

00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:49,220
a lot of backup mentors and people go

00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:50,720
into the channels so I should have tell

00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:52,550
you this team oh there's more each

00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:55,220
there's Bruce there's will this study

00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:57,230
there's Randi and then people on the

00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:59,030
admin side there's there's me apparently

00:34:57,230 --> 00:35:00,830
I do something there's Karen Poli and

00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:03,440
they're shown alito we had to do work as

00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:05,930
well right now they're in midterm so

00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:11,120
they're watching this do not watch this

00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:15,350
put your midterm assessments in now I'm

00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:17,000
serious now so I'm hoping this year will

00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:18,500
also revive the google code-in because

00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,950
when we did that that was a lot of fun

00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,420
as well

00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:22,010
which means to say it was

00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:25,790
extraordinarily stressful a lot of hard

00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:29,990
work but it's a lot of fun so small

00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:32,210
thing why does Shadowcat year's pearl if

00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:34,190
we were a start-up today we actually

00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:37,730
might choose javascript and say it

00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:39,740
satisfies a needing clients but you know

00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:41,690
we might also just choose Perl there's a

00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:43,550
lot of maturity in the language there's

00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:46,730
a lot of breadth of products I'm then

00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:50,090
spat over essential power a bit actually

00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:51,860
breathed life into a community that's

00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:53,750
what breathes life into pill that would

00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:56,390
be all of you that's what we love being

00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:57,650
part of this and I'm going to give you a

00:35:56,390 --> 00:36:00,500
call to action so there's some things

00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:04,100
you can do you know I just hate to enjoy

00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:06,080
yourself people I expect stuff if you do

00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:08,780
stuff like I already do stuff do well I

00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:10,490
expect work as hard as done that's

00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:13,160
that's level I'm holding you all up to

00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:15,240
now if you haven't got kids get some

00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:17,770
kids

00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:20,080
but that's not a call to go out and get

00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:22,210
somebody else's kids by the way

00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,530
completely no do not go out to steal

00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:26,160
other people's children unless you want

00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:30,370
mine I'm willing to give them away

00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:35,440
they're delightful my wife is watching

00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:38,590
this so she's five thousand miles away

00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:40,690
and I'm never going home use the hallway

00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:43,060
track here's the Buffs the meetings the

00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:44,440
socials in between times meet together

00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:45,700
with some people you never know two

00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:48,340
years from now I might be talking about

00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:51,610
you and whatever crapoly name meta Sipan

00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:53,980
you meet there a great way of meeting

00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:55,480
new friends and people that we've got a

00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:59,580
strong relationship from and this guy

00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:01,780
this guy makes a good argument down him

00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:04,150
networking the conversations around Yap

00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:05,850
see are often more important than talks

00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:08,470
more important than this talk anyway

00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:10,180
don't be afraid of who you talk to

00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:14,650
no matter who they are this is Karen

00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:16,570
Paulie she's not an angry badger that's

00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:18,790
Sango and we usually leave them hid on

00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:20,730
the bottom IRC and we don't let him out

00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:22,960
for the foaming stops

00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:24,520
Karen would really like to say hi to you

00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,770
and she really loved it but you know

00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:28,480
don't crowd it because too many people

00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:31,290
around Karen me she can't see the bar I

00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,290
mean she doesn't like it

00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:39,380
I can't even run home now she's really

00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:40,880
sweet she's from the UK don't crowd of

00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:43,160
addy say hi and smile it says she does a

00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,960
very hard job and she has to remind

00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:47,150
people all the time how crap they are

00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,990
getting answers back to her I'm not

00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:52,340
pointing at anybody myself right now

00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:56,480
join in a pod yet if you're not gonna

00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:59,270
follow mom don't say this everybody says

00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:02,120
this but you know what nobody's good

00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:03,290
enough to be honest you can't be placed

00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:05,300
really badly you can be asked to do

00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:07,210
things you can't do you could open your

00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:11,210
mouth and go but I really can't do that

00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:13,040
but nobody is good enough and if you are

00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:14,180
that good how why aren't you producing

00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:18,620
all those groovy things I'm talking

00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:20,690
about we all need a little help I also

00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:23,810
want you to talk a little more shout a

00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:25,610
little more about things shout on social

00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:27,560
media of shout on your blogs all of this

00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:29,630
is really important it does get

00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:32,540
attention drawn and perhaps we can game

00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:34,220
TOB healthy community did it let's make

00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:35,600
a concerted effort to screw their

00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:38,150
statistics and make it really

00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:40,910
disproportional because that would be

00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:42,560
hilarious wouldn't that be good and then

00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:44,300
we've got no actually what happened was

00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,950
a million people turned up to our Yap

00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:49,640
see they were all out in the Hollywood

00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:54,920
hidden ten times we invited back Pam

00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:58,640
that year along with dark pan and Linkin

00:38:54,920 --> 00:39:00,530
Park and there everybody turned up so

00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,510
use social media use a blog use some

00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:04,400
communication and join in a group whole

00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:07,370
organization you know they run off

00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,810
volunteers that's the poem mongers I

00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:11,330
already showed you how some pill mongers

00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:12,740
have done great things I can continue to

00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:14,810
do great things and Evie travel around

00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:16,970
go visit your local Punk a group Damien

00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:18,890
Conway does it you might meet him on a

00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:21,980
sort of random occasion I've done that

00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:23,390
before go to events and you know you can

00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:24,800
offer to help out the defense the least

00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:27,610
you can do is clean up after yourselves

00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:30,050
because often organisers are doing it so

00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:32,090
you can do tiny things to make a big

00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:33,110
difference you can drop those little

00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:36,560
stones down the hill because an

00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:39,690
avalanche that's not a good metaphor

00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:41,070
you can join in the organizations like

00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:43,800
Pearl Foundation the light and pearl

00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:45,000
organization you can join Yap to Europe

00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,320
if you really want to you can help them

00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,090
to survive but you can do that by

00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,830
donating I'm not gonna be like Dan you

00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:51,870
should all be giving money raise your

00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:54,480
money give me your money

00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:57,120
I can be quiet I mean given to the

00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:00,900
organization's they require you can

00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:02,130
donate here and these organizations do a

00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:03,360
heck of a lot with the money damn

00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:07,230
manages a lot of the stuff

00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:09,390
Koff maintenance fund grants events but

00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:11,100
they send the new B and C pen testers

00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:13,590
relies entirely on donations

00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:15,840
I made this statement a couple years ago

00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:19,470
and it's not happened yet but if 20

00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:22,320
companies give $20 a month C pen testers

00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:23,100
doesn't have any money worries if 40

00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:27,570
companies do it

00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:29,130
they'll do it on in size so if C pan

00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:32,030
testers is really important to you you

00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:34,950
can give $20 a month you should do so I

00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:38,520
put my money where my mouth is Shadowcat

00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:39,960
donate to it so you can you can donate

00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:43,220
service so you can try to do a million

00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:46,110
tests like bingos if you've got no life

00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:48,510
few final things soul actually I did a

00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:50,550
talk right 25 years of Perlman I had to

00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:53,070
cut a lot of slides and I cut some

00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:55,490
people out and they were very happy

00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:55,490
about it

00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:02,810
so to rectify that situation I'm also

00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:02,810
I'm not going to mention them this year

00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:09,020
but I'm probably going to know few more

00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:10,910
people but I'm gonna say this is one key

00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:12,530
I could have spoken about Wendy and I

00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:13,700
could have spoken about this and I could

00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:15,890
have done the whole talk on those two

00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:17,240
and this is Abigail I could have done

00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:19,670
talk on this man that he's been tried

00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:21,109
she know of how many is it now because

00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:22,910
Jeff um though how many events is

00:41:21,109 --> 00:41:27,829
abigail been to I'm sure if he's beating

00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:30,859
you isn't he this is he's breathing one

00:41:27,829 --> 00:41:32,180
or two they have a fight it's not a very

00:41:30,859 --> 00:41:33,530
good fight because they have to I'm

00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:34,599
going to more Yap seasoning you that's

00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:36,859
not a good fight

00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:38,510
how what have you just gonna outlive the

00:41:36,859 --> 00:41:45,920
other one untie spilling win

00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:47,900
I died this is andreas Koenig and he's

00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,420
really involved with Paul Paulson he's a

00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:52,250
great guy and this is Andrew he's the

00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:54,050
Russian yuppie oligarch he's organized

00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:55,040
more lapses on his own than anybody else

00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:56,560
but Chris is trying to character up

00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:59,450
because he thinks that's a challenge

00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:01,880
this is Barbie he does see pentesters he

00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:04,670
also does act and this is Filipe blue

00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:06,619
hat of yes and he created act and he's

00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:08,540
wanting to create act 2 there's a sequel

00:42:06,619 --> 00:42:10,180
this time we can make it worse with

00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:15,589
social media

00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:18,650
this is guru and you know tiny and Misty

00:42:15,589 --> 00:42:20,150
is his only friend this is brandy fight

00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:21,560
I could have easily done a talking brain

00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:23,150
I could have done sock actually about

00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:25,220
Brock Brock has organized conferences

00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:26,960
and events as well I could have talked

00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:28,730
about Bruce now Bruce is already in

00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,020
google Summer of Code as one of the

00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:31,490
backup mentos pretty also there's quite

00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:32,630
a lot of other things I could have

00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:34,430
talked about Casey but you know what

00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:36,440
Casey didn't buy kid Casey's bike into

00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:38,000
Washington or something and he doesn't

00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:41,119
like it anymore so no I don't like Casey

00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,770
doorway casey this is Chris I could have

00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:45,150
spoke about Chris this year's event

00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:47,279
organizer

00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:49,410
there's a crisp proud of the scale of

00:42:47,279 --> 00:42:49,769
sleep deprivation I'm about 2.4 right

00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:52,829
now

00:42:49,769 --> 00:42:55,980
that's mostly tied Chris had once broken

00:42:52,829 --> 00:42:57,630
a point 9 on his own scale that man he

00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:58,740
looked bad I mean you know it's rough

00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:01,619
most of the time but he looked really

00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:02,910
bad this is Damian Conway who couldn't

00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:04,549
talk about him for ages

00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:07,980
and I could talk a lot about Dave Cross

00:43:04,549 --> 00:43:09,990
he's a really really sweet guy and he

00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:13,019
loves and desires folks if you see him

00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:15,299
hug him this is Dave Godin and he's

00:43:13,019 --> 00:43:16,980
really pen testers and Dave falsely

00:43:15,299 --> 00:43:18,930
frightens me I'm a tall man and Dave so

00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:21,059
much told me he's a sweet guy but he

00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:22,289
he's so much top of me but I could have

00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:23,700
thoughts about him and I could have

00:43:22,289 --> 00:43:25,769
talked about Doctor Who a lot in fact

00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:28,680
maybe not year's keynote the absolute

00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:32,390
2015 the Doctor Who keynote because you

00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:34,499
know no copyright claim problems there

00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:35,940
talked about Dylan and Dylan there's a

00:43:34,499 --> 00:43:37,499
sweet guy too and then it's not working

00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:39,210
at Mozilla so he's really happy and paid

00:43:37,499 --> 00:43:41,609
to work on open source yes you can all

00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:43,380
hate him and this is Edmund Vandenberg

00:43:41,609 --> 00:43:45,210
he created to send a newbie program and

00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:46,980
then he gave it to me but with no

00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:49,230
documentation or idea of how to run it

00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:50,730
and then he ran away I'm like Florian

00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:52,200
who did the same with google Summer of

00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:54,299
Code but Florian at least wrote a loaded

00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,829
documentation of how to do it and then

00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:58,170
he run away

00:43:54,829 --> 00:43:59,400
his flow in here you owe me a bit and

00:43:58,170 --> 00:44:00,779
this is Jeff Adrien we can talk about

00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:05,640
Jeff because apparently he's tried to

00:44:00,779 --> 00:44:07,319
outlive Abigail and this is hacking kiss

00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,579
simile and he co-wrote the Internet of

00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:10,380
Things which is a great book and you

00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:12,779
should read it because he snuck some

00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:13,920
pearl into that book man everybody tell

00:44:12,779 --> 00:44:16,140
you and raspberry pi's and everything

00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,539
they are they all use Python this uses

00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:22,170
Python to display but it works so badly

00:44:18,539 --> 00:44:23,640
we've shoved a load of Perl in there we

00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:26,150
didn't want to get moose on moving to a

00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:28,589
small component obviously but we did

00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:29,789
this is heat and heaves the member of

00:44:28,589 --> 00:44:31,319
the Pro Foundation is a conference

00:44:29,789 --> 00:44:33,480
organizer and he does a lot of work and

00:44:31,319 --> 00:44:34,739
you know never let this money in nuclear

00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,839
source material you don't have enough

00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:37,499
time to read that slide and this is he

00:44:36,839 --> 00:44:39,960
not and

00:44:37,499 --> 00:44:41,489
ian is an organizer of a conference and

00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,599
also a member of his local pearl

00:44:41,489 --> 00:44:45,569
Mongoose and that organizes meetings

00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:47,069
there and omaree dedicates a lot of work

00:44:45,569 --> 00:44:49,289
to do dvh plasma because i've spoken

00:44:47,069 --> 00:44:51,340
about him I would have had to censor a

00:44:49,289 --> 00:44:58,270
talk about this man

00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:59,650
I have no fantastic picture of my own

00:44:58,270 --> 00:45:01,660
from Jacinta but I could have spoken

00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:03,640
back to Center and anybody but to talk

00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:06,640
about Paul Fenwick including himself he

00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:08,320
should have done this his own fault this

00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:10,210
is just Robinson and she's already been

00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:11,230
mentioned by done and Jess is a great

00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:13,720
person I could have spoken at length

00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:14,530
about Jess and I could have spoken about

00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:16,990
this man

00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:18,490
let's some of them too I could have

00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:20,830
spoken about JT I think he did a really

00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:22,570
great job of the Yap see and I think he

00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:25,270
did a really great job of talking to

00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:26,680
people in a calm moderated voice I don't

00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:32,170
know this guy is but it keeps on

00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:34,150
sneaking into my slides yeah this is Leo

00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:35,560
luck with and despite the fact that he

00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:37,090
got yourself a nice big award he still

00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:40,150
hides behind the scenes and does lots of

00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:42,550
work and doesn't say anything um because

00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:45,100
I got him into last year's keynote and

00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:46,480
he was really embarrassed this is Leo he

00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:48,070
still does a lot of things and he got

00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,510
himself crowd-sourced to come here and

00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:51,370
he's probably just as embarrassed again

00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:53,500
and you gotta love his nice long hair

00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:56,740
now he especially wants you to run your

00:45:53,500 --> 00:46:00,520
fingers through his hair because he

00:45:56,740 --> 00:46:02,320
likes to flick it this is Marcus Romberg

00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:04,900
who's done a lot of work in catalyst and

00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:07,540
also in mojolicious Amati is not just

00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:08,770
the husband of Karen you know we can

00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:11,890
talk about the other things Marcy does

00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:14,080
searches cheat when he's driving and

00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:16,060
this is Matthew I'm Matthew dedicated a

00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:17,440
bit of time to putting into five point

00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:18,670
to point over the Shay but he also does

00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,040
other stuff he got me a lot of

00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:22,660
sponsorship and he was working at Dyn so

00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,130
why do you give me any sponsorship where

00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:26,620
you are currently infinity interactive

00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:30,280
you bastards give me money John

00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:32,170
there you are money I mean sponsor and

00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:36,580
donate to organizers and things not to

00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:39,700
me but I hate this guy and he bites me

00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:41,500
Biff and he's sweet and he's really nice

00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:44,200
he's got a great accent he's quite

00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:47,820
attractive that's not fair

00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:50,380
how is that fair that he's nice

00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:52,210
attractive with the great accent that's

00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:54,580
just there's no part of that that's

00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:55,930
actually fair but I'll do is really

00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:57,220
shiny always looked away from a camera

00:46:55,930 --> 00:46:59,890
and he's gonna be so happy that you all

00:46:57,220 --> 00:47:01,360
know what he looks like now and anybody

00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:02,970
could talk about Miyagawa for a great

00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:06,930
length of time

00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:08,730
they really could this is Paul Johnson

00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:10,680
he did the Google Code done a couple of

00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:12,750
years ago he did a fantastic job it

00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:15,240
really tied him out I'm hoping hoping to

00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:16,590
persuade him to come and do it again

00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:18,270
I don't know who the hell this guy is

00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:24,780
but you know I understand he's he might

00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:27,200
work at booking so if you see Nick go

00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:30,480
talk to him apparently they're hiring

00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:32,100
and this this there are children in

00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,040
Lancaster who are now scarred for life

00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:36,870
for the things we did to that penguin

00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:38,430
this is Pearce colleague go seek seek

00:47:36,870 --> 00:47:40,620
out his child of the library song it's

00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:41,100
an English folk song on Google and it's

00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:43,590
brilliant

00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:45,870
and this you everybody knows Randall's

00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:47,550
waltz come on this is Randall we could

00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:50,510
all talk about him but we don't need to

00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:54,120
we can talk for himself and does Outland

00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:55,830
this is Ricky and I every SUNY should do

00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:57,510
a talk about Ricky just to embarrass

00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:59,370
maybe Ricky stand next to them while

00:47:57,510 --> 00:48:04,370
they're doing the talk and this is my

00:47:59,370 --> 00:48:06,690
dealer he got me hooked on hardware he's

00:48:04,370 --> 00:48:08,790
he's great he's a nice guy I don't like

00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:11,070
this guy though

00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:13,580
not like in this guy he's gonna make me

00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:21,600
look bad so I don't like this guy at all

00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:23,490
screw him a mrs. Steven and I could do a

00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:26,120
talk about him I could do talk about my

00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:28,800
reign Brandt rarely marine eyes actually

00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:30,930
pretty much supported the whole series

00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,280
of modules all on his own for years and

00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:33,690
he tells you about them but because I'm

00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:36,030
not as intelligent to him I don't

00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:37,470
understand he tells me at left every

00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:39,510
time as well I get him to tell me and I

00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:41,490
still don't get what he does and this is

00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:53,550
Jakov and if you are a newbie find this

00:48:41,490 --> 00:48:56,790
man and right now those people I could

00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:59,910
truthfully grab images of other people

00:48:56,790 --> 00:49:01,830
who contribute so before coming here

00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:03,900
like the last week or so I read this

00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:05,280
article if somebody would come in to

00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:06,810
Yahtzee and every time they've come

00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:09,210
before they come with some people from

00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:09,690
their company and they've had a great

00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:12,090
time

00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:13,440
and this time they're a bit food with

00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:15,330
trepidation because they were coming on

00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:17,850
their own but they still wrote this

00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:21,770
great article and the five words that

00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:24,090
really like is it helps me make myself

00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:29,340
on their own they're just really

00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:31,590
powerful words but that really is why I

00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:34,950
love this community and why Shadowcat

00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:38,780
stay using Perl it's all of those and

00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:38,780
though I saw that life so

00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:41,819
