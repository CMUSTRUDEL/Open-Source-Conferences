Title: Nick Patch (‎patch‎) - Unicode Beyond Just Characters: Localization with the CLDR
Publication date: 2014-06-23
Playlist: YAPC::NA 2014
Description: 
	Unicode is much more than just characters. The Unicode Consortium defines open standards for collating, parsing, and formatting data in much of the world's languages. The Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR) is the largest standard repository of locale data along with specifications for its use and is a powerful resource for software localization. Unicode CLDR is quickly becoming the de facto locale standard with widespread use among companies including Google, Apple, and IBM; projects ranging from Linux distributions to Wikipedia; and increasing support in many programming languages.

This talk will provide an introduction to software localization with the CLDR, highlight several CLDR-based CPAN projects, demonstrate how Shutterstock uses and contributes to them, and discuss the remaining work for the Perl community to provide first-class CLDR support.
