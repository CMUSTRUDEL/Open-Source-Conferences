Title: Augustina Ragwitz (‎auggy‎) - ‎Perl Out Of Order: Why Timeout Today What You Can Return Tomorrow‎
Publication date: 2014-06-24

Description: 
	So you've built a fancy web application with a fancy database back end, but now that people are using it you've got a few features timing out... and making for angry end users. In a normal procedural program, each task is done when the other finishes. Another option is to hand off the hard work to something else and give your user a status rather than a timeout! This talk will introduce asynchronous programming and the worker queue pattern. I will also provide a simple, reusable example for passing a long running SQL query off to a worker queue using RabbitMQ and AnyEvent::RabbitMQ.
