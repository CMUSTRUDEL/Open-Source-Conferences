Title: R Geoffrey Avery (‎rGeoffrey‎) - Lightning Talks Day 1
Publication date: 2014-06-23
Playlist: YAPC::NA 2014
Description: 
	These Lightning Talks may be serious, funny, or both. They may be given by experienced speakers already giving full length talks or by first time speakers just starting out (this is a great way to get started if you have something to say). If you are a first time speaker you will win a tie with an experience speaker when the schedule is made if it comes to it. Today's first time speaker could be tomorrow's keynote speaker.

We will have about 10 Lightning Talks of 5 minutes each day. Submit your talk through the submit talk link on this website. The first deadline is with the full length talks. The second deadline is one week before the conference starts and many proposals will be accepted. At least two speaking spots on days 2 and 3 will be held open until the day before the talks to give you a chance to see something at the conference and put together a Lightning Talk response. However if you wait for the later deadlines note that there are fewer spots available and you are less likely to be accepted so please try to submit more than a week before the conference.

In addition to the five minute Lightning Talks where you get to use your computer, slides, and any other tool, we will also have some Lightning Advertisements. These are only 30 seconds, you don't have to submit a proposal, you don't get any slides, and the only AV assistance offered is a microphone. If you have a BOF to announce, an auction item so advertise or any other short message you can use the transition time that would be otherwise wasted between Lightning Talks to share your message. Just show up before we start and take a seat in the assigned seats in the front of the room.

hey

00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:23,070
you

00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:19,440
so now it's time for the main event day

00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:21,990
one today we have 10 speakers scheduled

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,270
there's room for 10 more tomorrow and

00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:26,490
the following day they are not yet all

00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:28,440
full if you would like to submit a

00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:30,480
lightning talk the link is through the

00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,760
conference website just go submit it all

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,130
in if you have submitted one or are in

00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,140
the process of doing it please find me

00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:38,880
between now and then to say hello and

00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,739
that i know you're here and get

00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:44,010
everything set up tomorrow for the

00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:45,660
lightning talks come up during the

00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:47,489
afternoon cookie break make sure your

00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,320
laptop works sit in the first two rows

00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:52,440
here and everything will work fine if

00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:54,030
you want to give an advertisement during

00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,610
the gap while they're messing with your

00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,660
computers and switching while someone's

00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,239
messing with their computers and

00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,770
switching move up to the front off to

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,120
the side and then come up to the

00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:04,440
microphone here to give your

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,330
advertisement if you're giving an

00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,760
advertisement and they're still clapping

00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:11,190
for them you can wait I won't count it

00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,019
against you if you're about to plug in

00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,430
your computer and start speaking and

00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:16,620
they're still clapping for some reason

00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:19,769
for the advertiser go ahead and wait I

00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:22,620
won't count it against you we have five

00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:25,230
minutes at four minutes I will ring the

00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,489
bell which I stupidly left over there so

00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:31,380
we'll just have to trust me that it

00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:33,150
makes a bell sound at five minutes I

00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:37,430
will hit the gong which I think by now

00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:37,430
you've all heard so

00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:47,620
no that's okay oh and for advertisements

00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:49,510
particularly today I would like the

00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,790
people who are running a bath to come up

00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:53,440
or if you picked out a restaurant from

00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:56,860
the list on that you can find on the

00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,810
wiki things to eat come up say where

00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:00,459
you're going to go eat and we're in this

00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,319
room or out front you will be standing

00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:05,700
so you can gather a crowd and take them

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:15,430
with you don't leave any stragglers and

00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:18,040
we will go ahead and get started now hey

00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:21,130
everyone I'm Nick patch and I'm here to

00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:24,370
talk about stomach who here has used a

00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:28,630
stemmer okay handful of people out there

00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:31,300
so I'm what is stemming algorithm is is

00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:33,490
you take a word you run it through your

00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,410
stemmer and then you get the stem it's

00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:37,419
kind of like a root and I'll go into why

00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:38,560
you might want to do this so first off

00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:41,139
we have a few people who know about

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:44,979
stemming the audience on what do you

00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:48,539
think the stem of hacking is ok heck

00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:48,539
very good a hacker

00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:56,489
and of course hack is just hack some we

00:04:54,509 --> 00:05:00,919
get a stop common stem from each of

00:04:56,489 --> 00:05:04,729
these words then say what about gurgled

00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:07,469
yet gurgle but you know it may not be a

00:05:04,729 --> 00:05:09,719
actual word itself a stem isn't

00:05:07,469 --> 00:05:13,169
necessarily a word it's just a common

00:05:09,719 --> 00:05:16,129
portion of a word I were late 'add terms

00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:19,349
so gurgling is girl notice how the

00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:21,599
original word has an e after the L on

00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:23,309
one of them in an eye after the other so

00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:26,639
we just chop it all off and we get this

00:05:23,309 --> 00:05:28,499
common you know GU rgl different

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,449
stemming algorithms can do different

00:05:28,499 --> 00:05:32,669
things you should use the stain same

00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:35,189
stemming algorithm for the same language

00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:37,549
when you're comparing two stems so let's

00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:40,559
take a look at how we might use this I

00:05:37,549 --> 00:05:43,289
let's stem hacker again we get hack and

00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:48,239
I compare it to the Sam of hacking well

00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:50,849
obviously I this is true and we commonly

00:05:48,239 --> 00:05:53,519
use this in search engines so at

00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:55,649
shutterstock we support search in 20

00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,749
languages and we use a lot of stammers

00:05:55,649 --> 00:06:01,049
for various different languages to

00:05:57,749 --> 00:06:05,219
compare words so here you might I index

00:06:01,049 --> 00:06:08,039
the stem of hacker and then look up the

00:06:05,219 --> 00:06:12,989
stem of hacking toward and then you'll

00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:15,559
have a result and there are a bunch of

00:06:12,989 --> 00:06:18,809
different stemming algorithms on Sipan I

00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:20,699
once they're competing ones and there

00:06:18,809 --> 00:06:24,029
are ones that just afford an individual

00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:26,759
language but the problem is that they

00:06:24,029 --> 00:06:28,919
have all different interfaces and some

00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:31,559
of them expect character strings some of

00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:34,139
them expect byte strings possibly in

00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:36,899
utf-8 encoding possibly in various other

00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:41,759
encoding and don't get me started about

00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:44,129
passing byte strings around so I we

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:47,610
created this unified interface linguist

00:06:44,129 --> 00:06:50,099
mne that just supports all of the

00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:53,639
stemming algorithms on Sipan is backends

00:06:50,099 --> 00:06:57,569
it has a good saying defaults for I

00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:59,489
wants to use and there are 21 different

00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:02,279
languages that it currently supports and

00:06:59,489 --> 00:07:03,420
growing here's just a simple example of

00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:05,760
using it you in stand

00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:09,360
your linguist em any object for a

00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:11,250
specific language and then you call the

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:17,010
stem method pass in your word retrieve

00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:18,930
the stem I'm there are there's also a

00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:21,240
lot of functionality that the current

00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:24,240
stammers on Sipan don't have like

00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:27,120
there's the cash attribute here to

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,520
enable caching I say you're doing a lot

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,160
of stemming of the same words and this

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,380
is a performance boost then you can set

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,990
stemming exceptions say words you don't

00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:38,400
want to stem at all or words you want to

00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,080
stem to something entirely different

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,290
than what the stemming algo then will do

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:46,020
as well as by default unicode case

00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:48,720
folding and unicode normalization as

00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:54,080
opposed to most of the cpn stammers just

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:57,720
do lowercase I as part of their stemming

00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:01,010
and you can stem a single word a list of

00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:04,280
words or stem in a rare F in place so

00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:06,690
let's take a look at also some new

00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:09,240
stammers that have been added to Sipan

00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:10,920
in the last year there's check because

00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,040
this is a language that we started

00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:16,860
supporting at shutterstock I'm and we've

00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:19,500
got this bundle of stammers in linguist

00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,420
mu9 which stands for University of nasha

00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,730
tell they define a bunch of different

00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:26,130
stemming algorithms and don't worry

00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:27,870
about the funny capitalization in u9

00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:31,080
because just use linguist mne and don't

00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:37,500
think about i even you know calling

00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:40,500
linguist mu9 then Bulgarian and even I

00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:42,510
Persian also known as Farsi which for

00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,810
all of these these are the first

00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:49,290
stammers on Sipan for these languages

00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:53,060
but you may not need to use any of these

00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:56,640
because i just recently released an

00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:57,670
Esperanto stammer for the international

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,120
language

00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:02,860
so as soon as Esperanto catches on is

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,170
the international language you won't

00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,670
have to use any of the others and I know

00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:09,220
there are some critics in the audience

00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:13,030
who don't believe that will happen so

00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:18,490
for them I released by an ito stammer

00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:21,400
and I'm you know this covers all of the

00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:24,310
world languages now I but what about the

00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:26,500
intergalactic languages I how about a

00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:30,160
Klingon stemmer unfortunately I don't

00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:32,800
speak Klingon but I later this week I am

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:36,100
seeing Paul Fenwick so maybe we can set

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,800
something up a few other summers that

00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:42,100
are on the way our I polish Arabic

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:44,110
bengali hindi and marathi none of which

00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:48,630
other than a basic one of arabic are

00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:48,630
available on CPM so thanks everyone

00:10:03,619 --> 00:10:10,470
hi some of you may know and some of you

00:10:08,549 --> 00:10:13,139
may not know that we are having official

00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:15,779
movie nights this year we've had bad

00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:18,839
movie night for about a decade at yapchi

00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:20,609
unofficially this year they've asked me

00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:22,829
to do a good movie night as well as a

00:10:20,609 --> 00:10:26,459
bad movie night tonight is good movie

00:10:22,829 --> 00:10:30,869
night I don't know the exact location

00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:33,119
yet it's on the 11th floor but i will be

00:10:30,869 --> 00:10:36,059
posting it on the wiki as soon as i find

00:10:33,119 --> 00:10:41,179
out what it is it starts at nine o'clock

00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:41,179
and you are all welcome thank

00:10:54,140 --> 00:11:12,990
that is really broken table tonight

00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:19,740
apparently not thanks that looks better

00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:25,150
okay so it's about developing fess so

00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:27,670
Pearl has exceptions and they're not all

00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:30,040
that great they're kind of shitty

00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:35,440
actually they're basically how you do

00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:37,090
exceptions in Pearl is with die and you

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,580
just give it a swing that's an error and

00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:41,950
it reports where that air is there's

00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:44,800
some problems with this though because

00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:47,740
it's based on the location that the dye

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,270
was um not we're really what caused the

00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:52,900
error which is the thing that called it

00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:55,450
usually also it only gives you this one

00:11:52,900 --> 00:12:03,520
line of context which is not always very

00:11:55,450 --> 00:12:07,270
helpful so there are solutions to this

00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:11,140
the first one is using carp use croak

00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:15,490
instead of dye and so now we get a

00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:18,580
location based on the what actually

00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:19,930
caused the error as opposed to the

00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:25,510
location that you listed that you

00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:28,390
actually died from so that's helpful we

00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:31,240
also get confess which allows you to

00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:34,380
have a full stack trace instead of just

00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,380
one line of the error

00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:41,240
but what if this code isn't code you

00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:43,400
wrote this is somebody else's module

00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:45,110
you're interfacing with so there is a

00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:51,410
module written to solve this problem

00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:55,340
called carp always where you simply add

00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:57,170
carp always as a module you load and it

00:12:55,340 --> 00:13:02,990
gives you the full stack trace for all

00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:05,060
exceptions so yeah this dislike it gives

00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:06,890
you full stack traces for die croak

00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:09,260
confess anything like that including

00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:12,020
internal pearl errors like syntax errors

00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:15,290
etc it also has a thing for giving doing

00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:16,700
this for warnings but for example when

00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:20,690
you try to use this with other things

00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:24,770
like say e bi x class what happens when

00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:27,350
we add car always in this case nothing

00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:30,260
we don't get any extra contacts we don't

00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:33,080
get a stack trace the problem here is

00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:35,570
that DB IX class uses exception objects

00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:38,300
instead of strings the way carp always

00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:40,220
and carp work is by just taking the

00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:45,440
string of the error message or warning

00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:47,090
and adding our the context to the end of

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,010
it and to string so it's easy to modify

00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:51,320
that doesn't really work with objects

00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:53,570
because you destroy the object if you do

00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:56,210
that and other handlers can't handle it

00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:57,970
as an object like you should so instead

00:13:56,210 --> 00:14:00,650
they just pass them through unmodified

00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:03,560
so to solve this I wrote devel confess

00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:05,630
it's based on the same concept but adds

00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,490
stack traces to exception objects as

00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:11,690
well and also works for bear references

00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:19,010
in case anyone ever uses that so we can

00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:21,430
replace our default config to skip a

00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:21,430
little fire

00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:29,209
and we get all of our context

00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:33,829
information now and it also has a little

00:14:29,209 --> 00:14:37,639
short flag of dash D so it's even less

00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:39,559
typing which is fun so the advantages

00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:42,499
here include stack traces for exception

00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:44,569
objects it also does some other things

00:14:42,499 --> 00:14:47,689
to give you better context for anonymous

00:14:44,569 --> 00:14:49,670
subs and evals it can be disabled if you

00:14:47,689 --> 00:14:52,009
need to do that it also has kind of

00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:56,480
fewer prerequisites which matters to

00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:59,329
some people it also has some extra

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,759
features there is other variations on

00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:04,540
this concept on cpanel that gave you a

00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:07,009
colored warnings and errors would dump

00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:09,170
the contents of the arguments to study

00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:12,410
just references or would show you source

00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:15,769
information so I stuck all of those in

00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:18,079
as well you use the dump option and it

00:15:15,769 --> 00:15:22,220
shows you the contents of references

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:24,259
instead of just the address you give it

00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:27,889
color and you get color coded warnings

00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:30,050
and errors it has support for handling

00:15:27,889 --> 00:15:32,300
built-in exception objects so it'll

00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:35,180
detect other exception objects that are

00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:38,240
being used and not do its own magic and

00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:41,480
you can also disable stuff and you can

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,699
get the highlighted source for the for

00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:48,410
the entire context how does this

00:15:43,699 --> 00:15:50,360
actually work we used I handler it's

00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:53,750
handled calls for a cult for all errors

00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:56,269
or warn handler but what we actually do

00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:59,660
is well the warning silence is the

00:15:56,269 --> 00:16:01,339
warning unless we output ourself or the

00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:04,160
die you can't silence the error but you

00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:06,949
can just override it by dying um what we

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:09,199
do is we generate a subclass of the

00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:11,660
exception object they will show the

00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:14,929
stack trace and rebe less into that so

00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:18,259
it's kind of ugly and awful we save the

00:16:14,929 --> 00:16:22,249
the stack trace store externally we

00:16:18,259 --> 00:16:25,759
generate a package and then we inherit

00:16:22,249 --> 00:16:28,579
from the original class and bless into

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:30,529
it it's it's awful and then there's all

00:16:28,579 --> 00:16:34,570
this magic for string ification that it

00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:36,520
has to redo the original thing it's fun

00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:38,410
I did I fork instead of just using the

00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,480
original it's there's a lot of

00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:42,760
complexity here it can interfere with

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,200
code in other ways carr policies is

00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,370
incredibly simple and I talked to the

00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,320
author about this and he wanted to just

00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:49,600
keep it as a dead-simple module so I

00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:54,180
just used a separate thing so everyone

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,180
should use this I like it and thanks for

00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:13,230
hi

00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:21,459
hi Jane heck and where's Yannick just in

00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:24,350
cases are you knitting at the moment

00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:26,720
okay so there's going to be a dancer

00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:29,179
buff so we're just going to chat about

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:33,710
what's going on dancer 12 everything

00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:36,830
it's a tomorrow Tuesday 11am add the P

00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:38,539
naas did I get that right third floor so

00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:41,029
if you want to come Yannick and I will

00:17:38,539 --> 00:17:45,190
be there and you can go to the weekend

00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:45,190
register and that's about it thank you

00:17:49,610 --> 00:18:01,040
yeah one second where's my mouse

00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:11,440
last I put the chair for that

00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:25,230
yay ok so I'm Zack zebrowski I am a

00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:30,810
pearl guy I do database stuff at work

00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:33,430
but I also teach a course on security

00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:35,500
specifically web browser security so I'm

00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:38,170
going to give you a flavor for that the

00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:44,170
presentation here is at bdubs exit at us

00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:46,960
/ betta HTML or if you go to open

00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:50,080
security training info there is a ton of

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:53,200
full day courses all about security

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:55,780
training this is just one of many and

00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,060
it's actually have full youtube videos

00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:01,840
and all that good stuff it's all

00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:04,240
creative common licensed and if anyone

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:08,020
is interested in any of that stuff let

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:10,480
me know it's all good stuff this is a 5

00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:13,570
minute version of my full day course so

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,730
this is slightly abbreviated but it

00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:17,290
should be a good info and if anyone's

00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:19,570
interested I can talk with you later

00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:24,640
about any of the content I'm happy to

00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:26,950
talk so reminder that you learn what you

00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:31,000
learn here use for good not evil because

00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:34,000
good things are good so we're going to

00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,780
talk briefly about the characteristics

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,240
of internet connections we're going to

00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:41,710
talk about ways of identifying who your

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,130
end users are and they're going to

00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:47,560
briefly talk about ways to obfuscate

00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:51,340
where you're coming from so there's good

00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:55,780
cases for both of these if you are a

00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:58,210
bank user you want make sure that if you

00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:59,530
are someone that is I closing your bank

00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:01,360
you want to make sure that you're coming

00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:05,050
from the US I was compared to the UK or

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:07,150
something like that so there are three

00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:11,190
main characteristics of any internet

00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:11,190
connection which is the first one is

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,530
when are you connecting to the internet

00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:19,000
because that's important because you

00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:21,160
most people are awake when they connect

00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,779
to the internet so that's a good way of

00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:32,269
trying to identify where people are

00:20:23,779 --> 00:20:33,739
where I'm sorry when do you I what

00:20:32,269 --> 00:20:38,149
device is connecting to the internet

00:20:33,739 --> 00:20:39,859
people that's that's one thing you have

00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:41,149
to do is use a device to connect to

00:20:39,859 --> 00:20:44,119
internet so that's an important thing

00:20:41,149 --> 00:20:46,969
how are you connecting there is Wi-Fi

00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:48,469
their style up there is fios a whole

00:20:46,969 --> 00:20:49,999
bunch of different options each of those

00:20:48,469 --> 00:20:55,729
have different characteristics and our

00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:58,999
ways to identify you there is a IP

00:20:55,729 --> 00:21:04,719
geolocation is basically a database of

00:20:58,999 --> 00:21:08,539
IP addresses and location information

00:21:04,719 --> 00:21:10,159
this is derived by two main ways of

00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:14,899
doing it these are both open source

00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:18,499
techniques one is host IP info is asking

00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:20,659
basically the user where are you query

00:21:18,499 --> 00:21:23,059
who is registries is another way of

00:21:20,659 --> 00:21:26,080
doing it this is from software 77 which

00:21:23,059 --> 00:21:31,419
is actually based in South Africa and

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:33,919
max mind is is one example of this data

00:21:31,419 --> 00:21:36,950
for when i was in arlington virginia

00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:39,769
which is where i'm where i live it

00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:42,649
returned a neighboring city for where

00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:46,940
thought my IP geolocation was that

00:21:42,649 --> 00:21:50,719
actually makes sense because when IP

00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:52,700
addresses are for the most part static

00:21:50,719 --> 00:21:55,039
when you're connecting through a nano

00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:57,859
service provider however if there's a

00:21:55,039 --> 00:22:02,299
major storm outage data changes it takes

00:21:57,859 --> 00:22:05,719
a while for databases update so here's a

00:22:02,299 --> 00:22:08,029
some pro content yay there's a bunch of

00:22:05,719 --> 00:22:11,029
pro modules that allow you to do IP

00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:14,559
geolocation lookups within pearl these

00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:14,559
are the modules that do that

00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:20,820
there you can also be when you just

00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:24,070
connect to the internet you are also

00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:28,990
allowing users to add the server to

00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:31,510
identify who you are you can you the by

00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:34,780
just making the connection you know the

00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:36,670
remote IP address of the user you can do

00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:39,100
a DNS lookup on that to give you more

00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:40,990
information the user agent which is

00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,430
actually the type of browser like you're

00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:46,390
using can also give you more information

00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:48,820
about the server about what you're doing

00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:53,470
if you go to Zach that free salad org

00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:54,760
slash envtl you can see what the browser

00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:59,230
is returning for your particular

00:22:54,760 --> 00:23:02,260
information there is HTTP browser detect

00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:04,360
which is a pro module that lets you know

00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:07,260
if you're using a mobile device or

00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:09,940
something like that there is also

00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:12,880
JavaScript techniques if you go to PAP

00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:15,340
click eff dot org it uses JavaScript and

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,740
other techniques to identify fonts and

00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:20,580
also the size of your screen which is

00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:23,320
great for identification purposes

00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:25,630
JavaScript location API is a new feature

00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:27,100
of html5 which returns very accurate

00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:29,290
information about where your browser is

00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:33,190
it's a little bit scary I strongly

00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:35,560
recommend you look at it and if you want

00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:36,970
to borrow network connections that's a

00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:40,120
great way to obfuscate where you're

00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:42,250
coming from so just by going to a nearby

00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:44,110
hotel and saying I'm a guest user that's

00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:46,480
one way to obfuscate your location if

00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:49,450
your if your actual location is

00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,520
somewhere in the city there's also the

00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:55,120
application called tour which is

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:57,820
reasonably popular in the news that's a

00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:00,460
great way for people to anonymize their

00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:02,230
locations there are a bunch of caveats

00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:06,880
associated with any technique that you

00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:09,670
need to be aware of basically if you're

00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:14,680
using a anonymous application and there

00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:16,570
is there and if you are you are

00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,950
convinced or the browser and is

00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:20,500
convinced into doing something that

00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:24,360
shouldn't give might lose your and

00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:29,460
amenity so with all that said

00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:29,460
ask me later pearl yay

00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:51,350
hello I am Ori I'm the Pearl hunter I

00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:54,480
hunt down pro people and kill them dead

00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:57,180
pearl isn't dead always look at people

00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,430
to hire get jobs to them clients how

00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:02,130
people get joe get them right pearl

00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:04,920
people so i have a pearl jobs buff

00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:07,830
tomorrow at lunchtime on the 14th floor

00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:09,000
lounge we're getting pizza you got let

00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:12,510
me know you're going to get will have

00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,710
pizzas of soda their pay for your pocket

00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:16,350
on the pizza but we'll figure that out

00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:19,230
later okay just catch me anytime you

00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:21,500
want I'm here all week no tip your

00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:21,500
waiters

00:25:41,179 --> 00:25:47,340
at all so who in here knows what the

00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:49,620
pullout bin calendar is not enough

00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:51,809
people okay the Pearl advent calendar is

00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:55,409
an advent calendar will you get a new

00:25:51,809 --> 00:25:57,600
poll module a review of it err once a

00:25:55,409 --> 00:25:59,970
day over Christmas now it started 14

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,760
years ago when our local pool mongers

00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:05,100
went to the bar but anyway and ended up

00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:07,649
with me writing an article every 25

00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:09,570
articles every year and I got burnt out

00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:12,000
and it got taken over by many people

00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:13,559
most recently rick has been hurting

00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,750
people to help write articles and this

00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:18,090
year we want to start early rather than

00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:19,769
starting near Christmas so I'm looking

00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:21,330
for people to help write articles now

00:26:19,769 --> 00:26:23,309
many of you are sitting there thinking I

00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:24,840
can't write an article on PO well you

00:26:23,309 --> 00:26:26,850
can because it's mainly just a war story

00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,200
about your favorite module or what

00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:31,380
you've done with it or exciting things

00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:34,649
like that so come find me or join our

00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:38,899
mailing list tinyurl.com / pearl advent

00:26:34,649 --> 00:26:38,899
and help us write an article

00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:53,789
it worked earlier

00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:08,350
hey good morning my name is Steve I'm

00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:14,050
from Milwaukee um hi nah I'm an

00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:16,300
alcoholic I'm from Milwaukee no um I

00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:19,600
suggested a scalability Bob so I'm stuck

00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:21,310
doing the scalability buff it's a it's

00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:25,750
my first buff so it's gonna be amazing

00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:27,370
so you guys should come as an example I

00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:30,040
do a web application development so

00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:33,100
there's times where it's not going as

00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:34,930
fast as I like it so so I'm trying to

00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:37,240
get some advice on some new techniques I

00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:38,950
can use so I'm hoping that it's not just

00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:41,770
a bunch of people that are struggling if

00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:44,470
you guys are scalability experts let's

00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:45,430
get the broody experts and can give some

00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:46,660
advice that'd be awesome to have you

00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:49,570
guys there to share some success stories

00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:52,060
so join us today at four o'clock up on

00:27:49,570 --> 00:28:02,760
the third floor also in the pinellas so

00:27:52,060 --> 00:28:06,940
hooking up a cell thanks alright so in

00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:10,930
two thousand eight oh I don't have

00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:13,450
slides yeah so in two thousand eight I

00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:15,490
have hardware not slides so in two

00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:17,770
thousand eight I invited Alicia Gibb

00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:19,780
from bug labs to come and speak at

00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:21,720
Pittsburgh pearl workshop and most

00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:25,650
everyone there was kind of confused

00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:28,240
including myself but what I knew is that

00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:31,330
hardware was cool and awesome and I'd

00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:33,370
been a tinkerer for a long time I grew

00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:36,340
up having similar things I hope most of

00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:38,460
you had something similar to this but

00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:41,440
they're cooler now than they used to be

00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:44,830
and we can add things like Arduino to

00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:47,200
them in all kinds of cool stuff anyway

00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:49,240
so Alicia came and she was talking about

00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,340
bug labs and a lot of war was being

00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,360
talked about running pearl on the bug

00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:56,680
labs tool and you don't have to know

00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:59,080
what that is if you don't know alicia

00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:01,390
has gone on and she helped start the

00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:03,370
open source hardware Association so

00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:05,260
we're all Foss people we know free and

00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:07,060
open source software it also has applied

00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:09,730
to hardware but in those discussions

00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:12,400
with Alicia we were talking about the

00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:13,660
democratization of hardware which we is

00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,990
open-source people we don't always think

00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,030
of

00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:17,710
our free software is being democratized

00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:19,150
but that's a big part of it and the same

00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:22,809
thing is being happening happening in

00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:25,210
Hardware more than all of that we are

00:29:22,809 --> 00:29:27,400
reaching these points in hardware where

00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:28,750
you can provision infinite computing is

00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,160
the term that's being valley hoot about

00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:33,160
right we can go down these cloud

00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:34,780
services AWS linode wherever and just

00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:36,250
have infinite compute and we can have it

00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:39,940
instantly and we can have it for a while

00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:43,210
and they can go away and that's really

00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:45,190
very cool and that's really where I'm

00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:46,900
thinking about hardware that's not where

00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:48,970
you have to think about hardware I am

00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:50,740
interested in how pearl used to be the

00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:53,920
glue language for systems I see Pearl

00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:56,170
being the glue language for everything

00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:57,580
and what is everything people talk about

00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:59,380
the Internet of Things it's kind of

00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:02,040
become into the internet of everything

00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:05,770
and everything is just that it is

00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:07,780
everything from sending your drone which

00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:10,120
is a great talk coming up about drones

00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:12,309
but sending your drones to go take

00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:14,080
pictures and send them back get them

00:30:12,309 --> 00:30:16,750
analyzed on the cloud we can provision

00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:18,010
things so fast I mean it is amazing to

00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:19,480
think of where we're going to be when

00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:22,900
you think about everything and all the

00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:25,780
possibilities that we can do so

00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:27,610
everything is big right everything's

00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:30,179
pretty big but if you combine everything

00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:33,000
with everything to make something new

00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:35,890
then that's even bigger but if you

00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:39,400
combine that with the infinite dreams of

00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:42,670
what those combinations can be its

00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:44,530
enormous and I think pearl can find a

00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:48,309
great place they're dealing with

00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:50,650
everything but it needs to be easier it

00:30:48,309 --> 00:30:52,179
needs to be really easy i was talking to

00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:54,040
that trout I don't know where the hell

00:30:52,179 --> 00:30:56,620
he went but Matt trout was talking about

00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:59,890
you know he deals with catalyst and

00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:01,240
stuff because he hates the web he wants

00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:02,950
to build tools that make it really easy

00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:05,110
for him to get in and out of that web

00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:07,000
interface and I think some of us think

00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:09,670
that about hardware you want to build

00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,230
things that are kind of absolutely get

00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:13,240
that abstraction where you don't have to

00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:14,710
deal too much a couple of great things

00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,870
happen in pearl hardware over the last

00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:19,840
few weeks we got device fermata pushed

00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:21,820
up to see pan which is a kind of a MIDI

00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,429
interface into microcontrollers if you

00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:25,809
dine admitting which is great we have

00:31:24,429 --> 00:31:27,049
people from the dancer and mojo

00:31:25,809 --> 00:31:30,110
communities that are starting to

00:31:27,049 --> 00:31:32,450
build web interfaces into that so you'll

00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:34,249
be able to do like curl calls and use

00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:35,869
your whole UNIX toolchain to start to

00:31:34,249 --> 00:31:38,389
flip bits and turn things on and move

00:31:35,869 --> 00:31:40,190
motors and read bits everyone knows how

00:31:38,389 --> 00:31:42,200
to do this stuff we just need to get

00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:44,389
some thin layers to make it a much more

00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,320
approachable so everybody can be playing

00:31:44,389 --> 00:31:49,519
with the stuff we had to get this

00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:51,350
abstraction stuff right and we have to

00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,269
encourage each other I mean some people

00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:55,820
all have little ideas about how this

00:31:53,269 --> 00:31:58,340
should be and it's all getting invented

00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:59,809
right now so weird I mean if anyone

00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:01,850
thinks the internet is perfect raise

00:31:59,809 --> 00:32:03,649
your hand right because it's got

00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:06,169
problems all over the place but it's

00:32:03,649 --> 00:32:08,629
still awesome but everything is still

00:32:06,169 --> 00:32:09,980
getting invented right as we speak even

00:32:08,629 --> 00:32:12,019
though the Internet of Things has been

00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:13,690
here as long as the internet when you

00:32:12,019 --> 00:32:16,730
could talk to coke machines and find out

00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:17,960
how many cokes were in the machine and

00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:20,109
what their temperatures were at Carnegie

00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:23,029
Mellon in the early days of the internet

00:32:20,109 --> 00:32:24,619
but we still are like sledging like I

00:32:23,029 --> 00:32:26,539
talked to most of my software friends

00:32:24,619 --> 00:32:28,999
here and they're like I can't do

00:32:26,539 --> 00:32:31,129
hardware and I argue you absolutely can

00:32:28,999 --> 00:32:34,309
do hardware and we have a hardware

00:32:31,129 --> 00:32:38,840
hackathon set up we have a whole room

00:32:34,309 --> 00:32:42,019
full of Arduino 'he's micros boards you

00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:43,970
can borrow I am completely fine with you

00:32:42,019 --> 00:32:46,429
taking this borrowing it for the night I

00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:49,519
don't care I'm really excited about

00:32:46,429 --> 00:32:51,559
getting our software community excited

00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,330
about hardware and not just bringing our

00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:55,159
Perl code but bringing our pearl values

00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:56,869
into that community and when things are

00:32:55,159 --> 00:32:59,359
broken and confusing and hard to deal

00:32:56,869 --> 00:33:01,039
with well maybe they don't have to be

00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:03,049
and maybe you're not going to write a

00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:05,269
Perl solution to solve the problem maybe

00:33:03,049 --> 00:33:07,190
it will be something and see or who

00:33:05,269 --> 00:33:08,539
knows what but you'll still bring that

00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:12,169
value in that culture into that

00:33:08,539 --> 00:33:14,149
community and trust me trust me we're

00:33:12,169 --> 00:33:16,309
going to do some amazing things because

00:33:14,149 --> 00:33:18,440
when we start connecting everything to

00:33:16,309 --> 00:33:20,929
everything and we're able to reach out

00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:22,549
to see pan and pull something down or

00:33:20,929 --> 00:33:24,379
even something from another community

00:33:22,549 --> 00:33:28,759
and just slam them together and make

00:33:24,379 --> 00:33:30,799
those dreams from everybody come to

00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:33,259
reality people that really know very

00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:36,490
little about coding we're going to make

00:33:33,259 --> 00:33:39,080
it accessible to them like pearl did for

00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:40,290
like the early days of the web making it

00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,670
accessible it's

00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:44,940
to be awesome I don't know what our

00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:47,160
little CGI p.m. will be that will be for

00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:50,570
hardware that but let's find out

00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,570
together come join us

00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:41,110
I normally speak to about 20 people at a

00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:44,260
time so I'm a little nervous you've seen

00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:47,020
this for a while I'm JD the foo I'm from

00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:49,899
Atlanta so I see Bruce out there I don't

00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:52,720
have a lot of time virtualization is all

00:34:49,899 --> 00:34:54,940
about getting your CPU your RAM your

00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:58,240
disk i/o your net white Network I oh and

00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:59,740
your graphics as fast as possible so

00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,590
we'll just go through each of those in

00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:06,850
order but you have to remember on a vm

00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:10,150
you are sharing so you want to be a good

00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:13,750
a good neighbor to the other VMS running

00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:17,080
they're mostly things you can change

00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:19,690
easy it later so usually when you're I'm

00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:23,920
Alan eccentric kind of guy sorry that's

00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:25,690
what I do I run on Linux my host OS is

00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,600
Linux and all my VMS or linux unless i

00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:30,040
am forced to do something else under

00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:33,730
linux unless you're doing large-scale

00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:36,130
servers one vcpu is what you want this

00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:38,770
works great for things like kvm and for

00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:42,010
virtual box I don't usually deal with

00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:43,930
the commercial vm providers anymore you

00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:46,480
can always change that up if you need to

00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:49,050
for RAM you want to use the minimal

00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,430
amount that's required for your system

00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:54,790
the goal for best performance is to

00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:56,170
avoid swapping so I know zimbra doesn't

00:35:54,790 --> 00:36:00,010
like to run on less than a gig and a

00:35:56,170 --> 00:36:01,270
half sometimes you need 1.8 and if you

00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:02,760
have thousands and thousands you use

00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:05,020
your she will need a lot more than that

00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:07,660
boy this is going a lot quicker than I

00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:11,410
thought I normally talk for this in

00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:16,210
about two hours so we go a lot deeper

00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:19,540
into this always leave ram for the host

00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:23,500
OS on windows you need to leave a gig on

00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:26,580
unix a gig is good but 512 is usually

00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:30,520
enough so that it can manage all the VMS

00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:34,840
disk i/o is a really complex topic for

00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:36,970
small servers and home servers you want

00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:41,290
to pre-allocate or put them on SSDs if

00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:43,660
they're on SSDs then you don't care you

00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:45,820
know it's pre-allocate anything a lot a

00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:48,630
lot of virtual hosting providers will

00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:48,630
put you on NFS

00:36:55,690 --> 00:37:02,300
I've had this Chromebook for about three

00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:07,250
months it's not running Chrome OS the

00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:08,660
first time it booted it was wiped so if

00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:10,340
you need really fast performance put

00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:13,100
them on SSDs I don't care if you sparse

00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:15,470
files or not otherwise use fully

00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:18,160
pre-allocated files or use a direct

00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:21,890
direct pass through on your via on your

00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:28,010
on your partitions either with the

00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:31,610
hardware or with lvm network is real

00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:33,410
simple I didn't say this earlier your

00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:35,210
client VMS don't know anything about

00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:38,000
what's going on on the host machine

00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:40,130
unless you let them know so they see

00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,890
virtual hardware they're not seeing the

00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:44,570
real hardware so inside your client it

00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:49,270
doesn't matter if you have Wi-Fi is the

00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:51,890
real as the real network connection

00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:54,500
inside your client give them a either

00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:57,170
verte IO like and you want to use word i

00:37:54,500 --> 00:38:03,200
0 for the drivers whenever possible or

00:37:57,170 --> 00:38:05,810
given an intel pro 1000 as the Nick you

00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:09,340
don't want to be slowed down within

00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:11,990
within the client architecture in those

00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:14,140
virtualization technologies that use

00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:18,700
guest additions always install those

00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:18,700
they give it a tighter integration and

00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:29,600
but but on linux word io is easy for

00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:31,220
disk and for the networking who i left

00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:33,340
off some stuff because I was worried I

00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:35,720
was going to be long so in summary you

00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:37,730
want to pre allocate the virtual hard

00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:39,950
drive whenever possible so if you need

00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:43,340
20 gigs give it 20 gigs unless your own

00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:48,410
SSDs for linux use verdi 0 for your

00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:53,060
drivers on it on Windows use some intel

00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:55,040
pro 1000 and SATA drivers you can add

00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:56,390
the verdi Oh drivers but I haven't found

00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:59,869
that the performance difference really

00:38:56,390 --> 00:39:02,260
matters that much but going from ide to

00:38:59,869 --> 00:39:04,820
SATA which I guess people still run XP

00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:06,020
it is about a forty percent performance

00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:08,090
improvement it's really that much

00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:10,400
different

00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:11,930
start off with one vcpu you don't need

00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:19,490
more than that use the recommended

00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:21,170
amount of client-side RAM and make sure

00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:25,370
you leave enough RAM for the host OS to

00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:27,760
manage all your virtual machines hit the

00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:27,760
gong please

00:39:51,269 --> 00:39:56,789
the februari 78 that will be forced them

00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:59,219
first M is the biggest open swatch event

00:39:56,789 --> 00:40:01,979
in the world six to seven thousand

00:39:59,219 --> 00:40:04,439
people 25 concurrent x one of them is

00:40:01,979 --> 00:40:09,299
pearl I organize that we have something

00:40:04,439 --> 00:40:11,759
like 15 to 25 speakers on a day and it's

00:40:09,299 --> 00:40:14,390
awesome all earthly it's cutting

00:40:11,759 --> 00:40:17,009
awesomer this year it was extra awesome

00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:21,380
if you're in Europe next year februari

00:40:17,009 --> 00:40:21,380
come to force them enjoy thank you

00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:41,260
now rushing this

00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:46,730
they'll just

00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:49,880
no it's fine they're actually need to be

00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:55,220
here whoops mock them later hi I'm son

00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:58,880
go um I'm just a jackass not an

00:40:55,220 --> 00:41:02,720
alcoholic so how many of you know we

00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:06,650
have an IRC dot pearlberg excellent how

00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:09,400
many you actually use it alright cool so

00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:11,960
if you have not been paying attention

00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,010
we've undergone some changes we want to

00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,569
make sure everyone's aware of it and

00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:16,520
want to make sure that you're aware that

00:41:14,569 --> 00:41:18,050
we're having a boss about it very

00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:22,310
recently we came up with the standards

00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:24,619
of conduct for the IRC network and it is

00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:26,480
in place for the network now it has nice

00:41:24,619 --> 00:41:30,619
anti-harassment policies the whole nine

00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:34,130
yards that you sort of hopefully allay

00:41:30,619 --> 00:41:37,609
some fears in theory the SOC is drafted

00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:40,099
to be just what we're doing already with

00:41:37,609 --> 00:41:42,980
some nice guidelines for how you deal

00:41:40,099 --> 00:41:44,390
with people that aren't but in theory

00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:45,950
for the most part it's what we're

00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:49,160
already doing we're not intending to

00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:52,010
change the network at all we are also in

00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:54,530
the process of creating a governance

00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:57,440
policy to deal with what happens when

00:41:54,530 --> 00:42:00,770
those people violated what happens when

00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:04,460
we need to enforce it and that's why

00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:05,990
these poor suckers are up here these are

00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:08,900
the first of what we're calling the

00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:10,910
community offers they're specifically

00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:13,720
tasked with not running the network we

00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:17,000
already have that staff with essentially

00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:18,349
guiding the community and I'll let them

00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,990
introduce themselves here in a second

00:42:18,349 --> 00:42:24,349
but the notion is this is still a work

00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:27,440
in progress it is not done and it will

00:42:24,349 --> 00:42:28,880
never really be done but we want to make

00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:33,020
sure everyone knows that we're having a

00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:34,550
pop tomorrow we're still at 10 to talk

00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:35,480
about this we're working through some of

00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:38,960
the policies and want to make sure

00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:40,910
everyone is willing well everyone knows

00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:44,089
that you can come and have feedback and

00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:47,030
help us build this community for you

00:42:44,089 --> 00:42:49,509
this is your IRC network it will be what

00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:52,989
you want it to be

00:42:49,509 --> 00:42:54,809
and if you're not it I'm going to be

00:42:52,989 --> 00:42:57,639
kind of a jackass here for a second

00:42:54,809 --> 00:43:03,519
we've gotten out of the thousands of

00:42:57,639 --> 00:43:05,469
well thousand find end of the thousand

00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:09,219
or so users that are on the network I've

00:43:05,469 --> 00:43:12,429
gotten feedback from five of you despite

00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:15,849
the fact that we've been in am short

00:43:12,429 --> 00:43:17,049
alone despite the fact that this has

00:43:15,849 --> 00:43:25,389
been going on for two months so I'd like

00:43:17,049 --> 00:43:29,409
to get more feedback from the from the

00:43:25,389 --> 00:43:31,689
thousand 46 of you and 434 channels when

00:43:29,409 --> 00:43:33,819
i looked last night I'd like you to give

00:43:31,689 --> 00:43:38,169
us more feedback because this is for you

00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:39,759
this is about you so please come to the

00:43:38,169 --> 00:43:42,219
buff tomorrow and I will let these fine

00:43:39,759 --> 00:43:45,159
people who are helping us come up here

00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:46,569
and introduce themselves these are folks

00:43:45,159 --> 00:43:49,179
that you can come to when you have

00:43:46,569 --> 00:43:59,999
problems or questions and they will do

00:43:49,179 --> 00:44:03,269
their best to help you hi I'm guru and I

00:43:59,999 --> 00:44:05,859
stand by by some I mean what he said

00:44:03,269 --> 00:44:08,919
he's an awesome guy and we're really

00:44:05,859 --> 00:44:11,829
trying to make this for you guys in

00:44:08,919 --> 00:44:15,669
order to make a is see dr. the dog a

00:44:11,829 --> 00:44:19,689
better place and for you specifically so

00:44:15,669 --> 00:44:23,259
they go hi I'm Karen a third should i go

00:44:19,689 --> 00:44:25,719
by ether yeah i've been using i've been

00:44:23,259 --> 00:44:27,999
using perl for about 15 years and it

00:44:25,719 --> 00:44:30,009
wasn't until I joined IRC that I really

00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:22,080

working oh ok has this okay so i'm david

00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:29,369
foul from pearl tricks calm and i'm here

00:47:24,839 --> 00:47:33,300
to talk about why paul writing is like a

00:47:29,369 --> 00:47:35,220
dungeon hack let me explain so when you

00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:36,960
set out to be a pearl writer you need to

00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:40,260
think about what type of writer you want

00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:44,540
to be so do you want to be a master

00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:44,540
trainer like brian foy you know writing

00:47:45,859 --> 00:47:54,240
yeah i didn't know how to change it okay

00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:56,359
so if you're going to be a master

00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:59,400
trainer like brian foy writing technical

00:47:56,359 --> 00:48:01,500
articles and programming books or maybe

00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:04,020
you'd rather be an essayist like buddy

00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:05,730
burden whose articles don't contain much

00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:08,400
code but they're full of beautiful prose

00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:11,070
or maybe you prefer a hybrid approach

00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:12,359
like a coder bloggers like chromatic but

00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:17,099
you really want to think about what type

00:48:12,359 --> 00:48:19,950
of writer you want to be nothing

00:48:17,099 --> 00:48:22,800
attracts hordes of readers like a catchy

00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:25,950
title for your articles so I've prepared

00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:28,560
some Scrolls for you to derive catchy

00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:31,380
formulas for your titles a catchy titles

00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:35,190
for your articles so for instance the

00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:37,320
keyword guide to X so in this case the

00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:39,930
keyword needs to be a hook word like

00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:42,750
best or worst something that piques the

00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:47,190
readers interest so the ultimate guide

00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:51,780
to maggianos that works well any ways to

00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:53,820
die m ways to X so that's five ways to

00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:56,849
die in Perl that's the listicle approach

00:48:53,820 --> 00:49:01,020
so one thing to keep in mind if you use

00:48:56,849 --> 00:49:03,240
a listicle title is that Tim toady if

00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:05,010
you write five ways to die in Perl a

00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:07,080
guarantee someone will email you and say

00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:08,910
there's a sick way to die on pearl and

00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:12,990
you didn't write about it but that goes

00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:16,200
with the territory X you should know so

00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:18,030
this is the social proofing title right

00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,510
everybody knows this thing you should

00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:21,090
know it

00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:23,640
you so pearl tokens you should know

00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:25,560
that's a great title too and the key

00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:28,470
thing with the title is make sure that

00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:30,960
you deliver on the promise of the title

00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:32,610
in the body of your article so if you

00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,200
write five ways to die and pearl make

00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:40,020
sure your article has five ways to die

00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:42,830
in pearl that works great so everybody

00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:47,430
knows the dice God's favor the brave and

00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:49,800
writing is kind of like that so writing

00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:51,720
that expresses an opinion is intuitively

00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:55,020
more interesting than writing this sits

00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:58,530
on the fence so CGI has some drawbacks

00:49:55,020 --> 00:50:00,860
is a very reasonable statement but CJ I

00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:03,450
must die is a lot more interesting in

00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:10,590
fact CGI has died because it's been

00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:12,180
removed from core as of 520 so if you're

00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:13,860
writing and you're frequently

00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:16,020
encountering if you encounter someone

00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:18,240
who's frequently posting negative

00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:21,540
comments you may be dealing with troll

00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:25,530
and I found the best way to deal with

00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:27,090
trolls is not to engage them at all have

00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:28,770
a thick skin like don't take what they

00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:31,080
say to heart they often pick up on your

00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:32,610
weak points and make sure that you

00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:34,830
distinguish between people who provide

00:50:32,610 --> 00:50:37,200
critical feedback and people who are

00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:38,310
trawling because critical feedback can

00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,170
be really helpful it can make your

00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:46,590
writing better and make it appeal to a

00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:48,200
wider audience oh yeah so um test your

00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:50,280
code before you publish your article

00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:52,620
there's nothing more embarrassing than

00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:55,110
having a spell found in public for

00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:57,150
example this subroutine looks great on

00:50:55,110 --> 00:51:00,930
paper but if you were to run it it

00:50:57,150 --> 00:51:03,060
doesn't work and so we've got an error

00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:05,910
in our class but because we've run the

00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:11,430
code we can fix the error another code

00:51:05,910 --> 00:51:14,010
runs great so if you're thinking about

00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:15,810
being a pile writer or writing about

00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:18,900
pearl I'd really encourage you to do so

00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:20,610
there's a lot of benefits you can level

00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:22,590
up your pearl skill as you learn more

00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:25,650
about more features of the language that

00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:28,500
you wouldn't otherwise be exposed to you

00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:30,240
can earn gold when writers pay you when

00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:31,440
companies pay for your articles or

00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:33,870
through earning

00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:36,740
revenue on your own website and your

00:51:33,870 --> 00:51:39,030
reputation will saw as the communities

00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:41,550
come to appreciate your great writing

00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:44,190
and your contribution and maybe one day

00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:47,870
you can achieve the rank of heroic

00:51:44,190 --> 00:51:47,870
linguist thank you

00:52:28,539 --> 00:52:31,169
so

00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:39,780
so you want to you want to have a nice

00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:41,370
job you know this nice company and yeah

00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:43,950
date you know that they have awesome

00:52:41,370 --> 00:52:45,990
jobs you want to work there there are

00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:48,360
several ways to do that of course and

00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:52,730
one way is to prepare like I'm not going

00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:52,730
to tell you so very nice completed still

00:52:53,600 --> 00:53:01,440
it helps okay you know that they want

00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:03,900
people that are able to do specific

00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,820
things I don't care out of this but you

00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:09,300
know what they are so you have to work

00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:12,060
on that first thing you have to do is

00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:14,640
find yourself make sure that you can be

00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:16,410
found check what company X will see when

00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:19,050
they are going to search for you tight

00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:21,440
for yourself type in your name Google

00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:23,760
Doc the go and other search engines of

00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:27,690
course dr. Joseph very nice one they use

00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:30,600
pearl if you're not there if you cannot

00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:33,720
be found what do you what do you expect

00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:37,560
that any country might be interested in

00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:40,220
you or if what you find is where boring

00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:43,980
or bad why would he be interested in you

00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:46,050
so make sure that you prepare yourself

00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:48,540
to make yourself interesting and

00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:50,940
findable use a couple of months maybe

00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:53,040
even a whole year because if you re

00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:54,930
jected at a company it might take at

00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:56,550
least a year if they want to speak you

00:53:54,930 --> 00:54:01,410
to you again if they want to speak to

00:53:56,550 --> 00:54:02,730
you ever again anyway and of course be

00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:05,370
sure that you know your pearl or

00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:06,780
whatever subject you are going to do

00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:09,690

other people will find you out and write

00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:05,130
about it and there will be bad stuff

00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:07,790

present at pearl manga groups it's a

00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:21,630
very nice way to practice for speaking

00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:25,710
in public I can't do it now still

00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:28,980
nervous but I'm doing it also give

00:55:25,710 --> 00:55:32,369
presentations there again very nice to

00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:34,200
get practice and after that at some
