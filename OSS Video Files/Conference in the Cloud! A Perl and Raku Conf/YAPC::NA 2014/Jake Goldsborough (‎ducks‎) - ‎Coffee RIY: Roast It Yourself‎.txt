Description: 
	Coffee, Java, Black gold. Whatever you may call it, coffee is a lifeblood for many of us. But yet, many of you settle for low quality, poor tasting, (and probably stale) coffee. Why? This talk will be a beginner's guide to home roasting. It's an easy, fun, and affordable way to get some of the freshest coffee possible. We will go from an everyday popcorn popper to a fully functioning machine able to roast fresh coffee in under ten minutes.

Freddie good so this is a talk on

00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:33,820
roasting your own coffee it's not coffee

00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:36,410
script which some people thought it was

00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:39,200
so if you were expecting copy script you

00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:40,910
should probably leave I had originally

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:46,309
intended to actually wrote some coffee

00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:47,660
so that didn't work out so hopefully the

00:00:46,309 --> 00:00:50,510
information will be enough for you and

00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:52,879
it'll make you want to try so this is

00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,870
actually coffee in case people didn't

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,019
know what it actually looks like from

00:00:53,870 --> 00:01:01,000
the plant it takes about three to four

00:00:57,019 --> 00:01:03,460
years to grow useful crops for 25 years

00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,810
either pick it all at once pick it

00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:09,020
selectively and then it goes to

00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:13,100
processing to get to the bean you know

00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:15,740
the raw coffee bean a little bit on

00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:18,070
coffee consumption we drink a lot of it

00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:20,270
in the world 1 to 2 billion cups per day

00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:22,760
based on all the stats I could find

00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:24,470
which were production and then someone

00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,510
did the math to figure out how much each

00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:28,580
person drinks and it's the second most

00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:32,630
traded commodity in the world guess the

00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:35,900
first crude oil yes a little coffee

00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:37,310
history it's named after a region in

00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:40,850
Ethiopia where it's discovered called

00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:43,700
cava and the old story is there was a

00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:46,460
goat herder name called E and he noticed

00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:48,530
his goats eating this bright red plant

00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:51,650
and they started to be ecstatic jumping

00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:54,980
around this loving life so he took the

00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:57,770
beam back to a monk and they started

00:01:54,980 --> 00:02:03,320
eating it and drinking it and found it

00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:05,780
was awesome as it is didn't too popular

00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:09,200
until around eleven hundred and it

00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:12,590
spread the yummy and it was roasted and

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:15,379
boiled buyers creating I don't know the

00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:17,330
pronunciation but it was uh I don't know

00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:21,650
how to pronounce Arabic much but a kawa

00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:25,410
has QA hwa which was a word they used to

00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:27,819
name wine for a long time so

00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:34,390
in the first coffee shop opened in

00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:36,850
Constantinople around 1475 and so there

00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:40,630
was this guy care Bay he was the

00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:42,220
governor of Mecca and he thought he'd

00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,780
band some coffee because he feared the

00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:50,920
people would rise up against his power

00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:54,640
and they executed him after a week-long

00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:56,080
terror reign they said you gotta go we

00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:02,050
like this stuff we're going to drink it

00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:04,269
so dont ban coffee so there's a lot more

00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:06,820
history to it this is definitely more

00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:09,580
about roasting so go read about it how

00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:12,010
it went through trading through people

00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:14,260
discovery discovering other areas of the

00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:17,890
world how it spread out there's a lot of

00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:19,120
lot of history and actually you kind of

00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:22,450
don't think about it but there's a huge

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:25,780
American historical event that kind of

00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:30,459
shaped our coffee path and that was a

00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:32,019
huh boston tea party because obviously

00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:38,530
we were probably drinking more to you

00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:41,590
than coffee so i would imagine so Coffee

00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:44,440
Roasters you can either DIY or buy one

00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:46,269
and the DIY is much cheaper and this was

00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:49,209
the one I was going to show you a make

00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:51,640
and use it's actually just a popcorn

00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:53,410
popper there's not a lot special to

00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,590
roasting coffee you just need some hot

00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:59,320
air and some movement so it doesn't burn

00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:00,820
so you need to get the ones that look

00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,560
like this with a solid bottom and you

00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,940
have Vince in them too if it'll

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,030
circulate the air and keep your coffee

00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:09,400
moving they make some with just a heater

00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:11,079
in the bottom and those are very

00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,660
flammable because you don't get enough

00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:15,400
air flow and it's there's a lot of sugar

00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,840
and by the time you start to roast you

00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,479
cook out the water and the moisture so

00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:22,180
it gets very dry and there is like chafe

00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:24,460
and a hole on the green coffee usually

00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:27,430
so you definitely see some sparks

00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:29,740
sometimes when it gets too hot but you

00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:32,410
can also do stovetop like this fine

00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:34,539
person bad just kidding this is actual

00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:36,870
stovetop roaster but I like the guy's

00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:39,430
ingenuity or persons

00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:43,120
then you can do the old skillet and walk

00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:45,460
you just some heat and some movement I

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,520
actually roasted some on the grill the

00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:54,789
other night charcoal grill just for fun

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:55,930
it was tasted great so to start roasting

00:04:54,789 --> 00:04:58,840
the obvious you have to pick some beans

00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:01,330
and most people recommend a nice Central

00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:04,930
American or South American being just

00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:06,669
the way the process the variety the way

00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,139
they're they're grown in process they

00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:12,099
hold heat well you're not going to

00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:14,620
easily burn them and you can roast them

00:05:12,099 --> 00:05:20,860
from light to dark and get a nice

00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:23,379
product so let's start roasting so this

00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:26,020
is a what your green coffee bean is

00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:27,460
going to look like this is a raw and I

00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,840
have some if anyone wants to look at

00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:32,770
them because i was going to roast but

00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:35,400
that go through and then you you start

00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:38,979
to cook and you get to about 270 and

00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:41,590
based on your roasting apparatus this

00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:42,789
happened to quicker or slower the drum

00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:44,440
Roasters which i forgot to show a

00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:46,930
picture of i should mention you can buy

00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,550
at home drum Roosters that just spin and

00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,169
keep it spinning for you and that's

00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:54,279
generally what the big ones you see the

00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:56,379
coffee shop are and in the air popper it

00:05:54,279 --> 00:06:01,509
happens much quicker because the air is

00:05:56,379 --> 00:06:02,979
more direct the heat is quicker then you

00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:08,710
start to get into the yellowing stage

00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:11,319
around 320 degrees and you just you know

00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:12,969
the sugar starts to carbonize and get

00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:14,110
dark and you get your tanning and you

00:06:12,969 --> 00:06:18,190
can start to notice some indentations

00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:20,830
where it's starting to dry out and lose

00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:22,419
all the water and the moisture when you

00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:24,940
get to the light brown stage you see

00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:28,289
more indentation it's not quite even yet

00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:31,810
though so you're got to keep going and

00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:35,069
this is you get to the brown around 300

00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:38,139
93 degrees you can see it's still

00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:40,229
cooking the start to lose chafe at this

00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:44,080
point it'll start to fly out everywhere

00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:47,120
and then so when you're roasting one of

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:50,030
the ways to tell how far along you are

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,800
are certain cracks and this is the inner

00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,690
walls breaking down with the moisture

00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,240
coming out in the heat so you get these

00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:58,040
loud pops and this is how you know the

00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:02,210
first crack is very loud and it kind of

00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:05,479
sounds like popcorn and this happens

00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:10,780
around 400 degrees and this goes on for

00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:13,940
in my machine it'll go on for 30 seconds

00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:16,280
but the drum Roasters are a little

00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:17,810
slower obviously because the heat and so

00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:21,139
now you're into the first roast you can

00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:26,090
start to see more coloration some of

00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:34,760
more even cook this is your first

00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:36,949
Krakens is that me yeah you this is

00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:39,500
completely drinkable you can cut it here

00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:41,120
this is going to be really flavorful

00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,940
really fruitful you're going to get all

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,050
the like the notes out of the coffee

00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:47,330
generally when people start to roast

00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:49,520
their own and they've drank dark coffee

00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:50,690
of their life all their life you'll find

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,669
you'll start to like the lighter roast

00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:54,139
because the more you cook it the more

00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:57,430
flavors you cook out and it just starts

00:07:54,139 --> 00:08:00,860
to get the actual roast and smoky flavor

00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:04,729
so these these are your light rose city

00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:07,190
roasts whatever you want to call it now

00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:10,880
what's called city plus just a little

00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:12,800
darker 435 degrees the temperature

00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:15,440
doesn't really matter that much it kind

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,669
of happens on its own but it's I've been

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,599
doing it for a few years and I don't

00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:22,430
even know I had to look them up exactly

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,260
again just more colorization you're

00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:27,169
seeing the the chafe in the middle

00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:30,770
starts to lose go away starting to get

00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:34,300
nice and even this is a full city roast

00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:36,770
you're almost into the second crack so

00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:41,050
this is usually four or five minutes for

00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:44,209
me eight or nine for a big drum roaster

00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:45,800
this is a full city plus and just darker

00:08:44,209 --> 00:08:47,680
you're going to start hearing the first

00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:51,140
snaps of the second crack which are more

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:53,089
like a fire there like a smaller

00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:56,070
shallower they're not as loud and

00:08:53,089 --> 00:09:00,360
constant it's like Rice Krispies kind of

00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:04,350
and this is 150 air sorry need to go

00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:07,260
down and this is the next stage Vienna

00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:10,200
or light french roast second cracks

00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:13,290
happening again you can see see the beam

00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:18,410
definitely getting dried out more even

00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:20,880
color this is the full French this is

00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:24,960
getting dark all you can see oils now

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,940
which is the sugar coming out and these

00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,680
are nice flavors you get you start

00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:31,860
getting into the darkers like obviously

00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:34,950
it's pretty dark so it's going to taste

00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:38,520
dark this is fully carbonized

00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:40,320
everything's pretty much gone at this

00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:43,470
point you probably don't want to go that

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,150
far unless you like it that way but I've

00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:48,120
never gone that far in two years of

00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:53,160
roasting because why I kind of I don't

00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:55,980
know and this is this is dead this is

00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,510
basically charcoal this you can actually

00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,860
start fires with this from what I've

00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:01,440
read and I've never tried it because

00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,880
I've never gone this far so you can

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,480
actually it's dry enough that it should

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:09,290
supposedly spark up yeah but again I've

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,290
never tried it because

00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:19,090
Hotel insurance I was going to try i

00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:22,210
bought a roaster so target I'd bought

00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:24,190
all my machines at target because I saw

00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:26,440
was like 15 bucks for like two years and

00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:28,900
then they decided to quit selling that

00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:31,870
model I was going to consider using the

00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:36,480
one I did buy but I'd rather not burn

00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:39,310
the hotel down yeah just popcorn poppers

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:42,970
like the one picture you kind of need

00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:47,530
the you need this style with the forced

00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:49,890
air so you just have enough because it

00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:52,660
dries out so quickly you can go from

00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:54,340
first cracked a second crack to burn in

00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,810
a matter I mean you can go from dark

00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,460
rose to burn and just so I mean it

00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:59,530
doesn't take long at that point because

00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:08,910
you've you've cooked all the moisture

00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:11,200
out that's all I had speaking lies i

00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:13,570
highly encourage it i really wanted to

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,890
show and get that smell so you could

00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:16,540
remember the smell it smells so fresh

00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:19,810
it's the freshest coffee you're going to

00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:22,630
buy if you go to higher in the fancier

00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:25,930
coffee shops I live in Brooklyn so you

00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:29,470
can find not even a whole pound for ten

00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:32,770
twelve dollars and that's as much as we

00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:35,290
I drink developers probably I mean look

00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:38,470
at how much we drink this so far that

00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:44,410
kind of gets expensive so even the

00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:46,690
nicest beans sweet maria's is a they

00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:48,010
have so much information on roasting you

00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:49,810
can buy your green beans they that's why

00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:53,530
I buy my raw green beans they come green

00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:56,290
beans because they're green and they

00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:58,330
just got a Yuman in stock and that's

00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:59,470
only seven dollars a pound which you

00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:01,630
would probably pay at least double that

00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:03,750
in a coffee shop and you get a

00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:06,520
customized and cook it how you want and

00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:10,030
those little Roasters do about 85 grams

00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:11,440
so you get and that usually makes two to

00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:15,190
three pots of coffee depending on how

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:19,210
how heavy I am with the Grimes so it

00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:21,370
really i mean i bought a 10-pound batch

00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:24,000
of ethiopian beans and i still not i

00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:28,890
still have a big sack left so

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:34,140
and usually some of the coffee's you get

00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:35,310
at the store the pre-ground use a second

00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,800
I should explain their two types of

00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:40,050
beans robusta and Arabica and the

00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,540
robusta are the cheaper cheaper to make

00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:44,880
easier to grow their pest resistant or

00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,500
not as temperamental but they're lower

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:50,010
than caffeine and they're not they don't

00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:54,390
taste as good so most people use Arabica

00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:55,530
some use a combination so the arabic is

00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:57,960
going to have some more caffeine you

00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:59,580
might drink less even I I mean I worked

00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,650
in a coffee shop so I would pound coffee

00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:03,210
all day and there are days I drink two

00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:05,910
pots of coffee that's it just because

00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:10,920
it's nice being nice quality a lot of

00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:12,120
caffeine um so yeah if you go I don't

00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,870
think I'm on the internet or I would

00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:17,910
show they have that's where I've learned

00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:22,050
a lot of my information came from them

00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:24,150
so i highly recommend them they have

00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:26,460
videos that you can go watch actually

00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:29,970
people making them people roasting

00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:33,960
people it's there's forums for people

00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:37,830
you can ask questions and it's really

00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:40,950
fun smells great we plan on doing a

00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:44,390
coffee and donuts out with Auggie and

00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:44,390
floor in at some point

00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:56,860
any questions i nee yeah shoot they'll

00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:59,890
stay fresh two to three years i I've

00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:01,540
never had any that long so but in say if

00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:04,380
you freeze it only lasts longer four to

00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:06,640
five maybe green because it's pretty

00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:10,120
it's like raw so there's nothing to

00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:12,940
really but these when you roast them you

00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,080
usually want to I don't like using them

00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:18,670
after a week as you can tell they're

00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:19,840
stale and am getting they start to get

00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:22,660
softer and they can just smell it

00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:25,540
there's a stale smell to it and two days

00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:27,010
is the premium two days is like because

00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,870
after you cook it they're still carbon

00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:31,270
coming off the second crack the carbon

00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:33,760
that starts to extract carbon and so

00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:35,530
it's probably not exactly like a steak

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,720
but it rests long it'll rest so it keeps

00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:41,920
cooking and then over the day is it kind

00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:43,540
of settles itself and it starts it's fun

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,790
to drink some right after you roast it

00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:54,030
one day after a few hours after just to

00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:54,030
see what comes out win and yeah

00:14:55,580 --> 00:15:04,980
so I delivers no I think different

00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:06,360
flavors perhaps you can do blends I

00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,830
don't know about flavored coffee someone

00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,090
asked me about flavored coffees recently

00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:10,950
I don't know how you add the oils and

00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:12,840
the flavorings I've never been a fan of

00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:16,170
flavored coffee but yeah you can go

00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:18,890
online people their common combinations

00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:21,570
of coffees that makes reckless blends

00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:24,330
you probably heard a mocha Java is a

00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:30,150
common coffee you see that's actually a

00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:31,590
blend of a Yemen and a mocha and you can

00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:33,750
just find the line you can try yourself

00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:35,160
but they're definitely some you don't

00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:38,160
want to do because they're just not

00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:41,010
their clash I don't have any concrete

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,080
examples i usually don't blend but

00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:46,440
espresso balloons are usually blends and

00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:49,080
but yet people have recipes online of

00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:51,360
like two parts this two parts this and

00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:53,910
then there are also ways you forget the

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,310
exact names but you can roast both at

00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:58,650
the same time put two beans in one roast

00:15:56,310 --> 00:16:01,200
it or do one and then one do like a dark

00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:02,910
and light put them together to get the

00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:06,690
fruitiness over here and the darkness

00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:07,589
over here kind of combine them and again

00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:09,720
that's not something you're going to get

00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:11,730
a coffee shop unless they make those but

00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,770
you can really customize if you don't

00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:16,950
like this being dark you might like it

00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:19,260
lighter the floral the floral notes and

00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:21,120
the fruity notes I've had coffee that

00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:23,790
tastes like blueberry like you can smell

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,640
the blueberry on it just it's it's

00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:28,950
awesome yeah what's rub the process is

00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,740
that you added flavors and then into the

00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:32,990
air popper or was it something you

00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:35,029
don't know the cup I don't add in the

00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:39,440
coffee has all the flavors just based on

00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:41,450
how you grow it will ya just blend well

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,890
like you can either roast one and then

00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:44,240
the second one and then blend them or

00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:46,760
you can blend them and then roast them

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,940
is one you just don't yeah you just pop

00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:51,770
it right into that yeah you just throw

00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,089
it right in there it goes you don't you

00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:56,420
take the plastic thing off because it

00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:59,779
would melt and you just throw it right

00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:01,250
in this one runs about 85 grams if you

00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:02,899
do it to light it doesn't it spins too

00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:05,809
much if you do too heavy to spend enough

00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:08,660
and I don't know about other ones but

00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:11,540
yeah throw it right in turn it on 67

00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:13,339
minutes usually by a big strainer or

00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:15,500
colander because you want to cool it

00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:16,970
down quickly most of the big Roasters

00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,980
you it's pretty cool if you've ever seen

00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:20,750
a roaster they'll open the big drum

00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:23,300
it'll come out to smoking and then the

00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:24,500
big thing turns them it's if there's

00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,059
local coffee shops and they have a

00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,309
roaster it's fun to go just watch them

00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:30,160
get it just smokes the room up and it

00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:32,270
smells great kind of smells like a

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:36,559
coffee popcorn it doesn't smell like

00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:38,770
fresh coffee but it smells good you just

00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,770
go

00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:46,860
yeah that's the base in the cracks and

00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:48,450
the color I mean these are the cult

00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:51,330
between the colors and the cracks or

00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:54,030
where you learn to tell like these are

00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:55,950
way too early you just start you can

00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:57,630
start to see them brown up in the in the

00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:00,210
machine so you can tell if you're

00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:02,400
getting too far the cracks are a big one

00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:03,540
the cracks really because you don't want

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,430
to drink it before the first crack

00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:15,060
because it's not cooked and it just

00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:20,820
tastes bitter and not good raw or after

00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:22,890
you cook just there you don't really

00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:26,340
need to keep them anything anything

00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:28,610
special let me have a big sack of them

00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,610
here

00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:37,340
I think yeah that's how I got my big tin

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:40,279
pound usually if I get the smaller bags

00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:42,890
they don't send them in the burlap yeah

00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:45,049
you get them in a burlap sack or coffee

00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:46,370
shops it's the coffee shop I used to

00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:47,360
work out would buy it by the hundreds of

00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:50,240
pounds and they just bring them on

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,549
pallets just exactly sometimes stuff to

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:57,860
people because they're so just bulky and

00:18:52,549 --> 00:19:00,230
heavy does anyone here rose coffee and

00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:05,860
yeah what do you use roaster do you have

00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:05,860
your sleep

00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:14,060
yeah there they are

00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:19,080
what was the one dick tardies thought I

00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:21,960
was that red one that would look like

00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:25,669
that red one well if you want to West

00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:29,969
Bend it's called the air crazy and it's

00:19:25,669 --> 00:19:32,789
I was by them on a target for 15 to 17

00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:37,679
they're like 21 or 22 on amazon but you

00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:39,749
can prime them yep Prime yeah I mean

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:43,739
yeah if you want some you can't do much

00:19:39,749 --> 00:19:45,989
with it actually did learn usually don't

00:19:43,739 --> 00:19:48,509
use raw coffee for much but back in the

00:19:45,989 --> 00:19:50,039
early days they would grind it up and

00:19:48,509 --> 00:19:51,479
mix it with animal fat to make like an

00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:53,820
energy pace that they could just eat

00:19:51,479 --> 00:19:57,469
because of the caffeine and then the

00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:57,469
animal fat would give them some proteins

00:19:59,179 --> 00:20:05,519
you can get them yeah yeah though I've

00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:08,759
never made deep calf and that's a whole

00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:10,649
different that's a whole different beast

00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:13,049
because some people do chemically you

00:20:10,649 --> 00:20:15,330
can chemically decaf it or there's a

00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:17,909
popular way called the Swiss water

00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:20,249
process that decaf said that's not

00:20:17,909 --> 00:20:23,669
chemically doesn't add chemicals so it's

00:20:20,249 --> 00:20:26,070
nicer and there's I mean there there are

00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:27,960
beans that are grown in strictly hi

00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:31,379
beans they call them their high altitude

00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:33,029
beans they'll be different Ethiopia

00:20:31,379 --> 00:20:35,669
grows wild so you may never I mean

00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:38,129
there's so many based on the shade the

00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:39,629
altitude the ground the type of coffee

00:20:38,129 --> 00:20:43,430
how you process it it's all going to

00:20:39,629 --> 00:20:45,620
have a slightly different its

00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:48,020
and you might not get the same coffee

00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:50,510
from year to year if the plant dies out

00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:53,060
there's actually a big they call it

00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:57,530
coffee rust there's a big outbreak in

00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:59,000
the Central America now but haven't kept

00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:01,130
up with it in the last couple weeks but

00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,540
it sounded like it can get pretty bad

00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:05,960
and like wipe out a lot of the coffee

00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:12,290
for a while so hope that doesn't happen

00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:15,070
but the only place that's grown in North

00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:17,150
America is Hawaii another little effect

00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:22,280
because it's the only climate warm

00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:25,910
enough yes sweet maria's highly

00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:29,120
recommend them for twenty bucks twenty

00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:31,790
thirty bucks with beans their

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,560
instructions you actually do have to did

00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:38,800
you modify yours to bypass the

00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:41,960
thermostat or the thermometer huh

00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:45,140
although we are you right there in the

00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:46,670
one I use there's a thermometer in it

00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,810
that I guess keeps it from getting too

00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:49,760
hot because someone probably burned

00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:52,400
themselves on it at some point speed to

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:54,740
splice the wires and bypass that and it

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,600
will run us you probably shouldn't run

00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,770
it on for a while I usually do a batch

00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,590
or two at a time and then let it cool

00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:04,930
because it gets hot I mean it's almost

00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:04,930
500 degrees by the time of your settle

00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:12,430
roasted the coffee was the best men

00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:24,510
I use the Chemex it's just it kind of

00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:28,290
looks like a flat can't remember the

00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:31,080
name is not a real admirer okay yeah

00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:34,890
like an hourglass it's pour over and you

00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:36,600
just you get the filter and usually use

00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:38,070
a thicker filter with the Chemex it

00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:42,120
grabs some of the bitterness some of the

00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:48,420
bad oils out but people use a mr. Sean

00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:50,130
he's a big Aeropress fan and I want to

00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:52,380
get into the siphon the the pressure

00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:54,540
based they have some that you put the

00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:56,310
coffee and in the water it heats up and

00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:58,230
then based on all the pressure shoots

00:22:56,310 --> 00:23:01,470
the coffee into the water and it never

00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:03,450
touches any it's all automatic basically

00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:06,120
so there's no not a lot of user error

00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:07,560
even depending on the temperature of the

00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,510
water you could burn it and it's going

00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:11,790
to taste different if you don't you

00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:14,100
undercook it there under through it it's

00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:16,710
going to taste different I like the

00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:18,060
Chemex it's quick it's clean french

00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:21,240
press is really nice so i'm a french

00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:23,100
press drink you sometimes which is going

00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:26,780
to be a little heavier because it's a

00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,780
mess shoulder instead of a paper filter

00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:38,240
feature

00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:40,330
you any questions anything else all

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,330
right

00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,310
