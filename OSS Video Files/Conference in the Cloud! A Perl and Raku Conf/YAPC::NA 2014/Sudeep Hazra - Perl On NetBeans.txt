Title: Sudeep Hazra - Perl On NetBeans
Publication date: 2014-06-23
Playlist: YAPC::NA 2014
Description: 
	"Perl on NetBeans" is intended for Perl programmers who want the intuitiveness of a great editor with the ease of being able to execute the program without having to do it through a command Interpreter. Also, it has the capability to inspect the austerity of your Perl programs, and format the same in accordance to the best practices and conventions. And it does much more :)
About me: I am full time employee with an Indian IT services company. I am also a Perl enthusiast and created this software due to the feeling of dire need of something for beginners that works straight out-of-the box.

	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,959
which requires me to do some amount of

00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:07,080
both so due to which I'm still a

00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:09,540
beginner and what I saw is that for

00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,240
beginners getting up to speed is

00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:14,549
something that is not very much

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,740
available for the occasional programmers

00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:18,720
I could know who are not into full

00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,539
temple programming who do some amount of

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:25,619
Perl some database all of this kind of

00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:28,970
stuff so I had this idea about having an

00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:32,579
IDE which would be a standalone platform

00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:35,550
multi platform in fact and which would

00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:38,070
be able to address all the initial needs

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:41,219
for any person who would want to start

00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:45,570
up programming in Perl that gave birth

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:49,469
to Berlin that means now I have had

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:53,129
these ideas when basically starting off

00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:55,399
with an ID like why do we need an ID now

00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:58,920
the first person who comes into our

00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:01,620
projects like we have multi technology

00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,930
project wherein they come in and they're

00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,610
like okay I need to do Perl I need to do

00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,280
database I need to do some amount of

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,020
front-end some Java this and that so

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:14,549
these are some of the features which

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:17,490
were outlined initially that would be

00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:20,720
integrated into the platform because

00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:23,759
these are some things which basically

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:27,060
necessitated why we should have an IDE

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,880
now apart from the fact we can do this

00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,950
manually as well like error checking you

00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,530
run it through the syntax checker and

00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,390
everything you still do get all of these

00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,310
features individually but when you

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:41,490
package them in inside into an

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:43,649
application that becomes easier for any

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:48,119
person who has zero background knowledge

00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:50,820
on Perl and of course like once we are I

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:51,990
would say a medium level experience in

00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:56,670
Perl we don't want to do all that

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:58,920
manually now these are some of the

00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,869
options that I explode while I was

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,880
actually working with Perl and I was

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:06,750
looking at having something which would

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:10,229
make my experience easier now Vimy max I

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:12,960
know like sorry the people here are very

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:15,210
much tech savvy

00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,040
everyone is an expert in pearl and I

00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:19,020
know like we would obviously anyone

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,090
who's experienced in well would say that

00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,580
I would anyway go into the women in max

00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:26,250
way but that's not very easy when I

00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,080
first started off with Bo now that

00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:30,210
became a bit difficult and that's why I

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,890
moved out of them and a max I thought

00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:33,810
okay this is something that might not be

00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:38,370
a very good option for the first time

00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:41,640
personal epic is the pull plugin for

00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:46,050
Eclipse which came in it also is a very

00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:49,170
good option provided the kind of

00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:52,170
facilities that it provides but setting

00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:53,880
up epic was a very big pain for me so I

00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:57,090
thought yep if I'm facing this problem

00:02:53,880 --> 00:03:00,570
maybe others will also have that Padre

00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:03,930
yes father is very good no doubt it has

00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:07,710
all the options it's like everything's

00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:09,720
in Pearl in time for Padre but there are

00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:11,520
too many features integrated and the

00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:15,330
first time person who doesn't need too

00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:17,250
many things at a time then we have an

00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:18,720
people and open pool ID and we pull it

00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,220
basically another initiative to

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,490
integrate well into the NetBeans

00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:29,030
platform and open Pearl ID which

00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:32,280
personally I didn't work very much and

00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:35,490
this is yes of course when we work in

00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:39,290
multiplayer multi technologies these are

00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:42,060
some of the things that we do have I

00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:44,220
don't instead of my career when I

00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:47,160
started off I didn't do what I did Pearl

00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:50,190
I did so my things in databases I had

00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:53,220
Java JavaScript all things these things

00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:55,560
are bundled together so maybe only pearl

00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:57,720
was well not something that I was

00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,300
looking into so I thought half pearl

00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,880
plus half so within the same platform

00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:08,220
ICO Java I could pull everything within

00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:11,490
the same interface and if I want to

00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:13,890
create an ID or an language platform

00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:16,230
like NetBeans or Eclipse

00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:18,450
that's just plain crazy we can't design

00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:20,910
lectures or parcels for each languages

00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:22,350
by ourselves that's like all the things

00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:25,420
have already been designed by take the

00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:29,090
pain of doing that once more

00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:32,660
this is pollen that means the initial

00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:37,880
features it's cross platform built on

00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:41,630
Java minimum requirements JRE 6 it has

00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:44,570
its the native look and feel of an

00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:51,080
applet app so it looks the same in

00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:53,540
Windows on Mac or Linux this is

00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,820
available as a zip file on the Google

00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:57,530
code web page so you know dependencies

00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:00,340
no installations nothing just download

00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:03,890
unzip and fire it it works

00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:07,370
you just need Java and / Jerry not the

00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:10,400
JDK but the JRE and purl 2 for this app

00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:12,230
to work and it's portable since it's

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,980
just you don't need to install it it's

00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:18,080
just a zip file plug it into a USB put

00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:21,250
it anywhere it still runs provided the

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:23,300
computer has a GRE and Perl installed

00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:26,360
now these are the features that are

00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:29,540
currently supported both files and

00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:33,250
modules you can open them edit them run

00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:37,490
them syntax highlighting this is when I

00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:41,990
try to incorporate the full lecture

00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:44,810
lecture in antal are so this particular

00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:49,000
implementation is developed on top of an

00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:53,810
teller and I have a partially available

00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,060
Perl grammar available for Aunt Eller

00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:58,610
it does automatic base matching Bridge

00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,640
matchings project support you can have

00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:04,400
Perl projects new projects as well as

00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:06,140
projects with existing profiles this

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,870
particular feature might be required

00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:11,360
when you have an existing repository and

00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:14,390
you just want to use this software to

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:17,690
work on that repository syntax checking

00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:20,300
I can check the syntax execute the code

00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:23,200
source code formatting source code

00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:27,440
formatting is done using the Perl tidy

00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:32,660
module source code analysis which is

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:35,600
done by Perl critic and it has paul dock

00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:36,510
integrated within the ID so you just

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,500
read

00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:42,450
on the keyword say pearl dock and it

00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:46,110
gives you the build up for that

00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:49,410
particular keyword and it also has

00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:52,080
source code versioning like it can plug

00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:56,550
into your subversion your JIT and your

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:58,020
mercurial repositories these are the

00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:01,110
features that I'm currently working on

00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:02,310
we implant incorporate a real-time error

00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:04,290
parser

00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:06,330
the parser I'm finding it really

00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:08,310
difficult to implement a parser in and

00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:13,830
tell are it's not done yet that's

00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:16,670
currently in progress debugger using the

00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:19,650
existing NetBeans platform debugger

00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:21,690
planning to integrate the Perl debugger

00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:25,500
into inside the NetBeans platform

00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:27,840
debugger reg X emulator yes well of

00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:30,960
course but without reg X doesn't make

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:34,320
sense so a reg X simulators are also on

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:38,850
the way and we do have a current user

00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:41,570
base which are suggesting a lot of

00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:45,810
features those features are getting

00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:49,440
incorporated as and when time is

00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:52,230
available one of the features that is

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,210
planned to be incorporated very soon is

00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:56,460
the integration with the NetBeans 8

00:07:54,210 --> 00:08:00,420
platform currently this is supported on

00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:02,190
NetBeans platform 7.2 and 7.4 currently

00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:04,710
work is in progress for integrating this

00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:07,230
with NetBeans platform 8 which has a

00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:10,440
series of performance enhancements due

00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:13,830
to which the ID works around two times

00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:18,570
faster than it what used to do on 7.2 as

00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:21,030
well as compared to on 7.4 this is the

00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:24,660
current usage stats since the project

00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:27,620
started we have around 31 thousand plus

00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:33,080
heads on the webpage

00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:35,870
please just for my publicity and the

00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,760
project is also hosted on Facebook so

00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:40,880
this is where basically the user

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,890
community interacts with us and provides

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:46,760
us with any kind of feature requests

00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:50,090
that they have so feel free to log on

00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:52,880
since everyone's on Facebook and there

00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:55,010
is also a support page on Google please

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,310
don't mind why the color is coming up

00:08:55,010 --> 00:09:01,370
like this but it says Berlin that beans

00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:03,830
at Google Groups comm that's the Google

00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:06,890
group this is also an additional support

00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:08,450
page that we have so if there are users

00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:10,130
who feel the need for any kind of

00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:13,910
features to be added they request it

00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:18,710
here and we start working on that as per

00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:20,090
again time availability so this is about

00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:23,680
the presentation let me just show you

00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:23,680
what actually it looks like

00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:38,150
this is on 7.2 it's not migrated to 8

00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:38,150
yet so bear with me please

00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:57,230
so this is the startup screen once it

00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:59,240
opens up this is your home page and the

00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:01,459
basic structure is that you have your

00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,230
Perl code arranged in the form of

00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:05,810
projects and within the projects there

00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:08,089
will be profiles module files currently

00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:11,480
only Perl file PL and dot PM are

00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:16,459
supported so let's say we create some

00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:19,040
file and it says pearl project or pearl

00:10:16,459 --> 00:10:22,930
project with existing sources I see a

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:25,610
pearl project let's do a hello world and

00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:30,610
it gives you the name of the project the

00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:30,610
project location the folder I say yes

00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:43,710
and it opens up this now this is a

00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:45,810
template that's been designed this is

00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:49,350
entirely NetBeans platform that has been

00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:52,470
used for which like whenever you create

00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:53,990
a new file the shebang line and strict

00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:56,490
pragma they are included by default

00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:58,320
because this is intended for beginners

00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,980
they don't need to do anything it's

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:06,270
ready

00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:08,870
just code all we do is good ol

00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,870
HelloWorld

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:16,860
okay

00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:22,460
now this is for executed option runs

00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:22,460
this is your output very simple

00:11:27,089 --> 00:11:31,830
this is the code formatter

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:43,210
so it automatically reformed as the code

00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:46,890
as per the poll tidy standards now this

00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:49,660
is what it does for beginners let's see

00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:52,360
you have been working for around a year

00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:54,820
or two and now you want to set up the

00:11:52,360 --> 00:12:01,570
parameters for bolt I do both critic to

00:11:54,820 --> 00:12:04,570
use for the tools option problem

00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:06,360
NetBeans have the poll critic and Perl

00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:08,620
teddy

00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:13,410
so there and these are the commonly used

00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:18,160
parameters that are what I've seen with

00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:20,500
Teddy if there is any kind of any more

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,560
features that anyone would like to see

00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:28,330
anything that they would prefer to have

00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:29,770
configurable within the Taiji module all

00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,870
feedback is welcome we'll try to

00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:34,380
incorporate this into the space so that

00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:38,830
those parameters can also be configured

00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:41,170
so similarly for Perl critic you can

00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:43,030
have like Apple critic brat binary you

00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:44,890
can specify the location of the binaries

00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:48,060
so directly it calls the Perl critic

00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:50,440
binary and then with the levels of

00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:52,000
criticism depending on the levels of

00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:56,020
criticism it goes against the code and

00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:02,260
finds out any kind of mistakes also a

00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:04,660
general tab Perl executable now any kind

00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:07,300
of someone were working on the default

00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:11,290
we expect that Bob would be in the path

00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:13,300
now let's say I have Perl 5.0 point

00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:15,610
eight on my machine which is in the pub

00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:17,380
I don't have options of like this is

00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:21,520
what I'm speaking about life scenario on

00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:23,500
my work computer / 5.0 point 8 I'm

00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,540
unable to edit the path variable I

00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:28,120
cannot have it anywhere even in the user

00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:29,800
variables so it's not even a I cannot

00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,670
just go and say Paul and it will go to

00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,930
point 5

00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:36,820
508 I want / 5 1 6 and I have the binary

00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:39,880
somewhere I can point the binary to this

00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:44,140
that way it will go against well 5 6 5 1

00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:46,900
6 rather than 5 or 8 so this is for any

00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:49,540
kind of say custom Perl executable that

00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,800
you want to use the library path this is

00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,600
also any kind of

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,330
for module files which are not there in

00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,430
the standard installation part we still

00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:59,589
want to include them we include those

00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:08,529
parts here and it will automatically go

00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:09,550
against those part and let's see if this

00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:14,640
works

00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:14,640
and I say cool analysis

00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:32,800
still working

00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:35,220
hi 87.0 okay this is what the message

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,220
comes at

00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:45,110
so without the script pragma we get

00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:53,180
errors like this see page footer of the

00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:57,560
BBB so these are two options and I see

00:14:53,180 --> 00:15:03,199
pearl print and this option here pulled

00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:05,360
off it helped and I got both I got the

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,839
pearl dog for print who are actually

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,839
print does

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:27,680
now let's say I don't want to run the

00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:32,230
code but I want to check the syntax of

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,230
the code before executing well - see

00:15:33,319 --> 00:15:39,289
it still says syntax okay something so

00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:49,040
okay and we have this option of

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:50,720
execution with parameters let's say my

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,180
script expects some kind of parameters

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,040
to be passed on to the script I can

00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:57,050
execute this it will ask me for the

00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,740
command-line parameters we can pass on

00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:02,240
the parameters separated by spaces and

00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:10,160
those will be passed on to the perl

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:16,670
script as RGB one two three four so this

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:19,130
is a new project and now when we select

00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:20,960
a project we also get this option

00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:22,520
available which is add existing file

00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,860
let's say I have an existing file and I

00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:27,320
want to integrate that into a project I

00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:31,570
say add existing file select the file

00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,570
put it into the project and a work honor

00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:52,040
so anything else I guess yeah ah any

00:16:46,120 --> 00:17:01,180
doubts questions feature requests yes

00:16:52,040 --> 00:17:01,180
this currently is just me

00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:07,699
this took around four years to build to

00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:09,199
the current state where it is I didn't

00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:11,510
know Java I didn't know Pole I didn't

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:14,470
know Aunt Eller so I learned some Java

00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:19,390
Island sample Island some Aunt Eller and

00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:19,390
this is what it is right now

00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:32,059
NetBeans is different from Java the JRE

00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:34,340
that you have with NetBeans Lacan had

00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:38,450
been seven it doesn't need to be JRE

00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:41,000
seven and this this is on my machine

00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:43,750
this is currently the re six with

00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,750
NetBeans seven

00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:59,590
yeah the plugin is currently in progress

00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:03,530
the plugin should be available for 8

00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:06,170
within the next few weeks because this

00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:08,900
is currently the largest race question

00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:11,150
to me why don't I have a plug-in now

00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:14,300
another point is why don't I have a

00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:16,580
plug-in is this is an ID with a lot of

00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:19,250
features that are in built within the

00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:21,770
application now if I put it as a plug-in

00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:23,570
then those features like a poll critic

00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:26,330
poll tidy they are embedded within the

00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:28,280
application if I make it a module then I

00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:30,500
have to separate out pearl tidy per

00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:32,450
critic or the Pearl Docs which are

00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,580
currently integrated so those again

00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:36,620
because increases my dependency list

00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:57,470
well right now I just depend on GRE and

00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:59,150
I depend on pearl remote projects is

00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:02,150
something remote projects is something

00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:04,220
which is also underway first version of

00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:07,309
remote projects has been tested there

00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:09,679
are some issues there which have been

00:19:07,309 --> 00:19:12,500
identified still working on that for

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,929
catalyst I haven't looked into catalyst

00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:17,090
yet but dancer yes I'm working on dancer

00:19:14,929 --> 00:19:19,010
as well so catalyst might be something

00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:22,190
that comes in later but dancer would

00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:24,500
come in first and once debugging is

00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:25,880
resolved then the remote debugging and

00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:28,300
the remote projects would also get

00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,300
result

00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:39,470
Chagas this is it

00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:39,470
