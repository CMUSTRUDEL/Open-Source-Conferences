	00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:15,450
good morning I'm Dan right I'm the

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:19,169
treasurer for the pearl foundation it's

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:21,810
been my honor to serve you at in that

00:00:19,169 --> 00:00:25,020
role for the past four years and it's my

00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:28,170
pleasure to be here today to talk to you

00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:32,730
a little bit about what TPF has been

00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:35,670
doing now I know that there is a extreme

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:38,970
danger in asking a treasure to come up

00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:41,160
and give a report like this but I assure

00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:43,790
you I did not come with 50 minutes worth

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,790
of pie charts

00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:55,589
yeah this was kind of a hard talk for me

00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,620
to put together because there's a

00:00:55,589 --> 00:01:02,879
challenge in in talking about what TPF

00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:06,540
is done because TPS achievements are not

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:09,320
only TPS achievements okay the things

00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:14,009
that that get done to improve pearl

00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:16,320
happen because of all of you there's a

00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:21,119
symbiotic relationship that exists here

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:25,940
and the job of TPF is to provide the

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:30,319
support for all of you to improve pearl

00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:33,149
so when I talk about TPS it achieve Minh

00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:38,429
talking about your your achievements for

00:01:33,149 --> 00:01:43,500
example gpf doesn't go out and improve /

00:01:38,429 --> 00:01:46,740
05 core we have people like Ricardo

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:50,040
CIGNA's like Nicholas Clarke Tony cook

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:54,119
Dave Mitchell Paul Johnson jess robinson

00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:57,570
who are out there writing their code

00:01:54,119 --> 00:02:01,020
into the pro/5 core to help improve

00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:07,829
pearl where TPF comes in is we provide

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:11,970
the conduit between the sponsors and the

00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:15,000
developers and in in doing so last year

00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:18,420
we were able to provide over 80 thousand

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,079
dollars in grants to help improve the

00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,079
pro/5 core

00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:32,560
those aren't the only kind of grants

00:02:28,299 --> 00:02:35,079
that TPF is responsible for we also have

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,750
our traditional Grants Program who has

00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:42,639
just taken on a new chairperson Makoto

00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:47,349
nozaki is our new chairman and under

00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:50,889
under the leadership of Alberto last

00:02:47,349 --> 00:02:53,010
year we paid out to two and a half

00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:57,639
thousand dollars in grants for

00:02:53,010 --> 00:03:00,310
improvement projects and in 2014 we have

00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:02,909
a budget of sixteen thousand dollars

00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:07,569
that we are paying out in grants and

00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:09,760
Makoto is looking for grant applications

00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:12,340
right now we have we have a large amount

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:16,569
of money that we are eager to find

00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:18,280
worthy projects for so please look into

00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:23,469
that if you have a project that you

00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:27,370
think is worthy to apply for it please

00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:28,959
the money's there in addition to the

00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:32,229
traditional grants and the pro/5 Corps

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:35,680
grants we also have the en Hague grants

00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:38,049
Ian heck is an entrepreneur who several

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,150
years ago made an award to the pearl

00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:43,419
foundation of two hundred thousand

00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:46,180
dollars now that was split in half one

00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:49,180
half of that was intended to be put

00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:51,430
towards the development of pearl six the

00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:54,489
other half intended to improve the

00:03:51,430 --> 00:04:00,370
infrastructure of the pearl foundation

00:03:54,489 --> 00:04:04,680
itself and in 2013 we used another 2,000

00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:07,959
to that in paying for patrick mashhad to

00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:14,949
attend conferences and continue work on

00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:16,539
Perl 6 all said in 2013 the pearl

00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:19,949
foundation was able to award over a

00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:19,949
hundred thousand dollars in grants

00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:31,790
grants not not the only thing that the

00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:36,860
pearl foundation has been achieving in

00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:39,910
the past year we've also been active in

00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:42,919
the genome outreach program for women in

00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:46,190
2013 we had our very first intern

00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:48,229
through that program this year in 2014

00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:50,330
we've already got one intern and we plan

00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:53,090
to have a second one by the end of the

00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:55,010
year totaling over eighteen thousand

00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:59,630
dollars that we've applied towards

00:04:55,010 --> 00:05:05,150
internships in the genome opw in the

00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:08,960
past two years we also have our

00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:13,540
community advocacy program under the

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:16,360
leadership of Yakov slummin we've

00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:19,940
started that program last year and

00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:23,600
yaakov has been visiting various pearl

00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:26,419
monger groups in areas and giving talks

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:31,520
about community advocacy gathering

00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:33,350
feedback and trying to work on ensuring

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:37,310
that the pearl community is best served

00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:41,060
through TPF last year he made visits in

00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:47,930
New York City linode sponsored an event

00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:53,780
in New Jersey and we had an event during

00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:58,789
ppw in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania speaking

00:05:53,780 --> 00:06:02,410
of ppw last year there were four

00:05:58,789 --> 00:06:05,840
conferences that yet TPF was involved in

00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:09,200
yap see in austin the orlando pearl

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:11,300
workshop d.c Baltimore pearl workshop

00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,160
and Pittsburgh pearl workshop now the

00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:16,370
thing with this and this goes back to

00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:19,849
what I was saying before you know TPF

00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:22,310
doesn't run these events specifically we

00:06:19,849 --> 00:06:23,479
have volunteers that put in a lot of

00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:26,450
time and effort to make these things

00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:29,750
happen but what TPF does is provides the

00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:31,970
infrastructure to make sure that these

00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:34,400
events can happen and one of the things

00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:38,090
that we've been doing is if trying to

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,840
find new ways to make it easier to run

00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,160
these events

00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:44,480
take some of the burden off of the

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:47,510
organizers and we started a new program

00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:50,660
this year and everybody has received a

00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:53,300
sponsorship prospectus when you checked

00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:55,070
in this morning now we're not asking

00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,600
every single person in this room to make

00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:59,660
a donation to the pearl foundation

00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:02,240
that's not what this is for but what we

00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:05,090
would really like to see is for most of

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,930
you to be able to take these back and we

00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:08,720
understand you're not the

00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:10,400
decision-makers in most cases but if you

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,900
can take these back and put them in the

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,120
hands of the decision-makers that you

00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:17,030
know that can help the pearl foundation

00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:21,169
what we'd like to do is try to take some

00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:23,060
of the burden of fundraising off of the

00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:25,340
shoulders of our conference organizers

00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:27,970
and we want to centralize it and that

00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:31,400
that works that helps out both the the

00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:33,440
sponsors and the organizers so the

00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:36,410
organizers can focus on organizing the

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:39,470
conference but also the sponsors get the

00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:41,270
benefit of having a centralized location

00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:44,389
that they can go to for all of their

00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:47,720
needs regardless of whose event it is so

00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:50,360
in the past when we would go to sponsors

00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:53,080
five or six times a year for each event

00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:55,669
that we have going on the new model is

00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:58,580
we ask the sponsors to take a look at

00:07:55,669 --> 00:08:00,349
the prospectus figure out which level of

00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:02,780
donation that they're comfortable with

00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:04,669
and that gives them recognition at every

00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:07,340
single events without them having to

00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:10,389
worry about who did so and so remember

00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:10,389
to contact me this year

00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:20,039
the the initial response to to this has

00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:21,569
been very good in fact the the platinum

00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:24,120
level donation which is a

00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:25,409
fifty-thousand-dollar donation I'm happy

00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,620
to report that we actually have three

00:08:25,409 --> 00:08:31,860
sponsors that have already stepped up to

00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:35,279
that level and the first one that I'd

00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:39,599
like to announce today the is a booking

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:42,570

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:45,000
to provide sixty thousand dollars to the

00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:49,949
pearl foundation which will be earmarked

00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:52,860
for the pro/5 core grant program so we

00:08:49,949 --> 00:08:54,480
sincerely appreciate booking and all

00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,720
that they've done to to help with that

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,720
program

00:09:03,749 --> 00:09:11,889
the second platinum level sponsor this

00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:13,629
year is Craigslist who actually went out

00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:15,729
of their way to make an unsolicited

00:09:13,629 --> 00:09:19,209
donation at the beginning this year for

00:09:15,729 --> 00:09:21,899
fifty thousand dollars for the pearl

00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:35,199
foundation to be used in whatever

00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:42,759
capacity we needed it so we do and first

00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:44,529
one in the conference and and finally we

00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:45,959
would like to thank cpanel for also

00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:50,579

00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:50,579

lot of great programs that the pearl

foundation is involved in and it really

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:47,589
depends on having the finances to fund
