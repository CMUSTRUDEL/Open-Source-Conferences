Title: Mark Fowler (‎Trelane‎) - ‎Mac and Perl‎
Publication date: 2014-06-24
Playlist: YAPC::NA 2014
Description: 
	It's now 2014 and three years since I gave my "Pimp Your Mac With Perl" talk at YAPC::NA in Madison[1]. In this follow up talk, consisting of entirely new material, I'll be talking about new technologies that have come along since then (having seen the prior talk is not required.)

I'll be covering:

- Writing Alfred Plugins, for example to search metacpan
- Using KeyboardMaestro to fully control your Mac with Perl.
- PopClip Extensions, and brining features of an IDE to Terminal.app
