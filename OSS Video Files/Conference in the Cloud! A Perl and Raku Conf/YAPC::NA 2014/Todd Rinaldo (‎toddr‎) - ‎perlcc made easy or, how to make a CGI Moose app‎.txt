Description: 
	Based on recent work on the B::C module, it's now possible to build a working binary which can do away with the majority of startup expense a typical perl program would have. 

In this talk, I'll explain:
- What the perlcc compiler does and doesn't do.
- How to setup the perl compiler.
- How to pre-compile a perl script into a binary for faster execution.
- Discuss the common mistakes one makes when building a perl binary and how to work around them.
