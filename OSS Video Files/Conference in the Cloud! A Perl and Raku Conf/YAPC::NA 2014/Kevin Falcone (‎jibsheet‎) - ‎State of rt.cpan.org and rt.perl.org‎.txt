Title: Kevin Falcone (‎jibsheet‎) - ‎State of rt.cpan.org and rt.perl.org‎
Publication date: 2014-06-24
Playlist: YAPC::NA 2014
Description: 
	Best Practical took over primary support of rt.perl.org and completed a major upgrade last year. We've also worked with the perl.org admins to upgrade and support rt.cpan.org. We'll talk a little about the history of the systems (why does rt.cpan.org exist?) and how they work today. If you taunt me, we'll talk about how the email integrations work. We'll talk about the open source code they're built on and how you can help hack on them. We're working on upgrades to the newest series of RT (4.2) and will talk about features that will help CPAN authors and core perl hackers make better use of the systems.

Heather I'm Kevin

00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,840
I'm from best

00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:20,869
as a result we have slowly taken over

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,580
running two of the community artis that

00:00:20,869 --> 00:00:25,400
exists Archie at Sipan and archaea pearl

00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:27,829
I'm going to talk briefly about how

00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,810
those two work some upgrade work that

00:00:27,829 --> 00:00:30,800
we're doing on them this summer so

00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:33,620
things look forward in the future a

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,809
couple of the outstanding dev requests

00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:37,400
for them and you know one of the other

00:00:35,809 --> 00:00:38,540
big things is how to get ahold of us if

00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,850
you're one of the users of these systems

00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:43,730
and you want to file a bug asked for

00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:45,920
request that sort of thing at best

00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:47,809
practical I am too many different things

00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,699
but primarily relevant here is that I'm

00:00:47,809 --> 00:00:51,289
one of the developers of RT and one of

00:00:49,699 --> 00:00:54,140
the software guys I also do a lot of

00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:56,090
training and a lot of consulting so I'm

00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,399
happy to answer any RT specific

00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:00,969
questions and any RT at Sipan or RT de

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:04,390
pearl specific questions as we go along

00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:10,009
I'm going to start with Artie at Sipan

00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:11,360
the most relevant thing here is that you

00:01:10,009 --> 00:01:14,119
know our teeth at Sipan came about

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,210
because back in about two thousand one

00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:19,459
ish like mid-2001 Jessie Vincent who's

00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:21,050
the owner of s practical and Jessie says

00:01:19,459 --> 00:01:22,250
hi he wishes he could be here but he was

00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:24,229
out in San Francisco running laser

00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:26,660
cutters building keyboards but he

00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:28,130
doesn't miss the app see he was he was

00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,539
trying to file tickets and this was back

00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,280
in the days when you know we were still

00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:33,170
using CVS we occasionally maybe you had

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,610
subversion maybe there was sourceforge

00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:36,380
but there was no real good way we had

00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:38,090
Sipan was great it existed you can pull

00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,950
things off of it for years at that point

00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:41,539
but there's no standard way of

00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:44,060
submitting your bug reports some of them

00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:45,739
said please send mail to the author some

00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:48,289
of them were yelling into the dark of

00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:50,179
night some of them were just you know

00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:51,380
people would be angry when you sent them

00:01:50,179 --> 00:01:53,869
a bug report because you'd filed a bug

00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:55,520
against their module and when the other

00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:57,830
problem was if you had a bug there was

00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,709
no real good way to Google your bug and

00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:01,970
say oh someone else had this problem i

00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:03,590
wouldnt they have a patch oh that's

00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:05,539
great and Jesse realize well you know

00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:07,640
I've been writing a bug tracker for the

00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:08,720
last couple of years and maybe I could

00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,429
spend one up for the community and

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,340
that's how our teeth at Sipan came into

00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:18,140
being he you know basically bothered

00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:20,750
Andreas and got a copy of the pause

00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:23,090
database and used that to build out

00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:25,069
basically one q / distribution on sea

00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,970
pen and in order to do offer people to

00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:28,490
log in

00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:29,660
and for a number of years we ran that on

00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:31,730
actually the best practical

00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:34,220
infrastructure when I was hired by best

00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:36,140
practical was actually more than half of

00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,870
the resources on our primary server went

00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:41,720
to running our two dots offended org

00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:42,770
these days it runs on a vm I don't

00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,850
actually have a good picture of esque

00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,320
and Robert together I have a good

00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,580
picture of Robert but i have no good

00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,950
pictures of asked so I'm just steal

00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,240
their icons instead for about three or

00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,680
four years now we've run on their

00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,030
infrastructure has been great because

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,040
I've been able to be less of a systems

00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:58,970
administrator and less of keeping things

00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,830
up generally rule thumb if pearl dot org

00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,820
is down or pause that pearl the door if

00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:03,560
any of those other things are down

00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,000
there's not much I can do about it

00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,430
because I'm just sort of one of their

00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,950
VMs if specifically our teeth at Sipan

00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:12,320
is down or a pearl is down alone then

00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:13,820
it's probably my fault but if it's all

00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,110
of the things that run on Pearl the

00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,400
documents directory its Roberts fault

00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,660
and you're gonna have to wait for him to

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:23,030
wake up just like I have to wait from

00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:24,290
the wake up these days basically way it

00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,150
works is profit org contributes

00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:28,040
resources to run it best practical

00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:30,080
contributes a couple of people to run

00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,500
the systems and to do development and to

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,370
handle bugs and I'm a cure keeps running

00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,830
eighty-five percent of the time on our

00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,670
tail at Sipan that's going to be me

00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:39,860
fifteen percent or twenty percent of

00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:41,269
time is going to be Alex at some point

00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:43,940
Amanda being Wallace we'll see if he

00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:45,290
gets suckered into it but this is a

00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:47,720
couple of people who have root on the

00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:49,820
boxes and access to the databases but

00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,280
also just general RT knowledge although

00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:54,019
a lot of times it's not general RT

00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,690
knowledge its knowledge of like pause

00:03:54,019 --> 00:04:01,100
and everything else involved in RT dot C

00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:03,650
pen as of when I checked over the

00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,900
weekend there about just short of 34,000

00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:08,030
cues in RT dot C pen this is why you'll

00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,500
never see a list of the cues in our TTFN

00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,489
I was going around and like ripped them

00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,260
all out because there's often like a

00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:13,760
drop-down box in RT instances of queues

00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,290
and as you can imagine your browser

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,239
might freak out if we gave you one of

00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:18,530
those is why it's now one of the big

00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:20,810
major things that happened last summer

00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:22,220
when Tom Sibley did an upgrade was you

00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:23,540
got Auto completers in a lot of places

00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,660
to help you do a lot of things actually

00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:27,979
based off of meta Sipan looks like

00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,360
roughly you know we've been pretty

00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:31,310
consistently there's about 10,000

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,010
tickets a year reported across all the

00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:35,599
cues which is actually a very small RT

00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:37,610
instance although it feels like a big RT

00:04:35,599 --> 00:04:37,860
instance some days this is actually when

00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:41,879
I

00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:43,560
look at the statistics quite small most

00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:45,060
important thing most common question

00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,319
that I answer about our to not see Penn

00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:50,520
and this is the thing that I tend to do

00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:52,319
in hashtag toolchain is okay the

00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,389
permissions are wrong in r2 at Sipan or

00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:56,460
we have something hasn't shown up in our

00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:58,259
t dot CP n etcetera etcetera this is the

00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:01,349
program that does all of the magic it's

00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:02,879
called Sipan to RT now we run it every

00:05:01,349 --> 00:05:04,590
two hours for a number of years used to

00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,569
run every night because it took about an

00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:07,979
hour and a half to Ron and I murdered

00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:09,780
the machine that was running on so we

00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:11,520
fixed that a couple of years ago it's

00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:14,729
much lighter now it no longer runs

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,199
against the pause my sequel database for

00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:17,729
a number of years ago it's basically we

00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:19,680
run against all of the same publicly

00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:22,229
available data that you guys have access

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,389
to so that means you know find a less

00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:26,430
jeezy & 0 2 packages details which are

00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:29,460
just the other on every sea pen server

00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:31,229
they're on every pawpaws instance these

00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,199
these two files we end up using this is

00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:36,240
where we get our list of distributions

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,500
and there's a whole thing that I'm

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,900
probably not going to explain as well as

00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:43,949
I could about files versus distributions

00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:46,229
on pause you basically every you have 50

00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:47,580
perl modules in a bundle the name of

00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:48,810
that bundle is your distribution that's

00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,520
what we're going to use in our t dot c

00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:53,940
pen this does occasionally cause

00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:56,159
problems when engee you know releases

00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:58,199
six things and he changes the name of

00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:59,849
the module seven times i have to scurry

00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:01,710
around behind him closing the first four

00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:03,270
of them or something for him because he

00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:05,490
couldn't quite make up his mind or he

00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:06,779
wrote his own version of de silla to

00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,539
release to see pan and it was slightly

00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:10,680
wrong or something and those are the

00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:12,060
sorts of things that you please like

00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,500
please even up this email address a

00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,610
couple slides online please email us and

00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,930
that's when you see that sort of thing

00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,669
is i just want to make it easier for you

00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:20,300
to find the right cue the other one

00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:23,159
that's really good at cgi p.m. vs cgi

00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,300
ibc gif p.m. is the historical one that

00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:26,009
hasn't been the right one to use in a

00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,180
number of years and see guys the correct

00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:28,560
ones like we've tried to make this as

00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,860
obviously possible but it doesn't always

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,509
always work these are also the things

00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,189
where we get those broken in and fixed

00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:38,210
in custom fields to pull lists of like

00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:38,210
what are the relevant versions

00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:44,230
another really common question we use

00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:46,060
who is that XML to pull your party at CP

00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:47,530
end user name pull a real name for you

00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:49,900
and pull an email address if it's public

00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:51,220
so like my email address is in that who

00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,169
is that XML it's in there at Sipan

00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:54,760
Egyptian com that's you know my publish

00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:56,740
address a lot of people you can choose

00:06:54,760 --> 00:07:00,610
to have a private email address on pause

00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:02,380
we will just send mail just to your user

00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:04,660
ID at cpn a dog and let them figure out

00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:06,190
how to get you the mail of course if

00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,450
you've told see pause and you don't have

00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:09,820
an email address and you will never get

00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:11,380
mail from RT you can go into RT and

00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:13,990
change this we won't overwrite it after

00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:15,550
we create your user but you know a lot I

00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,990
think last time I checked or something

00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:18,880
like 85 or 90 percent of people just

00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:21,100
have either the thing that's in their

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,320
paws identity or they have blah blah

00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:26,169
blah at Stephen org as their email so

00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,550
that all just four words alone then

00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:30,340
probably the other most relevant thing

00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:32,500
is 06 perms we don't actually care what

00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:34,060
kind of permissions you have on a module

00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,860
we just care that you have some sort of

00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:38,229
permissions on a module this came up

00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:39,700
recently because pause may add another

00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:42,460
kind of permission in the year or two

00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:44,050
after one of the QA hackathons and we

00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:46,570
basically just look at it and say oh you

00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:50,550
have permissions on CGI great okay fine

00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:53,229
we will make you an admin CC of that Q

00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:54,610
relevant sort of digression there you'll

00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:55,780
see if you're not getting around an hour

00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:59,080
to etsy then you've got requesters

00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:00,760
you've got CCS you've got admin CCS MNC

00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,860
CSR the maintainer zand combing Tanner's

00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:05,080
that the administrative CCS you pick up

00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:07,350
a bunch of extra rights you can close

00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,550
tickets you can delete tickets you can

00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:11,650
often if you have rights on things you

00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:13,180
can move things between queues you

00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:14,320
basically do more with a ticket if

00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,120
you're one of the people who maintains

00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,010
tickets in a queue if you're just a

00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,229
requester or CC I think you can close

00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:21,970
your own tickets now but primarily

00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:23,979
you're just there so you'll get mail

00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:25,300
when somebody replies to the ticket

00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:26,890
saying I fixed your bug in the blah blah

00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,990
blah or when they write back to you

00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:32,229
saying can you explain your bug using

00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:34,599
more words please that sort of thing for

00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:37,539
the purposes of RTC pen requesters and

00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:39,190
ccs are basically equivalent in our

00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:40,330
normal RT we do differentiate them a lot

00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:42,310
we do a lot of fun things with them but

00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:43,839
for RC pen it's mostly just a way to

00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:46,070
send an email bomb out to people when

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,930
you want to know more information

00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:49,310
with the current version of our to that

00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:50,780
seat Bend that's running now and the

00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:52,730
next one there's actually a lot easier

00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:55,250
if you go into the people page on a

00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:56,690
ticket to go in and say find all the

00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,190
people that were related to a ticket

00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:59,420
have written it on a ticket over the

00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:01,010
history of it and add them to the ticket

00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,750
which is great and also when you're

00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:06,080
replying to a ticket from the web

00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:07,910
interface you get a much nicer interface

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,940
for ticking one time people into that

00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:13,130
into that reply this also brings up a

00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:14,930
trick that I know some people know but

00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:18,140
not everyone which is you can be given

00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:20,030
koment on one file in a distribution and

00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,500
you'll pick up artists at Sipan rights

00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:23,060
for the distribution this apparently is

00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,530
like a commonly used trick that I did

00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:27,830
not know existed until about four months

00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:30,290
ago totally works totally accept that it

00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:33,230
bears to be like an MST trick that I

00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:35,480
just learned about party at Sipan allows

00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:38,750
two ways to open tickets you can use the

00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,980
web UI you can you can't do them purely

00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,300
in the public interface you do have to

00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,760
be signed in with some identifying

00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:47,000
information we currently take will take

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:49,070
your paws ID david goldin has sent us

00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,540
over the years repeatedly stronger

00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:53,630
language saying please don't ask for a

00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:55,940
pause ID just a simple report bugs you

00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:58,520
can use bit card you can use open ID to

00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:01,100
log in and do it we've also bulked up

00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:03,140
the documentation on how to send an

00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,720
email and i mean this is just sort of a

00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:07,460
the general thing is bug dash whatever

00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,830
the distribution name is with colons

00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:12,350
replaced with dashes at RT that's even

00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:16,550
at org so one of my modules aren't yet

00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:19,400
an external off and one thing that I

00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:21,410
will note here open ID is a bit wonky

00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,660
with the Google open ID because they're

00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:26,090
open ID isn't really open ID but lots of

00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:27,830
other people do use open ID we probably

00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:29,660
should support some more options and

00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:31,990
can't supports more options we just

00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,990
don't know

00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:39,290
evil probably the two most relevant ones

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,449
on here actually are like the signing

00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:44,769
with gmail and I'm told the twitter

00:10:41,449 --> 00:10:46,730
oauth will give me an email address so

00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:47,899
you know I unfortunate no too many

00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:49,639
Twitter them so they pushed me for that

00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:51,980
one but it's like we could go this way

00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:53,420
that seems wrong it's more likely to be

00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,679
pull the door which I'll talk about in a

00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,209
couple slides and it would vaguely like

00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:58,189
some different auth options and so

00:10:56,209 --> 00:10:59,689
whatever we go with 4 12 the dark I'll

00:10:58,189 --> 00:11:03,679
just install on both of them and we'll

00:10:59,689 --> 00:11:05,299
use it in both places one thing you know

00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:07,189
when you do open a ticket we do try and

00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:09,019
like write out as much information as we

00:11:07,189 --> 00:11:10,459
can about people to like say please do a

00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:13,369
good job to tell me what pearl urine

00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:15,049
tell me bah bah bah you know be polite I

00:11:13,369 --> 00:11:17,119
did notice when I was taking the screen

00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:19,309
shot last night probably the most common

00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:21,860
bug that my coworker fixes because I'm

00:11:19,309 --> 00:11:23,629
just tired of fixing it is hi i emailed

00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:25,220
into your bug tracker and it's got my

00:11:23,629 --> 00:11:26,509
phone number in my home address and a

00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,579
picture of my child and the signature

00:11:26,509 --> 00:11:29,749
could you go delete that for me and I

00:11:28,579 --> 00:11:31,610
always just want to say come on man it's

00:11:29,749 --> 00:11:33,410
a it's a public bug tracker did you not

00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:35,569
analyze that we say it most of the

00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:37,600
places but we don't say here so we go we

00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:39,259
delete those and we trim them out but

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,489
unfortunately it's already been google

00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:43,129
indexed so it's probably out there on

00:11:40,489 --> 00:11:45,230
the web at this point and blood yeah

00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:46,309
it's a you know weekly occurrence so I

00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:48,079
keep trying to go around if you find

00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:50,389
somewhere else that doesn't say public

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,129
or if you disagree with this language in

00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:54,829
some way please file a bug we're happy

00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:56,749
to well language patches are easy for me

00:11:54,829 --> 00:12:00,189
to take and integrate for you code

00:11:56,749 --> 00:12:02,839
patches are harder check off Beauvoir

00:12:00,189 --> 00:12:04,819
email so if somebody writes into bug

00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:06,110
dash party off that external off that RT

00:12:04,819 --> 00:12:07,790
that's deep and adored if you're a

00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:10,489
maintainer or comb ain't on the module

00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:12,139
you'll get mail about the bug you can

00:12:10,489 --> 00:12:13,369
just reply to that mail and it will go

00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:14,839
back to the requesters and then they

00:12:13,369 --> 00:12:16,279
come on bro so you can basically never

00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:17,749
log in to our to that see penet org and

00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:22,369
be able to work back and forth on your

00:12:17,749 --> 00:12:24,220
bug you can and we'll talk about the web

00:12:22,369 --> 00:12:26,839
you in a sec but I mean I certainly do

00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:28,459
ninety-five percent of my RT I'm an arty

00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:30,559
developer and I still almost never use

00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:32,989
the web UI NRT I still do ninety percent

00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:34,760
of what I do in in email and then go

00:12:32,989 --> 00:12:37,360
back at the end

00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:39,290
I really do mean this by the way like

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,610
this comes up every now and then but

00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:45,170
both are too that's even an archetype

00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:49,460
pearls male is a fascinating and is a

00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:54,560
bunch of key male very very briefly does

00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:56,300
anyone know what QP smtpd is ok so

00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:01,520
that's that's about what i expected yes

00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:03,110
so um it's the oh right that one's

00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,850
public I always forget that that one is

00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:06,440
visible to you guys right because

00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,730
there's like 20 q's in provo dog that

00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:11,360
you can't see and then that one is

00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:14,090
public right so QPR 70b is like you mail

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,820
front end thing written by yon Henson

00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:18,560
and it runs on the front end of a bunch

00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,760
of the pro lot org servers so it's the

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,920
thing that gets your mail when you send

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,930
this mail it then sends that mail to us

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,190
over at best practical where we then

00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:27,470
store at one of our mail queues and we

00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:28,760
run it through like a giant perl script

00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:30,110
which then runs it through the mail

00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:34,010
gateway which then injects it and is

00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:35,450
done and as complicated as that it is

00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:38,090
it's actually worse when we talk about

00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:39,500
the art una prova torque Mel but so

00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:41,540
there's people occasionally ask about

00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,160
Mel like I only control about half of

00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:46,160
the mail stream for art yahtzee pen

00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:47,900
adored and but it does work I mean for

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,280
the most part I can count on one hand

00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:52,160
the number of nail problems we've had

00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:54,230
with our chats a pen over the years when

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,610
you're managing tickets you basically

00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:57,320
have your two options you can click

00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:58,880
around the web UI there are as an

00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,140
Actions menu up in the top right corner

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,000
that lets you do most of things you go

00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:05,150
you can reply you can comment you can

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,680
resolve you can delete etc a lot of

00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:09,410
other folks you know either don't know

00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:11,060
but there is a command line client it

00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:13,370
ships with our tea but we have it

00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:16,550
bundled up in case you aren't installing

00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:18,860
a full RT this are this Sipan package RT

00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:21,290
client CLI will get you the current

00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:22,970
release of been RT which is actually

00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:25,280
like a four dot to release but it works

00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:26,690
just fine on RT at sea pen it's actually

00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,610
how I do a lot of things I will end up

00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:30,380
replying to a bunch of tickets and then

00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:32,090
at the end I will just use the RT

00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:34,040
command line client to say you know

00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:36,200
reject all of those tickets or resolve

00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:38,210
all of those tickets or edit a couple of

00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:41,510
other things and it has its own built-in

00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:42,740
help it uses the rest interface that RT

00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:47,660
provides but I'm not going to talk about

00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:48,560
that briefly managing queues some of

00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:51,410
this is sean's faults

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,880
it's been added on later if you're if

00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:55,220
you're maintainer or co-main you get a

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,410
couple of boxes on the manage tag in

00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:58,279
your queue you can write up a bunch of

00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:00,050
notes which will show up at the top of

00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:01,910
every distribution page when you're

00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:04,070
creating tickets you can email other

00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:05,810
people so like the win32 bug you males

00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,700
the win32 list this is how they do it

00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:09,860
and you can also add more tags to things

00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:12,560
to have them to make it easier to see

00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:14,000
things so the distribution notes show up

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,740
anytime you're like looking at the top

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,200
of a page looking anything else you get

00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:19,970
a note saying you know the helpful

00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,620
helpful things but you also get people

00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:23,000
will write out when you report this blog

00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,230
please make sure that you tell me the

00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,330
version of the library you're building

00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:27,560
against it's a basic extra bug extra

00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:30,470
information you would really appreciate

00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,520
when hailing a bug report you don't want

00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,680
to use our to not see pen adored

00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:36,290
Shadowcat sponsored development ian

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,420
norton wrote it we will take out of your

00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:40,370
meta yamo bug tracker that email a bug

00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:43,010
tracker dot web and we will put notes

00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:44,660
all over our TLC pen saying please go

00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:46,640
over there and report this bug so

00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:49,040
anytime you see a distribution with this

00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:51,710
setup you'll see please visit the

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,850
preferred bug tracker you know ninety

00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:56,360
percent of these are just links over to

00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:57,980
github issues thing but other times our

00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:01,310
custom you know please only email me

00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:03,020
that sort of thing it lends up looking

00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:05,570
something like that and actually jewels

00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:08,390
make maker I missed a carrot sorry

00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:10,160
there's a bunch of other things we do

00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:12,140
keep the alternate bug tracker we do

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,430
keep it the QRM because it may have you

00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,780
know ten years with the tickets in it

00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,070
that people that are in Google when

00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:17,540
people will find the patches for their

00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:20,720
old version of a module they need and

00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:24,290
that's super helpful for folks other

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,820
things you can do this is how our meta

00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:27,920
seep in and search at Sipan get there a

00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:29,030
list of open bugs on our TLC pen so if

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,280
you want to stare at the information you

00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:32,600
can and similarly I think Neal be was

00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,040
the one who asked us for the sequel I'd

00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,760
data which is a dump of a bunch of

00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:40,220
ticket metadata there's not currently

00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,630
really any requests in 40 at Sipan for

00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:44,450
feature so now is the time that if you

00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:45,890
would like a feature on RT at Sipan you

00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:47,570
should email this e-mail address and ask

00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:48,920
about it because i don't have a list for

00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:50,570
our TWP rotatory I don't have a list

00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,470
froggy on see them so I did see if I'm

00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:53,209
the summer while just going to get a

00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:55,640
straightforward upgrade and maybe I'll

00:16:53,209 --> 00:16:57,650
had a few things but that's the right

00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,270
place if you'd like to know but this one

00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:00,440
if I don't know your name please tell me

00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,730
you're Paul's ID because I don't I can't

00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,620
guess it

00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,490
you dislike half the things right right

00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:09,199
end because I don't know how to check on

00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:11,299
things pull the door in the beginning

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,250
there was Pro bug if you are lucky

00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:15,530
enough to be far enough back in Perl 5

00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:18,079
get to be looking at pearl bug numbers

00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:20,689
this file exists it is the mapping

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,429
between those old numbers and the RT

00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:23,990
ticket spectrum represent those things I

00:17:22,429 --> 00:17:25,160
think this is like Nicholas Clarke it's

00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:26,449
probably the only person who uses this

00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,160
file but there's probably five other

00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:30,350
people that use it it's there it's

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,960
linked if you need it the rest of the

00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:37,340
actual bugs date from pre-2000 and r2 dr

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:39,500
hold the door for a long time this was

00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:42,260
run by robert spear robert of parole dot

00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:45,740
org basically I rebuild it from scratch

00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:48,320
in 2011 in 2012 he convinced me to take

00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:50,210
over maintainer ship of it and 2013 I

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,549
spent way too long finishing an upgrade

00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:55,760
from a very old version of RT to the

00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:57,799
current version of RT this is why

00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,390
sometimes when you asked me why I don't

00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:02,540
know because it was done 10 years ago by

00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:04,790
Robert I have to go ask him the biggest

00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,950
thing in here are that you will see if

00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:09,169
you're you know profile in Perl 6 are in

00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:11,000
there there's the QP smtp q which i

00:18:09,169 --> 00:18:13,250
always forget about and i always forget

00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,650
that like the Perelman pro mongers out

00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:19,100
or group management is in there as well

00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:20,419
as some other things and but if there's

00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:22,010
anyone who wants to be the Perl 6

00:18:20,419 --> 00:18:23,600
community liaison for me I don't even

00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:25,100
know who I should be asking questions up

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,360
for that because I have questions about

00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,820
how their cue should be wrong I don't

00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:31,850
know who that would be I'm going to skip

00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:33,770
over mail but upgrades that I'm working

00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:36,559
on biggest thing that you will get is

00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:38,030
our Tea for Two has a native my sequel

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,679
full text search support rather than

00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:40,940
bolted on full text search support so

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,910
will enable it once we finish the

00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:46,370
upgrade the linking between tickets

00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:49,220
mostly for people handling meta 521

00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:50,510
releases 522 releases now autocompletes

00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,830
you don't have to remember a copy and

00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:53,990
paste bug IDs all around you can

00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:55,250
actually search for them and we'll see

00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:56,980
if user summaries are useful to you guys

00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:59,210
I'll send male 2 p-5 p when i get there

00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:01,580
most requested things that i know for

00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:03,049
profit org we deployed this one there's

00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:05,240
about five or six people who now have a

00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:06,950
lot more privileges for deleting spam i

00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,480
also have a bunch of dev i'd like to do

00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:09,580
for the spam handling on our TWP roll

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,520
the door but i've not had time

00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:14,380
I am in the process of building a

00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,940
dashboard for you guys to use to look at

00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:17,500
tickets that will make the meta tracking

00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:19,420
better rather than having that one long

00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:21,430
list on the side of meta tickets for

00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:22,960
releases its much you can have a much

00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:24,190
better thing to look at I didn't even

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,360
realize as a pain point until I was

00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,800
talking to Rick a couple of weeks ago

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,320
and I said oh there's easy solutions for

00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:31,630
that and I'm in the process of building

00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,800
it out and I'll hand it over bleed

00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:34,510
brakes Sipan has been requested

00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:37,330
basically anytime I ticket comes in link

00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:38,680
it I have code and now i have a dev

00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:40,510
instance that i can test the coat on

00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,760
once it tests we'll just make that

00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:44,410
silently work the other thing is perma

00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:47,800
quest is being able to file bugs online

00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:50,110
as far as i know this actually works now

00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,040
but I've not really tested it and I

00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:52,840
would really like there to be more

00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,490
directions like saying what to include

00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,110
in a bug report online before you roll

00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:57,730
it out but as far as I know since the

00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:59,230
upgrade I accidentally made that work

00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:02,050
and then never fixed it to stop working

00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:02,980
again so I'd know literally that's what

00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:04,780
happened somebody's like wow I can

00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:06,460
submit bugs online yeah of course you

00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:08,680
can and something that i found out that

00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:10,510
they'd turn that off years ago i have

00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:13,210
two things sitting on p5p right now from

00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:14,830
last week or apply to carl about pending

00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:16,810
release if anybody else has opinions on

00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:20,170
pending release please reply to that and

00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:22,030
also the auto reply and the on resolve

00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:24,010
mail that goes out or relatively generic

00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:25,210
I've forwarded along that text if you

00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:27,850
have opinions on how the text should

00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:29,740
read let me know otherwise in like a

00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:31,330
week or 2 i'm going to buy Fiat clean it

00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:33,880
up a little bit but I'm not gonna do

00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:35,590
terribly much to it I was worried I

00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,970
would get an argument about it but I

00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:41,110
actually got ignored which I guess is

00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:44,800
better than an argument but well we will

00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:47,170
see reporting bugs pro bug admin at RT

00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,700
nonprofit org biggest thing you can tell

00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:50,350
me is who you're logged in as like what

00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:52,840
it says with logged in as blah blah blah

00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:54,730
at the top of the page reproduction

00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:56,350
steps and politeness I really shouldn't

00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:58,540
have to say that one but there are a

00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:01,930
couple of folks who are just shockingly

00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:04,180
rude to the role that or just have other

00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:06,490
things if you need me so I'm jib sheet

00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:09,250
on IRC I hang out in RT which is the

00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:10,480
general RT help channel i'm also in p5p

00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,490
although i don't read it all the time

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,440
but if I see something about the RT go

00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:16,420
past I usually try to comment I do read

00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,670
p5p itself but I can't keep up most of

00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:20,290
the time I'm also in tool chain but it
