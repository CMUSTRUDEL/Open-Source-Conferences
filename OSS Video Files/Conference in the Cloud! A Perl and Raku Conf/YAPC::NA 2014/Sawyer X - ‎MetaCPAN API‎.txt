Title: Sawyer X - ‎MetaCPAN API‎
Publication date: 2014-06-24
Playlist: YAPC::NA 2014
Description: 
	Are you using MetaCPAN? Do you want to hook up to its cool API? Wrong number?!

MetaCPAN::API is an interface to MetaCPAN's API (get it?) that allows a comfortable access to the data MetaCPAN has to offer.

Version 1.000 has been rewritten from scratch and I would like for you to be aware of it, and to use it. Come see what the hell I'm talking about. Also, bring chips.

alright so I'm sorry this is Mickey and

00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:14,050
we're gonna do [ __ ] dammit okay we're

00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:17,500
gonna wheee want to give a talk about

00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:20,050
medicine API and I don't know how many

00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,550
of you familiar with FCP an API but that

00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,480
that's the name of the talk the thing is

00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,359
that we don't actually want to talk

00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,520
about menís offender API entirely we

00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,779
want to kind of remove meta soup n API

00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,939
instead we're going to talk about

00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:32,980
medicine client if you ridden pearl

00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:36,129
maybe the the heading was a good

00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:37,750
notification of that so what is meta

00:00:36,129 --> 00:00:39,940
soup and client it's actually a rewrite

00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:43,420
of medicine API and it's what we want to

00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:45,729
talk about the most so we have a some

00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:48,070
agenda to this and we're going to talk

00:00:45,729 --> 00:00:51,010
about medicine itself we're going to

00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:52,900
talk about what medicine is why we have

00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:55,449
met asleep and we're going to talk a bit

00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:58,299
about medicine API at this point I'm

00:00:55,449 --> 00:01:00,850
going to pass the wand or torch or

00:00:58,299 --> 00:01:03,070
whatever other peripheral yeah i have

00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:05,890
here to Mickey who will talk about

00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:07,750
medicine and client and then we're going

00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:09,909
to have a bit of a magic show that of

00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:15,039
course of course we'll go flawlessly as

00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:17,429
all left demos do so meda step n itself

00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:21,219
if you're not familiar with it it is an

00:01:17,429 --> 00:01:24,369
alternative to search cpanel which is

00:01:21,219 --> 00:01:28,750
what we're all familiar with so this is

00:01:24,369 --> 00:01:31,060
a cpn as you know it search t10 there's

00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:33,009
a few problems with search Sipan which

00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:37,359
is the reason that medicine man was

00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:39,460
built it is closed source it is old it's

00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:41,350
pretty ugly the fact that it's closed

00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,880
source means that any features that we

00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,950
want to have with search Sipan are

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,689
limited to those very specific

00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:49,060
individuals who have access to this and

00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:52,719
their time and whatever they find

00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:54,850
important so a good example is that the

00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:57,850
only feature I can recall that was added

00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:59,499
recently was syntax highlighting its not

00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:01,600
on by default and all of the available

00:01:59,499 --> 00:02:03,069
schemes are terrible so this is

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,020
something that we complained a lot about

00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:07,719
and finally we got this i think it was

00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:10,450
all so badly done but it's a thing that

00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:12,580
we we can really have any innovations

00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:13,989
done in search Sipan so it's very

00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:16,630
important that we have a new thing and

00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:18,550
there was a discussion that started and

00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:20,770
eventually what happened from that was

00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:22,300
medicine you can this is how medicine

00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:24,010
fan looks like there's a lot of

00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:26,200
differences I'm going to name a few of

00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:29,380
them first of all men s you paint has a

00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:31,240
standard modern interface it is

00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:33,160
completely open source free software we

00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:35,200
can all hack on it it is community

00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,860
maintained we add features all the time

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,230
anyone can play with it it's fantastic

00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:44,530
it is also participant in a lot of

00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:46,270
outreach programs is powered by elastic

00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:50,410
search so we get a lot of really nifty

00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:52,690
things there's a lot of interaction with

00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:54,910
other services so you could get stuff

00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:57,880
like commit graphs from github which

00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:59,670
it's linked to the project so if we know

00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,900
that the distribution is actually

00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:04,360
developed on github we will have all

00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:06,100
those commits graphs and bug reports and

00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,410
everything going from there there's

00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:10,240
dependencies reverse dependencies a

00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:12,580
bunch of really nice introspection

00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:17,020
features that we added to it there's a

00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:20,440
very nice code browsing with syntax

00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:21,790
hiding by default there's a raw views

00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,200
and different formats to get the

00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:25,120
information it's really really really

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,740
really nice you should definitely start

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,470
using this if you're unfamiliar with it

00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:33,190
and try it out I'm certain you would

00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:35,680
love this now the part that I want to

00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:37,870
talk a little about here is a menace if

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,580
any API I don't know how many of you

00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,680
familiar with it it was a module that I

00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:44,680
wrote about it I think two and a half

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:48,459
years ago when medicine plants started

00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:51,700
and the idea was to have an API module

00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:55,650
for the meta Sipan public API and

00:03:51,700 --> 00:04:00,430
there's a good parts of medicines are

00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:03,640
literally that's it so it's available

00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:05,709
the problem is that well the problem is

00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,570
there are a lot of problems so this is

00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:09,640
one a when I actually want to focus on

00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:12,580
and there's a reason why we scrapped

00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,440
then remove that completely first of all

00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:16,840
the last update was two years ago I

00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:19,209
didn't have time to work on it at all at

00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:22,330
all so it wasn't updated a really long

00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:24,100
time which means that it's not really

00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:26,710
covering a lot of the API the meta see

00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,600
pen does provide us it doesn't cover the

00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:30,190
author the it does cover the author

00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,460
module and release but there's a lot

00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,350
about

00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,940
information that it doesn't cover which

00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:38,530
is its kind of terrible if you want to

00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:41,620
do more than minimal things it covers a

00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:43,599
very basic fetches there's no logic

00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,849
behind it you cannot apply conditions

00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:47,979
you can look for interesting

00:04:44,849 --> 00:04:50,889
combinations you can't have filters you

00:04:47,979 --> 00:04:54,250
can send an elastic search structure but

00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:55,990
it's kind of weird to sow somehow coerce

00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,940
that into the API you know at least one

00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:00,550
person here the try doing this and it

00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:03,639
doesn't look nice because it wasn't I

00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:05,650
think it just wasn't ready for this it

00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:09,039
has a lot of fragile code the first

00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:10,090
thing that that I said to Mickey when he

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,039
wanted to work in an open source project

00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:13,090
now I suggested medicine soup and API he

00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:14,410
said what was the problem with it so

00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,330
well the first thing is that it has a

00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:20,199
lot of fragile code it actually doesn't

00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:22,330
handle parameters well and it will break

00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:27,789
very very easily and then you have time

00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:30,009
to fix that it will return hashes which

00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:33,849
is nice but doesn't allow introspection

00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:35,349
too much it returns a subset of the

00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:36,759
elastic search output and some of the

00:05:35,349 --> 00:05:38,830
stuff that you get back from medicine

00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:41,380
it's actually very important some of it

00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:44,949
is like metadata like facets which i

00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:47,259
think i'm pronouncing correctly so you

00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:49,120
know the raw output is it's nice for the

00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:51,490
basic stuff but when you want like heavy

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,050
things you got to start parsing the data

00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:56,039
from the hash and it's kind of it's

00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:59,639
pretty horrible so we did instead was

00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:02,770
rewrite it completely from scratch as

00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:04,930
medicine and client at this point I

00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:06,070
would like to pass it on to the person

00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:08,830
who actually sat down and wrote the

00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:12,610
entire thing which is why we're all here

00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:27,550
and that is Mickey give my hand of

00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:31,780
applause everyone can hear me seriously

00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:35,620
I don't see prepared for me i'll try to

00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:39,450
speak louder alright so meta sipping

00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:39,450
client that's that's the new thing and

00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:52,810
right as i said this is a complete

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:55,510
rewrite of the aftermath a sequin api

00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:58,300
module the reason that we decided to

00:06:55,510 --> 00:07:00,520
completely rewrite it was basically we

00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:03,340
looked at the code that we had we looked

00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:06,580
at what we want to to have what what was

00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:10,570
our what were our goals and we figured

00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:13,030
it fixing it is not going to be easier

00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:18,610
than just starting from scratch so we

00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:23,740
did that the name was changed to make a

00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:27,540
sleepin client as suggestion by Allah

00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:31,120
Fowler's from the meta sipping group and

00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:33,220
basically he he made that into an

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,890
official client to met achievement so

00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:38,620
that's part of the meta simple package

00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:41,590
if you want to call it that which means

00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:44,950
that it guarantees our commitment to

00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:49,810
follow the API and and patch it with all

00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:52,120
the new changes and additions as i will

00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:58,480
show you in some examples some recent

00:07:52,120 --> 00:08:01,780
things that we added to it basically we

00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:03,580
cover most of the api we have several

00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:07,890
things that are still on our backlog to

00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:14,250
do and of course some open issues thanks

00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:19,600
to to do there and we want to basically

00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:23,620
simplify all the interaction between the

00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:28,420
user and the Metis append without the

00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:32,740
need to provide elasticsearch syntax and

00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:34,600
read elasticsearch in syntax because we

00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:37,599
don't want your code to be dependent on

00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:39,459
that if we can provide a simple API

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:43,690
that you can always use and always trust

00:08:39,459 --> 00:08:47,139
even if the back end is changed that

00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:50,769
means that we are returning objects our

00:08:47,139 --> 00:08:54,279
objects will be allowing you to access

00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:58,990
the data not through the hash entries

00:08:54,279 --> 00:09:03,990
but through attributes is that okay all

00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:08,170
right we are thinking of some future

00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:11,139
support for roll mod for testing and

00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:13,870
other things that we found useful in

00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:17,139
general our our way of operation is that

00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:20,050
we add things based on the need for them

00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:21,880
so people ask for features and we add

00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:26,130
them because we didn't know exactly how

00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:29,350
people are going to use that module and

00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:31,870
we also one of the things that it will

00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:33,970
allow us in the future to add more and

00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:36,130
more connections between the different

00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:39,730
objects so for example if you have an

00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:42,250
author object you can prove stuff from

00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:43,990
that author like the modules or releases

00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:46,540
or whatever is connected to that order

00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:50,230
just like on the website you can click

00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:57,509
in the author name and go to that same

00:09:50,230 --> 00:10:01,000
to have that same experience some of the

00:09:57,509 --> 00:10:04,050
some of the queries that you can do with

00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:08,980
this with the medicine client are

00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:13,569
complex queries for example you apply

00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:16,560
some logic as in I want this and that

00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:20,889
and not that and all those kind of nice

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:24,550
little logic phrases and we're going to

00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:28,269
show some example of them to achieve

00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:31,990
that and not and to also be nice to the

00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:35,230
servers we are basically wrapping the

00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:38,189
elastics crawler which allows us to have

00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:41,800
pagination there are also nice goodies

00:10:38,189 --> 00:10:42,520
what we give back is a result set around

00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,370
our

00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:48,810
object our results that will give you

00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:52,420
functionality like the total numbers of

00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:55,810
elements that we have in and allow you

00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:59,470
to iterate over the result set itself

00:10:55,810 --> 00:11:02,260
which means that we lazy lazily create

00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:04,900
the objects and we don't do them all at

00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:12,940
once because that we have performance

00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:16,480
penalty to it some late latest additions

00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:20,020
we support the pod object on our end

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:23,860
with some multiple formats just like the

00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:26,560
meta sipping API gives us so you can

00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:30,940
request for example the plane version

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:36,220
plain text version HTML export and some

00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:39,940
other options um we inserted our reverse

00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:41,830
dependency features so if you're looking

00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:46,360
at a module you can request all the

00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:49,030
reverse dependencies to it or as I like

00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:51,460
to refer to it is all the things that

00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:55,470
you can break by introducing a bug in

00:11:51,460 --> 00:12:04,030
that module which is very important

00:11:55,470 --> 00:12:06,280
that's so either okay recent releases

00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:09,220
that was a feature I added yesterday and

00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:11,590
it was released to meta sip and clients

00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:17,070
latest release was about five or ten

00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:20,590
minutes ago with that addition which is

00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:23,470
which give you the same list of recent

00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:25,750
releases to meet our two to see ban as

00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:28,420
if you go to the meta sip n dot org

00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:34,260
slash recent and you can request either

00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:36,940
the last X number of releases or the

00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:39,760
everything from today or some kind of

00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:43,300
data a still support only today and

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:45,880
number but i will add some more features

00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,810
to to allow you to play with the dates

00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,310
and

00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:52,600
things like that or a time frame and

00:12:50,310 --> 00:13:01,770
basically that's what we had to say

00:12:52,600 --> 00:13:04,830
about it and again come on we want to

00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:11,200
give you that's a five minute frame nice

00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:12,490
to show some examples we can do it live

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,680
because I have an internet connection

00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:20,310
but we will get the same results so I'll

00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:24,339
try to just go through the pre-prepared

00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:27,670
images basically that's how simple you

00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:31,720
can query something using that module

00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:34,750
all you need to do when you request an

00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:37,270
author from the municipal object or the

00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:39,580
meta sip and client object giving it

00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:45,640
just the name you will get back an

00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:48,100
object of an offer which you can pull

00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:52,900
attributes out of as you can see it's

00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:56,350
not hash entries its attributes and you

00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:58,960
can see on the right hand how does look

00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:04,780
like if we just put this into a nice

00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:06,910
hash for display sorry that's the paws

00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:11,320
ID sorry if a simple fashion and author

00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:14,980
goes by positing but i'll show you in a

00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:18,960
complex way you can also request based

00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,960
on any other term

00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:28,250
if we take the same example into a bit

00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:30,350
more complicated the requirement we want

00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:34,090
to see for example how many authors we

00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:39,350
have per country then we can do this

00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:41,840
this query on authors but not by name or

00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:45,380
pose ID we can do it by for example the

00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:48,620
country term just selected a couple of

00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:53,420
them and here I'm not even producing the

00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:56,150
objects of every author because I don't

00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:58,340
need to it's lazily fetched from the

00:14:56,150 --> 00:15:01,040
result set and I'm only pulling the

00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:03,830
total from the results and so I this

00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,710
will run much faster than if we didn't

00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:08,270
do it this way and on the right hand of

00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:11,450
course you can see some numbers just

00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:13,700
through those countries same way I'm

00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:16,700
going to run quickly over it is a module

00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:19,910
again give it a module name you'll get

00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:22,070
back an object a distribution in this

00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:25,430
case I just chose to show the name and

00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:28,130
the bugs structure that comes out of the

00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:31,520
elastic search but there are more fields

00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:33,950
in there you can also request the raw

00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:38,330
data that comes if you really need the

00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:41,870
ask search output here's how we do some

00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:43,520
more complicated queries for example we

00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:47,300
want to see all the Dave's and David's

00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:50,540
in the in the author's database we can

00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:54,220
use wild card I'm sorry my finger we can

00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:58,070
use a wild card to do the complex query

00:15:54,220 --> 00:16:02,720
in this case we say either this or that

00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:05,420
and we show that totally we have 286

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,100
Dave's and David's this number by the

00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:09,380
way did not change then we start since

00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:11,660
we started working on this module so no

00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:15,680
additional days and David's in a few

00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:17,660
months and here I'm showing just the

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,270
overall total and just the names of the

00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:23,870
first ten that I could take out of the

00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:29,090
iteration just to show that you can pull

00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:33,140
it however you want if you filter in

00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:34,259
another way of adding some complexity to

00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:36,899
this query is

00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:40,109
saying okay we we want either day for

00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:44,009
David's but we also want a restriction

00:16:40,109 --> 00:16:46,709
for all of them to have a gmail in in

00:16:44,009 --> 00:16:48,600
the email in one of the email fields in

00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:52,049
the structure or that comes with the

00:16:48,600 --> 00:17:00,569
author module and this list contains

00:16:52,049 --> 00:17:03,869
only 17 in total and we also added a

00:17:00,569 --> 00:17:05,970
feature to do and not in the logic

00:17:03,869 --> 00:17:08,370
queries in this case I'm just taking out

00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:11,039
a few of them based on the first

00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:12,630
character the last name so just see the

00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:16,519
number the total number just goes down a

00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:21,569
little bit more interesting examples

00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:23,100
reverse dependencies this is how easy it

00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:25,019
is to do reverse dependencies you have

00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:27,750
just call the method rev depths or

00:17:25,019 --> 00:17:30,000
reverse dependencies the same on the

00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:32,669
module name you will get all the reverse

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:37,230
dependencies which will come back as a

00:17:32,669 --> 00:17:40,950
release object which you can pull a lot

00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:47,029
of stuff out of you can do a recursive

00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:53,429
one and this one I would yeah I can

00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:55,470
that's it one minute yeah this is the

00:17:53,429 --> 00:18:01,230
last example so we can do it in one

00:17:55,470 --> 00:18:03,450
minute we can go into basically just

00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:07,049
does the same thing we just wrap it with

00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:09,450
some recursive function and if you want

00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:11,460
to see everything that we'd be broken by

00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:14,820
your bug including the things that

00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:18,179
depend on those then you can call this

00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:22,950
method all those examples exist in our

00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:25,679
github examples tree you can also add

00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:30,090
your own if you find interesting ways of

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:32,210
using this module and basically commit

00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:32,210
them

00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:42,549
or anyone have any questions your

00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:56,049
yeah what steps can we take to replace

00:18:53,229 --> 00:19:11,409
the banner with medicine can I think

00:18:56,049 --> 00:19:13,989
talk to people about medicine the

00:19:11,409 --> 00:19:15,669
website of my to cpanel it hasn't you

00:19:13,989 --> 00:19:17,950
repeat the question it's okay

00:19:15,669 --> 00:19:23,049
documentation separate from the API for

00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:26,529
medicean client right go ahead yeah you

00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:29,549
can you can go follow the link API on

00:19:26,529 --> 00:19:39,129
the on the website and you will see it

00:19:29,549 --> 00:19:40,749
alright so thank you very much oh yeah

00:19:39,129 --> 00:19:45,779
so we'll put the slides in talk page

00:19:40,749 --> 00:19:45,779
