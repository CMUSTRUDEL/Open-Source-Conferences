are you introducing me rely on just a

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,660
second all right saved a couple words so

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:25,169
we are ready for day two of the

00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:28,230
lightning talks now yay first two

00:00:25,169 --> 00:00:30,240
quick announcements one if you've been

00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,680
worried about can I get to the slides of

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,350
any of the speakers even the Lightning

00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,540
speakers fret no more if you go to the

00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,160
website down the side with all the

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,680
navigation where it says talks

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,350
presentations and schedules there's now

00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:46,739
a proceedings link it will list every

00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:48,809
talk from the conference with the first

00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:51,710
bit of the description from the talk and

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:55,100
any URLs what they included for the

00:00:51,710 --> 00:01:03,570
abstract or the slides all in one place

00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:05,729
Thank You DOM and second to make the

00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,670
advertising work a little smoother than

00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:11,010
yesterday you will see two chairs up

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,950
front on this side and two up front on

00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,780
this side and from the front table

00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:17,850
wander up to those chairs and then when

00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,820
it's advertising time come up here and

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,770
if you are doing a regular talk you can

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:26,180
either use this microphone or the little

00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,180
one and we'll be good

00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:34,770
alright so microphone yourself in my on

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,560
all right kind of sounds like it all

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:40,560
right I'm Mike Conrad my talk is about

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,840
simplifying Perl scripts that you want

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,400
to run as a daemon under unix I'm here

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,770
with a public service announcement that

00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,750
there is a better way than the de facto

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,460
standard for anyone who isn't fully

00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,200
familiar with the problem here's a quick

00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,720
recap of what you do to write Damon

00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,030
under pearl alright so you you want to

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,410
if you want to run your perl script in

00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,240
the background and you want to if it

00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,950
dies you want to restart it you want to

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,720
be able to start and stop the service

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,000
with you know sensible command line

00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,590
commands you want to be able to take all

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,570
the status and error messages from the

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,300
program and log them and maybe just a

00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:13,920
slug so you do a little research and you

00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,200
find out that you do it this way you

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,240
redirect io to Devon all you write all

00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,860
of your logging to a file or to syslog

00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,130
and it's a pain to convert everything to

00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:25,140
syslog you for can you call set s ID to

00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:29,310
become a session leader and you write a

00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:30,750
pit file to someplace like / run or you

00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,340
know so that you know which process is

00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,959
officially your service you might also

00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:37,410
use it as a lock file to make sure only

00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,790
one copy is running oh wait if you are a

00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,530
session leader and you happen to open

00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:42,239
the TTYL you get a controlling terminal

00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,920
again which screws things up you can

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,020
solve that by forking again and calling

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,730
set PG ID oh and what if you can't write

00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,020
to run so maybe the pit file should be

00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:51,390
configurable so you can put it other

00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,920
places and what's this log arguments

00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:55,290
should be goes well make those

00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,940
configurable too but wait it's really

00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:59,040
hard to debug a program the daemon Isis

00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:01,050
so you need some no option to not

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,489
demonize alright so you've got all this

00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:05,010
extra configuration that you thrown in

00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:06,720
so now if it dies we want to restart it

00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:08,760
okay so this is what your code looks

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,820
like so now if it dies you want to

00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,500
restart it but how do we know do we

00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:16,560
check from cron periodically every

00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,480
minute you know those are bad solutions

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,400
also the pit file causes a race

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,400
condition because the pigs get recycled

00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,620
all right now you want to up and down

00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:30,540
the service so you're going to use the

00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,459
pit file again to kill and you know

00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,440
checking you know so it's all everything

00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:36,630
that you do based on the pit is race

00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,299
conditions and more race conditions so

00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:40,890
now you've come back and you want to you

00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:42,450
know do your logging so you wrote your

00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,060
script using syslog but what about

00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,860
except

00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,209
you know if you die you want to log that

00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:49,750
if you warn you probably want to log

00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:51,310
that and you want to see what about

00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,290
modules that print directly to standard

00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:55,120
error also maybe you can trap standard

00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:57,489
error and whatever and try to get them

00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,170
to syslog 20 what if something sends you

00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:00,580
a signal any when you die so maybe you

00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:03,670
should trap all the fatal signals so

00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:07,900
that you can log them and then die but

00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:10,050
you know then you call an excess method

00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:13,480
and something dies inside of a C library

00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:15,299
so all of your you know important

00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:19,239
diagnosis get flushed down Devin all

00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:20,979
also you can't traps sig kill so you're

00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:23,350
never going to have complete logging

00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:28,540
even if you go through great lengths to

00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:29,830
set it all up so how do we fix this so

00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,090
we're doing all of that stuff in our

00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:33,280
script already and it still isn't

00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:34,990
working the real problem is that

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,560
everything you did today in the nicer

00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:41,260
script is breaking the UNIX model so the

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:44,740
answer is to stick with the UNIX model a

00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:46,330
parent spawns a child process the parent

00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,130
can use the PIT to refer to the child

00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:49,600
without a race condition because the pit

00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:53,710
doesn't go away until the parent reaps

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,600
it every process gets input output and

00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,430
diagnostic streams immuno standard error

00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,310
the output and diagnostics of a daemon

00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:02,650
are the things you want to log so

00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:04,510
redirect it to a logger process which

00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:07,180
could write to syslog if you want it to

00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:08,740
so let's call parent a supervisor and

00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:12,760
let's call the child your service and

00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:14,139
tada you have process supervision so now

00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,389
look what happens when the child crashes

00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:18,250
the error message and even the one

00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:20,860
printed by a C library makes it to the

00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:22,690
logger the supervisor gets a signal

00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,280
telling it that the child died and can

00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:26,289
check the status so it knows if it got

00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:29,139
killed by sig kill so it can log that

00:05:26,289 --> 00:05:30,550
too now let's suppose the supervisor was

00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:32,620
holding on to the pipe that it had

00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:34,600
connected to the logger so the logger

00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,220
doesn't die and it can start your

00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,110
cleanup script connected to the same

00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:40,090
logger so you're logging also doesn't

00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:42,550
have any race conditions and then your

00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:45,250
cleanup script can exact back into the

00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:50,590
script resuming it and you're back where

00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:52,210
you were so the supervisor super oh yeah

00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:53,800
the supervisor also can listen to a

00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:55,390
eunuch socket in a known location and

00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,560
then you can control the supervisor and

00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:58,540
tell it to send

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,250
to your dæmon for you because it knows

00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:03,550
the pit so you don't need the pit file

00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:06,400
well too to recap your dæmon no longer

00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:08,620
needs to detach for corset SI d you no

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,389
longer need to write a pit file you no

00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:12,490
longer need to use syslog or provide any

00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:13,870
options to configure it all errors or

00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:15,639
log even sigkill then we're race

00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:18,250
conditions when managing the service and

00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:19,630
no pulling from crime alright so what

00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:22,300
tools do you have available there's

00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:24,820
daemon tools pioneer of the idea at

00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:27,070
least as I know it by a dan bernstein of

00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:28,960
q milf am you've got run it which is a

00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:31,000
successor on the same idea it's easier

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,639
to use its popular it's found in busybox

00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,639
it's a very very tiny you can link it

00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:38,919
statically you know a few k of ram

00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:40,690
there's perp and s6 which are also good

00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:43,030
tools they've got some real word rolled

00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:46,810
testing and I wrote my own Damon proxy

00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:48,190
which is designed to be scriptable so if

00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:50,410
you want to write your you know it's

00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:51,910
kind of an easy thing to write so if you

00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,930
get into that kind of bike shedding

00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:55,900
thing where you want it to be just

00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:58,930
particularly your way consider extending

00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:01,990
Damon proxy with the perl script to get

00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:04,630
the the supervision you want there's

00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:05,950
also upstart and system d but by

00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:07,510
comparison they're kind of bloated in

00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:10,479
complex and they expect to be run

00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:12,100
globally across the whole system and the

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,590
neat thing about run it is that you know

00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,970
you can run multiple hierarchies of them

00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:17,860
you they don't even need to run as root

00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:19,450
you could have one running as Apache and

00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:21,820
it could have all your web service you

00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:24,370
know stuff running underneath of it so

00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:27,940
in conclusion those are some links you

00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:30,280
should check out run it perp s6 my own

00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:33,039
Damon proxy and if you are losing log

00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:35,490
any which you should be there's an

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,490
adapter

00:07:42,349 --> 00:07:49,759
using my phone you're speaking to know

00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:49,759
it I left my friend up there you're fun

00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:55,439
need some bloggers it's been languishing

00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:57,599
for a few years since we've been trying

00:07:55,439 --> 00:08:00,599
to start for various reasons and I need

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:04,860
your help so anywhere from like 12 to

00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:07,500
say 365 blogs next year between now and

00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:10,919
next yapti would be great 12 is kind of

00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:13,110
my men 365 cymax please see me I have

00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:15,719
like four people that are committed so I

00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:17,939
need more if you need ideas I have

00:08:15,719 --> 00:08:26,009
plenty and I'm sure others do too thanks

00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:28,319
so much I just real quick tomorrow's the

00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:31,409
last day of the conference someone needs

00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,510
to do this if you're doing a talk go to

00:08:31,409 --> 00:08:35,459
the live stream during the talk and

00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:36,930
watch yourself do the talk so there can

00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:44,250
be on the screen and the Internet can

00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:47,070
explode so someone do this tomorrow my

00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:48,480
name is dana jake is this on good my

00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:51,600
name is Dana Jacobson and I'm going to

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,180
talk about math prime util so in early

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,180
2012 i was writing a module and i needed

00:08:54,180 --> 00:09:01,079
a lot of primes so i tried doing in perl

00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:03,839
it's pretty slow so hey there's a module

00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:06,930
math prime x s not fast enough for me

00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,269
too much memory David Oswald has a nice

00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:11,220
module called math prime fast sieve that

00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:12,480
he was working on it was really close I

00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,820
submitted a patch it's now a little

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,920
faster that probably was fast enough for

00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:19,490
my original purpose but hey this is

00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:22,769
pearl I want to do it myself it was fun

00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:25,370
so I released it in june two thousand

00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:28,290
twelve it's now on its 42nd release and

00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:31,649
now has the functionality of pretty much

00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:33,269
all of these modules and many others i'm

00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:36,240
obviously not going to talk about all

00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:38,399
these functions it now has some of the

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,410
design decisions i went through do I

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,089
want function-based do I wanted 00 based

00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:45,269
different modules due to different ways

00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:48,089
I chose functions I do have a prime

00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:50,160
iterator object input so I originally

00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:53,130
started well just do native integers is

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,140
simple but later I wanted begins in

00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:57,480
number theory bigint usually means a

00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:59,490
hundred digits a thousand digits ten

00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,300
thousand a hundred thousand so they're

00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:03,630
quite large

00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:05,790
I can use math big int very portable but

00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:07,830
it's also very slow so I ended up

00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:10,560
writing math prime util GMP which is a

00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:12,360
back-end math priming till just finds it

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,240
if you have it installed and now you get

00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:17,490
very fast begin support many modules are

00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:21,390
one module for better or worse I chose

00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:23,700
one kind of like math parere it has

00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:25,610
everything it's very simple on the other

00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:28,020
hand there's some bad things with it

00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:30,840
input validation this was important to

00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:32,340
me this is usually caused by user error

00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:35,010
and they'd like to know instead of just

00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:36,510
getting the wrong answer and one of the

00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:38,400
things i found calling overhead can

00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:40,920
dominate all the time just calling that

00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:44,280
pearl subroutine ends up costing more

00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:47,850
than asking hey is this 128-bit number

00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:50,430
prime so load and call pearl only when

00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:52,230
necessary everything stays and see as

00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:53,490
long as possible there actually is an

00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:55,050
environment variable you can completely

00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:56,700
disable all the excess code and

00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:58,830
everything runs in pure pearl if you

00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,570
really want to and portability was very

00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:02,370
important to me this is a library not an

00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:04,410
application I'm running on just one

00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:07,170
computer so I'd like to support

00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:09,960
everything I possibly can this is really

00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:12,390
painful especially for Pearl 5.6 point

00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:14,610
to which loves to turn 64-bit numbers

00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:17,040
into doubles which just lost a bunch of

00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:21,060
precision on the end and then you get

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,830
very wrong answers applications simple

00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,840
applications like just hey is this

00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:27,060
number prime I want a list of primes I

00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:30,060
want to factor this large number simple

00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:32,870
tasks we can use it for lots of stuff on

00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:35,580
rosetta code or project euler OE is

00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:38,340
number theory record prime gaps or

00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:41,520
primality proofs and one of the things I

00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:42,990
often do in developing is use it versus

00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:45,210
other packages that might do something

00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:47,610
similar usually this lines bugs in my

00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:50,700
development code sometimes it finds bugs

00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:53,580
in other code crypt primes will return

00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:56,790
composites sometimes flinton sage we

00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:59,070
just found this last month there any as

00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:01,800
prime function will return true for

00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:03,660
composites sometimes they just did an

00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,150
emergency patch and bound it with this

00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:08,280
perl module mouth paari can return true

00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:11,100
for composites because it's using an old

00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,630
version of party perl 6 and simp I have

00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,820
a very

00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:16,310
issue there are known counter-examples

00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:19,820
to it's in prime is prime and sometimes

00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:23,300
it can be slow and cryptography which is

00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:25,220
big application lots of cryptography

00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:28,520
modules have been written over the last

00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:30,500
ten something years use math paari this

00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,840
is a problem because math para uses very

00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:35,420
old version of the actual math library

00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:37,510
and it doesn't work all on 64-bit

00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:39,890
windows so we'd like some alternative

00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:42,020
the crypt random module you can use

00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:44,570
bites random secure or plenty of other

00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:47,240
alternatives crypt primes math prime

00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:50,390
util has every feature crypt ron's has

00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:52,400
crypt RSA so I wrote alt crypt RSA

00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:54,980
bigint which is a drop-in replacement

00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:59,090
and that fixes all the open defects I

00:12:54,980 --> 00:13:01,130
know of DSA i wrote crypt DSA GMP

00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:04,820
again using this tool it had everything

00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:06,470
I needed this is 20 open defects but it

00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:09,050
does require GMP / from pawn for

00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:11,780
performance the good news is after that

00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:14,720
it's faster I think this is a pearl

00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:16,640
success story it is the fastest open

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,500
source prime count and then Prime you

00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:22,010
look at prime C yeah foo or any of these

00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:23,660
other open source tools this is millions

00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:25,210
of times faster because you can do prime

00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:27,980
counting better than generating primes

00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:30,260
it is the fastest 64-bit prime ality

00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:33,020
testing and you can do random and proven

00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:36,710
crimes with it if you install math prime

00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:39,470
util GMP we can generate proofs 420 bit

00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:41,780
numbers in milliseconds fastest big

00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:44,620
improbable prime test up to about 10,000

00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:48,740
digits open PF GW is faster past that

00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:50,740
open source aks and ec PP millions of

00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:53,390
times faster than the alternatives and

00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:54,860
I've been using this for the last seven

00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:57,590
months with a little script to do record

00:13:54,860 --> 00:14:00,350
Prime gaps it's now found twenty percent

00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:03,400
of all the current record gaps

00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:03,400
thank you very much

00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:18,170
evening my name is sean i am from

00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:22,250
endurance international also known as

00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:24,230
hostgator bluehost dr. domain.com and we

00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:26,390
are hiring the table right over the eggs

00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:28,880
the lovely Nicole if you want details

00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:32,990
you want a card you want our flyer we

00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:37,820
have offices in Vancouver Utah Texas

00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:39,530
both in houston and austin and in Boston

00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,450
so there's lots of different options and

00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:42,800
locations that you could live and work

00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:46,270
out with us again if you want more

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,270
information speak to Nicole

do that come on line Brian I'm from

00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:11,940
sites of X i'm indy kindling oh hey well

00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,950
he was all loud before so i might as

00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:15,420
well kabhi suit now anyway I'm Brian I'm

00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:16,770
from Boston I work for a company called

00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:18,420
site spec we're multi very website

00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:20,130
company unlike the vast majority which

00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,630
use JavaScript we actually do everything

00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:23,160
in a pearl back end so we can do regular

00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,660
expressions on HTML to do all your

00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,030
testing and modifications really cool

00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:28,560
we're hiring so if you want to get a job

00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:43,140
in Boston come talk to me you find me

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:45,900
thank you 12 months ago we were in

00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:50,850
austin texas and at that time i told you

00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:54,210
that opportunities abound opportunities

00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:56,160
abound for you to contribute to the

00:15:54,210 --> 00:16:00,210
pearl community the pearl five core

00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:03,060
distribution and CPM today a new

00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:07,950
opportunity one which i only found for

00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:10,970
myself in the past four months test a

00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:14,220
cpn module against the pearl thigh bleed

00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:18,120
now many of you may not know what is the

00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:21,210
pro/5 bleed it is the head of the

00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:24,180
principal branch of pro 5 in an hour

00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:28,740
gift distribution it is the so-called

00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:31,620
bleeding edge of / 05 development most

00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:33,930
of our new ideas for pro 5 are developed

00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:36,490
in branches and their discussed on the

00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:38,950
pro/5 porters mailing list

00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:41,220
and they only make it into bleed when

00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:45,100
they have been well discussed and tested

00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:49,959
bleed should pass all its tests every

00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:52,029
time however even if lead pit passes all

00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:55,089
the tests in the Pearl five core test

00:16:52,029 --> 00:16:57,070
suite we still can't test it against the

00:16:55,089 --> 00:17:01,060
production code that you write every day

00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:04,020
the so-called dark pan however we can

00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:06,429
test it against the 32,000 plus

00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:11,290
distributions that we have on the seat

00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:15,010
pan and we want to preserve pepper to

00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:20,829
the compatibility except where we can so

00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:23,920
what do we do we rely as always on

00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:26,410
volunteers particularly I would cite

00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:30,280
andreea skurnik and slaven desert who

00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:32,800
test cpn module dilute scen modules on a

00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:36,000
regular basis against the head of the

00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:40,840
profile distribution against bleed and

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,910
they filed bug reports to the RT probe

00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:45,820
org and they're reproduced on the pro/5

00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:48,190
Porter's mailing list when they produce

00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:51,010
that report we have to ask ourselves is

00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:53,309
that a problem in the pro/5 bleed is

00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:57,790
that a problem that we have introduced

00:17:53,309 --> 00:18:00,010
perhaps the cpn modules of test failure

00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:04,030
was something that we didn't previously

00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:05,440
test in our own test suite on the other

00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:08,470
hand it could be a problem with the

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,720
Sipan module perhaps it was using dicey

00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:14,230
code which we now believe to be

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:18,030
deprecated or forbidden or unsound this

00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:18,030
frequently happens with excess code

00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:23,560
was the cpn module playing with the pro

00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:26,500
hide guts in a way that we now realize

00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:28,540
our suspect but most simply most

00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:31,090
fundamentally can the test failure

00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:34,420
reported by sea pen testers like andreas

00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:38,800
and slaven be reproduced for eps it's

00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:41,110
only at found on one platform so we or

00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:44,340
at least I wanted a lightweight way of

00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:47,470
testing CN modules against bleed

00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:49,600
fortunately one already existed one of

00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:52,360
our principal / 05 Porter contributors

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,310
is Carl Williamson and he had this shell

00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,780
script that was lying in one of in his

00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:58,690
home directory on the dromedary

00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:00,730
development server when I asked him

00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:03,310
about this he said well no really it

00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:05,200
came from Florian drag West yes I asked

00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:08,230
Lauren velvets if you voted he said he

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:12,690
might have so maybe it's Florian's maybe

00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:12,690
it's Karl's maybe it's just pearl lure

00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:20,280
in any case this shell script built

00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:24,280
installs a local copy of pro 5 bleed

00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:26,980
then it uses see pot cpn-m one of

00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:29,770
everybody's now favorite modules to

00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:33,250
download a cpn module and test it

00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:35,050
against that newly installed pearl it

00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:38,260
enables you to confirm a test failure

00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:39,850
report into debugger the problem was I

00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:42,790
could only use it on the dromedary

00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:45,670
server I wanted to test modules against

00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:49,540
bleed on this laptop and on platforms

00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:51,310
other than linux x86 64 and most

00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:54,580
importantly we want other people like

00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:56,620
you to test your modules your CPM

00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:59,140
modules your production modules against

00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:01,300
glee and some day I was sitting in the

00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:03,190
heck amount of room over there I had an

00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:06,700
aha moment I figured out how to do it I

00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:08,020
put the solution up on github I probably

00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:11,920
won't have time in this talk to Gemma

00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:14,530
lip but I want you to to check it out

00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:16,420
because it needs feedback from you it's

00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:17,030
very much alpha code it's a shell script

00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:19,520
and I'm not

00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:23,330
shelf programmer it's ready for code

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:26,630
review as we say and if you have code

00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:29,180
that you want to work in the future in

00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:30,770
future versions of Perl 5 then you

00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:32,840
should check this out or you should do

00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:36,440
something like this you should help to

00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:39,830
future-proof your own code particularly

00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:43,910
if it involves access code you can test

00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:47,050
it against bleed yourself and that's

00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:47,050
where you can find it thank

00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:00,769
just like the follow up with a quick

00:20:58,489 --> 00:21:03,619
plug for the log go uncle in any module

00:21:00,769 --> 00:21:05,539
if you have a perl module and you would

00:21:03,619 --> 00:21:07,789
like it to you know maybe it has some

00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:10,190
interesting things that dick they like

00:21:07,789 --> 00:21:12,379
the log the module doesn't do anything

00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:15,259
until the person using the module

00:21:12,379 --> 00:21:16,460
installs an adapter to send the logging

00:21:15,259 --> 00:21:23,090
information somewhere it's a great

00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:25,759
module check it out hi my name is Alan

00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:28,489
I'm from Seattle Seattle is home of Jimi

00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:31,129
Hendrix and Pearl Jam and Nirvana but

00:21:28,489 --> 00:21:33,649
not home to a perl mongers group that i

00:21:31,129 --> 00:21:36,980
know of it as active if you are from CL

00:21:33,649 --> 00:21:39,559
come see me sometime if i don't scare

00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:42,279
you i hope and i would love to get that

00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:42,279
community going

00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:53,210
hey everyone my name is I'm your ass and

00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:54,830
I'm a software engineer in the

00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,930
international team at shutterstock and

00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:58,130
today I'm going to talk about

00:21:55,930 --> 00:22:01,220
internationalization and localization at

00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:02,510
10,000 feet and the goals for my talk

00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,680
are just addicted to think about

00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:06,200
internationalization and localization

00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:10,090
and to highlight some of the challenges

00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:12,620
of internationalizing so why

00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:15,980
internationalize number one it's because

00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:17,960
you can't not if you have an app or a

00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:20,000
website or product you'll find out

00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:22,820
sooner rather than later but you're

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,960
going to have a non-english user and/or

00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:28,370
a non-us person who wants to use your

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,920
product and you're going to want them to

00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:32,870
use it right and you're also want to go

00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:35,720
to capture that huge chunk of market

00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:37,490
that you might be missing out on um just

00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,920
remember that English is only the third

00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:45,860
most common language next to Mandarin

00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:47,840
and Spanish and lastly because it's fun

00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:51,440
to find out about the rest of the world

00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:53,990
and how they how different they are from

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,450
ours now let me talk about some of the

00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:59,450
challenges of internationalizing number

00:22:56,450 --> 00:23:02,390
one most of us don't speak 20 or even 10

00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:04,220
languages and that just means that we're

00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:06,530
not going to know every intricacy of

00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:10,040
every language right we're going to need

00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:12,350
some translators to help us translate

00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:14,360
some of our site and you're going to

00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:16,640
need some research to better understand

00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:21,019
your market and in the locale that you

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:23,700
want to target

00:23:21,019 --> 00:23:26,099
second most translators are not software

00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,959
engineers and that means that they're

00:23:26,099 --> 00:23:30,269
not going to be able to implement the

00:23:27,959 --> 00:23:32,190
the subtleties of a language and we're

00:23:30,269 --> 00:23:34,889
going to need tools to help to help

00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:36,570
bridge that gap which goes to my third

00:23:34,889 --> 00:23:38,969
point there's a big disconnect with my

00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:40,169
developers and translators so you're

00:23:38,969 --> 00:23:45,269
going to need tools to help bridge that

00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:47,009
gap and next we don't have

00:23:45,269 --> 00:23:50,159
internationalization and localization at

00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:52,200
top of mine that means you might develop

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,570
something and then realize later on that

00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,889
oh I need to internationalize this and

00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:58,409
then you go back to your drawing board

00:23:55,889 --> 00:24:01,499
and we architecture it is so that you

00:23:58,409 --> 00:24:04,739
can localize your product when when you

00:24:01,499 --> 00:24:07,139
realize that you want to do it so next

00:24:04,739 --> 00:24:09,389
is that language is very so let me go

00:24:07,139 --> 00:24:13,139
into this a little bit language is very

00:24:09,389 --> 00:24:15,179
in all of these right so for plurals in

00:24:13,139 --> 00:24:17,249
English there's only one form of plural

00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:19,259
but in Russian there's many different

00:24:17,249 --> 00:24:22,079
forms of course as you can see here in

00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:24,450
numbers na + 1 or 2 3 4 and so on and so

00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:26,129
forth and that's difficult to implement

00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:27,450
and you might want to audit your site

00:24:26,129 --> 00:24:29,909
for where you might want to implement

00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:32,429
this actually stock for instance there's

00:24:29,909 --> 00:24:34,559
this where you have three months 10

00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:37,229
downloads but it could be in a more

00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:39,450
prominent a page like our log down home

00:24:37,229 --> 00:24:42,509
page where we have the number of images

00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:46,820
on our site and that will change

00:24:42,509 --> 00:24:49,919
depending on our what we've collected

00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:52,499
language is very also in gender and it

00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:55,049
depends on context and translators may

00:24:52,499 --> 00:24:58,229
not always have that context also

00:24:55,049 --> 00:25:00,659
machine translations are imperfect an

00:24:58,229 --> 00:25:02,190
example here for Google Translate

00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:04,469
there's a chance stanford university

00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:06,779
research that finds that google source

00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:08,399
of database causes statistical bias

00:25:06,779 --> 00:25:10,709
toward male nouns and verbs in

00:25:08,399 --> 00:25:12,779
translation so for instance for gender

00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:14,969
neutral words like the or professor

00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:17,609
doctor they tend to be translated in

00:25:14,969 --> 00:25:19,979
mail forms which may not always be right

00:25:17,609 --> 00:25:22,139
so when I which is also very encouraged

00:25:19,979 --> 00:25:24,269
as you can see here it's displayed

00:25:22,139 --> 00:25:26,370
differently in English in US and it

00:25:24,269 --> 00:25:29,970
could be based on locale or language

00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:32,610
and it differs in Germany and German or

00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:33,840
German in Austria and I'm going to

00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:36,030
breeze through here because I know

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,110
you've seen these before phone numbers

00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:40,050
are displayed differently in different

00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:42,960
locales as you can see here dates are

00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:44,550
displayed differently and ranges my

00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,680
example here is just a date range but

00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:49,500
this could really be any range number

00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:50,970
range page numbers or what not another

00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:53,670
challenge is that designing for user

00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:56,130
interface that's easily localizable can

00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:57,690
be very challenging here's an example of

00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:59,070
an on-off switch in English is fine

00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:00,990
they're short words but once you

00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:03,300
translate that in Spanish for example it

00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:06,390
gets long and it may even break your UI

00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:08,520
so what's what's a solution if question

00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:10,290
maybe can use images or icons well it

00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:12,720
depends because they can have different

00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:16,200
meanings this may be cool here the US

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,580
but probably not in the UK and people

00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,290
confuse where someone lives in language

00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:21,150
to use we used to have this drop-down we

00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:23,040
have the flag in the language next to it

00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:24,750
but that language may not necessarily be

00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,309
only spoken in the country that

00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,510
represents so you have to be careful

00:26:26,309 --> 00:26:29,850
about that because that could be

00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:33,210
offensive in some cases so just to

00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:34,559
summarize this country our location does

00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:36,870
not equal language you need to develop

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,670
flexible interfaces for localization and

00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:40,770
sometimes this challenge should be on

00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:42,990
translation and sometimes on design and

00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:45,690
we can all develop an eye for possible

00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:47,720
localization issues and the world thanks

00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:47,720
you

00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:06,370
so hi I'm one of the conference

00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:08,470
organizers and I just wanted to remind

00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:10,600
speakers and this includes all you

00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:13,920
lovely lightning talk speakers please

00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:15,820
upload your talk slides I see from the

00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,080
administrative emails that I get that a

00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:19,690
lot of people are doing it and that's

00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:29,860
great but all the rest of you get on it

00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:31,780
Thanks I just want to take a moment to

00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:33,850
run everybody one of our favorite pearl

00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:35,440
authors tattooing miyagawa me a ghoul

00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:36,700
couldn't be here and I thought it'd be

00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,760
nice if everyone who has a twitter

00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:42,520
account could just tweet him the word yo

00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,550
I know he'd really appreciate it thank

00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,550
you

00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:56,170
one

00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:02,890
peers of the amount

00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:12,710
it's a new topic so um if you've enjoyed

00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:14,690
your time here and it's your like your

00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:17,480
first pearl conference or it's like your

00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:19,279
10th through 27th or whatever hey it's

00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,639
awesome to have workshops I've kind of

00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:24,110
hosted a few I've done a few events

00:28:21,639 --> 00:28:25,700
while the rest of Yap see is happening

00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:27,730
if you want to talk to an organizer and

00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:30,830
figure out how you can do it yourself

00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:31,940
that would be awesome like Seattle I'd

00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:36,859
love to go to Seattle and have a

00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:38,480
workshop I'll come anyway it's not as

00:28:36,859 --> 00:28:39,919
bad as you think and for the cost of

00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,950
your corporate training you can often

00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:45,440
host a workshop not a gap see but but a

00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:47,509
workshop a few thousand bucks can make a

00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:56,629
pretty awesome event anyway something to

00:28:47,509 --> 00:28:58,609
think about and thanks what John means

00:28:56,629 --> 00:29:00,710
when he says upload your slides is go

00:28:58,609 --> 00:29:03,230
back to act where you where you

00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:05,539
submitted your talk login click edit

00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:07,850
your talk there's two there's two fields

00:29:05,539 --> 00:29:10,009
in their abstract link and presentation

00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:12,169
link put your put a link to your slides

00:29:10,009 --> 00:29:14,889
in presentation link and save it in the

00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:14,889
world will thank you

00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:31,240
time borrow your back up why can't get

00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:33,630
up in a second first the universe then

00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,630
come back

00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:08,750
sweet

00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:48,220
hello awesome okay hello I'm I'm gonna

00:30:43,179 --> 00:30:51,340
tell you all about it I'm gonna tell you

00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:53,799
all about Bridget Cindy Bachman um and

00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:56,289
as anyone that have you ever had a

00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:58,750
production co server that at some

00:30:56,289 --> 00:31:05,950
unexpected moment sexual that without

00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:08,710
saying Awards everyone right right how

00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:11,230
how nice would be if instead of being

00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:13,750
silenced it would actively actually tell

00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:18,610
you it has sac folders and is that sack

00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:22,480
volunteer something like this

00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:24,429
this is a well and then from it it says

00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,760
that sexual and it will give you a sea

00:31:24,429 --> 00:31:30,549
stack trace not just that but if you

00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:33,549
read it you can see that it's a quilt

00:31:30,549 --> 00:31:37,360
inside pearl and it's been even tell you

00:31:33,549 --> 00:31:41,500
that it was a cold inside unpack so

00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:44,320
instead of instead of knowing nothing

00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:47,110
other than your daemon is suddenly gone

00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:49,929
you actually know I hit a bug and it is

00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:51,549
here how fixing it of course still

00:31:49,929 --> 00:31:53,410
required probably still required see

00:31:51,549 --> 00:31:57,330
programmer but at least you have a good

00:31:53,410 --> 00:32:00,880
idea where it is so where this come from

00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:06,070
well this comes from a tiny module of

00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:08,620
mine called CC SD it's it's animal it

00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:11,020
stands for sea stack trace it's in it's

00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:13,090
a tiny debugger that requires no

00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:15,280
external dependencies and because of

00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:18,940
that essentially having no overtime

00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:22,179
costs and currently only works on linux

00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:26,049
but i'm working on fixing that and

00:32:22,179 --> 00:32:30,340
making it work on OS x and b SZ I just

00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:34,210
haven't gotten around to that yet so

00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:38,010
what so how does it work well

00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:38,010
essentially it's a sec goldhandler

00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:43,610
it reads the contact folds and in a few

00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:46,100
similar other similar tools it reads the

00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:48,050
symbol it printed out standard error and

00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:49,910
then really raises the signal so that

00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:55,370
your process will die as it should on

00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:57,950
the SEC bolt the most fun part of this

00:32:55,370 --> 00:33:00,740
module was writing the test so I'm gonna

00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:03,760
entertain you with a few examples for

00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:09,350
example this here is it in this example

00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:12,380
back out elkwood L ! is creating a null

00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:15,560
pointer and unpack is the referencing

00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:23,110
the null pointer impure pearl check

00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:23,110
fault um this is another great example

00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:28,820
here you have an attic endler that

00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:30,440
requires a module so if you require

00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:32,420
something that will require the same

00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:36,500
thing that we require the same thing etc

00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:40,430
etc etc etc and this will eventually

00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:42,650
generate a stack overflow this is one of

00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:45,170
the fun things in the module because I

00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:47,420
actually have to run a piece of code

00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:50,650
during a stack overflow when I'm not

00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:50,650
having a stack anymore

00:33:53,040 --> 00:34:03,850
lastly this one was also wonderful the

00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:09,220
this whole this also set folds because

00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:13,090
it's a hangout returns grammars to do

00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:16,109
that yes well the fun thing about this

00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:19,119
example is that its axles during that

00:34:16,109 --> 00:34:25,510
compile time optimization base instead

00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:38,530
of run time so you can even do that that

00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:40,659
was all thank you so my talk is entitled

00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:43,080
don't bring a windows laptop to a pearl

00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:43,080
conference

00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:49,700
is no one else hiring

00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:09,390
does anybody here tried to use the Wi-Fi

00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:12,120
in the hotel was it fast and reliable if

00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:14,010
you're staying in the hotel on your

00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:16,770
pillow they left a little card that says

00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:19,110
you're parting thoughts so that's idea

00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:20,520
number one ID number two please raise

00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:23,010
your hand if you have already contacted

00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:25,890
the Federal Communications Commission to

00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:33,030
support net neutrality we got a round of

00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:35,130
applause for these people and if you

00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:37,080
have not already done so please reach

00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:38,400
out find somebody who has if you live in

00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,930
the United States you've been still

00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:48,600
comment on it will be happy to help you

00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:51,360
with that thank you alright so Apache 13

00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:53,880
released in the late 90s 1998 is when I

00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:55,770
came out of beta 16 years old I'm still

00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:57,810
using it don't be like me but if you are

00:35:55,770 --> 00:36:00,420
and some people are this is what you do

00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:02,670
now modern browsers will do a lot of

00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:05,100
weird things advanced caching DNS pre

00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:07,770
connect our DNS prefetching and then

00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:10,110
HTTP pre connect which is where they

00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:11,760
connect to your site before the views

00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:13,890
are even goes there you know if they're

00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,300
typing or if they're already on the site

00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:17,610
before they click the next link it'll

00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:20,130
start connecting to get them a

00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:21,900
connection sooner and of course if

00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:25,140
you're using apache 13 with mod perl

00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:26,940
like i am don't do that then you use a

00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:29,220
lot of memory and even if you use tricks

00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:30,870
like loading all of your modules before

00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,980
you fork you can still use a lot of

00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:33,240
memory if you're actually doing

00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:34,950
something with with pro if you've

00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,990
actually got a web it behind that then

00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:39,120
you're limited so we you know we run 10

00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:41,100
model Apaches if we run more than that

00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:43,440
we'll start swapping rather than buying

00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:46,440
more memory we can write perl script so

00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:48,450
what happens is even a single browser

00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,280
can go ahead and just open up a

00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:52,380
ridiculous number of pre connections at

00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:54,840
least four sometimes eight or more and

00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:57,540
so a single browser can basically take

00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:59,190
down your whole site everybody's are

00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:01,400
connected to it if you're one of the

00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:03,150
lucky people with chrome who have

00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,470
connection then you can click through

00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:07,050
and keep using the site everybody else

00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:09,210
the the site's down its its denial

00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:11,180
service attack so how do you fix that

00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:13,790
while you start killing processes

00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:15,109
and of course you can do that by hand PS

00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:16,730
you know if you're lucky enough to have

00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:18,980
a server status page you can you can

00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:22,130
look at that what you know you can also

00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:25,309
write a Perl script which is what I've

00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:26,599
done and if so if chrome is connected

00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:28,990
and it's just there for four seconds

00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:31,490
without do anything that I kill it so

00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:42,079
it's less than two minutes of talking so

00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:45,920
I'm going to show you some quick code so

00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:48,380
we found a bug on this right chrome devs

00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:50,750
stop reconnecting so much they're like

00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:54,290
okay stop using apache 13 i'll create a

00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:55,760
speedy HTTP to all right you know maybe

00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:57,650
not what about embedded systems what

00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:01,339
about systems that you know can't do

00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:04,849
that so so I put I put the link to this

00:38:01,339 --> 00:38:06,319
on that a chrome page and I got feedback

00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:09,369
people are actually using this

00:38:06,319 --> 00:38:09,369
ridiculous script that I wrote

00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:16,020
so just to show you up the thing I want

00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:24,990
to show off mainly is my my reg ex look

00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:26,550
at that beautiful regex come on it

00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:36,350
doesn't get any better than that as long

00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:39,510
as it works yeah exactly the /x yeah so

00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:41,610
grab grab the data parse it and then

00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:42,930
start killing things and again this is

00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:49,470
horrible horrible Code don't do this

00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:51,180
what am I doing here what is this don't

00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:53,640
do that but it's paul it works as long

00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:56,160
as nobody figures out a way to to get

00:38:53,640 --> 00:39:02,660
that as an attack vector should be

00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:04,650
alright right so yeah so so there we go

00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:05,730
so yeah if you can figure out a way to

00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:09,540
own my site go ahead and do that

00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:11,940
otherwise have fun and so chrome devs

00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:13,350
who what are they thinking they're

00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:16,250
breaking the friggin internet I tell you

00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:19,340
what HTTP two it's a month's monstrosity

00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:33,440
geez anyway

00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:35,860
that's all I have hi my name is Brendan

00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:39,260
bird and I live in Louisville Kentucky

00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:41,870
right now Kentucky Louisville Lexington

00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:44,960
none of the state has any perl mongers

00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:47,360
groups so I'm planning on starting

00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:51,470
either a statewide mailing list or a

00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:53,960
louisville-based promo guru group if you

00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:56,240
guys are interested please contact me

00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:59,320
you can't just you know see me after the

00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:12,590
conference or email me at be bird at

00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:14,690
Sipan org thank you alright so step for

00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:17,690
it is this thing I wrote for work in I'm

00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:20,450
going to tell you about it so it's kind

00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:22,460
of like make and rank and cake and about

00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:26,180
10 million other tools now there's 10

00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:28,100
million won so like all those tools you

00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:31,040
have declarative dependencies for

00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:32,660
different operations so you can say to

00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,250
build this file first I'm going to build

00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:35,570
these other three files to build each of

00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:38,750
these three files they need to have this

00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:41,420
database or whatever so then you ask for

00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:43,970
a final outcome again much like make an

00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:46,280
Drake you say okay step 4 go ahead and

00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:48,830
don't meet this file and what it does is

00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:50,690
it calculates the dependencies in the

00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:52,580
dependencies of the dependencies and so

00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:55,000
and figures out all the steps needed to

00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:58,640
get to the thing that you asked for and

00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,590
individual steps can have a last one

00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,570
time again much like make so you can say

00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:05,140
okay it's just going to skip it if it's

00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:08,240
up to date compared to its dependencies

00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:10,850
it's also totally unlike make and raking

00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:12,890
cake and all that stuff because with

00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:15,050
separate each step is a unique pearl

00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:17,780
class and the dependencies are

00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:19,790
attributes for the class this is all

00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:21,920
using mousse and the production's are

00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:24,260
also class attributes so there's no DSL

00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,330
I'm not a huge fan of dsls and for the

00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:27,250
particular task we need it at work it

00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:29,080
wasn't really a good

00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:30,490
it actually I shouldn't really say I'm

00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:32,970
not a fan of dsl's they're great when

00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:35,470
they're appropriate for this it wasn't

00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:37,990
so here's how you run Stepford you make

00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:40,270
a planner object you tell it what step

00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:42,160
namespaces you have it fun so all your

00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:44,380
steps are located under my step prefix

00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,880
in this example you can have a logger it

00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:47,980
can run in parallel so you can give it a

00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:51,240
number of jobs then you say planner run

00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:53,650
these final steps and you can pass it a

00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:55,450
optional hash of config that will get

00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:57,790
passed to the step objects when they're

00:41:55,450 --> 00:42:00,280
being constructed and it figures out how

00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:01,750
to get to those final steps you can have

00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:05,470
more than one final step at once and

00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:07,150
then it goes ahead runs it so as I

00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:09,400
mentioned dependencies and productions

00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:12,400
they're just regular most attributes in

00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:13,860
your class you give them a trait to

00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:17,350
declare that their dependency or

00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:19,150
production can be any type of data but

00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:21,850
it should be serializable for the sake

00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:23,620
of parallel runs and the dependency

00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:25,270
resolution is just based on matching up

00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:27,430
attribute names so something has a

00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:30,750
dependency foo it looks for another

00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:33,070
class that has a production name foo

00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:34,690
step classes can have productions they

00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:37,090
can have dependencies they can have both

00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:39,700
a class can have multiple productions

00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:41,680
that's totally seen and all step classes

00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:45,550
have to consume this one of these two

00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:47,820
roles so step classes themselves just to

00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:50,260
find a run method and a last run time

00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:52,870
the file generator role if you use that

00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:55,030
rides last run time for you by looking

00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:56,560
at the files that you generated and you

00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:59,110
want to do all the heavy lifting in the

00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:00,820
run method not in builders even though

00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:03,220
you might be tempted to do that but if

00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:05,620
you do all the heavy lifting in builders

00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:08,200
then skipping a step when its last run

00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:10,540
type is up to date will be useless so

00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:12,850
here's a very simple step class so it

00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:15,040
has a single dependency it's the output

00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:16,690
derp it has a single production which is

00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:19,900
the data file its going to stick in that

00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:21,700
output dirt and then when we call run it

00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:24,040
writes to that file very simple very

00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:25,420
useless but of course that's all that

00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:27,460
would fit on the slide if you want to do

00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:28,810
something useful don't do it in these

00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:32,230
slides

00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:34,120
duh so the when you create the planner

00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:35,680
loads all your step classes it doesn't

00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:38,380
actually do anything with them till you

00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:40,570
call run I'm not going to go all through

00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:44,200
this because I made this for a time when

00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:45,660
I had more than five minutes so when we

00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:48,250
call run it does a whole bunch of stuff

00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:50,320
calculates the dependency tree throws

00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:51,610
errors if your dependencies don't make

00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:54,370
any sense like they're circular or

00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:57,010
whatever comes up with plan runs the

00:43:54,370 --> 00:44:00,010
plan creates a bob jects and then poof

00:43:57,010 --> 00:44:01,540
you're done all right so I'm all done

00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:04,390
you can find this on Sipan we're

00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:07,420
actually using it at work at my work in

00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:09,730
production which is a bit terrifying I

00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:12,160
think it might be really useful for some

00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:14,020
folks out there if you ever needed a

00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,760
build tool of some sort and you were

00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:19,120
like if only i could write all the build

00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:21,340
steps in Perl code which it for some use

00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:22,780
cases is fabulously useful then this

00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:24,610
might be a great tool for you i'd love

00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:26,860
to have other people take a look and

00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:28,240
give me feedback and send patches and

00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:30,960
maybe just tell me how i did it wrong

00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,960
thanks very much

00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:45,660
everyone stop hugging me so not just me

00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:47,310
ago but also a Steven little couldn't be

00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:48,780
here today we all want him to be here

00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:55,230
today and yesterday and tomorrow and

00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:57,200
always and so before Force T for Steven

00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:59,850
sake I would like you to find something

00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:01,680
in the ops ii or in your experience here

00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:04,830
that you're not having fun with and

00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:08,900
please blame Steven for that okay damn

00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:08,900
it Steven thank you

00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:22,119
hey i'm david farrell brian foy couldn't

00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:25,150
be hit for this yap see but he did give

00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:26,830
me some extra pal nerd merit badges so

00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:29,140
we've got some for the lightning talk

00:45:26,830 --> 00:45:31,690
speakers already and I've got about 25

00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:34,060
left over so what I thought we could do

00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:37,890
is I could just hand them out now and if

00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:37,890
you want one take one if not pass it on

00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:58,330
you ready all right hi I'm this guy over

00:45:57,010 --> 00:46:01,000
the last five years I've taught myself

00:45:58,330 --> 00:46:03,609
how to read speak and write Japanese and

00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:08,080
I will teach you in five minutes how did

00:46:03,609 --> 00:46:10,119
you do the same in five minutes so I

00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:11,859
know what some of your thinking this guy

00:46:10,119 --> 00:46:14,230
who is he what does he know about

00:46:11,859 --> 00:46:19,270
Japanese well I beat nethack in Japanese

00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:21,400
so you no respect I've also given talks

00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:24,820
in Japanese this is actually my first

00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:29,170
lightning talk in English I talked about

00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:31,540
in line C which is an amazing module I'm

00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:33,070
also published in Japanese I wrote an

00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:36,250
article about mooses metal object

00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:39,510
protocol in Japanese for a programming

00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:43,750
magazine magazine called web DB press so

00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:45,130
maybe I know what I'm talking about how

00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:46,480
are you going to learn Japanese so

00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:48,760
here's the first rule you want to have

00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:51,760
fun it's probably a good rule in general

00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:54,460
to live by but it applies particularly

00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:55,750
strongly to language learning but that's

00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:57,369
not all right because you're having fun

00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:59,890
now you're not learning Japanese so

00:46:57,369 --> 00:47:04,720
what's the catch you have to have fun in

00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:06,970
Japanese so first of all our mrf all

00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:10,030
your English music no more english mp3

00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:12,580
is no english subtitles please change

00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:14,170
your operating system to japanese for

00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:15,190
whatever reason it continually surprises

00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:18,160
people when they see my phone and

00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:20,680
they're like hey wait at what anything

00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:25,660
english in your life get rid of it

00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:28,420
so it's the only five minutes you gotta

00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:30,490
you know commit so I know what some of

00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:33,160
you are thinking what fun is so let's

00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:39,329
review this is a Japanese textbook this

00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:39,329
is not fun this is the fifth element

00:47:51,150 --> 00:48:04,990
thank you so professor Tanaka does not

00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:08,470
intend to what the ever but you

00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:10,359
know that's not fun but fear is the

00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:12,040
mind-killer you know that you have a

00:48:10,359 --> 00:48:16,089
real emotional investment in that in

00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:17,890
some Night Fights Conte drills anyone

00:48:16,089 --> 00:48:22,510
like kanji no nobody likes County drills

00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:28,260
Karen way more fun is like suplexing a

00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:31,569
death train spoilers use a Phoenix stone

00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:34,660
um spending time with my crazy pug

00:48:31,569 --> 00:48:37,990
that's actually kind of fun he's this is

00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:39,190
moose but more fun is actually spending

00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:41,770
so I was gone crazy pug while playing

00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:43,359
pokemon his Japanese so you got to do

00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:44,829
that and I know he's actually watching

00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:50,530
the live stream right now so I'm blowing

00:48:44,829 --> 00:48:51,430
his a little meatball brain that me so

00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:54,430
some of you might be wondering what

00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:56,290
Japanese is so this is Japanese that's a

00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:59,109
textbook this is all the Japanese in

00:48:56,290 --> 00:49:00,760
that on that page in pink and then this

00:48:59,109 --> 00:49:03,700
is all the English so this is actually

00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:06,700
in English not Japanese and as we saw it

00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:08,020
definitely fails the fun yeah this is

00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:09,160
Japanese and it's actually got a really

00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:12,430
good joke that you'd understand after

00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:14,079
only a few weeks of study unfortunately

00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:15,859
Charlie this is not Japanese so I can't

00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:18,200
read it

00:49:15,859 --> 00:49:23,839
someone read this instead this is a

00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:25,670
japanese book by charles stross so have

00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:27,980
fun in Japanese sounds easy right well

00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:29,660
I'm actually pretty lazy it's easy to

00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:31,309
just not do these things so I use a site

00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:33,349
called daily practice which is a habit

00:49:31,309 --> 00:49:34,549
tracking site I have all these goals

00:49:33,349 --> 00:49:36,859
that I try to do every day or every

00:49:34,549 --> 00:49:38,569
other day or something and in particular

00:49:36,859 --> 00:49:41,059
if something is easy to do is easy not

00:49:38,569 --> 00:49:42,829
to do it and a lot of people say move to

00:49:41,059 --> 00:49:44,630
Japan to learn Japanese but that doesn't

00:49:42,829 --> 00:49:46,519
always work so well if you surround

00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:48,950
yourself in English so my suggestion is

00:49:46,519 --> 00:49:50,660
moved to Japan turn on the TV don't turn

00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:55,279
her off for two years that way you'll

00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:56,960
learn Japanese on a related note i don't

00:49:55,279 --> 00:49:58,759
live in japan i live in Boston which has

00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:01,970
very little Japanese but I try to get by

00:49:58,759 --> 00:50:03,589
so what I did was I took this device

00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:07,609
which is a Raspberry Pi which is amazing

00:50:03,589 --> 00:50:08,960
and I will praise it for a bit because

00:50:07,609 --> 00:50:11,210
it's like a disposable computing which

00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,589
is like this real weird new world of you

00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:15,079
know the next level science fiction

00:50:12,589 --> 00:50:18,319
anyway so I hooked up my raspberry pi to

00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:19,970
my TV my router so I can ssh in and a

00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:23,029
terabyte USB Drive filled with Japanese

00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:24,499
media and then I wrote some software so

00:50:23,029 --> 00:50:25,940
at nine o'clock in the morning my tv

00:50:24,499 --> 00:50:28,279
turns on and it starts streaming

00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:31,549
Japanese media automatically Thank You

00:50:28,279 --> 00:50:33,440
miyagawa for Twiggy yeah that's run by

00:50:31,549 --> 00:50:35,299
Qur'an and everything about 25 minutes

00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,799
later the first video is done so it you

00:50:35,299 --> 00:50:38,869
know selects another video automatically

00:50:36,799 --> 00:50:40,489
and then I don't worry about it you know

00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:42,769
kind of trying to do the turn TV on

00:50:40,489 --> 00:50:43,940
don't turn it off for two years so you

00:50:42,769 --> 00:50:45,619
know maybe this time it picks it up to

00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:47,420
the simpsons but i'm not really into the

00:50:45,619 --> 00:50:49,489
simpsons so i pull up my phone and i use

00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:51,499
this app that i wrote to cue up the next

00:50:49,489 --> 00:50:52,940
thing which is hoped I McKen which is

00:50:51,499 --> 00:50:56,029
about this guy who punches you know

00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:57,259
tanks and stuff and then at you know a

00:50:56,029 --> 00:50:58,759
little past midnight it's time to go to

00:50:57,259 --> 00:51:01,249
bed but you know I read before i go to

00:50:58,759 --> 00:51:03,819
bed so i try to read a little bit thank

00:51:01,249 --> 00:51:03,819
you go have fun

00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:23,080
hello I'm Dan with cpanel and I just

00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:25,030
want to let everybody know that we also

00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:27,670
are hiring so if you have any questions

00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:36,160
jobs cpanel net and it's an awesome

00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:37,810
place to work so come talk to us I'm

00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:41,410
just gonna add to line up of people who

00:51:37,810 --> 00:51:43,150
couldn't make it here this year JT has

00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:46,060
like three other conferences he couldn't

00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:47,710
make it so he's got a kickstarter for

00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:50,800
the captain is dead and if you could all

00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:52,780
go and spam his comments page i think

00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:56,320
that would be really fun no seriously

00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:57,700
cab no dead is a really fun game so JT's

00:51:56,320 --> 00:52:01,050
got that up on Kickstarter right now

00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:01,050
it's great i played it many times myself

00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:18,520
hi ya see how you doing when i was

00:52:15,819 --> 00:52:22,980
growing up i was told that it's not

00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:22,980
polite to discuss religion or politics

00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:30,480
and this is an established precedent

00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:33,200
since the 19th century etiquette and

00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,200
conversation

00:52:35,310 --> 00:52:43,110
lest they burn your fingers the problem

00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:45,480
is that a lot of people including myself

00:52:43,110 --> 00:52:49,530
care about a lot of really important

00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:53,550
issues and it's unfortunate that to be

00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:55,580
polite you can't discuss politics or

00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:55,580
religion

00:52:57,220 --> 00:53:03,770
and when I try to discuss things that

00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:05,210
people care about a lot what I tend to

00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:06,950
find is I tend to find there's a bunch

00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:10,780
of people over here that feel very

00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:13,640
strongly about that issue like this and

00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:16,160
then I tend to find that there's a bunch

00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:17,840
of people over here that tend to feel

00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:21,470
very strongly about that issue in the

00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:24,080
exact opposite way and so I try to go to

00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:25,820
one of these groups and I try to say hey

00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:27,500
have you ever thought that maybe you

00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:30,260
know if it's not always about that and

00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:33,440
that group tends to yell at me and such

00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:34,550
and that's uncomfortable so I go to the

00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:36,620
other group and I'm like you know they

00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:39,020
kind of have a point over there have you

00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:42,350
ever thought hey you know under these

00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:45,230
conditions maybe they don't tend to like

00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:46,970
that much they tend to want to talk to

00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:49,700
themselves about the opinions they've

00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:52,340
already established and I think this is

00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:56,240
a problem this is not healthy in our

00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:58,520
society in my opinion why isn't there

00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:00,110
something in the middle where you can

00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:02,270
discuss these things that are really

00:54:00,110 --> 00:54:08,810
important to you I'm really important to

00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:10,640
me so I tried to invent one and what

00:54:08,810 --> 00:54:13,940
this is is we have meetings in person

00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:15,080
once a month in person right if you want

00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:16,310
to argue on the internet feel free

00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:17,900
there's millions of places to do that

00:54:16,310 --> 00:54:20,020
already there's millions of arguments

00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:22,880
already underway feel free to join them

00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:24,230
but what we try to do is we try to have

00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,410
very small group meetings and we try to

00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:29,000
get attendees that are good listeners

00:54:26,410 --> 00:54:32,030
open-minded and the organization itself

00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,470
holds no position on issues this makes

00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:35,480
it really trick for tricky for

00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:38,330
organizers especially if this thing gets

00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:42,050
popular luckily so far it's only been a

00:54:38,330 --> 00:54:44,830
handful of us if it gets popular maybe

00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:47,780
it'll get really tricky even trickier I

00:54:44,830 --> 00:54:50,240
hope it gets popular but maybe not in

00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:52,280
Omaha because I'm the facilitator Noma

00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:55,140
ha

00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:56,970
welcome welcome to the group hey we have

00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:58,170
an agenda we set all these items you

00:54:56,970 --> 00:54:59,160
have any interest in any of these if you

00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:00,180
don't that's fine let's talk about

00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:02,550
whatever it is that you're passionate

00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:04,170
about what do you think about that oh

00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:05,970
here's some things that I think about

00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:07,980
that now let's try to figure out where

00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:10,470
do we agree where do we disagree and

00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:15,630
when we disagree why do we disagree

00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:19,200
let's try to understand here's what

00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:22,320
would change my mind about this what

00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:23,280
would change your mind about this now

00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,599
that we've been talking for a while

00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,190
maybe over the course of several

00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:28,859
meetings I think I can state your

00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:32,040
perspective accurately am i right is

00:55:28,859 --> 00:55:34,680
that your perspective on this can you

00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:37,140
state my perspective on this all of

00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:39,690
these things are very healthy in my

00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:40,800
opinion at the end of the meeting did

00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:42,390
you get what you wanted out of this

00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:46,470
meeting did you feel like people were

00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:48,750
listening and if now we both agree we're

00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:50,460
completely sympatico that is not the end

00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:52,230
of the process we are not forming our

00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:54,240
own echo chamber where we agree about

00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:56,849
these things we're going to go find

00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:57,869
people that do not agree with us we're

00:55:56,849 --> 00:56:02,940
going to invite them to the next meeting

00:55:57,869 --> 00:56:05,750
and have coffee and civil discourse this

00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:05,750
is hard stuff

00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:15,690
and it's well-trod ground social workers

00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:18,090
mediators do this for a living this is

00:56:15,690 --> 00:56:19,710
not an easy sell to get people to show

00:56:18,090 --> 00:56:22,790
up for these things because when people

00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:25,200
really feel strongly about something

00:56:22,790 --> 00:56:30,470
it's not always the funnest thing to do

00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:30,470
on any given night it's easier to drink

00:56:30,749 --> 00:56:36,339
but I think this is necessary in our

00:56:33,339 --> 00:56:38,709
culture I don't want all the people that

00:56:36,339 --> 00:56:40,299
get to discuss these things to be

00:56:38,709 --> 00:56:42,640
screaming about it from their

00:56:40,299 --> 00:56:44,880
perspective and not listening to someone

00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,880
else

00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:49,570
Oh

00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:58,300
I'm hoping our group fights against this

00:56:54,280 --> 00:57:00,960
trend that we can be a place where this

00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:00,960
is not true

00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:09,430
so if you're crazy like me and you don't

00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:13,180
live in omaha nebraska contact us you

00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:20,400
can start a group of your own unless you

00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:20,400
would rather drink and that's all I had

00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:24,180
thank you very much

00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:37,170
I do not agree this is a good idea fire

00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:39,950
fire there will be a discussion whether

00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:39,950
it's a good idea or not

00:57:45,510 --> 00:57:55,000
so in terms of things written in using

00:57:49,859 --> 00:57:57,039
apache 13 and using mod perl there is

00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:59,380
the thing that runs our conference act

00:57:57,039 --> 00:58:01,539
it has some problems there's been some

00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:03,369
attempts to fix that but um the oslo

00:58:01,539 --> 00:58:05,770
perl mongers group is trying to organize

00:58:03,369 --> 00:58:09,369
a hackathon for to work and fix that

00:58:05,770 --> 00:58:11,829
improve it next year at some point so if

00:58:09,369 --> 00:58:14,289
you have any interest in that join the

00:58:11,829 --> 00:58:28,500
ACT IRC channel or look at the mailing

00:58:14,289 --> 00:58:28,500
list and help out okay

I will kill you you can you can turn

00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:08,010

stuff that the piss this out of me

but first a few words of caution tim

00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:24,180
toady right you have your own things

00:59:21,630 --> 00:59:25,470
your mileage very mileage may vary no

00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:27,540
batteries included don't drink and drive

00:59:25,470 --> 00:59:29,160
you know all that stuff of course if you

00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:31,559
do have problem after all these things i

00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:34,770
really don't give a so don't come

00:59:31,559 --> 00:59:36,300
afterwards and say well i don't care so

00:59:34,770 --> 00:59:38,460
some small problems that i have with the

00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:39,809
way people do things first of all unless

00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:41,640
I don't like a list I don't think in

00:59:39,809 --> 00:59:44,069
ways unless none of us do we think we're

00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:46,020
programmers we think of if also post fix

00:59:44,069 --> 00:59:49,740
if no one thinks that way it's really

00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:53,970
annoying when they read okay if damn it

00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:55,890
okay stop some really stupid stuff okay

00:59:53,970 --> 00:59:58,770
people right now who named the variables

00:59:55,890 --> 01:00:00,480
a B ijkl every time i see this i want to

00:59:58,770 --> 01:00:03,059
change it today's it's just really

01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:08,160
 annoying don't ever do

01:00:03,059 --> 01:00:10,319
this trailing spaces stop it people who

01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:13,309
name their variables bar there are

01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:16,079
raised array or hash I know it's a hash

01:00:13,309 --> 01:00:18,059
tabs versus spaces this is an internal

01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:20,099
struggle everyone's confused what do i

01:00:18,059 --> 01:00:21,690
do what do we do I want to use tabs but

01:00:20,099 --> 01:00:23,010
people can complain after you space if

01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:26,339
I'd only new space that when these tabs

01:00:23,010 --> 01:00:28,319
here's here's the trick okay do not mix

01:00:26,339 --> 01:00:30,470
tabs and spaces this is this is where

01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:34,710
all the frustration comes from thank you

01:00:30,470 --> 01:00:36,420
now um I'm gonna I'm gonna help you out

01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:38,730
with this just so you can remember this

01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:41,819
better do not mix tabs and paste it in

01:00:38,730 --> 01:00:46,049
spaces do not mix tabs and spaces do not

01:00:41,819 --> 01:00:48,920
mix tabs and spaces the trick is no taps

01:00:46,049 --> 01:00:48,920
only spaces

01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:56,690
and and this is something you can

01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:58,250
configure in every editor I believe

01:00:56,690 --> 01:01:00,590
Emacs has an editor maybe you can

01:00:58,250 --> 01:01:04,130
convince them I had to have I ought to

01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:06,050
honey max joke so some misunderstandings

01:01:04,130 --> 01:01:07,760
people have people use map incorrectly

01:01:06,050 --> 01:01:09,290
okay people use map but they don't

01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:10,790
actually get the value from it so here's

01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:11,960
how you use map there's expression list

01:01:10,790 --> 01:01:13,730
if you have an expression here and

01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:16,220
there's one with a block this is the

01:01:13,730 --> 01:01:18,650
Schwartz change transform this is a see

01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:21,590
style for loop it looks like this for

01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:23,780
each style loop looks like this of

01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:26,840
course the post fix for I'm not a fan

01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:28,670
but fine switches you know you have

01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:31,040
switches hey here's something nice

01:01:28,670 --> 01:01:32,750
dispatch able use that one try it out

01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:34,880
there's a link here that you'll

01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:38,930
definitely remember by heart that's

01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:41,780
that's the dispatch tables from marc

01:01:38,930 --> 01:01:46,820
jayson ominous book empty if clause i

01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:50,420
 hate this what are you doing

01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:52,160
come on return variables people use

01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:53,720
return vehicles they have our available

01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:57,190
and if they set the variable throughout

01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:59,840
the program and then they return it ah

01:01:57,190 --> 01:02:02,870
Batman is your sidekick out spider-man

01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:05,030
there's just never mind um class methods

01:02:02,870 --> 01:02:07,400
this is something i really like I've

01:02:05,030 --> 01:02:09,920
seen a lot of code that does this if you

01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:11,900
do it stop it okay you see the problem

01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:15,710
with class methods is that you're using

01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:18,050
a class for a function using a method

01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:20,240
without a context that it doesn't make

01:02:18,050 --> 01:02:22,490
any sense basically it means that you're

01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:23,780
using two things for completely

01:02:22,490 --> 01:02:25,550
different purpose you don't even know

01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:26,900
what you're doing with those stop doing

01:02:25,550 --> 01:02:29,330
them if you want to use a method that

01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:30,920
means you need context use an object if

01:02:29,330 --> 01:02:33,110
you want just a function don't use a

01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:37,790
 class for this just use a

01:02:33,110 --> 01:02:40,250
function workflow try and catch not for

01:02:37,790 --> 01:02:43,220
workflow don't ever use try cats for

01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:46,330
workflow it is not meant for that you're

01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:46,330
getting for Christmas

01:02:49,910 --> 01:03:00,170
go to again not for workflow not for

01:02:56,059 --> 01:03:03,230
workflow okay this is meant for C code

01:03:00,170 --> 01:03:05,390
we're not writing in c you can use next

01:03:03,230 --> 01:03:09,619
on a label you can do last on the label

01:03:05,390 --> 01:03:11,420
use those unless you do this that's fine

01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:18,049
and if you don't know what this is don't

01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:21,500
do it some related conditions i'm

01:03:18,049 --> 01:03:24,799
wrapping up this thing i don't like it i

01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:26,000
really don't like it it's it's very

01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:28,099
annoying every time i see this this is

01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,920
what I'm thinking so fix it it up a bit

01:03:28,099 --> 01:03:35,210
you can do this or you can do this

01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:37,460
either one is fine now here's the

01:03:35,210 --> 01:03:38,780
summary why do I complain all the time

01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:42,500
other than the fact that I like to

01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:46,690
complain you see the thing is that code

01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:50,329
is alive code rose sometimes it grows to

01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:53,950
disproportionate size it grows and grows

01:03:50,329 --> 01:03:56,770
and grows mostly if you feed it and

01:03:53,950 --> 01:03:59,750
sometimes even runs to a ridiculous age

01:03:56,770 --> 01:04:01,339
okay it gets old which is not

01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:04,569
necessarily a bad thing a lot of you

01:04:01,339 --> 01:04:09,410
people here are old that's fine I

01:04:04,569 --> 01:04:13,010
respect that mostly it it's fine the

01:04:09,410 --> 01:04:15,770
thing is this you might not be the last

01:04:13,010 --> 01:04:18,260
person to deal with his coat more

01:04:15,770 --> 01:04:23,420
importantly the next person might know

01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:28,700
where you live they might be me so our

01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:30,849
own a chain saw yes also me so here are

01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:30,849
your options

01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:37,540
you need to think of a program is

01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:40,270
something kind of like a legacy that you

01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:42,280
pass on to someone else and just like if

01:04:40,270 --> 01:04:43,960
you have a kid or you are going to have

01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:45,700
a gator you have a dog I don't know

01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:47,980
it whatever you want to pass on

01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:50,170
something that they can play with they

01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:52,180
can work with they can study they can

01:04:50,170 --> 01:04:53,920
understand and that they can expand

01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:58,380
onwards and pass it along to the next

01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:58,380
