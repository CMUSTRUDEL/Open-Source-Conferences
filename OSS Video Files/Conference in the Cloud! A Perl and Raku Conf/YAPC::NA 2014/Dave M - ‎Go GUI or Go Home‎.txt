okay very good good morning I'm Dave and

00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:32,220
thanks for coming here I have to tell

00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:34,110
you this this is really great to be in

00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:37,140
this timeslot it's the coveted guy who

00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:40,559
talks right before lunch so this should

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:43,199
be good just quick background about me

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,790
I'm not a guru I'm not that chromatic or

00:00:43,199 --> 00:00:47,010
obit or any of these really cool smart

00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:48,660
guys I'm just not I'm Joe average parole

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,300
guy but before you book for the door and

00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,710
run out of here I've used pearl with the

00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,780
number of graphics libraries over the

00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,190
years and in particular they've been

00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,470
support and open source and they're on

00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,960
every Linux distribution you can get

00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:02,399
real support for and everything that

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,840
I've been doing that for over 10 years

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,320
so hopefully I can give you some kind of

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:11,820
information as to how easy it is to use

00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:13,560
graphical interfaces with Perl and one

00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,090
other thing I'd like to give you is some

00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,340
lessons learned that I've encountered

00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,780
when you're using gooeys and pushing

00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,950
things out because typically if you're

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,160
talking about writing a GUI interface

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,690
here you want to it's typically not for

00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,399
you it's for other people it's for a

00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:27,240
group of people it's a you know if you

00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:30,060
want to push it out to a Lakes

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:33,899
distribution or if it's for people work

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:36,240
or what have you I like when people

00:01:33,899 --> 00:01:37,979
asked people in Perl asked me what I'd

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,959
use with Perl and I say well I've read a

00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:41,910
lot of graphical interfaces and the

00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:44,069
first thing you hear is lalalalala

00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:45,810
that's not Perl that's not Perl you know

00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:48,030
it's not a module it's not something

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,520
cool like that it's not a CGI script or

00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,170
whatever but Perl does have this long

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,979
history of using graphical interfaces

00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:59,459
I've used TK g TK a gta2 and I'm working

00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:01,920
on some gk3 things so go ahead and feel

00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:03,569
free to ask questions the problem is we

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,979
only have 20 minutes it's not a lot of

00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:07,500
time so I've had to kind of reorient

00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:08,759
what I wanted to do here first like I

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,810
said I'm gonna give you a quick taste of

00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:13,080
what it's like Leah started with

00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:14,220
graphical interface design and - I'd

00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,020
like to give you some lessons learned

00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,480
that I've learned the hard way when

00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,280
you're dealing with software that you

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,830
have out there in the open and I'm gonna

00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,819
give you some resources so that you can

00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:25,849
if you need any help along the way

00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:28,380
there's plenty of it

00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:31,170
first let's talk about the two most

00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:32,909
important concepts with gtk using the

00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:36,030
graphics libraries one is containers

00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:36,420
okay so I like to think about things in

00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,780
picture

00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:42,420
so you start off with say a floor plan

00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:45,030
or a foundation right and you add rooms

00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,770
to it you add containers this is the way

00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,020
gtk things everything is part of a

00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:51,239
container you sawed off with a window

00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,980
you add a box maybe want to add a closet

00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:54,450
or something another box you want add

00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,670
some text you want to add a picture to

00:02:54,450 --> 00:03:00,510
it these all get pushed inside of boxes

00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:03,390
or containers second most important

00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:05,160
thing are signals and signal handling so

00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:08,880
this is what happens when a user had

00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:10,380
clicks on a button or something or they

00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,390
use drag-and-drop what should happen

00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:13,860
what kind of signals getting mitad and

00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,799
what happens what do you want to happen

00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,080
when the user clicks on a particular box

00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:20,190
that's it that's the two most

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,310
complicated aspects you have to think

00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:25,260
about here when I first started doing

00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,489
Perl one of those gurus I mentioned

00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,110
earlier I don't know who it was maybe

00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:30,120
it's unlearning Perl but they said use a

00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:31,890
template you know start off with you

00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,480
know your shebang line your use trick

00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:35,130
use warnings and this kind of thing that

00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,930
we always stay in the good habits of

00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:38,580
good writing practices so I'm going to

00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:40,440
offer you the same thing but from a gtk

00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,940
perspective this is the actual template

00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,489
that I use when I'm writing something in

00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:46,500
Perl and gtk right the same kind of

00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:49,230
beginning lines next you want to

00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,269
initialize the graphics libraries next

00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:54,329
we start off at the window and this is

00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:55,829
our big overall arching foundation of

00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:57,900
everything when I write you're always

00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:59,489
pretty much going to want a gtk window

00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,519
and everything you write it's the just

00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:06,660
the big top picture here guess what set

00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:07,950
title does yeah set title okay then

00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:10,230
we're going to connect this signal to it

00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:13,380
whenever this destroy signal is emitted

00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:15,810
I want it to go to this anonymous

00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:18,570
subroutine here and tell gtk to shut

00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:20,070
down nicely okay and then we want

00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,479
everything to be shown make sure every

00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:23,580
little aspect every little widget in

00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:27,030
there is being shown every image button

00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,169
everything and then launch these things

00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:30,150
you're pretty much going to need in

00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:32,780
every single program you write for ttk

00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:35,460
so it's a perfect example of a template

00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:39,270
but that doesn't do much so let's go a

00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:41,430
little bit further okay let's add a box

00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:44,070
and here you think about of room like I

00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:46,950
said if you like and we're going to add

00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:49,889
that box to the window itself let's add

00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:52,669
some text DTK label is the main

00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:56,639
utility use for text along the lines

00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:58,169
here first that hello world that's what

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,259
you're looking at the example there it's

00:04:58,169 --> 00:05:04,530
not too thrilling but for the most part

00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:06,060
you can also use markup so as you see in

00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:08,370
this example down here and you can use

00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,740
hyperlinks and everything so it's pretty

00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:13,379
full-featured so don't be misled by the

00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,629
simple hello world now this example here

00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:17,069
is just that and if a user looked at

00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:18,719
this okay that's kind of boring and give

00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:22,710
me something to click on so let's move

00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:25,020
along how about some buttons there are

00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:27,479
two kinds of buttons we can use here one

00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:30,659
I can customize it myself with something

00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:32,759
like click me or I can add another

00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:34,770
button but it's using stock icons that

00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:35,879
come with gtk and that's kind of an

00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,710
advantage here because I don't know

00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:39,539
about you guys but I can't design icons

00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:44,009
myself to be pushed out in some kind of

00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:45,810
project so the gtk library comes with a

00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:48,539
whole bunch of stock icons that you can

00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:50,669
use for use with these buttons so this

00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:52,139
time let's go a little further instead

00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:54,449
of just creating a button let's add a

00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:56,490
signal to it a signal handler to it I

00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:59,279
should say when the button is clicked

00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:01,650
run the subroutine don't get lost in all

00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,360
these you don't have to memorize these

00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:06,300
kind of options that come with this

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,770
that's what documentation for I don't

00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,779
memorize it after all these years I

00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:11,250
still look it up but I wanted to show

00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:14,870
you so you can see how fine-grained you

00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:17,580
can get when you're doing these kind of

00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:19,589
images here so you know modal and

00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:21,240
destroy with parent and things

00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:24,270
what kind of buttons do we want what

00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:29,819
kind of text do we want and look State

00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:31,020
that's modern pearl sweet okay so one of

00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:32,669
the other advantage I was just talking

00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,830
about with the buttons and stock icons

00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:37,710
this is running it on the left is

00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:40,529
running on my desktop with my language

00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:43,469
very environment variables but Auto

00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:45,960
magically if you're using Korean desktop

00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:47,849
languages or something else the locales

00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:51,539
come with it so you don't need a

00:06:47,849 --> 00:06:53,039
translator for that is the actual code

00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:54,389
right here below here this there's

00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,620
nothing in there saying what language to

00:06:54,389 --> 00:07:00,180
use it's grabbing it all from your

00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:02,159
desktop environment which is great more

00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,460
we have toolbars we can design we have

00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:06,789
built in images and stock

00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:07,210
Conn's we can use and tooltips even

00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:09,669
better

00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:11,080
did I mention this building images this

00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:14,310
is a good thing these are good stock

00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:19,419
icons we can use in here

00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:22,780
what about localization but awesome you

00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:25,630
have not backed up for a while I'll just

00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:28,889
I'm just going to close that for now do

00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:28,889
you want me to back it up okay

00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:33,639
but yeah this this stuff just works this

00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:36,729
is a real pearl gtk project out there

00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:38,289
and all the language files that you can

00:07:36,729 --> 00:07:40,120
use with it and it just works it just

00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:42,130
displays great now you do need

00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,979
translators for that I can help you with

00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:46,660
that as well but not translating but you

00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:48,960
know okay

00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,960
Oh

00:07:54,119 --> 00:07:57,689
it's beeping at me

00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:17,340
it really likes this sweet thank you

00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:19,020
okay okay so you're in luck I can't show

00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,310
you more slides but in the interest of

00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,810
time though I don't want to keep showing

00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,830
you these little examples and stuff I

00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:24,599
just want to give you a taste of how

00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,710
easy it is to do there's nothing that

00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:27,479
you've seen in there if you've been

00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:29,400
using pearl for a month or ten years or

00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:31,500
whatever that should look alien to you

00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:34,140
it really you're calling these same gtk

00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,370
libraries it shouldn't look any

00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:38,399
different than what you've what you've

00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:39,510
done before so I'd like to give you some

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,279
lessons learned like I said when you

00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:43,970
push things out there it's there for the

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:46,740
whole world and and I want you to get a

00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:48,480
taste of what I've done and some of this

00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,550
is kind of embarrassing to me take your

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,040
time when you're pushing releases just

00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:55,140
because you added one line to remove the

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,290
line that's not a call to put out a new

00:08:55,140 --> 00:09:00,029
version okay when you push something out

00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:01,740
there you have people who are going to

00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:03,450
download it build it test it running on

00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,800
their system then they're going to want

00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,390
to deploy it so they're going to push it

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,470
up two mirrors and those mirrors are

00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:09,329
going to sync with other mirrors there's

00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:11,700
all kinds of things happening when you

00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:12,390
push a new release okay so I learned

00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,220
that the hard way

00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:17,250
in fact so just take your time take a

00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:20,430
deep breath keep going I don't do any

00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:22,320
automated tests when I write buoys but

00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:24,209
that doesn't mean I don't run any I have

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,740
a list of a whole bunch of things that

00:09:24,209 --> 00:09:28,440
have tripped me up in the past even if

00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:31,079
it's spaces and file names or how to

00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,089
handle text that's not American English

00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:34,320
I have a whole bunch of these things I

00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:36,360
recommend you do the same write these

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,570
down have a directory of things that you

00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,610
can go through excuse me don't forget to

00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:43,410
comment your code because it could be

00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:47,640
around for a long time the main program

00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:49,290
I write and distribute I never intended

00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,980
for it to be around ten plus years later

00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:54,390
it just is so make sure you can write

00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:58,310
neat PO check you normally do and

00:09:54,390 --> 00:10:00,690
comment it be prepared for localization

00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:02,430
when I was first starting out as

00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:05,699
probably late into this for like couple

00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:08,760
of years I had somebody send me that

00:10:05,699 --> 00:10:10,770
they rewrote my program to use locale

00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,990
locale get text there on the bottom and

00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:14,850
had to end me a spanish-language file

00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:18,089
and I was like what do you do with it

00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:19,889
I have no idea but it's actually not

00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:22,289
magic these things can be plugged in

00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:24,329
brother simpler locale get text is very

00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:27,269
easy to use I can give you more examples

00:10:24,329 --> 00:10:30,660
of this later but low-cal make text is

00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:34,470
used by I think Google Chrome so they do

00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:36,289
just work here just fine I tell you an

00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:39,839
embarrassing story here about Bob myself

00:10:36,289 --> 00:10:41,339
I wanted to have a some code in the

00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:45,179
program that was so that the user could

00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:46,499
save preferences right and those config

00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:50,609
modules do a pretty good job of that

00:10:46,499 --> 00:10:52,889
right so I grabbed one and I noticed

00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:53,970
that I couldn't set updates it could

00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:56,729
read updates if they were already there

00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:59,009
but it couldn't it didn't set them and

00:10:56,729 --> 00:11:01,949
I'm thinking well these guys write perl

00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:04,169
modules they're their gurus I'm not I'm

00:11:01,949 --> 00:11:06,539
doing something wrong so I downloaded

00:11:04,169 --> 00:11:08,369
anyway added as a dependency which gets

00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:09,959
pushed to every single Linux

00:11:08,369 --> 00:11:12,149
distribution that my project gets pushed

00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:16,199
to and everyone else is adding this

00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:18,749
dependency there and I had to hand jam

00:11:16,199 --> 00:11:20,850
code to make up for the stuff that's not

00:11:18,749 --> 00:11:22,949
there in the config module that I picked

00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:24,329
and I kept it that way for a year and a

00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:25,439
half trying over and over again to

00:11:24,329 --> 00:11:28,979
figure out what could I've been doing

00:11:25,439 --> 00:11:30,359
wrong a year and a half later more than

00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:31,829
that I finally removed it out of

00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:33,059
frustration I said okay something is not

00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:35,999
right here and I just rewrote the

00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:37,889
configure stuff myself and then a year

00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:39,449
later they did add the stuff that wasn't

00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:41,879
in there in the first place I'm still a

00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:44,699
little bit bitter at how stupid I am for

00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:45,989
having done that but this could have

00:11:44,699 --> 00:11:48,299
been resolved that I just maybe just

00:11:45,989 --> 00:11:53,220
posted something on perl monks or just

00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:55,079
email somebody asked for help if you're

00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:57,269
writing on Linux right for all

00:11:55,079 --> 00:12:00,720
distributions it's not that difficult if

00:11:57,269 --> 00:12:02,129
tools like VirtualBox and vmware i've

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,769
used them both they're both great for

00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:08,549
this just power those upload a few sent

00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:10,979
to s debian whatever fedora and test it

00:12:08,549 --> 00:12:14,309
out on all of them it's it's free it's

00:12:10,979 --> 00:12:15,509
easy to use and it just works if you're

00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:18,139
writing for one you might as well write

00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:20,850
for all of them don't code in a vacuum

00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:23,309
the gtk parole guys we have a mailing

00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:25,619
list you're welcome to join it slow

00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:26,970
traffic you're not going to spammed it's

00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:29,809
a great place to ask questions to a

00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:29,809
bunch of smart people

00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:35,880
something else learn to package your

00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:37,800
product with rpms or Deb's or whatever

00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,470
and if you can't do it ask somebody to

00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:43,260
give you a hand it's a really a lot

00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:44,610
easier for bodies here for users that

00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,350
just double-click on your program

00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:48,180
whether it's an RPM Deb executable

00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:51,330
whatever and it just automatically works

00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:53,010
pulls in the dependencies you need I've

00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:55,260
actually heard people telling end-users

00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:57,210
to well just pop open a shell and type

00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:59,010
Sipan and go through the config they're

00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:00,990
not going to do that I've been using pro

00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:02,880
for over 10 years and i don't use Sipan

00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:05,880
I use everything that's in the because

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:08,000
my customer base is on the Linux

00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:11,460
distributions right if it's not on the

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,780
repositories and I don't use it

00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,980
you should also stay in touch with

00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:16,800
anybody if they're packaging your

00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:18,180
program technically the gear but if

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,670
you're packaging for somebody else you

00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:22,530
should contact them that almost never

00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:23,730
happens so if you find out somebody

00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:25,020
whose packaging your program and

00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:29,180
distributing it get in touch with them

00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:29,180
and you can work out any bugs in advance

00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:34,440
don't do things because you can because

00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:36,030
but rather because they're useful and

00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,580
relevant stick with what your goals your

00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:40,020
project are I remember an HTML people

00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,610
had all kinds of weird things like

00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:43,740
blinking text and whatnot and it's

00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:48,740
really irritating so stick with what

00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:50,790
works for your program clean and simple

00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:52,140
you're going to deal with end users

00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:54,750
they're going to email you from all over

00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:56,190
the world and it's really cool I have to

00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:59,400
I have to admit you get to talk to these

00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:01,320
people and but I notice that every user

00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,960
that comes to me will send me an email

00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,850
with two or three paragraphs apologizing

00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:09,480
for daring to interrupt the

00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:10,560
all-important developer okay there's no

00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,360
need for that I'm thinking how do we

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,980
even get to this point and I've heard I

00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,170
heard a story I don't know if it's true

00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:18,420
but someone emailed a developer of big

00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:19,800
project and said you know hey you might

00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:22,170
have a bug here can you check this out

00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,640
and the developer said why don't you

00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:25,620
look through 100 Meg's of source code

00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:27,000
and find the problem I'll get to it when

00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,290
I get to it and I'm thinking wow

00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,920
yes that's no way to talk to your

00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:34,560
customers or and the end users right

00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:36,900
excuse me so you know please there's no

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,030
reason to associate this guy with you or

00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:40,110
pearl or anything else you do you know

00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:41,320
just because you're a developer that's

00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:45,820
great but

00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:49,509
let's not disrespect people for

00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:51,639
resources there's a lot of it really for

00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:54,220
Pearl and gtk projects there are million

00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:57,070
examples million things you can use

00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:59,800
saying to go to for information one of

00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:03,880
which is the gtk pearl list go ahead and

00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:06,279
join low-traffic very useful pearl monks

00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:09,699
has a lot of tutorials on there and they

00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:10,800
have a lot of examples of gtk if you're

00:15:09,699 --> 00:15:13,540
looking to host stuff somewhere

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,790
SourceForge hosts big nugget hosts for

00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:17,769
downloads I'm going to point out

00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:20,649
Launchpad if you're into using

00:15:17,769 --> 00:15:22,149
translations if you post the words that

00:15:20,649 --> 00:15:23,920
you need translate up there on launchpad

00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:26,290
you'll have a whole bunch of people who

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:30,279
are happy to do it for you do not use

00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:33,670
like AltaVista or translate or babble or

00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:35,259
google translate it doesn't work well

00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:37,440
translators throw a fit when they see

00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:39,699
that kind of thing it really stands out

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,680
for announcing releases and projects I

00:15:39,699 --> 00:15:45,009
know SourceForge still does it free code

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:47,260
is apparently dead now so I just if you

00:15:45,009 --> 00:15:52,990
have any other ideas that I'm all ears

00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:55,350
for that and there you go take any

00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:55,350
questions

00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:22,340
Oh GUI what I'm sorry oh you mean just

00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:25,370
write a programming editor oh are you

00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:26,810
talking about Glade products like that

00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:29,810
yes I'm some folks who use Glade

00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:31,460
Networks wild form I just personally I

00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:34,220
prefer having a control being able to

00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:36,410
write it myself I think if you just go

00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:37,820
into Glade without having a little bit

00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:40,160
of experience putting things together

00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:41,930
the boxes and containers and signals and

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,240
stuff it's going to be more difficult

00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:46,790
for you so it may be better to get a

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,350
handle on the syntax and the code itself

00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:50,510
before you start using late if you're
