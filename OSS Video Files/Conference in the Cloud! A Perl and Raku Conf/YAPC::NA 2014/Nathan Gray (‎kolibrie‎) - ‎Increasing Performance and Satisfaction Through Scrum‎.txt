Publication date: 2014-06-24
Playlist: YAPC::NA 2014
Description: 
	This past year, my team adopted Scrum. I also happened to read several books about performance and inner drive.

We will discuss the framework of Scrum, and how the division of responsibilities it outlines can increase the motivation and mastery of the team.

back okay all right welcome to this

00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:13,349
morning's talk increasing satisfaction

00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:18,480
and performance through scrum i'm nathan

00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:23,310
gray I work at thinkgeek and this year

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:25,080
we adopted scrum and it's been a little

00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:28,349
bit of a rollercoaster up and down as we

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:34,880
adjust to different roles and stuff but

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:38,360
it's been good mostly so today I'm

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:44,570
taking experiences that we have from

00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:44,570
work as we adopt scrum and several books

00:00:56,679 --> 00:01:07,850
one book is drive by daniel pink it's

00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:09,409
pretty awesome another one is the

00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:15,170
smartest kids in the world and how they

00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:18,250
got to be that way this is a case study

00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:20,630
around the world of several different

00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:25,210
countries that scored really well on

00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:25,210
this test called the PISA test p is a

00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:34,130
and quiet the power of introverts in a

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,140
world that can't stop talking if you're

00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:38,690
introverted this is a very nice book to

00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:40,789
read if you're not introverted it might

00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:45,350
help you understand introverts a little

00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:48,110
bit better and then also the scrum guide

00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:51,289
which is available as a PDF on internet

00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:58,789
by Kench waiver and jeff's outside of

00:01:51,289 --> 00:02:01,190
London so um with sprint or scrum

00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:04,810
there's this thing called a sprint which

00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:14,269
is basically the container around

00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:18,349
everything else and a month or two after

00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:21,290
we started strong at work my family went

00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:24,950
on a vacation and we came back home at

00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:30,379
the end van was completely jam packed

00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:32,300
with stuff we have a bunch of kids and

00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:35,810
so my wife in are like all right kids

00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:39,140
our job right now is to unpack this van

00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:41,840
and so my wife and I started taking

00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:45,019
stuff out and so we've got increasingly

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,819
frustrated as the kids kind of just

00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:49,400
poked around and every once in a while

00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:52,370
they would grab something and take it

00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:55,129
into the house but they weren't really

00:02:52,370 --> 00:03:00,950
engaged at all and we were trying to

00:02:55,129 --> 00:03:02,569
both help them get stuff out of the van

00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:05,420
and take it inside and put it in the

00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:07,900
right place and do work ourselves and it

00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:11,079
just got into this really frustrating

00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:13,599
and right after that experience I

00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:17,530
realized what we should do is implement

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:20,019
Sprint's with our kids because then

00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:23,230
instead of trying to both do the work

00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:27,640
and oversee the work and motivate the

00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:31,030
kids and all the stuff we can do sprints

00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:34,480
with them and so we had a 15 minute

00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:38,799
sprint training with our kids we adopted

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:42,310
things a little bit we decided that each

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:44,950
sprint would be 15 minutes long and they

00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:47,470
could choose who was going to be on the

00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:50,170
team because we have a couple of younger

00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:52,030
kids that can't really help out so much

00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:53,709
so the older kids can decide are the

00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:57,700
younger kids also on the sprint team or

00:03:53,709 --> 00:04:00,879
not and so we would have one minute

00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:08,019
we're either my wife or i would say

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:11,760
these are our this is the goal of what

00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:15,010
we want for the next 15 minutes and so

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:20,760
with the unpacking the van example it

00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:20,760
would be something like let's um let's

00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:26,380
get everything out of the very very back

00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,750
not up where you sit but just everything

00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:34,300
back and so that would be maybe one

00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:38,349
sprint then they would have one minute

00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:39,669
to plan and they could decide who was

00:04:38,349 --> 00:04:42,310
going to do what you know who's going to

00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:44,349
take what suitcases who's gonna I don't

00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:48,190
know whatever back their sleeping bags

00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:49,990
stuff and then they'd have 15 minutes to

00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:53,289
actually do it and then one minute to

00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:55,599
report back in the end and so we

00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:58,210
actually tried this with our kids and

00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:59,889
they absolutely loved it because all of

00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:02,650
a sudden mom and dad want their telling

00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:04,030
what to do they had very clear goals of

00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:07,270
what they were supposed to accomplish

00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:08,710
and they had a set amount of time they

00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:12,039
knew it wasn't going to last forever it

00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:14,460
was just going to be 15 anything so they

00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:14,460
love that

00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:22,430
so throughout this talk I'm going to

00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,620
give different quotes and talk a little

00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:26,570
bit about scrum at the same time and try

00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:33,680
to put this together into one cohesive

00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:37,220
whole we'll see how that goes so first

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,230
quote is from drive by neglecting the

00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:42,290
ingredients of genuine motivation

00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:46,640
autonomy mastery and purpose they limit

00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:48,620
what each of us can achieve so this is

00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:51,200
something that we had with our kids we

00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:54,700
hadn't given them any autonomy or

00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:57,320
purpose we just said do this stuff and

00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:59,840
so they didn't have motivation at all

00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:02,510
another quote from drive the very

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:05,690
presence of goals may lead employees to

00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:10,490
focus myopically on short-term gains and

00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:12,320
to lose sight of the potentially dential

00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:18,500
devastating long-term effects on the

00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:20,150
organization I don't know if that really

00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:23,660
makes sense with the van example but

00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:26,180
it's a good quote another one on goals

00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:28,430
is goals that people step for themselves

00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:30,500
and that our devoted to attaining

00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:33,050
mastery are usually healthy but goals

00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:35,360
imposed by others sales targets

00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:37,550
quarterly returns standardized test

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,790
scores and so on and sometimes have

00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:43,160
dangerous side effects we didn't do that

00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:45,590
so much with our kids of having them set

00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:49,310
their own goals we set the goals for

00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:53,330
them because you know they're not that

00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:54,860
old but as we progressed with scrum with

00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,720
our family that I'm sure that we will

00:06:54,860 --> 00:07:02,330
allow them to start setting their own

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:04,370
goals and then the quote from dr they

00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:06,200
were focused on the work itself rather

00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:09,590
than on whether someone would call them

00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:14,300
a slacker for leaving at three p.m. to

00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:15,750
watch a daughter soccer game this has to

00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:21,840
do with

00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:27,450
autonomy over time and scrum does that

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:29,970
some not as the book drive is way beyond

00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:33,570
scrum on how much autonomy you give

00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:37,710
employees I think scrum is kind of this

00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:41,640
in-between of managers tell people what

00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:43,740
they need to do and the complete let

00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,170
employees figure out what needs to get

00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:48,600
done and do it on their own but some

00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:50,100
just kind of this balance point in the

00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,730
middle and I think that's why it works

00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:56,550
so well is that there's enough structure

00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:58,830
so that the manager e-types don't have

00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:02,669
to be completely freaked out and enough

00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:04,800
structure so that people who don't

00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:07,560
thrive in an environment of completely

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:17,190
being autonomous they they have

00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:18,510
something to go on ample research has

00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:20,310
shown that people working in

00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:26,060
self-organized teams are more satisfied

00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:26,060
than those working in inherited teams

00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:33,659
and we tried to do that a little bit

00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:36,320
with our kids where they can they could

00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:41,180
choose are the little kids involved in

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:46,290
this in the Sprint or not at work on

00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:49,500
scrum says that that the team is set and

00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:53,310
it doesn't change around but you can

00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:55,380
still within a sprint you can decide I'm

00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:58,380
going to pair with this person I'm going

00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:59,790
to go work with these people so you can

00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:02,180
shift around within your team a little

00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,180
bit too

00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:07,060
sorry

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,320
another couple quotes from drive the

00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:23,660
science shows that the secret to high

00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:27,230
performance isn't our biological drive

00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:29,930
or the reward and Punishment drive but

00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:33,500
our third drive our deep-seated desire

00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:36,350
to direct our own lives to extend and

00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:42,890
expand our abilities and to live a life

00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:45,200
of purpose that's really the core of

00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:46,640
what the book drive is about is these

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,250
different motivations you can have

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,440
external motivations trying to tell you

00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:55,700
what to do or you can figure out what's

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:58,690
that drive inside and having a life of

00:09:55,700 --> 00:10:02,750
purpose and expanding our own abilities

00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:08,810
that's really the central core two inner

00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:12,020
Drive another quote to what end and

00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:15,200
whose benefit are our employees being

00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:17,030
asked to give of themselves have we

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,100
committed ourselves to a purpose that is

00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:22,570
truly deserving of their initiative

00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,570
imagination and passion

00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:39,440
on in the book the smartest kids in the

00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:43,820
world there were on in the appendix

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:46,610
there's a lot of stuff about how to find

00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:48,800
a good school for your kids and some of

00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:50,470
the questions asked and it says when

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:55,510
searching for a school the leader

00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:59,030
matters more than any other factor and

00:10:55,510 --> 00:11:04,370
so the main leader in scrum is the

00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:06,830
product owner their job is to maximize

00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:13,580
the value of the product and the work of

00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:15,700
the development team so they they figure

00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:18,560
out what's the most important thing

00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:21,350
things most valuable for the company and

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,180
they put them in order and they make

00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:25,460
sure it's clear and visible to everyone

00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:31,550
in the company and that the dev team

00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:33,640
understands what they need on some more

00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:36,170
quotes from drive without management

00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:38,030
management isn't about walking around

00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:40,070
and seeing if people are in their

00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:44,480
offices it's about creating conditions

00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:46,010
for people to do their best work scrum

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,900
does this a little bit the product owner

00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:49,880
basically helps define what all the work

00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:54,800
is and then steps back and lots of scrum

00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:57,650
team do their thing another control

00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:02,840
leads to compliance autonomy leads to

00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:05,870
engagement and another quote after the

00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:07,910
introduction of the fine we observed a

00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:09,830
steady increase in the number of parents

00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:12,130
coming late the punishment didn't

00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:14,690
promote good behavior it crowded it out

00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:17,600
that this was an interesting experiment

00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:20,060
where there were student parents coming

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:24,160
to pick up their kids from school

00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:28,130
activities and some of the parents

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:30,410
arrive regularly on time and never you

00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:33,590
know a handful of them that didn't and

00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:37,850
so the school imposed a fine and they

00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:40,449
found that actually more people were

00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:44,899
late after the fine

00:12:40,449 --> 00:12:46,339
was put in place and it settled down at

00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:47,990
the end after a couple months so that

00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:52,850
about twice as many people are arriving

00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:55,790
late than originally so we can be aware

00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:58,459
of that and work that the more we try to

00:12:55,790 --> 00:13:00,850
constrain people the more likely to

00:12:58,459 --> 00:13:00,850
backfire

00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:29,520
in n sprint orange crumb there are goals

00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:32,880
and the purpose of the goal is its

00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:34,320
defined some coherence that will cause

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:39,870
the development team to work together

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:42,720
rather than on separate initiatives and

00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:45,210
the smartest kids one of the questions

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,950
to ask the students to find out if

00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:50,870
they're on task is what are you doing

00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:55,680
right now and why scrum believes in this

00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:57,810
principle so so that with each item that

00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:01,920
the development team is working on they

00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:05,190
know what it is and it's very clearly

00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:07,740
defined with user acceptance criteria of

00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:12,860
I won't know that this is done if all

00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:12,860
these things are taken care of and why

00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:20,820
they're generally written as sort of a

00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:23,370
story as so-and-so person in the company

00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:26,250
I want to be able to do this thing so

00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:27,900
that something about how it's going to

00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:31,110
make their job easier it's going to help

00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:32,940
some customer or whatever so things are

00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:36,960
very clearly defined in a way so that

00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:44,040
the people working on it understand what

00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:45,660
the what's at stake and how to think

00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,700
they can be motivated contained out

00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:53,730
there working on something bigger and it

00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:56,820
will help actual people a quote from

00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:59,190
quiet positive emotion is activated in

00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:03,360
response to the pursuit or capture of

00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:06,480
some resource that is valued so if we

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,820
know what what is valuable for the

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,920
company and its also valuable for us as

00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:15,270
employees and then we can work on that

00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:16,980
then we'll have positive emotion another

00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:19,650
from quiet if you focus on achieving

00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:22,620
your goals you don't want anything to

00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:26,010
get in your way this is both a good

00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:27,900
thing and a bad thing if you're very

00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,680
careful with your goals so that you set

00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:31,410
them limited

00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:34,140
enough so that it'll keep you focused

00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:37,339
and on task but not so focused that you

00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:37,339
forget about the big picture

00:15:47,149 --> 00:16:05,490
okay so then we have the development

00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:11,550
team the drill and a team there a fairly

00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:16,079
autonomous unit and their job is to

00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:18,450
define what an increment of work is so

00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,209
they take items off of the product

00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:23,970
backlog that the product owner has

00:16:20,209 --> 00:16:28,769
organized and put in order and they grab

00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:30,420
those off and they decide how much of

00:16:28,769 --> 00:16:32,430
those they can accomplish with Venice

00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:37,140
print which is always the same amount of

00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:39,420
time and they don't have any titles and

00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:41,880
you have enough of people with different

00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:44,459
varieties of backgrounds so that all the

00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:49,079
work can get accomplished either by

00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:51,000
working together in on their own but

00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:55,680
there's enough so that they can all do

00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,930
that a quote from the smartest kids

00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,970
students should not be frustrated or

00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:01,770
despairing instead they should be

00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:04,829
getting help when they need it often

00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:08,730
from each other and if you don't

00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:11,419
understand something what do you do this

00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:13,470
happens a lot in scrum where the team

00:17:11,419 --> 00:17:16,919
the development team will be very

00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:20,809
focused on what they're doing and they

00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:26,069
should be helping each other quite a bit

00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:28,199
and from quiet studies have shown that

00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:31,650
performance gets worst as group size

00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:34,320
increases groups of nine generate fewer

00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:36,840
and poorer ideas compared two groups of

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:42,929
six which do worse than groups of four

00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:45,480
and the scrum guide says that Velma team

00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:48,120
should be capped at nine people so they

00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,750
want between three and nine Ezra later

00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,750
optimum

00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:08,910
sprint planning is the time when those

00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:15,570
goals those items are brought from the

00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:17,370
product backlog into the sprint and if

00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:19,860
you have a one-month sprint than that

00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:21,360
meeting us eight hours long so if you

00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:24,840
have a shorter span there should be less

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:28,710
than that that's where the Sprint goal

00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:32,450
is really crafted by the entire scrum

00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:36,120
team and then it's decided by the

00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:40,230
development team what what items that

00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:43,980
are going to work on some things to

00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:45,930
remember a quote from quiet when your

00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:48,180
conscientiousness and tells you to take

00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:50,880
on more than you can handle you begin to

00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:53,850
lose interest even in tax that normally

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:57,450
engage you and this can be hard

00:18:53,850 --> 00:19:02,460
especially if the management team is

00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:04,530
putting deadlines the product owner is

00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:08,430
the one who decides when stuff goes live

00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:09,810
but the more pressure there is to do

00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:12,510
things within a certain amount of time

00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:14,870
the more you're going to burn out your

00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,870
team

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:31,260
another thing a concept that's really

00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:36,929
exciting to me this is talked about in

00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:39,600
both quiet and in drive is flow flow is

00:19:36,929 --> 00:19:42,809
an optimal state and what you feel

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,399
totally engaged in an activity in a

00:19:42,809 --> 00:19:46,529
state of flow you're neither born nor

00:19:44,399 --> 00:19:49,169
anxious and you don't question your own

00:19:46,529 --> 00:19:57,840
adequacy hours pass by without your

00:19:49,169 --> 00:20:00,419
noticing and enjoyment appears at the

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,760
boundary between boredom and anxiety

00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:06,059
when the challenges are just balance

00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:08,669
with the person's capacity to act so

00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:11,130
that's one of the goals I have and

00:20:08,669 --> 00:20:14,519
sprints is to make sure that the work

00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:17,669
that I'm choosing is something that's

00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:21,230
right in that balance between boredom

00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:21,230
and anxiety when it's just right

00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:33,380
in a daily scrum at the time to meet

00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:35,660
together once a day for about 15 minutes

00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:37,420
and make sure that everyone's on track

00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:46,160
that there aren't impediment going on

00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:48,490
and scrum tries to make it so that you

00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:51,440
don't need a lot of extra meetings and

00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:53,660
this is the one really small one that

00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,510
just happens every day and if you do it

00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:59,780
right then you can have a lot of little

00:20:56,510 --> 00:21:01,520
quick meetings right afterward and and

00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:10,910
that's pretty much it you don't need a

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:16,340
lot of extra meetings then we have the

00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:18,490
development work where the work gets

00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,490
done

00:21:21,389 --> 00:21:32,759
at the end on scrum says that it's very

00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:37,789
important to think about what what's

00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:37,789
gone well and what hasn't gone well and

00:21:38,509 --> 00:21:42,649
that's just an important thing

00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:51,570
and the Sprint review that's a time when

00:21:48,649 --> 00:21:53,389
the development team shows to the

00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:58,370
product owner and the business owners

00:21:53,389 --> 00:21:58,370
what happened and they make plans for

00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:04,730
what's going to be in an X print it's

00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:13,110
not a full planning but just sort of a

00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:15,799
get a gist of what's up next on product

00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:17,909
backlog we don't need to say much about

00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:20,159
there's another meeting that isn't

00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:23,690
defined formally but it does happen

00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:32,720
which is product backlog refinement

00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:37,619
refinement and this is to take the

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:39,149
product backlog and at first some of the

00:22:37,619 --> 00:22:40,649
items are going to be really broad

00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:42,840
themes things that are going to take two

00:22:40,649 --> 00:22:46,590
or three weeks maybe but as you get

00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:49,350
closer to implementing those then they

00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:50,929
get broken up into smaller pieces and so

00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:55,889
that's a meeting that happens regularly

00:22:50,929 --> 00:22:58,980
about that we already talked about

00:22:55,889 --> 00:23:04,769
certain backlog a little bit and a scrum

00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:06,629
master his or her role is really to work

00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:08,909
with the scrum team and to an

00:23:06,629 --> 00:23:13,019
organization to increase the

00:23:08,909 --> 00:23:15,749
transparency of the whole process so

00:23:13,019 --> 00:23:18,450
they're always learning trying to

00:23:15,749 --> 00:23:20,669
convince people about what works and

00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:23,429
what doesn't work and helping with

00:23:20,669 --> 00:23:26,789
change and they facilitate all the scrum

00:23:23,429 --> 00:23:29,460
events and they help them remove

00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:30,779
impediments in coaching they're just

00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:34,309
kind of the person to make sure that

00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:34,309
scrum is working and

00:23:37,429 --> 00:23:42,239
and that's what I've got that's just

00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:46,279
kind of a really quick overview of scrum

00:23:42,239 --> 00:23:49,549
and some of these ideas from this book

00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:49,549
