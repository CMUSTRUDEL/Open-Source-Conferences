Publication date: 2018-06-20
Playlist: TPC 2018 in SLC
Description: 
	Perl is available on nearly every Unix system, old and new. Learn how to use App::FatPacker, Moo, and CLI::Osprey to write apps that are much more powerful than “just a script”, but still pack down to a single file that runs on any machine with a Perl interpreter, with no need to install dependencies from CPAN.
