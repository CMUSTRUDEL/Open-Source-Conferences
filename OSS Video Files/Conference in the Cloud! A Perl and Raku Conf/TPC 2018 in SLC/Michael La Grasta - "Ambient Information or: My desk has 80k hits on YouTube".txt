Title: Michael La Grasta - "Ambient Information or: My desk has 80k hits on YouTube"
Publication date: 2018-06-19
Playlist: TPC 2018 in SLC
Description: 
	The exponential growth of data collection is on a collision course with the demands of the attention economy. Making information available with zero effort and minimal distraction help us all. This is the goal of ambient information devices and Perl is uniquely well suited to this. This talk will introduce the concept of ambient information and demonstrate easily created devices including the “DeskLights” project previously featured in multiple Maker Faires and STEM exhibits. The desk was briefly mentioned in my 2016 Lightning Talk and generated a lot of interest. This talk should appeal to people of all technical levels and will progress from idea to prototype to coding to refinement over years of use.

I'm Michael Agosta you can find me on

00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:08,250
Twitter github CP on the usual places as

00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:10,740
MN lagrasta I am the director of

00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,900
technology for the dr. J's comm family

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,190
companies that's online retail for

00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,789
clothing

00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:19,920
we have DJ premium for west coast isles

00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:22,070
and east coast isles mostly hip hop

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,949
urban street wear if you're into that

00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:27,390
like you know obviously there's a

00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:30,000
discount code for you good for the rest

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:35,430
of the month and i you know thank you to

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,950
them for helping me come out here the my

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:40,710
personal site is lagrasta calm and at

00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,809
coder calm I have some project

00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:47,129
information I have updates on these and

00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:49,739
other projects so this is ambient

00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:51,629
information my desk has 80,000 hits on

00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:53,690
YouTube a couple years ago I did a

00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:55,860
lightning talk and the last slide was

00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:57,840
meant to be a conversation starter and

00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:01,140
it was a picture of the videos of my

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,000
desk and so that was some interest and I

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,760
decided I would come back and do a talk

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,250
on it especially since the the really

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,770
interesting part is some Perl code for

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,630
me

00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:14,880
ambient information is information that

00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:18,210
is available with minimal effort and

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:23,400
without becoming a distraction until it

00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:25,080
must a little story to tell you where

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,850
this idea started for me and why I

00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,990
started appreciating these class of

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,659
devices that some people are

00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:33,390
experimenting with there's a research

00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:35,400
psychologist named Gary Klein who was

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:39,150
doing a lot of research into people who

00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:41,159
make quick effective decisions in

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:44,840
complex situations he was looking at

00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:48,540
medical personnel emergency personnel

00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:51,270
firefighters military and he wanted to

00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,500
find you know how this process worked

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,930
and why these people were able to make

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:58,079
good decisions so quickly they had such

00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:01,680
good gut reactions and he's since

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,909
developed a model of this and he did it

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,890
based on interviews with quite a few

00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:07,890
people and there's a fire chief he

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:11,370
interviewed you know your classic manly

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,569
man fire chief who reluctantly and a

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,069
little embarrassed

00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:16,650
admitted that he had had a psychic

00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:18,680
vision at one of his outings with his

00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:22,079
crew they'd gone out to fight a

00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,340
perfectly normal kitchen fire and they

00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:25,260
got there on the scene and the walls

00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,079
were coming up through the that flames

00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,859
were coming up through the walls and

00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:30,390
they started to do their normal

00:02:28,859 --> 00:02:32,310
containment things and he said this is

00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,409
just wrong and he says at that moment I

00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,959
had a vision of the floor falling out

00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:39,060
and all of us following to our death and

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,069
he yelled for everyone to get out of the

00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,389
room get out out out now and his team

00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:44,219
there was a solid team they listened

00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:46,500
they ran out the door and just as they

00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:48,450
did sure enough the entire kitchen falls

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,340
into the basement where the real fire

00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:52,079
had been raging for an hour already and

00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:55,319
consuming all the structure underneath

00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:59,129
and so through this process of interview

00:02:55,319 --> 00:03:02,370
he pulled out a lot of information the

00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:06,090
fire was way too hot for what he could

00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:07,379
visually see the there wasn't enough

00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,269
noise for the amount of heat being

00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:12,930
generated it should have been a raging

00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:15,989
roaring crackling fire and he felt the

00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:17,400
air rushing in he realized later that it

00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:19,260
was hard to breathe that the fire was

00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,090
sucking up so much oxygen which didn't

00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,760
make sense for this kitchen fire it

00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:26,280
didn't meet his expectations that he'd

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,470
developed over time and of course this

00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,229
wasn't really a psychic vision this was

00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:35,190
his brain our pattern-matching machine

00:03:31,229 --> 00:03:36,870
brains assembling wide array of data

00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:39,479
from around the room this temperature

00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:41,519
sound everything around him and he

00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:44,159
formed it into this coherent opinion

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,940
that said this is heat coming from the

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,560
wrong place this is wrong and this is

00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,449
what we call intuition and it can be

00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,629
built up over time and improved with

00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:56,970
experience but in addition your ability

00:03:54,629 --> 00:03:59,010
to take in data and the more data points

00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,970
you can understand and function with the

00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:02,340
better you can make these quick

00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,549
decisions so I thought about this for a

00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,889
while

00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:07,169
it's about getting information and I

00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:09,930
thought well this isn't it that's a lot

00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:11,909
of information but in my opinion these

00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:14,699
things are made for data center

00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:16,709
investors and not the system hints and

00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:18,389
then you have this kind of standard

00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:20,009
dashboard which has a lot of numbers

00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:21,930
it's good information to me this is more

00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:24,120
useful once an incident has occurred or

00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:25,290
you're trying to troubleshoot I'm not

00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,560
going to sit here and

00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:31,620
watch it so what other kinds of things

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,570
are just obvious and this is the famous

00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:36,120
weather rock that you can find all over

00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:37,680
the place if the stone is wet it's

00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,990
raining if the stone is dry it's not

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,630
raining you know this is a little

00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:45,860
oversimplified but that's the kind of

00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:49,260
intuitive thing that I was thinking of

00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:50,640
and truly ambient information would be

00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:53,160
something that you're just aware of or

00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:55,950
not aware of until you need to be like

00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:58,260
our senses you don't need to spend any

00:04:55,950 --> 00:05:00,300
effort deciding if you're hot or cold or

00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:02,400
it's too dark or too light you just know

00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,410
about these things you just know the

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,030
state of things until there's a change

00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:08,220
that warrants your attention suddenly

00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:13,340
it's very cold you need to do something

00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:15,780
about it so I was thinking about ways to

00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:18,150
present this kind of information and we

00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:21,660
moved into a new office space and we

00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:25,560
were given these glass desks and version

00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:29,850
one was born it had eight individually

00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:31,170
controlled lights very simple but I

00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:33,480
played around with assigning different

00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:37,860
colors and meanings to different areas

00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:39,780
on the desk and you know build processes

00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,360
could go fade from one color to another

00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:44,880
turn red when they went wrong server

00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,500
alerts things like that and and I

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:51,150
stopped missing phone calls when I was

00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:52,320
wearing my headphones this was just

00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,540
built on eight of these lights from

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,850
thing em they're just USB one USB

00:05:54,540 --> 00:06:00,090
controller and it was good it was

00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:02,760
interesting I used some foam core and

00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:04,620
zip ties and just taped it under a desk

00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,300
as a first experiment you know just like

00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,340
you give yourself permission to fail I

00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,290
give myself permission to use cheap

00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:12,740
prototype materials so that I don't

00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:16,650
hesitate to build things several times

00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:19,980
well it was actually quite well-received

00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:24,180
I posted it on YouTube sent it you know

00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:25,920
did a write-up on Instructables and it

00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,200
started getting thousands of views and

00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:31,440
so I was invited to the Bay Area Maker

00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:34,140
Faire to display it and I decided well

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,960
I've got to write this up I'm not gonna

00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:38,520
bring eight little lights all the way to

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:45,870
Bay Area Maker Faire

00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:48,449
so I added about 232 more LEDs and a lot

00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:51,240
more zip ties I upgraded to pegboard

00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:52,770
from foam core although I have since

00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:58,349
returned to my foam core roots you'll

00:06:52,770 --> 00:07:00,660
see in a minute and it's still very

00:06:58,349 --> 00:07:03,660
simple and Arduino that's an Arduino Uno

00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:05,669
ethernet which at the time was the only

00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,710
one with an Ethernet connection built in

00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:10,560
that since obsolete which prompted some

00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:12,990
upgrades along the way but the core of

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,280
this just this idea of just displaying

00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:17,669
this information different colors

00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:19,949
position has proven very useful for me

00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:22,259
and that Arduino is no longer available

00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:24,900
and the other thing that evolved over

00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:27,270
time was then I put less intelligence

00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:29,340
into the desk at first the desk had its

00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:32,430
it's a webserver obviously it has a rest

00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:33,840
type interface but it was going out and

00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:35,909
querying things and that just was

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,740
backwards so then I moved the

00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:41,190
intelligence into a Perl script and now

00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:43,530
I could scrape Nagios I could watch the

00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:45,930
VoIP phone systems I could you know get

00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:49,229
input from anywhere I wanted and then it

00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:52,139
became a lot more interesting so this is

00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:55,320
what it's running on now this is the

00:07:52,139 --> 00:08:00,330
Adafruit feather huzzah which is just an

00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:02,520
Arduino with an esp8266 daughterboard

00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:07,710
sandwich to it Sparkfun has their own

00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:10,199
version that Arduino cost $65 now you

00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:13,259
know they're 16 you can use any generic

00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:16,759
one off the internet eBay Amazon

00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:20,610
whatever it's really become a lot more

00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:23,370
available was able to simplify the code

00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:27,919
quite a bit the desk can now report back

00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:27,919
on its status and things like that

00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:34,950
in fact as interesting when I went to

00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:36,750
Maker Faire they asked me if this needed

00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:41,310
to be in their dark room where they put

00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:43,500
LED based projects and I said no it's

00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:45,089
pretty bright I think it'll be okay it's

00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:48,589
really meant to be viewed in a normal

00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:48,589
office environment

00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:54,060
and it has some patterns it can run in

00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:55,770
the background obviously it doesn't do

00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,660
this when I'm doing point normal routine

00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:59,540
at work that was one of the comments I

00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,890
got is how do you get any work done

00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:03,480
doesn't normally do this the whole point

00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:07,830
is that it usually does not much of

00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:09,720
anything but as a retail business we

00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:11,310
have so much of our business done during

00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,850
the holidays and it's a super critical

00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:16,560
time and so now we you know the desk is

00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:18,600
just there I'm doing my work the system

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,370
mins have their monitoring tools but you

00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,959
know as the guy who's ultimately going

00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:25,170
to be yelled at when the site's down I

00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:28,890
like to know oh it's kind of a red day

00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:33,230
today what's going on and so you know it

00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:35,130
really does help give you that automatic

00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:36,959
understanding of what's going on

00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:40,470
whatever kind of thing you're addressing

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,790
to it it uses you're not supposed to

00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,890
read that don't worry they'll be more

00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:47,730
detail but this is the standard Arduino

00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:49,470
IDE it's again very basic tools anybody

00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:51,899
familiar with that kind of code will see

00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:57,420
your normal initialization setup

00:09:51,899 --> 00:10:03,089
routines the light modules have drivers

00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:04,980
at Adafruit made and the Wi-Fi chip has

00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:07,860
a library not only for itself but is

00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:10,500
some basic web server functions so then

00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,940
you can register route handlers just

00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:17,459
like many other systems you're familiar

00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:21,240
with and and then you can see the sort

00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:23,250
of API that I created with this I have

00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:26,520
that added the concept of a frame which

00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:28,680
is the entire state of the display so

00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:33,420
that you can get or set the entire

00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:36,029
display and it actually even can do

00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:38,279
small animations then it has a built in

00:10:36,029 --> 00:10:40,350
function for alerts and some things like

00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:45,839
that so I'll show you that in just a

00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:48,779
minute you can hit it with curl

00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,250
obviously and then just about any

00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:53,130
scripting language on the planet can

00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:55,560
make requests I use the environment

00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:57,779
variable just to reduce some config for

00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,250
the perl script but you can see here's a

00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:01,870
result of a get info call it actually

00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:07,070
returns JSON

00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:07,820
and then here's an example portal script

00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:11,000
not just kidding

00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:16,790
that is obfuscated Perl contest winner

00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:22,310
from the first time let me let me switch

00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:25,300
over to that real quick see if you guys

00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:25,300
can see this

00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,530
sorry it's not coming up online

00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:11,670
so this is the Arduino code I don't

00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:13,740
think there's actually much to go into

00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:17,790
here because I have tried to make it

00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:21,170
very much you know just a display but if

00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:21,170
we switch to

00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:39,540
this is the Perl code it takes some

00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:42,570
basic parameters the IP address if you

00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:45,180
want you can specify the X&Y let's have

00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:46,620
a grid it does that automatically for

00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:49,950
you though

00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:52,350
and it's got some commands like the set

00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:53,579
frame command is actually a post where

00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:57,000
the others are gets just because of the

00:12:53,579 --> 00:13:01,130
amount of data it sends each color value

00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,240
as a hex or integer in decimal form and

00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:05,910
displays that so you can see a couple

00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:09,630
wrapper functions and then I actually

00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:21,680
tried to document it I know that's it's

00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:25,350
not very popular sometimes then sorry

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:28,459
I'm bringing this back over here that is

00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:28,459
not easy to see

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:48,470
so I was supposed to give the effect of

00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,520
the frosted glass there are a few things

00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:52,610
you just don't want to bring through

00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:54,020
airport security it was nerve-racking

00:13:52,610 --> 00:14:01,700
enough to bring this through and hoping

00:13:54,020 --> 00:14:05,000
that it would make it so the desk does

00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:09,260
again it has some background patterns

00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:25,040
that it'll run the built-in alert

00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:26,750
functions each color value is just 32

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,370
bit like I said so you can use web

00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:32,150
colors that you're familiar with like F

00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:44,960
F F F F F F F F and it will display them

00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:48,500
you can also set duration and things the

00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:50,750
interesting thing is we typically think

00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:54,080
of you know web responses as being

00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:56,030
fairly slow but you can actually each

00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:58,520
one of these changes is a separate curl

00:14:56,030 --> 00:15:00,440
command to it so it turns out that you

00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:03,440
can actually do some things pretty

00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:09,640
quickly depending on your network

00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:14,720
traffic and one of the other things that

00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:18,830
is new to this is that you can send

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:22,100
whole frames of images to it so if you

00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:24,890
pass it an image anything that GD

00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:30,650
understands it will actually convert it

00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:33,880
to it'll resize it and then put it on

00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:33,880
the display

00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:44,749
so I found that to be a lot easier when

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,399
you know coming up with some of these

00:15:44,749 --> 00:15:48,470
things instead of setting the pixels in

00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:53,019
programming and individually I can just

00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:53,019
take images and throw them to the board

00:16:02,949 --> 00:16:11,720
so this takes between five and six amps

00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:14,089
to run but there's no reason it has to

00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:17,059
be this bigger complex I found that you

00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:19,160
know one light in the right place or you

00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:22,459
know one status or put it behind a map

00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:24,529
and we're tracking you know visitor

00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:27,110
counts coming in where our orders coming

00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:29,420
from you know customer service can see

00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:31,790
things it's really neat you know you

00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:33,410
just don't think about it anymore and

00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:37,819
then suddenly this information is is

00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:38,870
coming to you on its own and that is you

00:16:37,819 --> 00:16:40,879
know what I think is really the

00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:44,660
interesting part of this is you can only

00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:46,430
develop your intuition so fast but we're

00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:49,480
generating so much information between

00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:52,009
you know the normal Big Data trends and

00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:55,670
the amount of stuff we're saving we're

00:16:52,009 --> 00:16:57,620
using machine learning just to just to

00:16:55,670 --> 00:17:00,110
decide what is important enough to look

00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:02,149
at you know so I think that different

00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:04,399
ways of consuming and looking at this

00:17:02,149 --> 00:17:08,089
information is just going to become more

00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:11,079
and more valuable over time so I'm open

00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:11,079
for questions if you have any

00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:26,709
yeah I found that frames is really

00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:28,840
helpful because I can create an overall

00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:30,850
picture one of the things I did was now

00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:33,100
the alerts and those commands they

00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:34,659
record the state and then set the alert

00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,399
and then put the state back which is a

00:17:34,659 --> 00:17:40,120
nice step instead of clearing out what

00:17:36,399 --> 00:17:41,770
was there but really I think of this now

00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,210
as just a display those times when you

00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,559
might have a monitor on the wall or

00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:46,659
something like that

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:49,059
this can be spread over an entire wall

00:17:46,659 --> 00:17:51,159
it can be one pixel it can be a thousand

00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:53,740
pixels you know when you watch a fancy

00:17:51,159 --> 00:17:55,779
game show or you know one of the music

00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:58,570
contests on TV and you see that giant

00:17:55,779 --> 00:18:02,380
screen behind them it's these it's just

00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:04,630
a lot of these so this really is I mean

00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:08,380
you can make Jumbotron you can make one

00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:14,230
pixel and having less intelligence in

00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:16,299
the display and more in you know the

00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:18,549
thing gathering and sending commands has

00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:21,429
really been interesting like I said the

00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:24,580
Tyendinaga Oz was was a blast because

00:18:21,429 --> 00:18:27,130
during holiday I made a grid of all of

00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:31,179
our servers and it was you know load

00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:33,520
average and visitor count and you know

00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:35,230
RAM utilization and you just sort of

00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,610
watched it you know just over time you

00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:38,470
would know and like I said you get this

00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:40,059
general feeling for it

00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:41,710
hey we're getting spikes every day

00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:45,730
around 11 o'clock what's what's

00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:48,070
happening then so you know really just

00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:49,990
that translating this overly complicated

00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:51,730
fragmented information into something

00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:57,750
that's just there and it you know

00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:57,750
without thinking about it anything else

00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:17,850
yeah the only time I really do things

00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:20,070
that specifically is when you know it's

00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:21,960
typically inside of a glass desk so I'll

00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:24,210
just mark it up with dry erase markers

00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,910
and I'll reassign it you know we're

00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:29,730
doing a big series of builds I'll do you

00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:33,210
know test and compile and this module or

00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:35,970
that module you know we we were fighting

00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:37,310
an attack which we thought was a DDoS

00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:41,580
attack but it was just a really

00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:43,020
incompetent password crack all of our

00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:45,030
attacks are incompetent I guess we're

00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:46,290
lucky you know I would really like to

00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:48,810
see somebody knows what they're doing

00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:50,250
but you know we have a lot of people

00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:51,600
trying to break credit cards and so

00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,670
sometimes we'll monitor you know that

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,760
level of activity in timeouts and things

00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:58,410
like that you know I've shut off my

00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,970
phone so I don't do that for phone calls

00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:02,720
anymore because there aren't any good

00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:05,160
phone calls for me anymore

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,870
but yeah there's it turns out there's a

00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:09,570
lot of things I've also been contacted

00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:11,010
by hospitals where they're representing

00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:12,960
you know they want to do patient room

00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:14,970
statuses and if you can figure out a

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,590
good way to make an index to aggregate

00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:19,620
that different information into one

00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:21,210
thing you know you can see it music

00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,860
studios where they don't want sound they

00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:24,780
don't want you know bringing phones or

00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:26,250
things or places where it's too loud and

00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:28,830
you need something you can see instead

00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:31,470
of here and then I've got plenty of

00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:34,080
requests for just purely cosmetic

00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:35,730
displace you know the in fact I think

00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,950
you're fair a girl came up to me and

00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:39,420
asked me how you could do this battery

00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:42,900
operated because she wanted that to be

00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:44,250
her prom dress so it's really been all

00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,420
over the map I mean I can't tell you how

00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,010
many people told me I should put an

00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:51,180
audio input on it and make my desk and

00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:53,850
EQ and that's just not you know that's

00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:56,820
cool but you know for me it's it's more

00:20:53,850 --> 00:21:00,030
about consumption of information with

00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:02,340
little effort but the more I dig into it

00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:06,390
the more I find that there are an

00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:08,450
incredible number of metrics okay thank

00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,450
you

00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:13,859
