Title: Scott Lee - "Writing Testable Code"
Publication date: 2018-06-20
Playlist: TPC 2018 in SLC
Description: 
	Writing tests is easy — as long as the code is designed to be testable. If your code is hard to test then this presentation will help you see a better way to write that code. More than a check list of dos and don’ts, we will focus on how to change the way you think about programming. The goal is to help you understand why and how tests help you write better code and do it faster. This will improve not only your tests, but your code and your documentation as well.
