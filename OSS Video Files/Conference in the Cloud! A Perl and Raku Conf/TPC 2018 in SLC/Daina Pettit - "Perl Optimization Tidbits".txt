Description: 
	Have you ever wondered how much difference Perl coding styles make to performance? Perl has lots of ways to do the same thing, and some are more readable/maintainable, but are slower or consume more memory…or is it the other way around?

We’ll look at Perl syntax and see what performs better or worse and why. Maybe your favorite syntax is an awesome efficient race horse, maybe it’s a pig, or maybe it makes no difference. Come see your dreams shattered, hopes dashed, or realize how awesome your syntax choices really are!
