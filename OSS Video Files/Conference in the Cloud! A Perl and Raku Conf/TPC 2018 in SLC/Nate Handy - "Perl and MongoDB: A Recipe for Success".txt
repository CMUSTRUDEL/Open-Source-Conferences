Title: Nate Handy - "Perl and MongoDB: A Recipe for Success"
Publication date: 2018-06-21
Playlist: TPC 2018 in SLC
Description: 
	Using Mongo in Perl (warning puns and Dad jokes abound):

Lettuce take some thyme to look into chow we could store recipes butter. If you carrot all about cooking, Nate will taco ‘bout what turniped, and olive the knowledge he gained, when going on a journey to store recipes in a document store vs a relational db. Oven if you don’t like cooking ewe could probably pick up a pizza knowledge here or there. Hoping to leave no scone unturned.

all right welcome and thanks to all of

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:12,570
you who turn up my name is nate handy

00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:17,670
there's a little bit about me yes I am a

00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:21,630
man I am currently employed at Bluehost

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:25,380
of which is there's quite a large

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:29,519
percentage of the the audience here who

00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:31,740
is Bluehost at this point I am sure

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,110
you've heard this almost at every

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:37,530
presentation so I'm gonna say it a

00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:39,840
little bit differently I am NOT being

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,719
mandated to tell you that as an

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:48,289
organization we are seeking Perl Wizards

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:51,809
to embark on a quest of programmatic

00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:54,719
nature in parties and varying skills and

00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:58,469
powers with the end goal being to level

00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:02,250
up our features and to altom utley

00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:06,409
vanquish the evil production s budget is

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:11,180
oh and there's a epic loot involved so

00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:13,680
anyway I I enjoy working for Bluehost

00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:17,220
we have a really good team that I work

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,979
on right now and it's a lot of fun so a

00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:25,080
little bit of my background I've spent a

00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:29,009
lot of time in databases B I work as

00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:35,090
well as just varying databases

00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:38,240
everything from smaller databases to

00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:43,829
large-scale production environments or

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:45,509
enterprise environments I I have been

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:47,790
working with parole I've taken breaks

00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:51,590
from time to time at different jobs but

00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:58,170
I always seem to be coming back to Pearl

00:01:51,590 --> 00:02:02,430
I I currently have four kids and two of

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:05,579
them are teenagers one's a tween raising

00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:08,970
two teenagers it's not a piece of cake

00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:13,350
and as most of you know the cake is a

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:19,800
lie so I I'm a dad which

00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:22,520
is apparent so so this is where we talk

00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,560
about what's acceptable and groans are

00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:29,460
completely acceptable responses to this

00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:32,630
talk so I get plenty of those from my

00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:36,240
teenagers I roles are also acceptable

00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:39,150
face palms especially the card level

00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:42,560
face palms are definitely acceptable I

00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:45,270
ask that you do not throw anything

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,210
unless you know and here's a couple of

00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:50,070
caveats that it is a non-perishable food

00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:53,190
that is still contained in its original

00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:55,740
packaging uh Nate and pastries are also

00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:57,390
acceptable and money I will always

00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:06,030
accept the money thrown at me

00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:09,230
so speaking of dads I might add he is

00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:14,160
just like a father to me

00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:17,460
no no really even married my mother with

00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:19,620
Father's Day having just happened I I

00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:24,660
want to share a little story about my

00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:25,940
dad and a long time ago in a country far

00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,230
far away

00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:30,950
Germany specifically my dad was living

00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:35,310
there and he got invited over to dinner

00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:38,400
with his roommate and when they arrived

00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:41,010
at the location they the smells

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,730
permeating from the kitchen were just

00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:49,590
overwhelming and this is what he smelled

00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:51,330
beautiful roast just his he was

00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:55,050
salivating like no other he's like oh

00:03:51,330 --> 00:04:00,540
this is gonna be so great this is what

00:03:55,050 --> 00:04:04,640
he saw on his mind it's so the the host

00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:07,620
brought out the food under a silver tray

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,620
silver cover placed it on and lifted it

00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,660
off now before we get to what he saw I

00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:19,230
want to talk about something and that is

00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:21,030
fat content in Rose so as as you as you

00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:23,280
talk about roasts you go with kind of a

00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:25,820
leaner cut a sirloin cut you get about

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,550
seven to ten percent fat content

00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:31,100
it's a little not quite as flavorful as

00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:34,340
maybe a round roast which you get up to

00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:37,790
10 to 15% go up to a chuck which is a

00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:40,160
really nice flavorful roast especially

00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:43,130
cook it a long time and get that fat to

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:46,370
break down so and then you talk about

00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:49,670
like ground meat you can go from really

00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:52,250
lean like a 2% all the way to 30% which

00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:53,420
is like a third of your you know burger

00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:56,750
if you're making a burger on the grill

00:04:53,420 --> 00:05:00,040
is just gonna melt off as you're cooking

00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:04,880
it and it makes for a really flavorful

00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:07,940
so one thing that my dad didn't

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:15,250
anticipate with the smell was that his

00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:17,840
roast looked like this it had 95% fat I

00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:21,310
couldn't find an image that would fully

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:24,470
represent this so I did a faithful write

00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:28,550
recreation of it that was the meat there

00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:30,140
the rest was fat he he saw it and

00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:32,840
thought okay well there's a little bit

00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:34,490
of fat I'm gonna you know well we'll

00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:37,310
have a little bit or sorry a little bit

00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:40,600
of meat we'll have a little bit to eat

00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:43,070
there his host proceeded to carve off

00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:46,040
the meat and place it in front of her

00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:51,170
plate because she prized the fat as the

00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:54,170
the the Preem prime cut of the of the

00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:59,240
meat she proceeded to cut into cubes

00:05:54,170 --> 00:06:01,820
about an inch in Kubik nature and plump

00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:06,520
on about 10 of them onto each of their

00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:09,320
plates my dad looked at this and well

00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:12,470
this is this is essentially what he saw

00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:14,990
they're just these big globs of fat that

00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:17,810
weren't quite cooked all the way

00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:19,670
and is you've had that that hasn't been

00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:23,120
cooked all the way it's not pleasant

00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:27,170
said it was like tasting rubber so

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:29,120
anyway he uh he tried to chew through

00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:32,120
these and it would just was not breaking

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,180
down so he decided to just go ahead and

00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:37,160
eat him like a pill and so he threw a

00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:39,319
bunch in in his mouth and just took a

00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,319
huge gulp of water

00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:44,869
swallowed them all down well the host

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:48,439
took this as he was really enjoying them

00:06:44,869 --> 00:06:51,199
and so she piled on quite a few more and

00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:53,349
at this point my dad said I can't I

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,330
really can't do it anymore

00:06:53,349 --> 00:06:58,460
so he was looking for a way out because

00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:03,439
he didn't want to be rude and he turned

00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:06,680
and looked and saw this saw window and

00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:08,509
he thought okay this is perfect I'm out

00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,479
of water let me ask for some more water

00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:14,059
and while she's gone

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:21,619
you know I'll I'll go ahead and you know

00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:24,199
just toss him out so as she left the the

00:07:21,619 --> 00:07:27,430
the room to go get a refill he grabbed a

00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:30,559
handful and he threw him at the window

00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:38,839
this is where we talk about the amazing

00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:41,719
product that Windex is so when does this

00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:45,199
is an amazing product it can could make

00:07:41,719 --> 00:07:48,139
seem like windows aren't really there

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,809
and that's what my dad didn't really

00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:52,879
sense was that there wasn't an open

00:07:50,809 --> 00:07:56,240
window there was a closed window and

00:07:52,879 --> 00:08:00,529
when the flat the fat splattered against

00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:03,169
the wall his roommate proceeded to roll

00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:07,490
on the floor laughing because of the

00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:09,080
situation so he he got his roommate to

00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:11,300
get up go and distract their host

00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,580
scooped up the fat open the window

00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:16,249
tossed it out kind of fluffed the drapes

00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:18,589
to make sure that it didn't appear like

00:08:16,249 --> 00:08:22,430
it was there and then quickly made their

00:08:18,589 --> 00:08:24,080
goodbyes not the not the proudest moment

00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:32,539
I would say but it makes for a great

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:34,610
story so why why did I tell this I would

00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:35,479
say that what we can learn from that

00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:40,880
story is

00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:43,430
oh it's best not to assume you you you

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,649
don't you don't assume that you know

00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:52,520
everything going into a situation and

00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:56,410
it's best to analyze that so the

00:08:52,520 --> 00:09:01,160
the what I want to talk about now is

00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:03,860
recipes I love to cook I love to I do

00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,950
kind of all forms of cooking the the

00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:09,350
latest I've gotten a sous-vide machine

00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:12,560
and it's been great super tender

00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:14,360
but I'd like to do my own stuff but

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,930
occasionally I do like to look up

00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:20,870
recipes gather intel on them but I have

00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:24,830
a few gripes about them so my recipe

00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:27,080
gripes are when I look up a recipe is I

00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:30,500
don't need your life story I don't need

00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:33,560
to know how it changed your life this

00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:36,770
one recipe I really don't like reading

00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:38,510
paragraphs of text through and through

00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:42,380
just get to the point what am i doing

00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:45,140
and you know recipes as they stand

00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:47,240
aren't very visual they they don't kind

00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:53,020
of jump out to you as what it is you're

00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:58,460
you're going a path to go and so I I

00:09:53,020 --> 00:10:01,880
went to a talk a few a few years ago at

00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:03,380
the local open with the open source

00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:06,970
conference here and someone was

00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:11,630
presenting on MongoDB and they shared

00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:15,380
some interesting information about it

00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:17,210
and I I was very intrigued so the

00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:20,810
individuals shared something like this

00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:24,080
and said okay this is what MongoDB

00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:27,200
storage looks like we've got this what

00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:29,770
what they call document shows a data

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:35,720
structure that looks a lot like JSON and

00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:39,260
that you've got nested structure and the

00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:46,900
first thing I thought when I saw this

00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:46,900
was wow that looks like a recipe well I

00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:54,670
maybe it's not perfectly obvious to

00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:57,680
everyone so let me explain my reasoning

00:10:54,670 --> 00:11:01,220
here here we have a bunch of different

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:04,340
containers you've got different

00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:06,440
ingredients and what is a recipe more

00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:09,740
than manipulating

00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,540
container placing it in combining with

00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:13,820
other containers into a bigger container

00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:16,730
and so on and so forth until they're all

00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:19,850
combined in one container in the end so

00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:22,490
to me that looks like a nested structure

00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:27,890
that flows up from the very deepest

00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:29,840
level so before we get into how I I

00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:34,400
structured this a little bit let's go

00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:38,120
over some quick MongoDB basics just as I

00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:41,840
reference them so just kind of versus

00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:43,970
your standard relational sequel

00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:49,640
terminology so you've got a collection

00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:51,950
which typically is a table document

00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:55,580
which equals kind of a record or row and

00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:57,410
then those are broken out your where you

00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:59,870
typically have your column you have your

00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:02,030
key and you have your value so going

00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:04,970
back to there you know you've got this

00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:07,430
this is a document here the name would

00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:09,530
be key and then Joe is the value and so

00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:18,620
on and so forth and they can be nested

00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:23,480
through so I set up quick MySQL

00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:26,270
structure just to to essentially get to

00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:33,050
where I would like to be with with the

00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:36,080
output of my database to be consumed by

00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:39,710
the front-end so I've got a recipe I've

00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:44,660
got steps which kind of can contain

00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:47,240
other steps got a ingredients which are

00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:51,860
included in each particular step and

00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:55,910
then I've got the actual ingredients and

00:12:51,860 --> 00:13:01,430
they're their names linked to the to

00:12:55,910 --> 00:13:03,920
each step at this point talk about what

00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:06,080
with the MongoDB structure one of the

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,089
cool things about MongoDB is you don't

00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:12,020
need to necessarily have the structure

00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:14,270
set up beforehand you can just supply it

00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:16,040
to it and it'll it'll allow that

00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:19,420
structure to go through now you can do

00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,420
validation and in strict

00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:25,250
mature that there is validation on the

00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:27,800
structure on inserts and updates to make

00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:30,850
sure that you maintain integrity but

00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:34,550
this is essentially what I came up with

00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:38,800
so this would be the recipe for making a

00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:41,839
ham sandwich so if we if we talk about

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:44,240
at the very deepest level here you've

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:47,240
got your ingredients which are bread and

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:50,510
mayo the action is go ahead and spread

00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:53,270
mail on the bread and then go up one

00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:56,330
level further and then you place the ham

00:13:53,270 --> 00:14:00,170
and cheese between the bread go up one

00:13:56,330 --> 00:14:01,970
let's go up one level further because I

00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:05,140
really like cheese I'm gonna add more

00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:08,029
cheese and so on and so forth so that

00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:11,839
that's kind of the structure is it this

00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:14,089
nested approach have listed out all the

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:18,110
ingredients that are associated with it

00:14:14,089 --> 00:14:20,750
as well so visually I had this kind of

00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:24,170
concept to go about it so this would be

00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:27,140
the the deepest level of it so in this

00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:28,820
case I am making some cheesy grits so

00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:32,720
the first thing I do is I take some

00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:34,880
water and some salt and boil it the next

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,160
step which it would kind of zoom out on

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,170
would be okay we're gonna take some

00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:42,650
cornmeal once it's boiled you take some

00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:44,390
cornmeal gradually whisk it in from that

00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:47,180
point you go ahead and reduce the

00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:49,850
temperature to low stir until thickens

00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:52,910
which is about roughly 15 to 20 minutes

00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:55,100
at that point you zoom back out and you

00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:57,740
take off the heat and then you add in

00:14:55,100 --> 00:15:00,740
the parmesan the butter the milk parsley

00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:03,920
you stir it until the cheese and butter

00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:05,240
are melted at that point you go ahead

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,640
and season with salt and pepper

00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:10,610
and you're done so as you can see this

00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:15,050
the structure kind of goes from an

00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:22,190
inward all the way out approach kind of

00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:24,980
a a zoom out approach so what what were

00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:28,130
my MongoDB assumptions heading into this

00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:29,839
because I I wanted to do this but I was

00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:33,440
a little worried about a couple of

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:35,720
things one is I am I

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:38,780
gonna get it to a place where it's

00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:41,540
acceptable from a from a performance

00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:45,890
standpoint can I get it to where it

00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:48,500
performs like a relational database are

00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:51,530
the querying how is the querying going

00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:53,690
to be because it seems like you know

00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:55,790
coming from a relational table table

00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:59,060
standpoint I'm familiar with that

00:15:55,790 --> 00:16:02,560
I know join in tables how to do all that

00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:05,080
what what does the Quarian look like so

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:09,920
let's go ahead and move on to

00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:14,180
implementing this in Perl there's a

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:16,430
couple of great modules obviously I just

00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:21,350
went ahead and used the default to a DB

00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:23,570
I for the MySQL piece for the DB

00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:26,120
there's just a module called DB

00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:28,940
which makes the purple pearl

00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:32,630
implementation really easy so let's

00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:37,690
let's go ahead and compare the two

00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:37,690
between what it looks like in Perl

00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:49,990
apparently my animations are awesome

00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:52,430
there we go okay so for for the MySQL

00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:55,040
implementation you go ahead and open a

00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:57,170
DVI connection you pass in everything oh

00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:02,240
no I forgot to take out my password

00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:04,310
sorry about that for you you you

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,980
can set up a client which is basically

00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:10,220
the database connection and then like

00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:13,189
the collection was said you can go ahead

00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:17,740
and specify a particular table you can

00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:21,439
also make a direct call to DB

00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:23,360
 collection and just pass it the

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,579
additional collection that you want to

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,920
and get that so you could do it in one

00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:31,430
line I showed it is to to show that the

00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:34,010
distinction so on inserts how do we go

00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:39,230
about doing inserts so we can go ahead

00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:42,440
and do a basic DBH do which is awesome

00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:44,420
but probably or better would be actually

00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,210
preparing the statement and passing and

00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:50,380
bind variables

00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:53,409
prevent sequel injection and so for the

00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:55,450
MongoDB it's kind of nice you don't

00:17:53,409 --> 00:17:57,909
really have that whole sequel injection

00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:59,590
piece you've got this data structure as

00:17:57,909 --> 00:18:03,100
you can see I've just got a hash with

00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:06,700
one element called name name and it

00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:08,470
Burton toast and at this point you're

00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:11,740
not really worried about the sequel

00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:14,860
injection I guess the only case would be

00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:17,260
is if you as part of your program we're

00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:19,510
actually iterating over these values and

00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:24,159
maybe doing system calls on them which

00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:27,340
I'd highly suggest you don't against

00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:30,460
data that isn't validated anyway so

00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:32,169
insert that's so it's pretty pretty

00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:33,820
straightforward okay well what about

00:18:32,169 --> 00:18:36,580
crane I was a little bit worried about

00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:39,760
this so I've got I've got my query

00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:43,380
statement I want to grab from recipe

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:46,240
where they were the names like toast

00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:51,610
that's pretty straightforward and we

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:54,909
pull out the values in a hash ref so in

00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:58,270
 how do we do that well you build

00:18:54,909 --> 00:19:01,179
it just like the the structure that you

00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:03,279
have so I have name as an element and

00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:06,190
then you can go ahead and pass in a

00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:08,380
regular expression so in this case I

00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:12,250
just want to grab where it's like toast

00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:14,620
and not case-sensitive and then from

00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:16,779
that data object you go ahead and just

00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:20,830
grab the next one which is just like a

00:19:16,779 --> 00:19:27,570
fetch row so that's actually pretty easy

00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:32,770
at this point so so it's time to test

00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:37,240
and I I would like to say at this point

00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:38,830
I that I went ahead and used this but

00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:42,250
I'll be honest I didn't learn about this

00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:45,220
until Monday when David gave that great

00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:47,289
talk on on higher order functions this

00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:48,909
this is a really good talk you should go

00:19:47,289 --> 00:19:53,470
back and see it if you if you didn't

00:19:48,909 --> 00:19:58,440
date a fake really good for making fake

00:19:53,470 --> 00:20:03,030
data I I wanted to create

00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:07,080
fake data and make it plausible so I set

00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:11,280
up some rules for me this is this is the

00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:15,180
module that I created basically I picked

00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:17,580
at random a protein a veggie two spices

00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:21,680
and an action I figured with that I

00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:26,400
could create a fake recipe that sounded

00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:28,230
pretty pretty good and so with that I

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:32,220
went ahead and generated a hundred

00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:35,940
thousand fake recipes went ahead and

00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:40,530
inserted them both into MySQL and into

00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:45,150
MongoDB and the results were really

00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:48,870
interesting actually so I in fact I

00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:50,970
liked them so much I took the next

00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:55,770
logical step than any person would do

00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:58,710
and I'm starting a restaurant as you can

00:20:55,770 --> 00:21:01,500
see these are these are some very

00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:05,010
interesting recipes that that my

00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:07,500
generator came up with I think my

00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:12,690
favorite is the roasted sea pork with

00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:15,270
guajillo tomatillo but anyway it was

00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:18,450
lots of fun and I realized that playing

00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:20,670
with random data can be lots of fun and

00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:24,360
waste a lot of your time just looking at

00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:28,590
these so anyway this is this was the

00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:31,550
real fun part of my my experiment so

00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:35,390
let's let's go ahead and catch up on the

00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:38,400
actual testing that we're doing here so

00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:40,620
what I wanted to do was I inserted

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,810
around a hundred thousand recipes and

00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:47,400
these were the test scenarios they

00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:49,890
weren't super comprehensive but I wanted

00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,990
to just count based on the name so I did

00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:55,140
that similar query to what I did before

00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:59,720
which was grab one of the ingredients

00:21:55,140 --> 00:22:03,000
and say oh how many recipes had this

00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:05,490
ingredient in the name I also did a

00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,070
count based on one ingredient so I

00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:10,140
searched the particular ingredient and

00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:12,690
said how many recipes contain this

00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:14,940
ingredient a little bit different

00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:19,950
because of the structure but essentially

00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:23,700
the same then I also did details so I

00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:26,760
pulled out the entire recipe including

00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:28,530
in MySQL I converted it from just a

00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:31,440
bunch of rows which would have been like

00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:33,300
five six rows to the actual data the

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,390
nested data structure that it looks like

00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:37,950
because my end goal would be to hand

00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:44,100
this off to a front end that could

00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:48,450
display like I showed before so the the

00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:50,780
full recipe with parsing to JSON so I

00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:55,650
decided to run this a hundred times

00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:58,920
through this scenario and each and timed

00:22:55,650 --> 00:23:00,870
it and and what I found was was kind of

00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,920
interesting and a little bit different

00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:06,420
than what I expected

00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:09,570
so in and as a caveat these both these

00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:12,060
databases were strictly not touched from

00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:14,520
an optimization standpoint I just went

00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:18,480
ahead and created them and added the

00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:23,280
data to it so with with the optimization

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:25,530
results may vary I guess the count based

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:30,540
on the name of the recipe Maya school

00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:33,150
was you know quite a bit faster for that

00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:37,230
the the count based on one ingredient

00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:39,630
though blew it away it my school

00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:42,240
almost took twice as much time to come

00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:44,190
back with that and that really I think

00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:48,000
points to the fact that really

00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:51,840
handles data structures that are complex

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:56,730
a lot better than a relational table

00:23:51,840 --> 00:24:00,540
database would Beit the details based on

00:23:56,730 --> 00:24:04,980
the two ingredients MongoDB was a lot

00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:06,720
faster still I included the details

00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:09,150
because I wanted to see the time it took

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:12,210
for the conversion of the actual data

00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:16,380
but turns out Pearl's pretty awesome at

00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:20,630
converting data structures and although

00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:24,840
it was kind of a pain to write the the

00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:25,290
the actual conversion from MySQL rose to

00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:29,070
a

00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:33,180
hache took milliseconds to the you know

00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:37,470
tens of seconds of the the query and so

00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:41,300
it was negligible so in the end what

00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:44,730
what did I learn out of all of this so

00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:49,290
MongoDB wasn't wasn't up to my

00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:53,580
assumptions it's not that hard to set up

00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:56,130
and learn I I was able to just go ahead

00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:58,790
and do a quick install of I was up

00:24:56,130 --> 00:25:04,290
and running in just a couple of minutes

00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:09,770
doing a Sipan inst install on I

00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:13,590
got got set up immediately and the the

00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:17,100
interface with the database was

00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:18,260
was actually really nice it was better

00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,970
than I expected

00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:23,550
it was actually pretty quick and it

00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:26,190
really handled the complex ish data

00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:29,670
structure that I worked with albeit

00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:32,520
wasn't super complex but it was complex

00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:36,150
enough to show kind of its its strengths

00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:41,460
for that I also learned that randomness

00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:44,460
can be actually quite fun and it it it's

00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:47,730
fun to just explore things and I think

00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:49,830
one of the things that we take for

00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:52,100
granted sometimes as programmers is

00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:54,990
finding fun in the work that we do

00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:57,060
making something enjoyable so that it

00:25:54,990 --> 00:26:02,580
you know that we want to continue to

00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:04,620
work the other thing is - maybe I should

00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:09,720
search on Sipan before I start to build

00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:12,660
something data fake and if you have a

00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:14,370
project in mind getting it accepted for

00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:17,850
a conference is great motivation for

00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:19,350
working on it I had this idea for a

00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:21,630
couple of years and just didn't really

00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:23,130
get around to it talked about it with a

00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:28,440
co-worker and he said hey you should

00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:31,590
submit it for a talk it tpc and so I did

00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:35,550
and got accepted and so that was my

00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:37,610
motivating factor and presenting at TPC

00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:41,690
has been a serial experience

00:26:37,610 --> 00:27:00,230
and I thank you all for coming are there

00:26:41,690 --> 00:27:02,170
any questions about yes yeah is Sipan

00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:05,620
did have to install a couple of

00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:09,710
dependencies but it handled it just fine

00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:12,669
yeah it literally the MongoDB Sipan

00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:16,820
module took maybe a minute to install

00:27:12,669 --> 00:27:19,010
MongoDB itself ran I just had to run in

00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:22,190
a separate terminal the MongoDB and then

00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:25,660
the I was able to command line to it

00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:31,130
instantly there was no issues connecting

00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:33,230
localhost or anything like that so I I'm

00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:41,000
a key so that that that was my

00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:43,660
experience with it so yeah yes I'll keep

00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,660
going back

00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:04,940
just the recipe yeah so and and that's

00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:08,210
that's probably why it was faster just

00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:10,220
from the standpoint of you had the maybe

00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:14,960
the three data elements versus the whole

00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:22,420
structure within that that that

00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:22,420
that would be my guess towards that yeah

00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:37,300
well technically they were both doing

00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:41,740
that right you were doing a like and in

00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:44,920
MySQL it was both they it was

00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:47,260
case-insensitive as well I would think

00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:56,380
that it would be pretty pretty much the

00:28:47,260 --> 00:29:00,070
same so yeah right like I said I didn't

00:28:56,380 --> 00:29:01,960
index anything at this point I was

00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:04,900
planning to go that route and kind of

00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:11,110
show that but yeah it just ran out of

00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:14,590
time I I realized I realized that I'm

00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:17,710
not the the the point of this wasn't

00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:20,350
necessarily to say is so amazing

00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:23,980
and it's so much better than MySQL the

00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:26,050
point was hey seems to be able to

00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:28,750
hold its own when especially when

00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:31,750
talking about complex data structures I

00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:34,480
have no I have no ball in the fight I

00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:37,180
mean I use MySQL every day and will

00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,760
continue use MySQL every day but it has

00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:41,830
opened my eyes to using a document

00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:46,380
storage like for especially

00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:46,380
complex structures yeah

00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:52,899
yes there is indexes that you can create

00:29:50,299 --> 00:29:52,899
on Lanka

00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:13,849
yeah

00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:13,849
[Music]

00:30:20,899 --> 00:30:26,929
the impress the question was why why did

00:30:23,869 --> 00:30:32,149
I think that was possibly going to

00:30:26,929 --> 00:30:38,269
be slower and and the reasons for that

00:30:32,149 --> 00:30:41,090
were a couple the the the table the

00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:42,979
being able to pull in just the data that

00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:46,539
you needed versus having the whole

00:30:42,979 --> 00:30:49,309
document there as well as the whole

00:30:46,539 --> 00:30:53,179
nested be able to query within the

00:30:49,309 --> 00:30:56,269
nesting was was something that I was

00:30:53,179 --> 00:30:59,539
unsure of how would handle and so

00:30:56,269 --> 00:31:01,970
it it most mostly comes down to just

00:30:59,539 --> 00:31:04,479
lack of familiarity as to why I made

00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:04,479
that assumption

00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:24,540
I used I used a couple of things I I was

00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:28,660
having some issues with with how it was

00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:31,570
determined I I was using NYP broth for

00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:34,300
for some of it but based on how I wrote

00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:37,650
my code it wasn't completely clear how

00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:42,100
that was so in the end I just ended up

00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:45,690
running through these iterations just by

00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,690
timing them with high res

00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:01,540
where

00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:10,890
it was it was basically the one run yeah

00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:16,620
III didn't have the time to do it to

00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:23,100
scale it up alright

00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:27,710
I didn't look at that actually so I that

00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:27,710
that would be good to know yeah

00:32:54,110 --> 00:33:03,820
yeah a great now mark

00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:24,630
whatever is the latest that was was on

00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:24,630
see again I I don't

00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,820
no I

00:33:57,190 --> 00:34:00,190
yeah

00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:10,510
all right well thank you so much for for

00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:10,510
being here and enjoy the rest of DPC
