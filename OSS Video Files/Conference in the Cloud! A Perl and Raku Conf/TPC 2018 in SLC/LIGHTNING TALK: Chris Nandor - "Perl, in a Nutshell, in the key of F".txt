this is my new toy

00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:09,710
it's AI traveller guitar it fits an

00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,710
overhead bin so that's pretty cool

00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:20,750
so I actually actually I played this

00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:23,789
that I'm gonna fizzle Perl conference ER

00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:26,099
or Yap see but is that a thickness at a

00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:28,980
pro conference but does that a lightning

00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:30,529
talk I don't know how many years ago

00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:38,210
just forever ago

00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:40,260
but um no I don't think so I don't know

00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:43,649
yeah was that the yeah I don't know I

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,860
don't know where that was it was okay it

00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:45,860
was Chicago

00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:57,330
all right level good there

00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:04,699
all right so this is a this song called

00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:07,340
pearl in a nutshell and it's a parody of

00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:09,020
a bare naked lady song called life in a

00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,680
nutshell and it goes a little something

00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,769
like this

00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,769
[Music]

00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:30,450
when I started out I used to use it only

00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:32,700
for my CD eyes now there's no doubt and

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,100
I'm finally beginning now to realize

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,140
it's like a knife and I'm like Swiss

00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:40,410
where were solving problems we never

00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:43,640
miss sense - it's never enough it's

00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:45,900
never enough no it's never enough I

00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,760
don't tend to worry about what other

00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,440
language BBC and I'm learning that

00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,510
through the whole I'm more than just one

00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:57,630
way call me crazy but it really doesn't

00:01:51,510 --> 00:02:01,650
matter on the master we use / - fine

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:06,090
in a nutshell no way is the right way to

00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:09,440
do it it's so easy to write but it's not

00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,440
always easy to read

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,520
to

00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:26,750
I memorized all the special variables

00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:29,580
are in the docs I ruined my house

00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:32,580
reading every maybe try my Cola box I

00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,739
read a function I read a test when I do

00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:37,440
the test purse I don't get stressed but

00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:39,599
still it's never enough never enough

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,510
though it's never enough

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,160
I don't tend to worry about what other

00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,720
language people say and I'm learning

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,610
that there is a whole lot more than just

00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,349
one way call me crazy but it really

00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:57,569
doesn't matter all that matters to me

00:02:49,349 --> 00:03:01,260
use / boo pie in a nutshell no way is

00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:06,410
the right way to do it it's so easy to

00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:06,410
write but it's not always easy to read

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,640
do

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:25,250
well I fell down with nothing there to

00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:29,450
catch me and fall in and Pearl came

00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:34,310
round and only it's eclectic

00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:37,299
to stop me from losing my job now I'm oh

00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:37,299
okay

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:50,840
that's why sing-along pie in a nutshell

00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:54,230
no way is the right way to do it it's so

00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,419
easy to write but it's not always easy

00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,310
to read Nana tend to worry about what

00:03:56,419 --> 00:04:00,049
other language people say and I'm

00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:02,120
learning that there is old I'm all in

00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:06,790
just one way call me crazy but it really

00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,790
doesn't matter of matters to me as pearl

00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:12,549
