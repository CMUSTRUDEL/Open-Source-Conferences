Description: 
	A brief overview of the various grant programs that are managed by the TPF, from the open Grants Committee process to the more directed sponsored programs. Weâ€™ll talk about how you can help with donations, apply for grants for your projects, and what what volunteer opportunities are available.

so when they asked me to submit some

00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,839
talks I submitted to talks I submitted a

00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,830
technical and this one about the grants

00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:09,420
committee because I figured I could do

00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,980
this one in my sleep and then they

00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,070
accepted both of them which I was not

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,650
expecting so thank you for showing up

00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:18,210
most of the I think exactly half of the

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,380
people in the room are probably very

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,529
familiar with what I'm going to talk

00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,390
about hopefully this will be interesting

00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:27,050
enough compelling enough for 20 minutes

00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,550
feel free to just stop me with questions

00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:31,920
because there's not a whole lot of

00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:35,969
content here just a little bit about me

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,440
there's my contact information I had

00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:39,239
meant to reverse the communities here

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,730
because for this talk the TPF community

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:44,480
is more important I specifically put in

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:48,050
as community based on the talks

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:51,570
yesterday there's a lot of different

00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:53,309
groups inside the overall Perl community

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,699
and these are the two that I'm involved

00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:58,530
with I also put my day job on there

00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:59,789
because it really has absolutely nothing

00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,430
to do with any of the work that I do

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:06,450
with Perl so I just wanted to call it

00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:13,080
that contrast Jim actually talked a lot

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:15,049
about this other other languages go lang

00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,650
Swift there's a there's a lot of

00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:19,670
languages that have corporate

00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:24,180
sponsorships so it's easier for them to

00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:25,500
get tasks done because they can they can

00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,049
hire people and throw developers at it

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:33,680
and we're just basically all volunteers

00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:36,570
so TPF is a non-profit Andals donation

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,180
legal issues like copyright the

00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,350
financials but we don't own perl we

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,530
don't own the community we're just here

00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,530
to help

00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:49,259
so the talk overall talk is about the

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,579
grants committee the first place the

00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:55,439
first place where that process starts is

00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:59,460
with donations so we get I think a

00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:01,259
substantial fraction of our of our TPF

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,790
income from corporate donations I

00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:05,310
actually just found out earlier today

00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:09,360
that previously the way the donations

00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:11,670
would work is there'd be repeat

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,080
solicitations for particular events so

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,660
they wanted to fund the contract

00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,550
conference

00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,960
they would go out to donors and say can

00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:20,860
you pay for this conference or this

00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:23,470
event and I guess a few years ago they

00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:25,840
switched to a model where now instead of

00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:28,060
sponsors supporting things that we do

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,590
they're supporting us and then we have a

00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,200
little more leeway in terms of how that

00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:37,750
gets allocated it makes it a little

00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:42,100
smoother of a process individual donors

00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:43,090
I I know a lot of people have a project

00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:47,620
that they care about they'll kick in a

00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:50,200
few bucks if you do that a lot of

00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,760
companies do matching so be sure if you

00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,650
are donating if you're trying to

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,930
encourage other people to donate that

00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:59,230
they set up that corporate match because

00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:01,230
every little bit helps in terms of

00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:03,280
dispersing the money there's basically

00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:05,080
as far as grant related things there's

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,960
two ways that that happens right now one

00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:11,220
is the funds and this is like the the

00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:13,420
pro/5 core maintenance fund for example

00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,830
the way these are managed right now it's

00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,420
currently by the board it's not actually

00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:18,550
the grants committee so I don't actually

00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:20,490
touch any of those that's something that

00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:23,890
may change in the future as we try to

00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:27,370
figure out how we can all more

00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:29,770
effectively volunteer our time so this

00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:31,690
the the funds for this go into a

00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:33,100
specific bucket when somebody donates

00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:36,310
money they can say I want this to go to

00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:40,480
this fund these tend to be more

00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:44,110
long-running I think the pro/5 fund has

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,340
been going on for three years it's been

00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,560
many years I'm looking at Jim like you

00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:52,720
might know the answer to that question

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:54,550
longer than that okay so for those

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,220
grants there's there's usually some

00:03:54,550 --> 00:04:02,830
technical expertise required for the the

00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:04,060
five you have to you have your work

00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:07,020
basically your proposal has to be

00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:09,580
approved by the people that work on p5p

00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,959
just as an example and a lot of the work

00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,459
that gets done there is stuff that I

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,400
mentioned we're volunteers even the

00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:16,299
developers are volunteers obviously

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,470
there's some stuff that just nobody

00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:21,850
wants to work on it's not rewarding so

00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:24,250
by having some funding associated with

00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:25,780
that it helps us act a little bit more

00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:28,260
like those languages they do have a

00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,260
corporate spot

00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:33,270
so on the opposite side of the funds are

00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:35,160
the grants these are managed by the

00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:38,310
committee so this is the part that I

00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:43,800
actually do we have an annual budget

00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:45,750
that's a set up by the board these

00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,040
grants tend to be a lot shorter in

00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:49,500
duration it might be a couple of months

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,740
long for the average there's very

00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,419
specific deliverables deliverables but

00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,919
the the interesting thing about the

00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:58,500
grants is that these are usually self

00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:01,169
selected there's not it's not like

00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,190
anybody is saying here's 50 things that

00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:03,780
we think need to get done these are

00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:09,120
things that people are passionate about

00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:13,070
that they're going to work on as far as

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:15,870
that process goes there's a bimonthly

00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:19,949
review of proposals that have been

00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:22,169
submitted those proposals like I said

00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:23,460
come in from all across the community

00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:26,520
there's int there should be information

00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,960
in there about what what is what is it

00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,669
you're trying to do how are you going to

00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,260
do it why are you the person to work on

00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:33,740
this grant

00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:35,910
what are your deliverables and the more

00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:39,990
detail you can provide there in terms of

00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:41,150
what the impact is going to be and how

00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:43,919
you're going to go about the work

00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:45,990
that'll all help as part of the review

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,010
process these proposals get posted

00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:49,380
there's a chance for everybody in the

00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:52,860
community to comment on them meant to

00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:54,090
voice concerns maybe point out some

00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,880
information that the proposer didn't

00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:58,590
know once it goes to that community

00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,789
review period and actually there's a

00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,979
round that's going through that right

00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:03,660
now and basically this evening I'm going

00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:06,120
to take the ones that are out posted on

00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:08,810
the site for review and put together a

00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,770
mailing to everybody on the committee

00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:13,110
linking to the articles linking to the

00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:15,360
comments and then calling for a vote and

00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:17,070
we'll have a week - for the everybody on

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:24,090
the committee to review what those look

00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:26,580
like and I'm looking at you - and put a

00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:29,729
everybody puts in numeric Odin

00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:33,449
it's either no an abstention or like 1

00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:38,580
to 5 to rank them once the voting

00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:39,930
happens grants can be voted approved and

00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,130
then we have to have a

00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:43,680
separate thing that decides whether or

00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:45,360
not were going to fund them so approval

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,130
is basically the quality of the grant

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:51,090
and then funding is do we have any money

00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:52,320
left so that that we have to manage that

00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:53,430
as we go along through the year with our

00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,949
budget

00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:58,259
the grants committee manages the running

00:06:55,949 --> 00:07:01,440
grants and this is basically a super low

00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:03,000
level project management task are you

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,919
doing any work yes you are okay the

00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,449
grants still going great there are rules

00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:08,100
about if you have a long-running grant

00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:11,130
where there's been no progress or no

00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:14,190
reporting then we're just we're gonna

00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:15,660
kill the ground it's dead we try to

00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:19,680
provide a little leeway because again

00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:21,509
everybody here traditionally is coming

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,710
from a volunteering background you know

00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:30,509
real life gets in the way sometimes but

00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:32,910
that's part of that so this question

00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:35,580
comes up a lot what can we do to get the

00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:37,740
grants that you have something you're

00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,759
super passionate about how do you how do

00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,160
you get that in front of the grants

00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:42,419
committee and get a yes vote and there's

00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,210
just a bunch of questions that we

00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:47,520
consider there's no formula every person

00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:49,199
on the committee all of them have a long

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,039
history in the community and they're

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,979
basically using these questions and they

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,150
have their own set of criteria no doubt

00:07:54,979 --> 00:07:59,909
but I talked briefly about this what's

00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:01,320
the cost of the grant versus what we're

00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:05,909
getting out of it what's the type of

00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:08,250
grant we tend to fund development

00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:11,550
projects a lot documentation projects

00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:16,800
are a close second we tend not to get in

00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:18,449
front of travel or event grants there's

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:24,180
other places that you can go through the

00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:27,810
board to to book that sort of thing so

00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:29,400
and actually speaking of that there's a

00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:30,870
there's a little bit of confusion I

00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,680
think in terms of what stuff is going

00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:34,820
through the grants committee what

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,770
stuff's going through the board it's

00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:40,469
it's a little bit of a mess so some of

00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:41,849
that if you have a question about that

00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:43,950
sort of thing feel free to reach out to

00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:45,529
me or somebody on the board and we can

00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:47,730
try to point you in the right direction

00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:50,440
so other questions

00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:52,640
what's a target audience who's gonna

00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:56,120
benefit from the work that the grant is

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,529
doing what was the feedback I just found

00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,440
out today for example that we have a

00:08:57,529 --> 00:09:02,060
currently running grant that might

00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,800
actually be duplicating some effort that

00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:08,089
was already available that nobody knew

00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:11,890
about so the community feedback process

00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:14,420
is the time to let us know that and that

00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:18,040
we I think have to do a slightly better

00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:19,880
job there of soliciting that feedback

00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:22,490
what's the history the applicant we've

00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:25,279
had one or two grants where somebody has

00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:26,750
submitted something the grant failed for

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,149
whatever reason you know personal life

00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:30,829
came up and then basically got our

00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:32,750
recent middle of that grant basically to

00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:35,240
start over and I'm gonna tell you that

00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:36,470
that's you that's gonna be marked down a

00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,380
little bit in terms of whether or not

00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:42,170
we're going to vote on that but again

00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:44,420
it's all every grant is considered

00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:47,870
separately and then what is our budget

00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:49,190
that's left that doesn't factor into the

00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:50,779
acceptance but it's quite it is

00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:52,550
technically possible to get a grant

00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:54,050
accepted everybody's excited about it

00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:56,060
and we can't pay you to do it cuz we're

00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:59,060
how many money left which goes back to

00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:01,100
donations so and there's because that

00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:06,760
every every proposal is considered on

00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:06,760
its own yeah

00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:22,339
sweet that's good to know because I

00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:23,810
didn't know that absolutely and that's I

00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:25,940
think that just highlights another thing

00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:28,010
at EPF is just a volunteer organization

00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,329
it's not like we have regular running

00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:32,540
meetings to figure out how everything

00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:34,250
and actually we just had one over lunch

00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:36,649
which is the first one I've been to and

00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,820
I hope we keep doing that just keeping

00:10:36,649 --> 00:10:39,050
the lines of communication open amongst

00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:45,200
ourselves and then out to the community

00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:46,660
as well so there are I think the grants

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,459
committee is one of the few

00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:51,980
subcommittees that has a charter like we

00:10:49,459 --> 00:10:53,720
have rules of operation part of that is

00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:56,959
dealing with voting on grants part of

00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,940
that is how many members were allowed to

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,970
have and how we solicit new members or

00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:03,980
how we onboard new members so we

00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:08,959
actually due to some recent shuffling

00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:11,089
there's one vacancy for a voting grant

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,709
committee member so if if you're looking

00:11:11,089 --> 00:11:16,190
to volunteer your time that's something

00:11:12,709 --> 00:11:17,350
that that might be an option I describe

00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:19,430
the process a little bit but basically

00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:22,160
you're you're gonna be reviewing

00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:23,480
proposals every two months and then

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,649
providing your just your honest feedback

00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:31,430
on what what are why you like this

00:11:27,649 --> 00:11:35,390
proposal or don't we can always use more

00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:37,220
grant managers I can tell you the last

00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:38,300
grant that came through I ended up being

00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:40,940
the grant manager because I couldn't

00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:42,140
happen to find one in time and that like

00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,450
I said that's a really low level project

00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:45,980
management you're just basically poking

00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:48,320
the person with a stick just to make

00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:49,760
sure that they were alive so slightly

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,300
more than that but that's that's the

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,890
minimum that we're looking if you need

00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,800
one I will I will

00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:59,060
I will look into that I'm sure we get it

00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:02,020
some sponsors to give us some special

00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:02,020
poking sticks

00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:08,580
right Kari yeah yeah yeah if you're

00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:17,130
using money as a stick you're probably

00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:19,500
doing it wrong so and I haven't I didn't

00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:21,720
update this slide and I meant to between

00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,070
the lunch meeting that I said we had

00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,450
there's actually a lot of volunteer

00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:27,630
opportunities not unnecessarily in the

00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:32,970
grants committee but in the TPF as a

00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:35,970
whole we talked about migrations of some

00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:39,090
of the websites so we need people who

00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:40,380
are like I don't know if webmaster is

00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:44,280
still a job title but basically that

00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:50,370
level of expertise migrating between

00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:52,050
content delivery systems we need I think

00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:53,970
we have some marketing folks but I

00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:55,380
imagine we could always use more people

00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:56,850
who are willing to learn how to use the

00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:59,130
the customer relationship management

00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:01,640
tool that we're now signed up with so we

00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:05,940
have a new way of processing donations

00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:07,200
so there's just there's a lot of I used

00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,980
the word unglamorous before I think

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,160
that's a good one there's a lot of

00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:12,480
there's a lot of I guess maybe for me

00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,190
would be boring work maybe somebody's

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,860
very excited about marketing and

00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:17,880
actually I do actually know somebody in

00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:21,180
the community who is excited about

00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:23,190
marketing so forward unto you but

00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,600
there's always there's always an

00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:26,160
opportunity to help out so whether

00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,680
that's you personally volunteering or

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,260
somehow getting your company involved if

00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,610
you guys are heavy users of Perl this is

00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,370
one of the discussions we had do we need

00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:37,620
volunteers more or do we need money more

00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:39,990
and I think we ended up and say

00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:42,900
basically saying both yeah

00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:46,410
yes so any way that you can help out

00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:48,600
there would be great actually I'm glad

00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:50,580
will is here one of the things that we

00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,470
need to do a better job of when we

00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:55,140
reject a grant we need to make sure that

00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:57,390
we give some better feedback and we try

00:13:55,140 --> 00:14:00,710
to do that we aren't always able to in

00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:03,580
terms of the feedback that we have yeah

00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:07,240
absolutely yeah

00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:12,610
he said that there is a opening for one

00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:15,370
new member tip and that the job of that

00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:21,730
member is to give honest feedback

00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:24,910
whether or not a deserves to be well

00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:26,980
I'll also put you here unfortunately

00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:29,860
there is no guarantee of feedback in

00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:31,900
Deming process which you tagged my name

00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:36,330
there and I was obviously quite unhappy

00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:38,590
about being rejected when I requested

00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:45,280
well certainly I can tell you part of

00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:47,950
that will right yep so that's why I put

00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:49,150
this bullet point on here because it's

00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:51,370
not something that is part of the

00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:54,010
official process like I said we have a

00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:56,170
charter there's a bunch of rules that's

00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:58,720
not one of the rules so we try to do

00:14:56,170 --> 00:15:01,060
that and what I am trying to do here is

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,470
to make that more official so that in

00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:10,420
the future we can give that feedback

00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:12,520
that you're looking for yep well it

00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:19,560
doesn't have to be it doesn't it doesn't

00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:19,560
have to be but okay

00:16:02,859 --> 00:16:07,369
right well certainly will part of that

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,100
is because you didn't request the

00:16:07,369 --> 00:16:32,119
feedback you demanded the feedback so

00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:34,519
and I get that so part of that is going

00:16:32,119 --> 00:16:37,609
to just be instructions to the folks on

00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:39,169
the committee make sure that and we like

00:16:37,609 --> 00:16:41,809
like Jim said we do this to some extent

00:16:39,169 --> 00:16:46,489
now there is discussion and I do ask

00:16:41,809 --> 00:16:48,350
people and I'm sure I'm sure there's

00:16:46,489 --> 00:16:50,209
been an email about this on the list

00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:51,379
when you're providing feedback let me

00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:53,449
know if this is something that I can

00:16:51,379 --> 00:16:55,449
post on the list and for that round

00:16:53,449 --> 00:16:59,029
there was nothing that met that criteria

00:16:55,449 --> 00:17:01,899
so there was nothing to provide you

00:16:59,029 --> 00:17:01,899
there and

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:24,760
you know alongside well

00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:28,929
again part of this is there is private

00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:31,510
discussion right so when there is public

00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:32,740
feedback we do provide that so and we'll

00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:36,279
try to do a better job of that in the

00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:37,929
future but just like just like there's

00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:38,980
no guarantee that an individual grant is

00:17:37,929 --> 00:17:40,289
going to get accepted there's no

00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:47,880
guarantee that there's going to be

00:17:40,289 --> 00:17:50,799
feedback there yeah good okay yeah so

00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:55,000
yeah other things that have that have

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:57,039
come up better integration with the

00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,510
sponsors there's some directed work that

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,760
the sponsors might want to get done we

00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:03,640
don't know if that's going to be through

00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,659
the grants committee through funds part

00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,909
of that needs to just be an open

00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:08,679
discussion with the sponsors about what

00:18:06,909 --> 00:18:10,600
sort of work they want to see done in

00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:13,200
the community so like I said that might

00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:15,429
not even go through the grants committee

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,919
we talked I talked briefly about this

00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:20,140
there's the work on the funds which is

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,450
similar to what the the managers of

00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:26,230
individual grants are doing but right

00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:29,220
now that's being handled by Makoto so

00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:31,779
that might get shuffled around as well I

00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:34,390
think so we've probably a lot of that

00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:36,480
time already but certainly if yeah go

00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:36,480
ahead

00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:53,799
yep so that's actually a question for

00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:57,220
the treasurer and I think in the past

00:18:53,799 --> 00:19:00,390
what we have done is if a grant failed

00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:03,580
we tried to keep that money in the pool

00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:06,909
to apply to whatever the next grant was

00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:08,260
but the last discussion that I remember

00:19:06,909 --> 00:19:09,730
having it with Dan is that basically

00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:11,110
that money is going back into the into

00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:12,820
the general budget and if we need to

00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:14,740
talk if we need to have a separate

00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:16,570
discussion about okay new stuff is

00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:18,100
coming in and we need to fund that that

00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:20,880
is separate from what happens to the

00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,880
grants that didn't want

00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:06,320
right I think I think Dan would probably

00:20:04,429 --> 00:20:12,710
be happy if we did it the same year that

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:14,390
but right we do have a spreadsheet

00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:15,919
somewhere with a list of all of the

00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:17,480
running grants and whether with the with

00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:25,059
the final status was so the den can work

00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:25,059
through that so yeah

00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:45,690
that those were the bounties that I was

00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,680
alluding to there we have there is some

00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:49,080
suggestions out there they're probably

00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,920
four years old at this point so honestly

00:20:49,080 --> 00:21:09,860
we probably just need to get rid of

00:20:49,920 --> 00:21:12,420
those so yep so and again it would be

00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:14,880
you put in a proposal that proposals

00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:16,770
going to get evaluated the fact that it

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,360
was one of the about one of not about he

00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:22,260
one of the suggestions would probably be

00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:24,120
taken into account we find there's if

00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,890
there's a project you're excited about

00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:28,140
you're probably gonna have your best

00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:30,600
luck with that rather than finding some

00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,980
other project so just something to think

00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,830
about

00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:35,820
so there's another round we're in the

00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:39,000
middle of a round right now it's every

00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:40,290
two months and honestly it takes most of

00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,510
the two months I think for us to get

00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:45,000
through it these days the next round is

00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:48,090
going to start sometime in July so look

00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:51,660
at news Pro Foundation org and there'll

00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:53,960
be a blog post putting up that call for

00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,960
new grads

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:02,030
