all right welcome everyone uh last year

00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:06,450
I talked about dart I really was excited

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,519
about the dart programming language but

00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,990
I couldn't find a compelling case not

00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:13,139
like the case of 1% today which is

00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:15,450
flutter based on dart so here I have an

00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:16,740
app that's already launched that's ran

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,150
from the code that's sitting right there

00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,500
this is the demo app when you build a

00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,800
new app it always puts this code in

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,960
there

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,580
now I saved you the 30 seconds that it

00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,230
takes to bring this up to go through the

00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,869
Xcode phase and everything and that's

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,880
the cycle normal app developers have to

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:31,679
use watch what happens instead though

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,620
here's the app it's very simple it's got

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,719
an F a B and it counts ooh exciting

00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,280
right but I'm gonna go in here and I'm

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,870
gonna say I don't want a blue theme I

00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:46,410
want an orange theme I press save 1/2

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:48,629
second later it's reloaded it that's the

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,309
development cycle on this I like this

00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:52,289
plus button here but what I really want

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:54,750
to do is put a minus button in there too

00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:56,129
so let's change the structure first it's

00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,109
not just color changes its structure

00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:01,020
change as well so I'm going to take out

00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:05,820
one of these text widgets and we're

00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:08,250
going to add count is so I actually

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,650
deleted a widget from the tree no

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,119
problem I want to make a minus button

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,030
over here so I'm gonna put this in a

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:16,920
column so we're gonna go down here we're

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,780
going to take this floating action

00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,790
button and when we're going to use one

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:24,990
of the helpers to say wrap this thing

00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:27,150
with a column save half a second later

00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,009
oh it's a column but it defaults to the

00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,750
beginning of the column I gotta fix that

00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:31,979
so I'm going to mouse over column it

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,570
shows me everything I can do

00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:36,650
main access alignments the thing I want

00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:40,110
to use so we'll do main axis alignment

00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:42,500
and it wants a mean axis alignment and

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:45,990
probably end let's see if that's correct

00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:47,909
and save there we go buttons now back in

00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,869
the right place I want a second button

00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:51,680
I'm just going to cut and paste this

00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:53,930
code for the new floating action button

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:58,829
by the way I'm temping the live demo

00:01:53,930 --> 00:02:00,750
gods of course but it's gone right four

00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:03,360
or five times so let's see so I'm just

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,829
copying the button for now save boom now

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,420
I got two buttons there but the other

00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:10,899
one has to have a minus sign so let me

00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:13,150
change this to icons remove save

00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:14,440
boom now we got that okay now we got to

00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,510
wire it up because both of these are

00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,940
identical buttons right now they're both

00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:20,950
going to increment our counter that

00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:23,230
doesn't help so let's go into here and

00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:26,019
we're going to take the thing that does

00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:28,000
the increment we're gonna copy paste it

00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:29,110
and first it's gonna complain because

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,879
there's two functions with the same name

00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:33,099
don't worry about that we'll fix that in

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:36,010
a second here gonna change that to

00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:38,260
decrement counter and we also have to

00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:39,579
make it from plus + to - will - if I had

00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,349
more time I'd actually were wrong and

00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:43,569
show you that I just have to fix it ok

00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:44,769
we hit save nothing changes because they

00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:46,359
didn't actually change the wiring of

00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:48,760
that button so now we're gonna back to

00:02:46,359 --> 00:02:52,079
that - button we're gonna change it from

00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:56,530
increment counter to decrement counter

00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:59,379
save and now watch plus plus plus minus

00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:00,940
minus - one thing I haven't pointed out

00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:03,220
yet is notice that even though I updated

00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,319
the code the state of that counter

00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:07,359
remained throughout it you can drill

00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:09,400
down eight pages find an error on your

00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:11,890
eighth page change the code that's there

00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,239
and hips reload and all that state was

00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:15,310
preserved all the way up and down I

00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:16,750
don't like those being above each other

00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:22,959
I'm gonna make this a row instead of a

00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:23,889
column save okay boom that's a row and I

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,109
don't like the fact that they're both

00:03:23,889 --> 00:03:27,549
the same orange color that's up here so

00:03:26,109 --> 00:03:29,290
I'm going to go in to my floating action

00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:31,000
button and I'm going to say floating

00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:35,639
action button can take a background

00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,720
color and it takes so say colors red

00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:38,319
save just to make sure you hit the right

00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,139
one yep

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,699
and then I want to go down here can you

00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:46,090
see how fun writing mobile apps could be

00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:48,849
with this okay we're gonna go here I'm

00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:50,349
gonna see background color did I also

00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:52,900
mention but it works in both iOS and

00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:54,459
Android from the same code base and

00:03:52,900 --> 00:04:00,579
works just like this for developing on

00:03:54,459 --> 00:04:01,900
both sides colors green save looking

00:04:00,579 --> 00:04:03,099
good looking good I haven't heard the

00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,019
formant gone yet so I'm gonna do one

00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:07,480
more change to it so I'm gonna go in

00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:08,650
here and I'm going to change the I'm

00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,720
gonna put a little padding around that's

00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:11,889
hold tight for the corner there so we're

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,109
gonna go to each of these so I'm gonna

00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:17,169
do my new action button oops what they

00:04:14,109 --> 00:04:19,419
say yes save okay whoa what happened ah

00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:20,799
see I know excuse will be off okay there

00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:22,539
it is okay so we're gonna do that

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:22,870
floating action button again up there we

00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:24,520
go

00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:26,169
let's do padding on water

00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:31,810
then you'll see how it works so right

00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:33,639
here we're gonna go add padding I would

00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:35,409
do them both lookup time and then go up

00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:39,340
here to this floating action button and

00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:40,900
again add padding all the layout our

00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,550
widgets everything's in code there's no

00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:45,580
hidden XML here I'm actually changing

00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:47,379
the actual layout by changing the code

00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,539
that means you can refactor it you can

00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:51,250
factor out if you have make common

00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:54,340
things make your own widgets there we go

00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:58,139
a little bit of padding flutter check it

00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:58,139
