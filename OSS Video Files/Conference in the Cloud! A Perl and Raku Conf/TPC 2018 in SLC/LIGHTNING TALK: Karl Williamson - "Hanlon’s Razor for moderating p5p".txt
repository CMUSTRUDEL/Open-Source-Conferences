so um Carl Williamson and I came up with

00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:12,690
this talk in response or as a result of

00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:14,490
Vicky's talk yesterday yesterday and my

00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:18,779
experience joining the community nine

00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:21,689
years ago was not negative I was

00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:24,890
encouraged and not considered people

00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:30,510
didn't denigrate me and so I stayed and

00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:33,540
have made a lot of commits this quote is

00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,820
the humorous part of my talk and this

00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:40,079
guy eventually became Gerald Ford's

00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:45,030
chief speechwriter it was a comedian he

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:48,480
wrote jokes before then so earlier in my

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:51,149
life I kind of felt like this that

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,500
everybody was against me my saner

00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:56,760
moments maybe not not everybody but

00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:59,399
those who didn't know me for example

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,199
then I got more mature grew up and

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:07,110
stopped being so self-centered and

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:12,810
realized this was not the case and so I

00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:17,400
came to a a thing for myself which was

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:20,509
essentially similar to this don't

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:23,640
ascribe to malice that which can be

00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:26,460
explained by incompetence and I would

00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,470
use that myself and then I discovered

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,240
that other people had done that I had

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,759
heard that there was a British diplomat

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,220
in the nineteenth century who had done

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,710
that who had come up with a similar

00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:40,409
quote and I was I named I am still

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:42,479
unable to find the source of that but I

00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:46,470
did find this on Wikipedia Hanlan's

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:48,180
razor and never attribute to malice that

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:51,590
which is adequately explained by

00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,590
stupidity and

00:01:53,840 --> 00:02:04,310
in a lot of the contentious things that

00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:07,430
go on in the p5p email this is violated

00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:09,800
a lot people tend to think some of the

00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:13,940
some people tend to think everybody's

00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:16,100
against them and no you're just not that

00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:18,830
important to most people they haven't

00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:20,900
thought about it that much and that's

00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:28,130
really what's going on a better

00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:33,590
excellent is Goethe's and i don't know

00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:36,800
how you pronounce that in german no not

00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:40,940
good too but in french this is ver ter

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,739
it's from there's an opera based on this

00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:45,470
story by Joel Massenet that's still

00:02:42,739 --> 00:02:48,560
frequently performed their terror but I

00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:53,810
don't know how you pronounced that word

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:56,989
but anyway misunderstandings are and

00:02:53,810 --> 00:03:00,950
neglect that's really what's going on

00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:05,329
and so I'm advocating that moderators

00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:09,440
and people who write or who check who

00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:11,320
post consider Hamlin's razor when

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,299
they're posting and don't post it

00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,769
everybody is against me don't assume

00:03:14,299 --> 00:03:18,620
that because it's not true

00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:22,269
and that moderators can use this as an

00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:24,739
objective method for looking at

00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:29,060
discussions and saying does this pass

00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:31,880
hanlin's razor or not and we say

00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:35,200
everything has to pass Hamlin's razor or

00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,200
it's unacceptable

00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:42,859
now Hanlon some people think Hanlan's

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:46,760
razor is actually a corruption of the

00:03:42,859 --> 00:03:49,910
word Heinlein who which I like because

00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:54,140
Heinlein was one of my favorite writers

00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:59,269
when I was growing up and from his 1941

00:03:54,140 --> 00:04:01,310
story it's slightly different it's but

00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:04,730
it's kind of the same people have

00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:07,810
realized this and it's published

00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:07,810
and that was it

00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,490
