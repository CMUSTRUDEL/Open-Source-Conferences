well alright my name is kerstin tang and

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,429
i'm here to tell you just a little bit

00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:10,139
about my journey in learning Chinese now

00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:11,700
if you know anything about Chinese you

00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:13,290
should know that there are many dialects

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,450
and most of the time when people say

00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,640
they speak Chinese they mean Mandarin

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,680
now my family actually speaks a dialect

00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,460
called Theia Zhu has anyone ever heard

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:26,160
this dialogue before one person wow

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,199
that's amazing um all right now even

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,179
though Mandarin and theage you are both

00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,600
dialects of Chinese they are not

00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:35,910
mutually intelligible at all Theo is

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,559
actually my first language but as I went

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,870
to school I spoke more and more English

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:42,450
and eventually I forgot almost all of it

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:45,360
so this year I made up my new year's

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:47,309
resolution to relearn the language so

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,840
how am I gonna do this well if I were

00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:50,760
learning Mandarin I have so many

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,949
resources available in me I could use

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,719
duolingo I could find online courses I

00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:57,870
can even take free classes at my local

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,969
library but it's not as easy to learn

00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,559
the achooo it's definitely not on

00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:03,510
duolingo and I don't think my library

00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:05,790
even has a single book on the language

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:08,070
but there are resources out there I

00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:11,010
found some apps that actually have the

00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,780
atchoo dictionaries I found some blogs I

00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,689
found some YouTube videos or they speak

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,369
Teochew but the problem was I was

00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:19,530
missing a curriculum I had no curriculum

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:21,720
that I could follow so I really had to

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,299
make my own and this was really like a

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,580
big research project for me so what I

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:30,210
decided to do was to take what I learned

00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,740
and put it in a web app alright so even

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,509
though I do web development at work I

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,270
actually never really made my own

00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:37,740
polished web app before and I wanted to

00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,540
do this with the hopes of eventually

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,880
letting other people use this app to

00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:46,320
help learn this language all right so

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:48,990
let's take a look all right so right now

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,090
it's basically a flashcards app it

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,220
displays an english word in this case

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,110
seafood I click on it and then it shows

00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,390
you the translation this has a

00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:00,090
transliteration that's called penny

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,920
M it also has the Chinese characters and

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:05,579
an audio clip that I recorded once Oh

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,149
seafood is high Chi so you may notice

00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:09,619
that in this translation there is

00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:11,329
an accent mark over the a and you might

00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:12,079
be wondering what does this accent mark

00:02:11,329 --> 00:02:16,040
even mean

00:02:12,079 --> 00:02:17,780
well did you is a tonal language that

00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,670
means that the pitch of the sound that

00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:25,010
you're making affects what the word

00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:27,650
actually is so I could say ma ma ma and

00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:30,560
ma and those are all different words

00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:33,109
because they use different tones so

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,030
there are eight tones in Thea choo and I

00:02:33,109 --> 00:02:36,680
could use the tone number to represent

00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,989
the child but I found that not very

00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,599
intuitive so instead I'm using different

00:02:38,989 --> 00:02:44,090
accent marks so for example the low tone

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,579
uses a dot underneath the letter and the

00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:49,819
high tone uses a line over top of the

00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:51,530
letter now I actually found this kind of

00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:53,329
a pain to have to type out so I'm

00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:54,889
actually inserting it with the tone

00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:56,780
numbers into the database and my app

00:02:54,889 --> 00:02:59,540
transforms that into accent marks before

00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:01,220
it's displayed all right so besides

00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,379
being able to translate just various

00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:05,540
words my app can also translate numbers

00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:07,670
I'm gonna can actually translate all the

00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,989
numbers up to a thousand now I didn't

00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,970
want to have to add a thousand entries

00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:13,519
into my database just to be able to do

00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:16,069
this but like most other languages

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,290
there's really a formula you can use to

00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:21,440
translate these numbers that are a lot

00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:25,220
bigger for example 50 translates to no

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:28,159
Jeff this is literally five ten the

00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:32,299
number 75 literally translates to seven

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:35,180
ten five and number fourteen is just ten

00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:37,459
four so basically all I do is write a

00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:40,159
function that figured out the individual

00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:41,720
parts of the number translate each of

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,510
those and concatenated those together

00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:49,069
but I had one complication in this and

00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:50,569
that's tone change so many words undergo

00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:53,000
tone change when place in front of

00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:56,900
another word so let's let's take the

00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:02,000
number 15 for example 15 is just 10 5 10

00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:04,940
is chopped and 5 is no but 15 is jump no

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,519
and if you listen carefully yes that the

00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:11,569
the the sound for 10 changed from a high

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:14,060
tone to a low tone so what I had to do

00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:15,409
when I was creating these translations

00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,789
was I had to make sure when I was

00:04:15,409 --> 00:04:18,350
linking the words together that I was

00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:20,270
applying tone change

00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:22,400
and for large numbers every single

00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:24,680
syllable except the last one undergoes

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,790
tome change the last thing I'm going to

00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,760
show you since I'm running out of time

00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:31,070
are my phrase flashcards so not only do

00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:33,440
I have words I also have phrases so for

00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:35,870
example I'm going to the store is well

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,210
catchy what I thought is cool about

00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:40,220
Chinese is that the grammar is really

00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,960
simple there's no verb conjugation

00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:44,600
there's no differentiation between

00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,220
singular and plural and there's no

00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,530
different differentiation between

00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:50,390
present and past so really for

00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:51,800
translating these sentences I did

00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,450
basically the same thing I did with

00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,830
numbers I figured out the individual

00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:56,450
parts of the sentence and I just

00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,620
stitched them together and I use the

00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:01,070
same function that I used for

00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:03,800
translating numbers all right so since

00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:06,920
I'm basically out of time I'm just gonna

00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,570
leave you with a link to my app that's

00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:11,120
Mei Ling tang calm that's actually my

00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:12,650
middle and my last name so I didn't show

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,120
you everything in my app I have a lot

00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:16,700
more stuff in there and I also have a

00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,170
lot more than I want to add I didn't

00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,610
actually look at any other language

00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:22,100
learning software so if you have any

00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:24,590
ideas for ways that I could improve this

00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:26,060
please come talk to me and if you want

00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:29,650
to learn more about the language itself

00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,650
