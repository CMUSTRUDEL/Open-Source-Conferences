Title: Dave Rolsky - "Make Your Technical Hiring Process Suck at Least 20% Less"
Publication date: 2018-06-19
Playlist: TPC 2018 in SLC
Description: 
	As someone who’s both done a lot of hiring and been through many interviews, I can tell you with great certainty that it’s almost uniformly terrible. I have some ideas on how you can make your hiring process less terrible, both for the candidates and for yourself. Some topics I’ll cover are how most processes suck, how to write a good job description, pre-interview screening approaches, how not to be a complete jerk when you interview someone, questions to ask (and questions to not ask), and more.

so welcome everyone thanks for coming my

00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,170
name is Dave Rolle ski and I'm going to

00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:10,590
make your technical hiring process suck

00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:13,590
at least 20% less it's a big promise but

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:16,049
we'll see if I can follow through so I

00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:19,650
do want to emphasize I work at active

00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:21,779
state enjoy working at active state so

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,970
all these opinions are mine alone that

00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:26,699
said I am in a hiring capacity there and

00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,830
I've been doing hiring and trying to

00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:32,550
apply my own advice to the hiring as

00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:33,870
much as possible so but yeah nonetheless

00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:35,910
this is not like an active

00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,340
state-sponsored talk this is this is my

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,629
opinions so this all started when I was

00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,730
looking for a job about a year and a

00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:44,129
half ago and I felt kind of like this

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,629
you know it was a little sad looking for

00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:47,760
a job it's stressful and I was sad to

00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:52,460
leave my old job and I started applying

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:55,050
for jobs and I felt a bit more like this

00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:56,579
now maybe the table flip is an

00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:59,280
overstatement because it was more of a

00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:01,829
strong constant irritation than an

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,769
actual table flipping rage but

00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:07,260
nonetheless the process was frustrating

00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,360
so why there or there are a number of

00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,570
reasons so a lack of basic courtesy was

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,850
a big one a lot of unprepared

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:16,979
interviewers also prepared interviewers

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,869
but it was just a weird mix some

00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:20,490
pointless questions I did not understand

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:23,400
why anybody would bother asking and just

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:26,490
general wasted time very annoying

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,460
not that much skill evaluation and of

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:33,270
course it was really really slow just

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:35,070
everybody's slow this is just a constant

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,470
problem in hiring in general it seems to

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,450
be a problem in technical hiring so

00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,979
ultimately I kind of took a job in spite

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,579
of the hiring process that I've been

00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:46,470
through rather than because of it and so

00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:50,369
I think it can be less terrible so

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:52,860
that's my pitch today less terrible so

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:54,689
why bother besides all the things that I

00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,280
just listed what's the advantage if

00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:58,649
you're on the hiring side well you're

00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,329
wasting your own time you know I feel

00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:02,369
like a lot of the hiring process can be

00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:04,229
very wasteful of your time and hiring is

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:06,229
time intensive no matter what so if

00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:08,700
you're wasting your time that's not good

00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:10,200
of course false positives are really

00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,540
expensive so if your process isn't

00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,069
actually good at finding people who will

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,799
work

00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:17,150
that's not so great false negatives or

00:02:15,799 --> 00:02:17,709
missed opportunities that's not great

00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,569
either

00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:23,150
bad hiring turns candidates off so you

00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:24,499
could have a process where somebody was

00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:26,329
initially excited to work for your

00:02:24,499 --> 00:02:28,639
company and then if your process is

00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:30,530
really bad they might at the end of it

00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:33,079
when you make an offer say you know what

00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:35,510
no thanks if this is how you do hiring

00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:37,519
then I don't want to work for you I'm

00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:39,169
really I would say hiring is the most

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,109
important thing that you're doing when

00:02:39,169 --> 00:02:43,969
you're doing it because the amount you

00:02:42,109 --> 00:02:45,200
know the work you do is very important

00:02:43,969 --> 00:02:46,669
but when you hire someone else that's

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,980
like a multiplier so if you're hiring

00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:50,870
people it's really kind of a big deal

00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:53,389
that you get the best people you can get

00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:55,669
and waste as little time as possible so

00:02:53,389 --> 00:02:57,829
how can you start so how do you start by

00:02:55,669 --> 00:03:00,739
making it to make your process better so

00:02:57,829 --> 00:03:04,189
step one is you got to figure out what

00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:06,739
it is that you want so I feel like a lot

00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:09,319
of places don't actually start with this

00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:11,569
step which is really weird to me so you

00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:15,620
should have some sort of evaluation

00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:17,810
criteria so what sort of criteria would

00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:20,239
you put in there is the courser yep okay

00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:22,729
like trying to scroll something on my

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,989
screen so the first thing of course is

00:03:22,729 --> 00:03:25,879
you're gonna have some sort of technical

00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:28,250
skills right if you're hiring for

00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:30,259
technical hiring if there's anything

00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,389
specific make sure to cover these

00:03:30,259 --> 00:03:35,569
somehow in your hiring process to make

00:03:32,389 --> 00:03:36,739
sure that people have them you might

00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:39,019
want them to have knowledge about your

00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:40,609
domain maybe maybe not depends on what

00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:42,859
you're doing what you need you probably

00:03:40,609 --> 00:03:44,840
want somebody with good communication

00:03:42,859 --> 00:03:46,519
skills you know they need to be able to

00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,870
collaborate effectively with other

00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:53,150
people on the team other technical staff

00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:54,439
in most places they're probably gonna

00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:57,079
also need to be able to communicate

00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:58,519
effectively with non-technical staff

00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:00,500
you probably want them to have some

00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:02,599
level of writing and organization skills

00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:05,150
because a lot of what we do as

00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:07,250
developers involves writing writing

00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:09,349
comments writing Docs writing commit

00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,459
messages how many of you work have

00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:12,469
worked with somebody who's commit

00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:13,849
message was fixed a bug and that's

00:04:12,469 --> 00:04:15,319
really annoying when you're trying to

00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:16,699
figure out what happened so trying to

00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:18,979
figure out if people have these skills

00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:21,709
is important and we'll come back to all

00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:23,590
of this again later another important

00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:25,740
thing is everybody should agree on

00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:27,900
what's important

00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,930
so everybody involved in the hiring

00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:32,669
process before you start doing hiring or

00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:34,410
certainly before you start reviewing

00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:36,240
resumes and interviewing people and

00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:37,919
really before you read the job posting

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,410
you should agree on this okay so

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,330
everybody needs to agree that these are

00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:45,599
the things that I think are important

00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:47,099
but don't just assume that everybody

00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:49,080
involved is on the same page as you

00:04:47,099 --> 00:04:52,050
because you know what they say about

00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,090
assuming so you really should meet with

00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:56,099
people discuss with the other folks

00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:57,449
involved with the hiring here's the

00:04:56,099 --> 00:04:59,069
things we think are important do you

00:04:57,449 --> 00:05:00,900
agree and if they don't you know have a

00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:02,400
discussion they'll probably have good

00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,380
reasons why they think some other thing

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,470
is or isn't important but ultimately you

00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:10,830
need to come to agreement on this so

00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:12,180
that feeds into the the job posting so I

00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:14,539
think it's really important that you put

00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:17,159
really clear requirements and benefits

00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:19,470
but be very careful about what's a

00:05:17,159 --> 00:05:21,479
required skill I see places just like

00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:24,599
with these long laundry list of required

00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:26,550
skills first of all most people don't

00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:30,570
have like every single specific thing

00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:32,070
you might imagine and my theory is the

00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:34,320
good people are gonna learn new

00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:36,479
technologies quickly so if it's like oh

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,919
we really need somebody who knows about

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,570
message queues but if you're already

00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,030
using message queues and you have people

00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:43,169
know this internally or you know you

00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:45,240
don't need to hire somebody else who

00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:47,520
knows this to get just to get them to do

00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:51,960
work right they can come in you can

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,979
teach them about it so I really caution

00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,419
people against putting too many

00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:56,759
requirements what I like to do is just

00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:58,440
put stuff in the optional section is

00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:00,060
nice to have because of course sometimes

00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,409
there's lots of things that we're using

00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,960
that would be great if they could come

00:06:01,409 --> 00:06:06,270
on board and know already but it's not

00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,590
absolutely necessary now sometimes I

00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:09,509
would point out you need to hire

00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:11,310
somebody to teach you something so maybe

00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:13,289
nobody on the team knows it you really

00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:16,050
want to get into I don't know using AWS

00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:17,250
and you have an open position well it

00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:19,409
would make a lot of sense to actually

00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,969
hire somebody with AWS expertise at that

00:06:19,409 --> 00:06:22,830
point because then they'll come in and

00:06:20,969 --> 00:06:25,650
teach you something but that's a that's

00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:27,389
a not as common case it can't be it

00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:29,009
can't explain all these job postings I

00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:32,039
see with the laundry list of things they

00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:33,930
need another thing to really think about

00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:35,909
is do they need a degree I see all these

00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:38,430
positions that wanna comps I'd agree I

00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:39,020
don't understand this I don't have a

00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,479
comp site

00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:44,270
greed myself and I'm amazingly awesome

00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:47,629
so I can't imagine why that would be

00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:49,460
required it all seriousness I don't

00:06:47,629 --> 00:06:51,159
think it's really necessary to have a

00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:53,840
comp site agree to work in this industry

00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:56,419
especially if somebody has some sort of

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:59,060
experience right if somebody can point

00:06:56,419 --> 00:07:01,280
to github or something it was like look

00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,780
I wrote a bunch of code isn't that good

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,750
enough to figure out whether they can

00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:07,039
write a bunch of code if it's not I

00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:09,770
don't know exactly what you're hiring

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,599
for the other things that you go in the

00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:13,280
job posting have a very clear

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,169
description of the work this helps

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,599
people filter themselves for things that

00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:19,099
they don't want to do so things to

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:22,400
mansion or like the size of the team

00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:25,630
that they'll be on whether you're doing

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:28,370
new code GREEN field work old code both

00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:30,259
what technologies you're using just

00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:31,669
because that's a way to get people

00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:33,250
excited potentially and also if

00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:36,979
somebody's like I don't know I hate

00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:39,949
whatever PHP just to pick a route like

00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:41,750
which is totally at random and they just

00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:43,159
can't imagine working on that then you

00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,509
don't want them to apply because you

00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:46,610
know it's a waste of their time waste of

00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:49,159
your time so the more detail you can put

00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:51,199
about what you do how your team works

00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:52,460
the better also put about like what

00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,469
types of interactions I'll have with

00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:55,520
non-technical folks some developers

00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:57,020
probably don't want to deal with

00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,060
customers and if that's a big part of

00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:00,830
the job maybe make sure to mention that

00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:03,650
really anything else you can mention

00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:05,210
that you think is of interest like talk

00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:07,219
about your development workflow do you

00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:08,440
use github and pull requests and stuff

00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:10,940
like that do you do pair programming

00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,889
whatever things you do put it in there

00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,659
because it will get the right people

00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:16,340
excited and it will keep the wrong

00:08:14,659 --> 00:08:17,719
people away and by wrong I don't mean

00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,190
that they're bad just that they wouldn't

00:08:17,719 --> 00:08:21,169
be a good fit for your particular

00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:23,449
environment so again this is about

00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:25,969
saving everybody some time and of course

00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:27,319
one of the most important thing is is to

00:08:25,969 --> 00:08:31,039
mention whether you allow remote

00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:33,140
employees I feel like that's a

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:35,329
no-brainer to say but you know I don't

00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:38,079
know job postings are terrible so I'm

00:08:35,329 --> 00:08:40,880
gonna say the no-brainer things I

00:08:38,079 --> 00:08:42,589
strongly believe in putting a salary

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,000
range but if you go to active State and

00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:45,589
see the positions that have been posted

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,230
for my team you'll notice that there's

00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:51,270
no salary range so I've lost this battle

00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:52,860
so far and active State

00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:55,800
but I'm gonna bring it up every damn

00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:57,480
time we have a job posting I may or may

00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,850
not ever win but at least I'll you know

00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,080
I'll fight the good fight I really think

00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:03,540
you should include a salary range in

00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:06,930
this industry especially with remote

00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:09,600
jobs the salary ranges are very wide and

00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:11,520
it's not always clear what the

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,690
expectation is like if I live in

00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,190
Minnesota or they're gonna pay me a

00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:15,510
Minnesota rate even though the company

00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:17,940
is based somewhere more expensive I

00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:20,460
don't know having some sense of that is

00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,890
very helpful because again this this

00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:24,390
prevents you from wasting time if salary

00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:26,490
is like the last thing that gets

00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:30,090
discussed as part of a negotiation and

00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:33,390
so you spent I don't know ten fifteen

00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:35,040
person hours interviewing and reviewing

00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:37,020
their code and whatever you've been

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,930
doing and then they get to the end and

00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:42,270
you just can't agree on salary why how

00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:44,850
does that possibly make sense that's a

00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:47,700
terrible use of everyone's time so I

00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:49,230
really want to encourage everybody else

00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,480
to do this even though I can't quite

00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:53,760
make it happen yet for me I won the

00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:57,240
battle at my last company but I haven't

00:09:53,760 --> 00:10:00,210
won it yet here so what next

00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,310
pre-interview screening remember the

00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:03,900
criteria you set up in the beginning the

00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:06,330
things you think are important the

00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:08,640
technology knowledge that you want them

00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:12,480
to have the communication skills all of

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,770
that sort of stuff try to you know do as

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,550
much of that screen as you can

00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:20,490
early buy resume or I'll talk about

00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:22,140
other ways to do it just as much as

00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:24,270
possible but again remember every step

00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:26,670
you're applying those criteria you came

00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:29,820
up with send the responses quickly and

00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:32,130
actually send some damn responses the

00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:34,410
number of places that don't even send an

00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:37,290
automated rejection when you when you

00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:40,290
like when you click the reject button in

00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:42,240
there their candidate software I just it

00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:43,470
blows my mind and if you don't have

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,910
Canada is it software I'd have to do it

00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:47,220
by hand I don't care you need to do it

00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:49,260
anyway it's just like basic courtesy to

00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:51,660
tell somebody thanks but no things and

00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:54,840
really there should be automated so it's

00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:57,260
easy if it's if it's too hard then I

00:10:54,840 --> 00:11:00,330
don't know you have some sort of problem

00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:01,230
and you know all the other thing you

00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:04,780
should do is send a thank-you

00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:06,730
immediately after they reply again a

00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:08,620
half competent system will let you

00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:09,970
automate this you should just say thanks

00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:12,490
for your application we'll get back to

00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:13,840
you in the near future just so that they

00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:16,600
know it actually went through when they

00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,550
click the button or sent the email and

00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,070
try to move on to the next steps as

00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:22,660
quickly as possible

00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:26,140
so I really like trying to do some sort

00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:27,760
of technical pre-screening and just the

00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:31,900
goal is to find out whether they have

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:33,790
any like some level of coding skill and

00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:36,520
you can't really get a sense of that

00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:39,490
without having them do some sort of

00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:41,170
coding right you can't figure out if

00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:43,570
somebody can code by asking them

00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:45,130
questions you figure out - somebody can

00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:51,760
code by having them write some code and

00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:53,920
looking at it excuse me so that all said

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,660
you can't make them do real work that's

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,490
not ok if it's if it's something you

00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:59,440
need done for your company you have to

00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:01,840
pay them if they're gonna do it but that

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,700
it has it's a whole can of worms where a

00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:08,020
lot of people have contracts that forbid

00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:10,150
moonlighting so you know it's tricky so

00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:11,770
then you can you can give them a shorter

00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,940
kind of test assignment something that

00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:16,840
just takes a couple hours that's a

00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:18,910
little more reasonable something like

00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:21,220
that so it's really important to find

00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:23,290
some way to evaluate their actual

00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:26,260
ability to do the job and the best way

00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:28,500
to do that is to look it at code so

00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:31,750
there's two ways that I've done this

00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:33,400
homework is the obvious one so I try to

00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,470
for all the homeworks that I've designed

00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,790
for different jobs try to make sure it

00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:39,760
does not take more than three hours to

00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:41,260
complete that's not as little as I'd

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,640
like but I also feel like to have any

00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:45,250
sort of substantial amount of code

00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:47,620
that's not just ten lines needs to take

00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:49,060
a little time I always do the homework

00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:50,650
myself I always give it to other people

00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,540
on the team and make them do it and have

00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:53,980
them report how long it took and if it

00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:56,110
takes them three hours it's too long

00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:58,030
because if it takes you or somebody

00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:00,160
who's like intimately involved with the

00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:01,240
process three hours to do the assignment

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,220
that you want to hand to a total

00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,290
stranger then it's gonna take the total

00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,820
stranger four or five six hours so it

00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:08,560
should be taking your team maybe one and

00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,600
a half to two hours to do it otherwise

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,010
that's too long and when we were hiring

00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,110
an active state we came up with a

00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:15,700
homework problem and I did it and it

00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:17,380
took me like two and a half hours I was

00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,910
like yeah there's no way I came up with

00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,920
this and it took me two and a half hours

00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:22,540
to do it it's gonna take other people

00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,790
quite a bit longer so we just cut it

00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:26,110
down and made it simpler and when I talk

00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:28,060
to people it seemed okay they were

00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:30,070
taking maybe three some we're taking

00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,180
more the the problem is you tell people

00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,530
don't take more than three hours and

00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,790
they get it done in two hours and then

00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:36,490
they spend the next four hours polishing

00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:38,470
it I don't know it's it's tough I don't

00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:40,450
want to abuse their time but I want to

00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:41,770
see some of their real code of course

00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:46,060
the other thing you can do is accept

00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:47,740
code samples so I didn't do this in the

00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,970
past but for this current job we decided

00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:51,400
to do it and I think it worked out quite

00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:52,900
well we said to people when we sent them

00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,340
this email about doing the homework like

00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,780
here's the homework assignment here's

00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:58,030
what we want you to do and then in big

00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:59,830
bold there is a sentence however you can

00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:02,410
ask for an exemption if you can point us

00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:04,200
at some code that we can look at and we

00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:06,880
basically said it has to be something

00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:11,290
reasonably self-contained a small app or

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:14,350
a library not like a 50,000 line or

00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:16,470
500,000 line you know giant monster

00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:18,580
server thing or

00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:20,200
flipside we don't want to look at a PR

00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,580
you sent to somebody else's project it

00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,950
had to be something that you created

00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:26,080
mostly yourself that you were kind of

00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:27,790
the primary owner of and was you know a

00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,190
few thousand lines of code not tens of

00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:32,050
thousands because we can't you know on

00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:34,600
the wasting time front we cannot look

00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:36,040
through ten people submitting a 50,000

00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,020
line project that's just not reasonable

00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:40,960
the homework assignment that we gave

00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:45,160
people typically came back at anywhere

00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:47,350
from I would guess like 300 to 800 lines

00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,820
maybe a thousand so you know I'm willing

00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:51,550
to look at a few thousand lines of code

00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:54,370
but I can't do between much more you

00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:56,320
guys when you're in doing your homework

00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:58,030
or sorry when you're doing your hiring

00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,950
process decisions this is a discussion

00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:01,060
to have do you want to make everyone do

00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:04,120
the homework in some ways it's a little

00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:05,590
fairer and that everybody has to do the

00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,840
same thing you evaluate them all the

00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:09,190
same way flipside you let them submit

00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,380
something they've already done you're

00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:14,380
saving everybody some time and that's a

00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:17,650
nice thing to be prepared to actually

00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:19,420
evaluate the homework so of course we

00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,530
have our evaluation criteria overall but

00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:22,060
for the homework we can probably get

00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:25,480
much more specific and if you follow

00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:28,360
this link you'll see the thing we sent

00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,379
out for hiring Erik to see and it has in

00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,209
the repo that we

00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:34,179
send you that has the assignment there's

00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:36,069
also an evaluation MD and it has all the

00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:39,489
questions that we ask ourselves when we

00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:41,319
review the homework big hint if your

00:15:39,489 --> 00:15:42,729
code doesn't pass that you'll get the

00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:44,109
right answers to these questions which

00:15:42,729 --> 00:15:46,149
should be obvious because it's like does

00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:48,729
the code do this like handle this error

00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:50,769
case then you're probably not gonna move

00:15:48,729 --> 00:15:52,059
on in our process yet I'm not sure

00:15:50,769 --> 00:15:54,489
everybody actually read through the

00:15:52,059 --> 00:15:56,499
evaluation anyway you should have some

00:15:54,489 --> 00:15:57,970
sort of very clear evaluation

00:15:56,499 --> 00:15:59,229
so again if you're having multiple

00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:03,279
people review the homework and you

00:15:59,229 --> 00:16:04,929
probably need to have at least two you

00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,669
should agree on what's important and

00:16:04,929 --> 00:16:07,929
what's not important and of course

00:16:06,669 --> 00:16:09,459
you'll still disagree on your

00:16:07,929 --> 00:16:13,239
evaluations and then you talk about it

00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:16,329
the homework instructions should be very

00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:20,559
detailed it's really easy when you write

00:16:16,329 --> 00:16:23,439
these to have ideas in your head that do

00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:25,989
not get translated onto paper or well

00:16:23,439 --> 00:16:27,309
not paper what am I saying however yes

00:16:25,989 --> 00:16:29,649
and then you send it by carrier pigeon

00:16:27,309 --> 00:16:31,419
it's really easy to have ideas in your

00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:34,569
head that don't get translated into the

00:16:31,419 --> 00:16:36,009
readme and the github repo and so you

00:16:34,569 --> 00:16:37,689
really have to be careful to make sure

00:16:36,009 --> 00:16:39,999
this is very detailed this is another

00:16:37,689 --> 00:16:42,100
reason to have people do it internally

00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,720
in your company ideally people who

00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,220
weren't involved in the formulation of

00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,589
the homework at least have one person do

00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:50,229
it so it's clear that your instructions

00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:52,419
make sense and don't leave a lot of

00:16:50,229 --> 00:16:53,470
ambiguity because what happens is if you

00:16:52,419 --> 00:16:56,109
don't cover something in this

00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:58,029
instructions you'll get back varying

00:16:56,109 --> 00:17:01,239
different ways of doing it you know

00:16:58,029 --> 00:17:03,220
handling some error case or you know do

00:17:01,239 --> 00:17:04,899
I need to check for this or that you'll

00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:06,819
get this back in the homework and it's

00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:08,799
not clear did somebody make a mistake if

00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:11,529
they didn't do something that you didn't

00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,939
ask for does you know the person who did

00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:15,309
it did they do better it's not clear

00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:16,689
because following instructions that's a

00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:18,639
good thing you told them not to spend

00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:20,889
more than three hours so again just make

00:17:18,639 --> 00:17:23,409
sure the the homework is very detailed

00:17:20,889 --> 00:17:24,730
cover just what you want them to do but

00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:26,740
also if there are things that they don't

00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:31,389
need to do for example in the active

00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:33,909
State example we explicitly say there's

00:17:31,389 --> 00:17:35,409
a circular dependency case that could

00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:37,809
happen in theory we say you don't need

00:17:35,409 --> 00:17:39,610
to check for it because we don't want

00:17:37,809 --> 00:17:42,550
people to just spend more time on things

00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:43,990
we decide we're okay

00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:48,970
kind of already covered this that the

00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:50,440
samples have to be substantial yeah this

00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:53,740
always happens I do something that's on

00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:55,060
five slides ahead so we'll skip this and

00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,970
yeah I already covered this should

00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:59,650
everyone do the homework it's up to you

00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:01,570
this is this is your technical hiring

00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:03,940
process you're gonna make it better one

00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:07,960
way or another it's up to you to decide

00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:09,610
all right so how do you do interviews so

00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,220
here's the first thing you should do is

00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:15,850
actually make a list of questions I've

00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:18,400
had interviews with people where it was

00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:22,060
quite obvious that they had not actually

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:25,890
planned in ahead in advance what to ask

00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:25,890
me and I found this very off-putting

00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:33,370
it's very keep in mind people are

00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,380
nervous normal people I don't get that

00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:37,530
nervous but like sane normal people

00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:40,900
actually get nervous in interviews and

00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:42,670
when you're clearly unprepared and don't

00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:44,920
know what you're doing you're really

00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:45,160
freaking the candidate out so don't do

00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,440
that

00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:49,240
also you're wasting valuable time where

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,070
you could be getting to know this person

00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,780
and learn more about them and learn

00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:54,910
whether they are suitable for what you

00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:57,820
want to hire them for so make a list of

00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:59,650
questions in advance for every question

00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:01,780
that you put on the list there should be

00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:04,090
a reason why you're asking it and that

00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:05,740
reason it cannot be because I assume

00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:07,780
seems interesting to me

00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:09,880
no tie it back to your evaluation

00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:11,440
criteria what are the things you want to

00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,480
learn about the person what do they need

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,640
to demonstrate in order to be a good

00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,110
candidate and every question on your

00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:20,910
list you should be able to tie back to

00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:23,350
one or more of those criteria now a

00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:25,120
perfectly valid reason to ask a question

00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:26,620
is because it's a really easy warm-up

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,630
question that hopefully will help the

00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:31,570
candidate relax so that's a valid reason

00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:33,310
to but don't just ask things for no

00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,840
reason whatsoever or because somebody

00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:37,030
asked them to you at an interview in the

00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:40,990
past for example what's your greatest

00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:43,600
strength and weakness terrible question

00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:45,790
and then of course the flipside is for

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,410
every criterion that you care about you

00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:49,210
should have some questions that cover it

00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:51,430
or you should be covering it's somewhere

00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:53,710
in the hiring process if not during this

00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:55,120
technical interview then maybe it's

00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,340
something that comes up during the home

00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,720
or

00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:58,430
to some other stage but you got to make

00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,930
sure that if you decide something as

00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:03,320
important that you have a way to

00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:08,330
evaluate that be prepared

00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:10,010
read the forking resume I I have had

00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:11,720
interviews where people say oh I didn't

00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:15,170
look at your resume and like oh thanks

00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:16,850
that really makes me feel good this

00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:19,160
seems like the very middle but I'm not

00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:21,590
saying read it in detail top to bottom

00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:23,120
every little thing but you know at least

00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:26,270
know some of the technologies they've

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,800
worked on where they last worked you

00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:29,120
don't need to memorize their entire job

00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,710
history but you should at least know

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:34,190
where they are now or what their last

00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:35,840
position was you know just inhale if you

00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:38,660
haven't read it don't tell them you

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:42,620
haven't read it at least fake it for oh

00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:44,630
man anyway the other thing coordinating

00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:47,210
the process in advance so if you're

00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:49,340
having multiple interviews and I'll get

00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:51,290
into whether you should whether I think

00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:53,150
you should do that later but just be

00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:54,620
real coordinated so if you have multiple

00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:56,240
people if it's a group interview which

00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:58,430
is really common I think it's just fine

00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,290
figure out who's gonna ask the questions

00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:02,420
we'll just one person ask all the

00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:05,000
questions are you gonna kind of trade

00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:06,440
off on every question maybe one person

00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,270
asks like the general questions the

00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:10,190
other does some technical stuff whatever

00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:12,950
doesn't this doesn't matter as much as

00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:14,660
that you have something coordinated in

00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:15,920
advance and that during the interviewer

00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:17,840
you're not looking at each other and

00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:20,060
going oh who's supposed to talk next

00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:24,440
just be organized again you're trying to

00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:25,910
make this process as not painless it'll

00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,110
never be painless but make it less

00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,880
painful for the candidate

00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:30,650
let them be their best self by not

00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,380
making them more nervous than you have

00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:35,480
to make them when you're uncoordinated

00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:37,100
and it doesn't seem like you know what

00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,740
you're doing you're making them more

00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:41,510
nervous figure out what types of

00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:44,300
questions you'll ask what types of

00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:45,860
questions you won't ask what you're

00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:48,680
looking for all this sort of stuff and

00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:50,870
also make sure it's very important that

00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:53,840
you allocate time for the candidate to

00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:55,580
ask their own questions you can do it at

00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,560
the end you could say ask me a question

00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,910
whatever you want you could do both just

00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:02,450
make sure that you have some time for

00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:03,800
that slotted so like I said I'm I think

00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:05,630
group interviews are fine as long as

00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,310
you're very organized the way we

00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:08,519
typically what I've done a couple

00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:10,049
different things I've done

00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:12,690
things were like just one person asked

00:22:10,049 --> 00:22:14,159
all the questions and we tell the

00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:15,330
candidate up front you know I'm gonna do

00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,940
all the talking the other people are

00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:19,589
here just to listen I might ask them to

00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:21,330
chime in on your question something like

00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:23,519
that I've also done things where we

00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:25,080
traded off explicitly like we had a we

00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:26,639
had our list of questions remember we've

00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,700
made a list of questions and we had a

00:22:26,639 --> 00:22:31,169
point in the list where it was like okay

00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:33,450
Sean who was the person I was doing this

00:22:31,169 --> 00:22:37,049
with you take over it was really clear

00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:37,950
and organized so the other thing you

00:22:37,049 --> 00:22:41,159
should do is have some sort of

00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:42,869
back-channel for chat so that people in

00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:44,820
the interview like on your side can be

00:22:42,869 --> 00:22:47,579
like oh hey you missed this or can you

00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:48,989
ask more about this or this is going

00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:51,719
nowhere can you find a way to end this

00:22:48,989 --> 00:22:57,320
gracefully all of which are valid things

00:22:51,719 --> 00:22:59,219
to discuss privately so basic politeness

00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:03,359
what should you start with it the

00:22:59,219 --> 00:23:05,159
interview not questions no you need to

00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:08,149
start with introductions there is a

00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:10,379
company I interviewed with where I

00:23:08,149 --> 00:23:13,259
realized I was interviewing with one of

00:23:10,379 --> 00:23:16,829
the co-founders about 30 or 40 minutes

00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:18,389
into the interview I I'm not gonna say

00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:22,379
what company it is but they might be

00:23:18,389 --> 00:23:24,029
represented in this room Oh company by

00:23:22,379 --> 00:23:26,249
the way I gotta say he seems really

00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:28,440
great in a lot of ways I I don't want to

00:23:26,249 --> 00:23:30,179
like say this was bad coming at all I

00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:33,119
think I would have been very happy to

00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:35,489
work there but there's always there's

00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:37,409
always things that could be improved so

00:23:35,489 --> 00:23:38,909
what I would suggest is that you start

00:23:37,409 --> 00:23:40,950
the interview with some introductions

00:23:38,909 --> 00:23:43,950
and everybody should say their name what

00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:46,320
their position in the company is their

00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:48,209
relationship to this potential hire like

00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,950
I'd be your manager I be on the same

00:23:48,209 --> 00:23:52,739
team as you or I'm on a different team

00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:54,869
just to give them some context if that's

00:23:52,739 --> 00:23:57,299
not obvious how long you've been with

00:23:54,869 --> 00:23:58,950
the company again more context and if

00:23:57,299 --> 00:24:00,839
you're remote tell them where you live

00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:03,320
just to give them a sense of that just

00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:05,999
again just to be friendly and polite

00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:07,469
you should also tell them about the

00:24:05,999 --> 00:24:09,299
interview tell them what you're gonna do

00:24:07,469 --> 00:24:11,190
and how it's going to be structured so

00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:14,429
this is the thing I basically read to

00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:16,139
people an active seat and I'll read it

00:24:14,429 --> 00:24:17,669
to you now it says our goal is to learn

00:24:16,139 --> 00:24:19,710
more about you and for you to learn more

00:24:17,669 --> 00:24:21,539
about us in the position we will not be

00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:23,190
asking stumper type techno

00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:25,409
technical questions nor are we looking

00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:26,549
for someone who fits a specific mold if

00:24:25,409 --> 00:24:28,499
you have any questions during the

00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:30,389
interview please feel free to ask them

00:24:28,499 --> 00:24:31,830
as they occur to you we'll also make

00:24:30,389 --> 00:24:33,359
sure to leave time at the end of the

00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:36,359
interview for you to ask questions so

00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:39,239
just giving them a little bit of prep of

00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:41,909
how this is going to go doesn't take

00:24:39,239 --> 00:24:44,129
very long it just again this is kind of

00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:46,109
trying to put people at ease be polite

00:24:44,129 --> 00:24:48,869
make it easier for them to be their best

00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:50,609
self so what sort of things can you

00:24:48,869 --> 00:24:52,320
learn in an interview this goes back to

00:24:50,609 --> 00:24:55,590
the types of questions you might ask and

00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:57,299
your criterion and all that stuff does

00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:59,279
the candidate want the job

00:24:57,299 --> 00:25:01,049
this is a good thing to try to find out

00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:03,059
because some people will apply to a lot

00:25:01,049 --> 00:25:05,639
of jobs and maybe they don't actually

00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:07,440
want them so try to ask them some

00:25:05,639 --> 00:25:09,570
questions I try to have to find things

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,220
about you just ask them what appeals to

00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:13,259
you about this job and if they don't

00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:15,419
have any sort of answer that's a bit of

00:25:13,259 --> 00:25:17,519
a red flag you know and often people say

00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:20,279
very normal things like I'm looking for

00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:23,429
a remote position okay hey that makes a

00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:25,019
lot of sense you'll probably you know at

00:25:23,429 --> 00:25:26,340
least get something out of working here

00:25:25,019 --> 00:25:27,779
if you're looking for remote or I want

00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:30,119
to work with this technology or whatever

00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:33,119
just try to figure out if they want this

00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:34,679
job and they'll be happy Kim Kim the

00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:38,190
candidate communicate effectively so I

00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:40,320
try to ask them technical questions that

00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:41,759
aren't like Google look it up type

00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,759
things but more like let's have a

00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:46,499
conversation or tell me about what you

00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:48,659
like you know one of the questions I ask

00:25:46,499 --> 00:25:50,549
is actually I'll get to that in the next

00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:52,200
slide you just try to make sure that

00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:54,299
they can communicate both about

00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,769
technical and non-technical topics

00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:57,690
effectively this actually is every

00:25:55,769 --> 00:26:00,599
question right like if I ask you what

00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:03,690
what are you interested in about this

00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:06,419
job what interests you for this job and

00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:08,220
they can't formulate a coherent answer

00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:10,769
just like I was unable to formulate a

00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:12,210
coherent sentence a second ago and then

00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:15,330
don't hire them don't hire me because

00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:16,799
clearly I can't communicate so really

00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:19,619
just this is something I think is really

00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:21,749
important do they care about technical

00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:23,249
stuff but not too much so one of the

00:26:21,749 --> 00:26:25,559
questions I ask is what's you you know

00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:27,029
what languages have you used or you know

00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:28,769
I say okay I see on your resume you've

00:26:27,029 --> 00:26:30,629
done javascript perl python and go

00:26:28,769 --> 00:26:32,279
anything else you want to mention

00:26:30,629 --> 00:26:34,040
okay what's your pick one that's your

00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:35,450
favorite and they asked them to tell me

00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,830
why and then ask them to tell me what

00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:39,620
they don't like about it because I want

00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:42,080
them to have some sort of interest in

00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:44,900
technology like you know I really enjoy

00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:47,510
using go because it compiles quickly and

00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:49,070
it's really easy to deploy and it's got

00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:51,350
built-in go format and that's already

00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:53,180
really nice and so they have some sort

00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:54,920
of opinion I don't actually care what

00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:56,900
the opinion is I just want them to have

00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:59,540
an opinion I want them to care about

00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:01,070
their work but if they like I use go

00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:02,750
because this is the greatest language in

00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:05,540
the world and all others are terrible

00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:06,860
that's the too much you don't want that

00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:10,430
person on your team because they're

00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:12,860
gonna drive everybody crazy so you know

00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:14,900
do they care but not too much what's

00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:16,940
important to them if they say I love

00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:18,800
pair programming and I have to do it all

00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:21,230
the time and your team doesn't really

00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:23,300
like to do pair programming then

00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:24,860
actually I would tell I would say hey

00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:27,020
you know I'm really glad you brought

00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:29,090
that up we don't really do that and I

00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,860
don't see that changing so I don't know

00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:32,900
if this is good fit for you is it really

00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:33,980
such an important thing because I want

00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,690
to give them an outlet and you know if

00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:38,060
they say yeah this is crucial amazing I

00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:39,080
say thanks for your time you know I wish

00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,070
you the best of luck in finding a job

00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:43,340
where you can do a lot of pair of

00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:44,390
programming so you know try to figure

00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:46,700
out if there's things that are really

00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:48,440
crucial to them that you can't provide

00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,970
conversely if you can't provide them

00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,400
make sure they know that because that'll

00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:53,780
make them more excited to take the job

00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:55,580
what reservations do they have again

00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:57,800
this is a chance to address concerns or

00:27:55,580 --> 00:28:00,440
find out if they're like oh I'm really

00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:02,060
concerned about like remote like I want

00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,850
to do video chats all the time but your

00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:06,710
team is all about slack and email again

00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:08,690
this is this is an opportunity to say

00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:10,400
maybe this isn't the best fit for you

00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:11,570
and that's okay that they haven't done

00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:14,390
anything wrong you haven't done anything

00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:16,670
wrong again save time don't have them

00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:19,520
find out two weeks after they start that

00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:21,500
this is a terrible position another

00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,150
thing I like is see what questions they

00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,710
ask me this gets back to do they care

00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:26,240
about stuff do they hear about technical

00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:27,650
stuff do they care about their work

00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,360
environment and their co-workers and

00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:31,130
stuff like that if they have no

00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,310
questions that's kind of a red flag I

00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:36,440
just want to see some sort of interest

00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:37,850
so some of the specific questions asked

00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,290
I mentioned this what appeals to you

00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:40,580
about this position what are the most

00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:42,650
important things for you in a position

00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:44,000
what reservations do you have on moving

00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:46,250
the mouse around on the other screen

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,600
again this is really hard because the

00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:49,789
scroll bar is on the right and the

00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:52,039
the screen is on the right I mentioned

00:28:49,789 --> 00:28:53,450
the programming language 1 what is one

00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:55,429
of the hardest technical problems you

00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:57,620
solved just to get a sense of can may

00:28:55,429 --> 00:28:58,940
explain a hard technical problem in and

00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,960
this is especially good because often

00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:02,000
they're explaining something I don't

00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:04,220
understand very well at the candidate

00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,110
who worked on some satellite stuff I

00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:08,510
don't know anything about programming

00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:10,610
for satellites and sending them commands

00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:12,860
to move around in orbit but he explained

00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:16,220
it in a way that made sense and it was

00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:18,260
interesting and he was engaged and he

00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:20,210
was able to communicate that clearly to

00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:23,210
the rest of us and I thought that was a

00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:24,350
really good thing tell us about one of

00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:25,850
the dirtiest acts you've ever

00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:27,950
implemented how would you go back and

00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:29,919
fix it again just what's their insight

00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:31,909
into their own work their own process

00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:33,110
describe what you think an idea what

00:29:31,909 --> 00:29:34,940
development workflow would look like

00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:37,070
again I want them to come here care

00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:38,929
about how this works I also want to find

00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:40,940
out if they want us to do you know they

00:29:38,929 --> 00:29:42,590
want to do X and I don't know they want

00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:44,240
to do waterfall and we're doing agile or

00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:48,320
vice versa and they just think it's got

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:49,730
to be waterfall good to know another

00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,110
type of question I think is really good

00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:52,820
and actually when the companies I

00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:55,100
interviewed with asked me a great one

00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:56,780
it's really impressed this is just like

00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,770
a kind of unfolding technical question

00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:59,539
where you start with kind of the

00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:00,890
simplest version and then you just make

00:29:59,539 --> 00:30:02,570
it harder and harder and the goal is to

00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:04,850
kind of like push their boundaries a

00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:06,440
little and have a conversation really

00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:08,690
this should be a very conversational

00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:10,429
thing so you know start with like let's

00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:12,620
sketch out to design for this thing and

00:30:10,429 --> 00:30:14,630
I'm going to give you like the simple

00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:16,970
version and I'm going to make it harder

00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:18,260
as we go and now it's very important

00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:20,450
that you be prepared to answer their

00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:24,110
questions because if they're like well

00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:25,730
can I what's our budget or you know can

00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:28,460
I run this across multiple data centers

00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:30,890
or whatever and you say no then this

00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:32,210
isn't going to go very well so be

00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:33,980
prepared answer other questions make

00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:35,690
something up on the spot if you need to

00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:37,640
but at least have some sense of where

00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:39,289
this is going to go so you can do

00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:41,299
something like you know build a web

00:30:39,289 --> 00:30:42,679
service how would you build like a

00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:44,179
really simple web service and they

00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:45,710
answer that and you say okay what if we

00:30:44,179 --> 00:30:48,350
wanted to operate across multiple data

00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:51,710
centers how do you handle updates from

00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:53,809
those data centers all at once what do

00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:56,059
what if it's a batch system that dies

00:30:53,809 --> 00:30:57,650
six hours into a 12 hour process just

00:30:56,059 --> 00:30:59,929
different ways to kind of push their

00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:00,700
knowledge push them to come up with new

00:30:59,929 --> 00:31:02,230
ideas

00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:04,480
the goal isn't to find out that they

00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:06,160
know everything in the world that's not

00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,630
the expectation again it's really can

00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,640
you have a conversation with them about

00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:12,280
a technical challenge because this is

00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:14,440
exactly what you do at work all the time

00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:16,180
right you're that the product team is

00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,310
like we need to build this set of

00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:20,280
features and then you know the

00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:22,720
engineering team says well okay

00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:24,430
product you want to do X Y & Z what

00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,800
about this what's the you know

00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:28,750
requirements for requests per second and

00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:30,910
so on and then you also have this

00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:32,500
conversation internally well we could

00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:34,150
build it using a message queue well what

00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,500
if the messages get lost what if they

00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:37,660
get delivered more than once these are

00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:39,460
the kinds of conversations you need to

00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:43,660
be able to engage in to be effective in

00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:46,000
this field so I think culture fit is

00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:48,940
really I hate this term I do

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,380
think it kind of gets at something

00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,570
that's important but it's much too

00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:56,410
nebulous so what I really think you need

00:31:52,570 --> 00:32:00,070
to focus on is company values you know

00:31:56,410 --> 00:32:01,810
does this person will they resonate with

00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:03,550
whatever your company values whatever

00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:05,380
that might be so one thing I really like

00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:07,360
about working in active State this is

00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:09,100
real culture of transparency internally

00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,350
so we have like monthly meetings where

00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:12,670
the CEO tells us about financials and

00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:15,430
sales and all that I think that's great

00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:17,830
it's really cool if we were hiring a CFO

00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:19,990
and they were like it's very important

00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:22,150
that we not show this information that

00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:23,770
would be example of what you might want

00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:26,860
into culture fit but I would say is like

00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:28,570
a conflict of values right so that's

00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:31,000
really important and then you know also

00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:33,010
how you work as a team so to get back to

00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,270
the pair programming thing that's

00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:35,920
something that you know is a very

00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:39,250
concrete thing that might just be a

00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:40,810
conflict so other things that you can

00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:43,180
talk about that I think are narrower

00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:45,220
that are more useful things like

00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:46,570
work-life balance goals if you're a

00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:48,970
start-up where everyone works crazy

00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:51,010
hours and they want the same life or

00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:52,630
some people really want to just join

00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:54,700
some startup with it can work crazy

00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:58,330
hours and maybe your company doesn't do

00:32:54,700 --> 00:33:00,160
that you know their preferred

00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:02,950
communication style I'm it's not before

00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:04,960
chat versus video versus email and so on

00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:07,030
you know these are all things that I

00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,740
think are valid and could maybe be

00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:10,600
called culture but I think culture fit

00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:14,119
gets used as kind of this broad nebulous

00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:16,969
term to just like pick people that you

00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:18,499
not that you shouldn't like them but you

00:33:16,969 --> 00:33:21,349
don't need them to be your friends so

00:33:18,499 --> 00:33:22,699
I've heard people say things like you

00:33:21,349 --> 00:33:24,049
know you want to hire somebody who you

00:33:22,699 --> 00:33:26,749
think you could go out and have a beer

00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:28,999
with I'm just like that's crazy first of

00:33:26,749 --> 00:33:30,339
all I don't drink beer or alcohol I

00:33:28,999 --> 00:33:32,389
don't want to have a beer with anyone

00:33:30,339 --> 00:33:35,119
second of all this isn't really about me

00:33:32,389 --> 00:33:36,769
the point is it's not about somebody

00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:38,839
who's gonna be your best bud for life

00:33:36,769 --> 00:33:41,449
you want to hire somebody who you think

00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:44,059
will work well with the team and I

00:33:41,449 --> 00:33:46,159
emphasize the word work okay you're

00:33:44,059 --> 00:33:47,659
hiring them for a job you're not hiring

00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:50,179
a friend if you want to interview

00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:51,409
potential friends that's a very

00:33:50,179 --> 00:33:53,869
interesting idea

00:33:51,409 --> 00:33:55,699
maybe there's a talk in there but that's

00:33:53,869 --> 00:33:57,259
not what hiring is about you want to

00:33:55,699 --> 00:33:59,359
hire people you think you can get along

00:33:57,259 --> 00:34:01,159
with it work doesn't mean you'd want to

00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:01,669
hang out with them at after work that's

00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:04,369
okay

00:34:01,669 --> 00:34:05,959
I'm remote I can't hire it hang out with

00:34:04,369 --> 00:34:08,359
anybody I work with they all live very

00:34:05,959 --> 00:34:10,879
far away so I just want to hire people

00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:13,159
who I think will do a good job day to

00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:15,829
day at work you know now there is

00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:18,139
certainly a you know basic communication

00:34:15,829 --> 00:34:20,119
skills basic civility all that that also

00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:21,829
is something you'd want and a friend but

00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:23,359
the things you want in a friend or I

00:34:21,829 --> 00:34:25,819
think much more and much more specific

00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:28,429
than what you need out of your coworkers

00:34:25,819 --> 00:34:30,679
I think puzzles are also I

00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:33,919
really hate when people do these puzzle

00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:35,869
type questions every question you ask

00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:37,669
like I said it should have a purpose and

00:34:35,869 --> 00:34:39,499
it's really hard for me to figure out

00:34:37,669 --> 00:34:41,779
how brain teasers have a purpose because

00:34:39,499 --> 00:34:43,429
this is not what you how many of you had

00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:44,899
to figure out why manhole covers are

00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:52,279
round as part of your day to day work

00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:55,009
really okay oh no it's like this is not

00:34:52,279 --> 00:34:56,629
your job figure out I don't know the

00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:58,730
population of some random with all these

00:34:56,629 --> 00:35:01,400
stupid questions I mean this is not your

00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:03,259
job I want to see how they think no ask

00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,700
them a technical question see how they

00:35:03,259 --> 00:35:07,670
think about something actually relevant

00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:09,619
to the damn job I also hate really

00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:11,420
overly specific especially technical

00:35:09,619 --> 00:35:12,829
questions this is if it's

00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:15,769
something that somebody can look up

00:35:12,829 --> 00:35:17,720
online don't ask them you know how do i

00:35:15,769 --> 00:35:19,339
how do you reverse a doubly-linked list

00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,700
without allocating more memory or

00:35:19,339 --> 00:35:23,720
something like that and that's like

00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:25,789
literally I could type that into Google

00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:28,130
and get the answer so why do I need to

00:35:25,789 --> 00:35:30,500
hire somebody who knows how to do this

00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:34,340
their ability to memorize algorithms or

00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:36,140
data structures or api's is not really a

00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:37,790
very important part of the job

00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:39,770
one of the questions I do ask is when

00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:41,480
you're stuck on something what resources

00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:43,250
do you turn to for help and if they

00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:45,230
don't mention things like Google and

00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:47,150
sack overflow that is kind of a red flag

00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:49,520
I need people who can walk things up and

00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:51,620
learn stuff I don't need the people have

00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:54,590
memorized everything that's totally

00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:55,630
pointless really hate white board coding

00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:58,010
mmm

00:35:55,630 --> 00:36:00,620
it's there's been a lot written on this

00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:02,810
it's again it's very unrealistic you're

00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:04,840
not testing anything like real work I

00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:07,460
think it's really stressful and cruel

00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:08,900
now I I do want to note that something

00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:11,300
like sketching out a system architecture

00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,920
on a whiteboard that's totally legit

00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:14,780
that is actually what you would doing

00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:18,230
real work right so that's fine but

00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:18,740
asking them to write actual code is not

00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:22,550
okay

00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:23,540
pseudocode diagrams again the things you

00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:27,320
might do in real life

00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:31,040
that's fine similarly I'm mostly against

00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:32,780
live coding but at least it's not a

00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,330
whiteboard but if they'll still think it

00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:37,850
can be very stressful and cruel my one

00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:39,770
exception is I'd like to do a pairing

00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:40,820
session with people on the if they've

00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:42,230
done the homework I do it on their

00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:45,860
homework otherwise on whatever they

00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:46,970
submitted so it's really important that

00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:48,260
you parent something that they're

00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:50,240
familiar with you can't just hand them

00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:52,940
some new thing that's why I use their

00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:54,350
homework or their code submission it's a

00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:57,020
good way to see what it's actually like

00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:58,760
to work with them and also it does give

00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:01,340
you a chance to check that like in

00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:02,420
something approaching real time they can

00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:04,820
do it because they could tell you they

00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:06,890
did the homework in for three hours but

00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:08,660
they actually spent three days on it I

00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:10,130
do want to at least see that they can

00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:13,400
think through something and what I think

00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:14,990
is an appropriate amount of time and I

00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,640
think at least doing it on some piece of

00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:18,500
code that they've already written and

00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,880
you know and tell them in advance that

00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:22,490
this will be part of the process so that

00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:24,290
they can be prepared for it this is like

00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:28,640
the least stressful way I can think of

00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:31,700
to do this try to do fewer interviews if

00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:33,770
possible this makes the process quicker

00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:35,690
it's less stressful this is why I like

00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:37,670
group interviews more than just having

00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:38,810
I've done interviews of places where

00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:40,760
they have me interview with like every

00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:41,300
person on a team see really they ask a

00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,890
lot of the

00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:45,020
questions it just seems like a big waste

00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:46,640
of time there's always gonna be people

00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:48,080
though with less free time who won't

00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,810
participate in all the group interviews

00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:52,640
the CTO the CEO you're going to need to

00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:54,290
schedule multiple interviews that's okay

00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,360
it's also okay to do like a quick

00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:58,490
pre-screening like we do an active State

00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:00,800
our recruiter just has a ten minute

00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:03,220
conversation that's not technical just

00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:06,950
to make sure the person isn't just

00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:08,720
completely weird or you know unable to

00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:11,240
communicate at all or just says

00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,740
something I I don't know we've never had

00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:14,630
somebody not get through that so I don't

00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:15,890
know what it would take but I feel like

00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:17,900
spending ten minutes on the phone

00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:20,210
talking letting the recruiter talk to

00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:24,530
you it seems like a good use of

00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:27,230
everyone's time you know post interview

00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:28,580
remember your evaluation criteria that's

00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:30,560
where we started with all this you

00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:32,780
should be evaluating everybody based on

00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,330
all of this and try to make a decision

00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:38,090
as quickly as possible

00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:39,170
it's it's tough I I will say we failed

00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:40,730
miserably with it

00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:43,190
an active save during our last hiring

00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:45,080
process it took way too long one of the

00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:47,120
things we did we did a post-mortem after

00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,860
we had finished and we're like how what

00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:50,990
are all the changes we can make to save

00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:52,670
time save our time try to make the

00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:54,980
process move quickly or quicker in

00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:56,900
particular can we find ways to screen

00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:59,480
people out a little earlier so we're

00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:01,370
gonna do like a short technical

00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:03,290
screening phone interview they'll take

00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:04,460
like 15 minutes see if that screens some

00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:06,710
people out worried you know

00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:08,600
I'd also encourage you to experiment see

00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:10,010
if you can find things that work better

00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:12,560
there's never going to be anything

00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:13,970
perfect and maybe you'll come up with

00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,760
some system that works better for you

00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:19,640
that's again saves people time and is

00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:22,400
just a hopefully less stressful for the

00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:24,530
candidates but also stressful or not if

00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,480
you reject them earlier that's actually

00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:29,300
good for them they're applying to a lot

00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,890
of jobs you know it's a stressful

00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:33,800
process getting and no it's actually

00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:38,030
better than sitting in limbo forever so

00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:40,520
at least you've let them move on they

00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:43,660
can let it go and now I will sing this

00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:47,240
no I will not sing so here's my summary

00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:49,400
be prepared that's what a lot of this

00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:51,340
has been about is just be prepared don't

00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:53,500
wing it while you're in the middle of

00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:54,710
interviewing or hiring people

00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,900
the

00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:58,430
on your evaluation criteria this is one

00:39:56,900 --> 00:40:00,470
of the most important things you can do

00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:02,359
have a conversation before you hire to

00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:04,280
make sure everybody's on the same page

00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:06,349
and then reflect this through all the

00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:08,089
stages of the process through the draw

00:40:06,349 --> 00:40:10,760
posting through the interview questions

00:40:08,089 --> 00:40:12,320
through whatever technical thing you

00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,790
have them do whether it's homework or

00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:16,099
submit a code sample make sure that

00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:19,550
everything ties back to what you thought

00:40:16,099 --> 00:40:21,830
was important in the first place don't

00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:22,369
waste your time you have a lot of work

00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:24,980
to do

00:40:22,369 --> 00:40:26,510
right at least I assume you do I feel

00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:29,060
like I have a lot of work to do and I

00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:31,790
assume most other people do don't waste

00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:33,680
your time don't waste their time you

00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:35,390
know it's really not cool to keep people

00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:38,200
on the hook for six or seven or eight

00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:41,089
weeks and not give them any feedback

00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:43,760
reject them sooner ideally try to hire

00:40:41,089 --> 00:40:46,609
them sooner it's so hard but try to make

00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:48,650
it quicker if you can and the best thing

00:40:46,609 --> 00:40:57,770
you can try to do is suck it at least

00:40:48,650 --> 00:41:11,720
20% less thank you so we have nine

00:40:57,770 --> 00:41:13,700
minutes by my clock for questions yes so

00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:15,170
the question was for the pre-screening

00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:17,930
how do I feel about coding tests they're

00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:19,760
automatically scored I've never I've

00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:21,650
never really looked at them my

00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:28,010
inclination is to think they'd have to

00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:31,820
be terrible it's hard for me to I guess

00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:33,859
okay so what I could imagine in theory

00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:37,730
is if the way it worked was you were

00:41:33,859 --> 00:41:40,099
asked a question and the answer was code

00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:42,920
and that code was executed and tested

00:41:40,099 --> 00:41:45,349
against like a test suite or something

00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:47,750
that could work which is essentially

00:41:45,349 --> 00:41:49,550
what we do with our homework we say you

00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:50,839
know your code needs to do this and

00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:53,210
produce this output and then when I run

00:41:50,839 --> 00:41:54,589
I wrote a tester program that I feed

00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:56,180
their command line program into it

00:41:54,589 --> 00:41:59,230
executes it looks at the output that

00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:59,230
seems fine

00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:07,380
well let me finish answering her

00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:09,060
questions and I will answer that because

00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:12,300
that's also a good one so yeah my

00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:15,300
thinking is that it lists the coding

00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:16,890
test that's automated is really running

00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:19,290
the code it's hard to see how it could

00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:20,550
be good because otherwise you're

00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:21,930
essentially gonna get one of those

00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:24,120
things where it's like a non-technical

00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:25,800
person like all these horror stories we

00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:27,660
hear about the Google recruiters asking

00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,400
questions where like the person's like

00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:31,290
an expert in file systems and they give

00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,970
a really detailed answer and the crude

00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:36,000
was like no that's wrong you were

00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:38,010
supposed to say inode it's like it's

00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:42,350
hard to see how it would be different so

00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:42,350
I could imagine in theory of being good

00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:54,360
oh okay I say yeah I mean I think that

00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:57,960
could potentially be okay I'd really

00:42:54,360 --> 00:43:00,180
want to dig into it more deeply before

00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:03,600
I'd use it but I won't say it's

00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:07,590
automatically awful I do that however

00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:09,840
think there is I guess with that I want

00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:11,490
it to be something quick like maybe a 20

00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:13,170
a 30 minute thing that we have

00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:14,610
candidates do relatively early on in the

00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:18,720
process again to try to screen people

00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:20,130
out earlier I still want to see so what

00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,260
I see substantial code they've written

00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:24,750
because the other thing besides that we

00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:27,390
look for when we review homework besides

00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:30,390
just is it correct is stylistically how

00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:31,470
is it like is it well organized you know

00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:33,540
and there's lots of ways to organize

00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:35,970
code and we get lots of different

00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:37,440
submissions that you know organize it in

00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:39,950
different ways that's okay but it can

00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:42,090
also be very disorganized and that's

00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:43,170
something I don't you know I don't want

00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:45,960
to hire somebody it's gonna come in and

00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:47,700
make a mess so seeing code that's again

00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:49,680
a couple hundred lines or had to divide

00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:51,300
it into at least a couple packages and

00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,160
subroutines and stuff I think is

00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:54,420
important and I can't imagine what those

00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:56,930
coding tasks that's what they're

00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:56,930
producing

00:43:58,309 --> 00:44:05,569
yeah okay yeah and see that that if it's

00:44:03,829 --> 00:44:06,949
algorithms and data structures also be

00:44:05,569 --> 00:44:08,900
concerned that it's just testing like

00:44:06,949 --> 00:44:11,449
how much you remember from your comps i

00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:14,209
degree which you may or may not have so

00:44:11,449 --> 00:44:18,579
I don't know I'm skeptical

00:44:14,209 --> 00:44:18,579
color me skeptical so you had a question

00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:25,719
[Music]

00:44:29,529 --> 00:44:33,979
so the test yeah so the question is do

00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:35,059
we show the test suite we have with

00:44:33,979 --> 00:44:37,640
people doing the homework

00:44:35,059 --> 00:44:39,170
we haven't the the test suite is like a

00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:41,269
functional test suite that just runs

00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:43,519
your program for this particular thing

00:44:41,269 --> 00:44:46,670
looks at the output which the output is

00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:48,619
supposed to be a JSON so it's really

00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:50,269
easy to just slurp it all up and parse

00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:52,999
it and make sure it matches what we

00:44:50,269 --> 00:44:54,589
expect we do go into a fair bit to

00:44:52,999 --> 00:44:56,150
detail in the instructions on what this

00:44:54,589 --> 00:44:59,180
is supposed to be I feel like giving

00:44:56,150 --> 00:45:01,339
them the test suite would make it maybe

00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:03,170
a little too easy I do like to see if

00:45:01,339 --> 00:45:05,179
they've written tests it's not mandatory

00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:06,679
for the the thing we give them a lot of

00:45:05,179 --> 00:45:09,019
people do just because that's how they

00:45:06,679 --> 00:45:10,519
work they typically write more like unit

00:45:09,019 --> 00:45:12,499
test stuff which is great I'd love to

00:45:10,519 --> 00:45:13,849
see that some people have written more

00:45:12,499 --> 00:45:16,369
kind of integration level test that's

00:45:13,849 --> 00:45:18,380
also great yeah I just feel like it

00:45:16,369 --> 00:45:20,119
would maybe make it a little too easy if

00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:22,880
I if it was a different sort of problem

00:45:20,119 --> 00:45:24,979
I might but for this particular problem

00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:30,160
I just feel like it would be too much

00:45:24,979 --> 00:45:30,160
help this

00:45:40,000 --> 00:46:07,040
so that's a great question yeah that's a

00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:09,320
great question so the question was when

00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:11,720
if you're in a situation where like

00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:13,610
booking where Abigail works at where

00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:15,500
you're hiring a lot of people it's a

00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:16,850
very big growing company by the time

00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:18,140
somebody starts it could be several

00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:21,170
months because it's often an

00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:22,670
international move and but their time

00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:24,110
they start that the team's may have been

00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:25,550
reorganized or whatever so they don't

00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:26,930
really hire four teams so how do you

00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:28,460
accommodate that because I was talking

00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:29,900
about well the team should you know

00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:32,270
should decide on this based on the team

00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:34,460
thank for that you just there's a couple

00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:36,200
things one you need to be a little more

00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:38,090
general in your evaluation criteria

00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:39,680
because you're looking probably for just

00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:43,010
people are good that can be put

00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:44,270
somewhere the other is you probably need

00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:46,460
to incorporate something into your

00:46:44,270 --> 00:46:48,080
interviews or screening where you try to

00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:49,670
get a better sense of their specific

00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:52,100
skills so that you can actually place

00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:53,330
them effectively I've never worked in a

00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:54,440
company that's been big enough where

00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:58,610
that's been the case I've always been

00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:59,990
hiring for more you know even when we're

00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:01,490
hiring more generally it was like we had

00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:03,920
ten developers we were hiring the

00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:05,840
eleventh we weren't necessarily looking

00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:08,030
for a super specific skill set just a

00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:09,770
skilled developer we could bring in and

00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:12,320
throw it the the things we were doing

00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:13,940
but yeah that's a different situation so

00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:18,730
I think you just try to find ways to

00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:21,800
adjust it you know to have more kind of

00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:23,330
conversational general questions and and

00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:25,160
your job postings should probably be a

00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:27,530
lot much less specific and and say that

00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:29,480
in the job posting you know at the rate

00:47:27,530 --> 00:47:31,910
we're hiring you know you probably will

00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:33,460
end up on a you know we won't know your

00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:37,190
placement in advance we're looking for

00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:38,990
skilled general developers who or you

00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:40,520
know can work in various areas or if you

00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:41,930
have you you probably say stuff like if

00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:44,000
you have specific skills you think are

00:47:41,930 --> 00:47:45,319
interest let us know because you know

00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,999
you might

00:47:45,319 --> 00:47:48,680
be really happy to get a security expert

00:47:46,999 --> 00:47:50,569
to put on your security team and stuff

00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:51,349
like that so yeah that's a really

00:47:50,569 --> 00:47:59,209
interesting question

00:47:51,349 --> 00:48:00,949
Victor oh that's a great question so the

00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:02,749
question was have we found any graceful

00:48:00,949 --> 00:48:04,459
way to get feedback from candidates so

00:48:02,749 --> 00:48:08,299
it's really excited to try this at

00:48:04,459 --> 00:48:10,579
active State so I was like okay I'm

00:48:08,299 --> 00:48:12,619
gonna do this survey of everybody who

00:48:10,579 --> 00:48:14,719
got to submitting the home worker later

00:48:12,619 --> 00:48:16,819
in our inner process but didn't get the

00:48:14,719 --> 00:48:19,430
job the people who we hired I can ask

00:48:16,819 --> 00:48:20,599
them because they work for me of course

00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:22,009
they might be inclined to say nice

00:48:20,599 --> 00:48:23,869
things at this point because they work

00:48:22,009 --> 00:48:25,309
for me but at least I can have a longer

00:48:23,869 --> 00:48:26,599
conversation with them so I'm that great

00:48:25,309 --> 00:48:28,219
I'm gonna send a survey and this is

00:48:26,599 --> 00:48:30,529
gonna be amazing and I made it really

00:48:28,219 --> 00:48:32,239
simple had three questions did you feel

00:48:30,529 --> 00:48:35,059
that the hiring process was respectful

00:48:32,239 --> 00:48:35,390
yes or no and then what could we do

00:48:35,059 --> 00:48:37,309
better

00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:39,289
no it just had two questions okay and

00:48:37,309 --> 00:48:40,699
then the third question was we're gonna

00:48:39,289 --> 00:48:42,170
enter you in a drawing for an Amazon

00:48:40,699 --> 00:48:43,309
gift card do you want it from the US or

00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:46,309
Canada because that's where we were

00:48:43,309 --> 00:48:49,459
interviewing out of like 20 people I

00:48:46,309 --> 00:48:51,440
sent it to I got five responses one of

00:48:49,459 --> 00:48:54,459
the people who said no that the process

00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:58,339
wasn't respectful gave us zero feedback

00:48:54,459 --> 00:48:59,959
the other feedback just was not as

00:48:58,339 --> 00:49:02,599
useful as I would have hoped you know

00:48:59,959 --> 00:49:04,430
one person the people were unhappy were

00:49:02,599 --> 00:49:06,979
unhappy for reasons I wasn't sure I

00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:10,039
could control they were like well you

00:49:06,979 --> 00:49:12,140
know I you you seem to assume one person

00:49:10,039 --> 00:49:14,390
was upset because they felt like we had

00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:15,979
assumed that like doing the homework and

00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:18,199
not live coding made it not stressful

00:49:15,979 --> 00:49:20,359
but I was like I never I don't think I

00:49:18,199 --> 00:49:21,589
said that I wanted to assume it's not

00:49:20,359 --> 00:49:24,709
stressful hopefully a little less

00:49:21,589 --> 00:49:26,749
stressful so I just wasn't sure like

00:49:24,709 --> 00:49:28,160
nobody gave me actual actionable

00:49:26,749 --> 00:49:29,329
feedback well one person said they'd

00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:32,299
like something we did so we'll keep

00:49:29,329 --> 00:49:34,219
doing it like when people asked if we

00:49:32,299 --> 00:49:36,469
rejected them after the homework if they

00:49:34,219 --> 00:49:38,329
asked for feedback I would send them

00:49:36,469 --> 00:49:40,069
feedback kind of a sanitized version of

00:49:38,329 --> 00:49:41,839
our internal review and what president

00:49:40,069 --> 00:49:42,739
said he liked that so I was thinking in

00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:45,349
the future we should make that more

00:49:42,739 --> 00:49:47,239
formal put that in the email about the

00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:48,559
homework that you know if we are in the

00:49:47,239 --> 00:49:50,539
rejection like if you'd like more

00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:52,910
feedback let us know because I'm happy

00:49:50,539 --> 00:49:54,829
to do that so that it is literally I

00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:58,009
feel like the very least we can do we've

00:49:54,829 --> 00:49:58,700
made you do this assignment we can at

00:49:58,009 --> 00:50:00,349
least

00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:04,310
and ten minutes giving you some feedback

00:50:00,349 --> 00:50:05,630
on why we didn't like your cut right so

00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:07,070
I'll keep doing that but didn't get a

00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:08,690
lot of other actionable feedback I was

00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:10,730
disappointed and I got five responses

00:50:08,690 --> 00:50:12,890
out of twenty it's like $50 Amazon

00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:17,119
giftcard surely people fill out a two

00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:19,010
questions survey for this and I made it

00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:20,810
clear that they could use like an

00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:22,490
anonymous email address like mail inator

00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:24,650
or whatever I wasn't trying to correlate

00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:26,000
it with people some people use the email

00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:28,609
address they submitted with that's fine

00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,560
too but I'm happy to send the gift card

00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:33,050
to mail inator but it wasn't that useful

00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:35,030
so I don't know if I'd do it again I

00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:37,490
mean the company was like totally cool

00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:38,960
with me doing it yeah and one of the

00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:40,730
things I like about active State it's

00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:44,119
pretty pretty easy place to just try

00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:45,650
something out but yeah it wasn't it

00:50:44,119 --> 00:50:47,630
wasn't super useful so I don't know if

00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:51,460
we can fight other ways one more comment

00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:51,460
and then I'm gonna stop was it really

00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:58,130
okay so you're saying it's a pre-created

00:50:57,050 --> 00:51:10,220
they asked for feedback on the hiring

00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:11,540
process when you were hired oh that's

00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:13,339
interesting so you were asked for

00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:15,530
feedback during the hiring process

00:51:13,339 --> 00:51:18,170
itself oh that's interesting

00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:20,960
I I interviewed it zip recruiter and I

00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:23,119
don't remember the masking that I said a

00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:25,460
long email unsolicited with feedback

00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:28,359
that I then personally turned into this

00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:30,740
talk again I really want to innovate

00:51:28,359 --> 00:51:34,640
emphasize I really like to zip recruiter

00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:36,020
any any like criticism I had should not

00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,940
be taken as like oh these are bad

00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:40,640
companies that interviewed with just

00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:42,410
that I think it can be done better so I

00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:45,560
do want to emphasize that since we

00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:48,349
mentioned one by name cool place to work

00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:50,240
from everything I've heard yeah that's I

00:51:48,349 --> 00:51:53,569
think that's an interesting idea asking

00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:55,460
for feedback as you go my only concern

00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:59,450
is I don't want people to feel pressured

00:51:55,460 --> 00:52:01,970
to provide good feedback yeah it's

00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:03,800
really tough it's a great great question

00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:05,420
because it's really hard like how can we

00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:07,700
improve this from the candidates

00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:10,220
perspective when the vast majority of

00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:10,880
them don't get hired right even they're

00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:12,980
really good

00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:15,170
if you have ten good candidates in one

00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:21,470
position you still only hire one so it's

00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:24,170
it's a tough problem so clouds Oh glass

00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:25,940
door yeah I've looked at that like

00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:27,440
fractus eight and other companies for a

00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:30,470
small company like active see there's

00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:31,789
very little feedback I'm sure for you

00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:32,960
know bigger companies like zip recruit

00:52:31,789 --> 00:52:34,250
or booking they probably have a decent

00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,920
amount of activity there

00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:40,490
we're like thirty some people so there's

00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:41,779
just not that much activity and you yeah

00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:43,099
I think for small companies Glassdoor

00:52:41,779 --> 00:52:44,839
tends to get the outliers that people

00:52:43,099 --> 00:52:47,150
love it or hate it you just don't get

00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:48,410
enough feedback to get a really good

00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:50,690
sense all right

00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:52,910
I I'm three minutes over I will wrap it

00:52:50,690 --> 00:52:54,610
up thanks again and I hope you improve

00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:57,699
your hiring processes

00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:57,699
