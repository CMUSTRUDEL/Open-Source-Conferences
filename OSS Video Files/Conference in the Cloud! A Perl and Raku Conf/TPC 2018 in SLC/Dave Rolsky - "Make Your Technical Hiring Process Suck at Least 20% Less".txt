Publication date: 2018-06-19
Playlist: TPC 2018 in SLC
Description: 
	As someone who’s both done a lot of hiring and been through many interviews, I can tell you with great certainty that it’s almost uniformly terrible. I have some ideas on how you can make your hiring process less terrible, both for the candidates and for yourself. Some topics I’ll cover are how most processes suck, how to write a good job description, pre-interview screening approaches, how not to be a complete jerk when you interview someone, questions to ask (and questions to not ask), and more.
