	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,830
we are we're at the Perl conference 2018

00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,450
it's very exciting for us to be able to

00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,560
continue to say that for those of you

00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,400
who've been around for a while know that

00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,110
we used to have a different name for

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,759
this conference because there was some

00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,349
confusion for a while but talk about

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,880
confusion people who are not in the Perl

00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:16,890
community did not know what that other

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,600
acronym meant it was just an immediate

00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,810
sort of confusion so we just get to call

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,580
it it is not right this Broadcom so as

00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:26,310
Lena said I'm Jim Brandt I'm the

00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,590
president of the Perl foundation I also

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:31,590
work for best practical solutions we do

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,759
Artie and as Jeff sort of hinted you're

00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,250
gonna see a lot of this but we're hiring

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,890
a lot of employers come to this

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:41,760
conference to find programmers so it's a

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:44,640
popular thing very excited this is the

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,070
19th Perl conference that is freaking

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,210
amazing to me at least how many people

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:54,660
are here the way of people here who are

00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:58,469
19 or younger a few it's 20 yeah but

00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:00,170
it's not officially right so it's 20 how

00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:03,120
many people here are twenty or younger a

00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:06,900
couple hands so the conference is like

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:12,510
older than you guys which makes the rest

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:16,770
of us feel really old but anyway but

00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,750
it's fantastic still going strong so I'm

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:21,509
gonna do more thanks because we really

00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,710
can't thank people enough lanÃºs slide

00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:24,479
was much better because she had the

00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:26,790
names of all of the organizers but I

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,280
want to thank her as well for all the

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,140
work that everyone has has put in it

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,420
really is a year-long effort people were

00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,829
already talking about next year so this

00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,869
really is something that people work on

00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:39,960
for the entire year to make sure that

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:41,579
all this can come together volunteers as

00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,380
we saw we have some already but there

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:46,259
are more needed so you can actually

00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:49,170
become one of these folks and the

00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:51,119
speakers so as you're sitting in your

00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,979
talks your 30-minute talk the 15 minute

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,040
talk whatever the time period of that

00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:59,850
talk is appreciate the fact that the the

00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,149
people who are giving those that's not

00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,759
good

00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:03,630
keep going I'm gonna keep going

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,360
appreciate the fact that they put in

00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,259
hours and hours and hours sometimes like

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,090
they're probably working on the right

00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,670
now into their slides into their

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,780
material into the stuff you guys see

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:14,130
thumbs up from like

00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,490
across the crowd like yes I'm working

00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:18,750
right now on my slides so for those of

00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,520
you who are doing that you're not alone

00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,830
I saw thumbs all over the place so

00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:26,000
anyway so I just a big round of applause

00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,000
for all these folks please

00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,319
that is not keynote I'm not making that

00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:37,080
effect it's not my father

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:40,500
I really try to restrain myself with

00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,510
keynote there's so much you can do I'm

00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,459
not sure if that's even in keynote but

00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:46,970
I'm gonna have to check later they would

00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:48,120
called they would be the scroll effect

00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:51,030
okay

00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,280
another big thank you nothing that we do

00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:55,590
would be possible and when I say things

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,640
that we do I mean both everything that

00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,160
you're seeing in the conference today

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,010
but also the Pro Foundation we are a

00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,569
foundation so we accept donations and

00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,769
then we try to distribute those out into

00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:07,920
the Perot community so really it is

00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:10,200
about the come and go of money so

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,000
without these people none of that would

00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,680
be possible so please huge round of

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,400
applause for all of these sponsors which

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,400
make everything possible

00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,730
and so many of these sponsors are

00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:26,650
repeated like year after year continue

00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:29,080
to support us so it's really fantastic

00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:34,300
and allows us to do everything that we

00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:37,690
do okay so this is the pearl foundation

00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:38,950
yearly update and this is just again and

00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:40,990
again and again this is the question

00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:42,550
that we get I know we could do a poll

00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:44,080
and see how many people here feel like

00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:46,180
they could come up and give a concise

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,740
definition of what is it that the pearl

00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,060
foundation does but anybody actually

00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:51,430
think that they could come up and do

00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:55,360
that yeah no one would volunteer dan dan

00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:57,130
would probably volunteer to do it but do

00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:02,350
you get this woman cutting an onion

00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:04,890
because it's the onion pearl yeah I know

00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,890
I know

00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:10,360
so again question comes up I was able to

00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:13,420
do floss weekly how many people listen

00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:16,840
to floss weekly it is a web slash

00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,890
podcast that Randall does they do it

00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,410
every week he's in there almost every

00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:22,360
week and he was able to have us on Pearl

00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:23,740
foundation so and that was really like

00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,350
probably the first question what does

00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,430
the Pearl Foundation do but so you can

00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,840
go check that out if you want but you

00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:30,160
here live right so you don't want to

00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,740
have to go look that up you should do

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,320
that it later though this is usually

00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,820
what people think all right it just

00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,440
makes sense right pearls in the name of

00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:40,390
the pearl foundation and people like to

00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,070
have somebody to point to so it's like

00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:45,970
you know you guys like run pearl right

00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:49,810
it's like oh yeah no it doesn't quite

00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:51,250
work like that but I understand I

00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:54,520
understand where people sort of get this

00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:56,080
confusion right because you know most of

00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,790
the things that you have out there maybe

00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,110
if you have one of these right there's a

00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,700
few others out there if you have one of

00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:02,290
these it's very straightforward if you

00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,790
have a problem or a question or

00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,960
something you go here right it's very

00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:06,640
straightforward there's not a lot of

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,100
question about this

00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,120
likewise you know you might get some of

00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,800
this there might be people ordering

00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,060
stuff right now I think I heard someone

00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,990
this morning talking about you know

00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,300
they're ordering something from Amazon

00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:18,070
getting it like sent here or even this

00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,750
now right you might have issues here

00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:23,410
there's no question this is the guy

00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:25,420
right I've read he actually he reads

00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:26,770
email from just random people on the

00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,940
internet like I don't even think I read

00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:30,010
my email from random people on the

00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,710
internet but he does and I can tell you

00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:33,330
you don't want to be in the meeting

00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:34,800
you decided to read an email about some

00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:37,380
feature that someone's complaining about

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,180
those are very uncomfortable I've heard

00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,620
luckily I've never been in one of those

00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,450
but again very straightforward right

00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,520
there is somebody in charge at Amazon

00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:48,960
there is no question about who's in

00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:51,240
charge at Amazon but what about Pearl

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,280
you have like a question or a problem or

00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,720
suggestion or a problem or something

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,990
want to complain about there's something

00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,690
you wanna complain about you think who

00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:02,490
do we go to right so it makes sense that

00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:04,500
maybe you might look for this guy right

00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:06,360
you go look for all foundation president

00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,150
there he is right that's the Jeff Bezos

00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:11,610
that's the chief jobs yet no it doesn't

00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,990
work like that I'm not like I can't have

00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,640
a meeting like basil is gonna have a

00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:16,740
meeting and just so you guys I got this

00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:19,200
email and someone's you know grep

00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:21,480
doesn't work right it doesn't work like

00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,850
that so you might think you know what

00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:26,670
I'm gonna go find this guy right if you

00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:29,940
google pearl you might come up right so

00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:32,520
he might be able to help out but as you

00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:34,890
can see maybe he can't actually help out

00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,360
which seems bizarre right if anybody

00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:38,040
could help you it seems like it should

00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,210
be this guy but but I think you know

00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,040
he'll agree and you know what the

00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:43,590
personality isn't quite the same you do

00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:45,270
not have the the Bezos job just kind of

00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:46,380
you know I'm gonna have a meeting and

00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:48,720
heads are gonna roll all kind of thing

00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:51,240
right so you might be out of luck there

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,380
but then there's this guy right so hey

00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,970
you think maybe all right though those

00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:56,010
first two guys are not very helpful but

00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:57,330
how I got this is I probably search you

00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:59,190
know pearl there's this thing called a

00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:01,530
pump King and you know he's in charge of

00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:03,480
pearl he's a guy who can do it but hey

00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:06,720
there you go there's the response I wish

00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:09,150
it's exactly and you know so I think if

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,370
you talked to any of us what you realize

00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:14,409
is that most of what we're really

00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:17,000
dealing with is this alright

00:07:14,409 --> 00:07:19,310
there is no meeting that we're gonna

00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,979
call in the product team for our feature

00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:23,719
X in pearl and say you know what we're

00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:26,030
gonna get this thing fixed this is what

00:07:23,719 --> 00:07:30,469
we live with this is what we do day to

00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:31,729
day as is the cat hurting so just right

00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:33,979
off the bat when you're thinking about a

00:07:31,729 --> 00:07:35,539
pearl foundation not something that we

00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:37,069
have this sort of uh control over it's

00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:38,300
not like the other areas of your life

00:07:37,069 --> 00:07:40,870
where if you have something you're

00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:43,280
concerned about that you can deal with

00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:45,319
occasionally though occasionally the

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,020
stars align and you can get the cats to

00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:49,940
actually line up and they can actually

00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:52,580
do something and they can work together

00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:54,139
it's really exciting when this happens

00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,840
and I'm very happy to be able to go

00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:58,879
through a couple of times where the cats

00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,259
got together this year and we were able

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,900
to get things done because it's not the

00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:04,400
case that we're completely helpless it's

00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:07,069
that you know it just takes a little

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,979
coercion at times so the first one I'd

00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:12,529
like to talk about is pearl calm so we

00:08:09,979 --> 00:08:14,629
use pearl calm tom kristensen who's here

00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:17,090
actually owns the domain but but he's

00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:19,550
let us sort of be steward of it for the

00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:22,069
last few years and it's kind of been you

00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:23,270
know come and go we've had periods of

00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:24,529
time where we've had an editor and then

00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:27,199
there's period times where it kind of

00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:28,909
went dormant for a while it's a very

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,740
popular destination a lot of people if

00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:33,289
he just google that's where you're going

00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,579
to go and I'm very excited that over the

00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:37,190
past year actually starting at the

00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:40,310
conference last year David Ferro who's

00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:41,779
here was we were talking about he was

00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:43,250
doing pearl tricks about the time that

00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:45,500
pearl calm kind of got quiet

00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:47,180
he was started doing pearl tricks it was

00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,940
a similar kind of content right just

00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:52,100
stuff going on in pearl and starting at

00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,180
last year's conference we emailed

00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,070
afterwards we started to get together

00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:57,620
and we were able to work from you know

00:08:55,070 --> 00:09:01,100
roughly June ish last year through to

00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:03,170
around December around Christmas and

00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,550
we're able to pull together and really

00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:06,589
you know David just two tons of work on

00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:08,209
this merged all the content pulled

00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:10,820
everything together put together not

00:09:08,209 --> 00:09:12,320
only pulling back all of the stuff from

00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,760
the archive so everything that's ever

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,589
been on pearl comm is still there

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,820
fantastic stuff David doesn't article

00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:19,130
every once in a while like where he goes

00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:22,010
back and pulls an old article all the

00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:24,199
stuff is is still relevant still really

00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:26,449
good and we're able to put it and put it

00:09:24,199 --> 00:09:27,980
all together and build in a process

00:09:26,449 --> 00:09:29,930
where all of you

00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,580
can contribute right on github if you

00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:32,870
have content so you can write an article

00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,580
there's a whole process that goes

00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:37,160
through it gets built into the site it's

00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:39,230
fantastic so all the cats came together

00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,700
and we got something done and we fixed a

00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:42,140
problem did a lot of people have noticed

00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,940
like oh it's been a while since the the

00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,920
content on procom has been updated now

00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:48,410
there's content like crazy like at least

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,360
every week sometimes more often tons of

00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:52,190
different authors so if you haven't

00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:56,230
contributed yet this is one of the

00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:59,030
things that you can jump on it's as

00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:01,340
things for the Perl foundation go this

00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:02,900
is one of the things that you can jump

00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:05,270
in and it's a fairly low effort and it

00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:07,100
will have a finite done date as in when

00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:08,960
you put the article in you're done so

00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,310
not all things on TP are like that so

00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:13,880
this is a good one to get started with

00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:15,570
so that's fantastic so thanks to David

00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:23,120
for all of his work on that

00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:25,680
[Applause]

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:29,160
that's 20 years 20 years of amazing

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:31,170
articles another one that we're going to

00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:33,810
be able to roll out very soon is the

00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:36,300
Perl Foundation website which also was

00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:38,610
very long in the tooth there was kind of

00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:41,940
an interesting system that we had set up

00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:45,240
a long time ago where we used the social

00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:47,310
text wiki as a way to drive content to

00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,410
the Perl foundation site is really cool

00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:51,000
when we first set it up but then we went

00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,260
through a few generations of people and

00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,090
people didn't really know how to use it

00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:56,400
to push forward and it got so that we

00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:58,320
couldn't really upgrade so things are

00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,730
kind of in a weird state and and that's

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,770
the content on the site got kind of

00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:05,190
stale similar to the the procom story

00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:07,500
I'm very happy to say that very very

00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:09,450
soon maybe this week we'll be able to

00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,590
replace that site with a new version of

00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:13,980
site again we brought over all the

00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:16,020
content much like the the perl comm set

00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:19,650
up how did this happen how do we get

00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:23,070
this pulled off so there was a class the

00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:25,620
CIS 480 class at Niagara University now

00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:28,320
your university is up near Buffalo where

00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:30,030
I live and basically the this class was

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,740
is one of the final class for these

00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:33,360
seniors who are graduating and really it

00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,940
was like a documentation class it was

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,260
all the different project management

00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,670
stuff that you have to do for IT

00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,590
projects and things like that but they

00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:41,880
needed an actual project to do that they

00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:43,170
could then produce all these project

00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,310
management Docs I know it sounds like

00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,870
absolute hell that they went through

00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:47,310
with it this is all documentation but

00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:49,260
anyway then you did an actual project

00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:51,510
they can created a project plan and then

00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:53,490
do the project right so I got in touch

00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,720
with them and I'm like I got a project

00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:56,130
you could do how do you want you know

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,870
maybe you want to convert a website for

00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:59,820
me right and it was perfect because it

00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:01,860
wasn't a huge amount of effort and it

00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,090
wasn't a huge amount of coding but it

00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,290
had enough steps and there was enough

00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,820
stuff that they had to do that they

00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:08,190
could do all the stuff they had to do so

00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:11,070
Danny Allen and all the other folks that

00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:12,510
were in this team in this class went

00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,890
through and throughout the semester

00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:15,780
while they're doing all the stuff they

00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:17,310
had to do for the class they converted

00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:20,010
the website and they moved it all over

00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:22,950
so through all of their work we're gonna

00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:25,260
get a new TPF website and we moved it

00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:26,700
over to platform Weebly which is a

00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:29,910
platform that has an integration with

00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:31,320
what pair networks and we're to move to

00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:33,120
that platform so many other people can

00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,280
get involved and it's just a lot easier

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,380
for people to update the content the

00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:39,780
point is a group of people who really

00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:40,950
weren't even affiliated with purl didn't

00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:42,630
know much about purl they know a lot

00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:43,890
about it now because we were in a slack

00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:46,170
Channel and I made sure to mention purl

00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:48,030
like least once a week so hopefully

00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:49,290
they're all checking it out now but they

00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:50,970
really knew nothing about it ahead of

00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:52,770
time but because of something that

00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:54,990
needed something we needed we're able to

00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:56,790
get something done so the cats kind of

00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:58,350
lined up on this one as well so I'm very

00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:00,450
excited about this this is a big deal

00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:02,130
we've been wanting to do this for a long

00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:03,870
time if you go to actually if you go to

00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:05,820
the TPF website right now you'll see my

00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:08,040
post from 2016 where I said we were

00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:11,280
doing this so this became the new

00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:13,140
Christmas but it's it's this close and

00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:16,290
we're gonna launch it very soon so

00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:19,320
that's very exciting the other thing

00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:21,330
that the cats line up every year is this

00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:25,470
all the different conferences and events

00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:26,730
so in my slides wrong 20th year so it's

00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:28,680
an active group as you mentioned works

00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:30,750
all year there's always more room for

00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,280
people to help though and that's

00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:35,330
probably the leader where you can kind

00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:37,770
of see where I'm going with this is

00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:39,930
first of all TPF isn't in charge of purl

00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:41,670
but we do support all of these different

00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:43,590
things right we support development

00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:45,360
through grants and things like that we

00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:47,820
support the community we support events

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,650
so we can guide things but we're not the

00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:51,750
doers on all this stuff the doing that

00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:54,300
we do is all of the mechanics of keeping

00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:55,770
the Perl Foundation going so dealing

00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,970
with all the donations that come in all

00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:58,200
the donations that go out all the

00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:01,350
different assets we have to keep track

00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:03,240
of all things like that but really all

00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:04,830
the things that actually get done are

00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,540
because of people like you

00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:08,010
so I have a few examples here where some

00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,480
people stopped up over the last year and

00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:11,760
something really significant got done

00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,220
and that's where all of you come in

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,810
there's tons of projects that we have

00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,860
there's things that we want to do

00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:18,690
they're probably things that you've

00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,070
noticed people often come up to us at

00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:22,500
these events and say well you know the

00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:24,810
Perl Foundation websites really old yeah

00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,430
we know we see these things but that's

00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:27,480
how we get people to step forward

00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:29,100
because if it's something that kind of

00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,470
bugs you there's probably something that

00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:33,960
we can do to fix it to improve it to

00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:36,720
make it better the other really great

00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:38,490
part about this is it allows you to do

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,710
something that creates a little bit of

00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:42,600
positive energy right now I think maybe

00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:44,790
a lot of people negative energy

00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,800
the world in general right now I think

00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:48,030
all of us work on open-source partially

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,530
because it makes us feel good we put

00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:51,330
stuff out there make the world a little

00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:53,280
bit better place this is other stuff

00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:55,620
that we can do very similar to that

00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:57,210
where a little bit of volunteerism a

00:14:55,620 --> 00:15:00,120
little bit of help and we make something

00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:02,070
better so it's something to really think

00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,930
about and again everybody here there's

00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:05,340
something that you can do literally

00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:06,990
starting at this conference there's like

00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:08,340
all those slots open you can just

00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:10,470
volunteer that'd be like the first thing

00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:12,060
that you could do is just go in and sit

00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,320
and you don't even have to miss a talk

00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,460
right you can sit in the talk and you

00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,560
just hold up the things and let the

00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:17,310
presenter know like Makoto is doing for

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,290
me right now

00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:21,330
what's your timings are right so you can

00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:23,820
literally start right now you don't have

00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:25,800
to wait and you know starting at a

00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,240
conference it's a gateway drug you'll

00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,830
get in and then you know we'll keep

00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:32,850
bugging you about new stuff that you can

00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:33,590
do so how can you learn more you might

00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:36,060
ask

00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:37,500
so there's a bunch of things going on

00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,700
here at the conference that you can

00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,680
actually learn more about some of the

00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:43,170
things I'm talking about so one we have

00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:46,680
a TPF based off birds of a feather

00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:48,960
session that's tomorrow and there might

00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,700
be food yes there's gonna be food will

00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:53,670
give you lunch if you come we'll give

00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,840
you more food so that's something you

00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:56,040
can go to we're going to talk about a

00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,840
lot of different things you'll see it in

00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,700
the schedule as it's about funding

00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,020
because there's people that Dan would

00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,520
love he is also we have all sorts of

00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:04,200
ideas we just need people to help with

00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,100
these things so if some of this stuff

00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,140
we'll talk about but there's a lot of

00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,520
other projects and things that we would

00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:10,260
like to do and we just need someone to

00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:13,350
come take it and own it and and go

00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:14,610
forward with it grants is a huge thing

00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:17,160
that I have not talked about because

00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:19,320
there is a talk about it tomorrow

00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,460
and that's where we put money back out

00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,900
into the community that's where if you

00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:23,130
have a really cool project you can

00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,180
actually contact us and you can make a

00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:26,550
little bit of money while you're working

00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:28,860
on your open-source project it's not

00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:30,120
gonna like replace your day job but it's

00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:32,100
just something that sort of you know

00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,840
keeps you give you some incentive if you

00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,080
work on stuff so you can go check that

00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,210
out

00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:39,480
and you can get involved with grants on

00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:42,030
both sides you can submit a proposal for

00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,310
a grant or you can be on the grants

00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:46,080
committee and I think they have an open

00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:48,480
member right now right they're looking

00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:50,400
for somebody so there's literally an

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,290
opportunity right now to get involved

00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,700
and what you do on the grants committee

00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:54,870
is basically you work with someone who

00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,860
has submitted a grant and you just try

00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:57,390
to keep him honest you know

00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:59,040
email them like once a week once a month

00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:00,300
hey you need your update how's it going

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,730
stuff like that and sometimes just

00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:05,579
people need a nudge so that's something

00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:07,500
you can do and the Pearl calm stuff

00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:08,730
there's a whole talk about it so this is

00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,130
something that you can go to also

00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:14,429
tomorrow tomorrow's TPF Day stuff where

00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:15,929
you pearl ships shirts so this is all

00:17:14,429 --> 00:17:17,640
about the entire project so I gave you

00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:19,530
like the brief version but David's gonna

00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,959
go through some history some of the

00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:23,490
stuff that we went through it was you

00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,760
know it was pushing the boulder up the

00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:26,400
hill

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,319
it wasn't easy all the time but we did

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,030
finally get it over the line so you can

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:33,210
hear all about that tomorrow

00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:34,650
so I think my time is about up and I

00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:37,730
want everybody to have a great

00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:37,730
conference so thank you

00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:45,380
