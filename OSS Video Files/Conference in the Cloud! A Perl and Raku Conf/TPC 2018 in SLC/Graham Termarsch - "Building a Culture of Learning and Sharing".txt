Title: Graham Termarsch - "Building a Culture of Learning and Sharing"
Publication date: 2018-06-19
Playlist: TPC 2018 in SLC
Description: 
	At ZipRecruiter, we still believe that “you learn something new every day”.

In early 2017, Graham started a casual “brown bag lunch” webinar series at ZipRecruiter, to share some of his experiences and knowledge with the team. Twenty-three talks later, we’ve had a ton of fun, discussed a wide range of topics, and learned a lot (not just about software development, but about how to run a successful discussion series).

Come listen to Graham talk about how it started, what worked, what didn’t work, and how you can start one up in your own organization.

Drewry welcome everyone today I'm here

00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,330
to talk to you about building a culture

00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:11,280
of learning and sharing and my

00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,469
experience in doing that at zip

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,139
recruiter but before I really get into

00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:17,789
that Who am I

00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:19,490
my name is Graham trimmer SHhhh I live

00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:21,449
up on Vancouver Island British Columbia

00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:24,150
although it kind of shares the same name

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:26,310
as Vancouver it's not necessarily close

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,890
to Vancouver I'm a four to five hour

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,429
drive away including a 90 minute ferry

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,380
ride

00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:34,559
so getting to Vancouver and back in a

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:38,760
single day you not going to work you can

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:40,170
find me as Jeter MERS on Sipan and I've

00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,250
been a Perl developer since the mid-90s

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:45,660
I think about 96 97 and I had the

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,210
opportunity to work with active States

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,489
which then got bought out by Sophists

00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:53,039
spent about almost a decade working with

00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:54,750
them on and off but I've been a career

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,969
consultant and career contractor which

00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,559
has meant that much of my career history

00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:01,170
has been spent working on the dark pan

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,390
projects not just code that were not

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,979
allowed to release but unfortunately

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,630
also includes lots of fabulous things

00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:09,210
like companies I'm not even allowed to

00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:11,820
say that I worked for them nevermind

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,470
what project we worked on so I'm really

00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,060
happy to be able to say that I'm here

00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,439
today with zip recruiter and I can

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:20,400
finally talk about the stuff that we're

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:21,659
doing at work but a little bit of a

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,130
disclaimer what I'm going to talk about

00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,320
here these opinions are mine

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:31,979
they're not necessarily the opinions of

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:33,750
the company for our purposes at zip

00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,500
recruiter we've started up what we call

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,680
a Lunch and Learn

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,380
it's a webinar series and originally we

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,439
started it it was really casual

00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:44,610
bi-weekly you'd bring your own lunch and

00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:47,430
when we started we had less than a dozen

00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:49,829
people it was really casual we now

00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:52,409
regularly reach between 30 and 60

00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:54,600
members of our development team composed

00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:58,380
half on-site sitting in a conference

00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:01,350
room half remote being connected when we

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:04,259
reach 50 members of our team that's

00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:06,890
approximately one third to one half of

00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:10,679
the size of our entire development team

00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:12,510
which is pretty astonishing we

00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,660
originally started by weekly this year

00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,030
however we're going to chain

00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,320
we're going weekly because it's been so

00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,880
successful and obviously that

00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,290
effectively doubles the number of talks

00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,020
we can do and doubles the number of

00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:25,480
presenters that we need to have but

00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:27,190
first before I really get into sort of

00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,710
the nitty gritty a bit of a story how

00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:34,990
does it all begin I've actually started

00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:36,490
here at Yap see in 2015 in Salt Lake so

00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:38,950
it's actually really fitting that I do

00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:41,320
this talk here but it didn't really

00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:44,080
start here I think it started over at

00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,970
the bayou we were there I think Matt

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,070
took a whole bunch of people over we had

00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,690
this huge table there's good food good

00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:52,630
company

00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:55,210
drinks probably a little too many drinks

00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:57,760
but that's half the fun and it was Greg

00:02:55,210 --> 00:03:00,070
worst fault and if you've worked with

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,690
Greg or you would understand it's always

00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:04,710
his fault

00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:07,570
we stayed really late in fact past close

00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:09,010
he and I were shooting pool and got

00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:10,420
talking about work and talking about

00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:12,610
what I've done in the past he's like

00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,870
grab you know so much of this stuff you

00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,460
know you really need to teach me how to

00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:18,070
do some of these things I don't know

00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:21,700
this stuff and then I had my lightbulb

00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:24,130
moment I was like wow you know he's

00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:26,620
young he's in his early 20s and no one

00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:28,420
had taught Greg or or all these other

00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,660
devs that were starting to work with us

00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:34,630
how to do thing a bunch of things and

00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:36,370
without that kind of training developers

00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:38,590
they're going to simply repeat the

00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:41,680
mistakes of the past us that have been

00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:43,060
in the industry for 30 40 years we see

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,220
that there's approximately a 10-year

00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:47,080
cycle you know the mistakes come back

00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,459
again and they hit us time and time

00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,140
again we're like wow didn't we talk

00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:51,340
about this before I thought we figured

00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,380
out how to deal with these types of

00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:56,980
issues of testing and memory management

00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:59,739
and code control but they keep coming

00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:02,140
back and that's when I stopped I was

00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:04,959
like you know if us older senior

00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:06,640
developers who got experience and who've

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,040
been in the industry if we're not

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,739
actively mentoring and teaching the

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:15,550
junior devs who come on we are not going

00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:18,010
to break that pattern and it took a

00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:19,680
while though I worked one-on-one with

00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:22,539
devs over the course of the next year

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,260
including Greg or they do pair

00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:24,940
programming

00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,040
I'd have guys just sit and watch over my

00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:28,530
shoulder we

00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,000
you know make time I would have open

00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:31,800
office hours people could just ping me

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,940
at any time I'm happy to sit down with

00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,800
you for an hour and answer your

00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:37,320
questions about anything I can help with

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,820
and while it felt like progress and I

00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,640
was helping get some of the word out

00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:44,640
didn't really feel like substantial

00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:48,030
progress it took a lot of effort and so

00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:49,770
one day I made a commitment twice a year

00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:51,810
at sip recruiter we hold some internal

00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:53,370
Tech Talks usually mid and end of year

00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:56,130
and I was standing up doing a

00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:58,260
presentation on testing why we do it

00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:00,450
what are the values how everyone else

00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:02,340
can get involved and at the end of that

00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:04,680
talk I announced that starting that

00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:08,340
January I would be doing a bi-weekly

00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,600
one-hour webinar and it was like okay

00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,460
now that I've told the whole team I'm

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,250
gonna do this I'm kind of committed

00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:18,030
because if I don't I'm gonna look like a

00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:20,850
fool and so a few weeks later we begin

00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:22,500
and initially it was just me speaking we

00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:24,150
did it during lunch hour so we're not

00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,670
taking away from people's time which

00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:29,190
made it an easier sell at the company we

00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:30,990
do it every other week which provided me

00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:32,700
some time to get material together and I

00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:36,030
would present topics that I knew and

00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:37,110
that I was passionate about and shortly

00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,940
thereafter we started to get some

00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:40,290
feedback and some of it was really good

00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,610
you know we love the passion and the

00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:44,220
excitement that you have when you get up

00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:47,070
and speak the topics are useful they're

00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,660
applicable to what I'm doing but then

00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:50,280
one of the founders showed up and I got

00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,780
some interesting feedback he's like why

00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:57,300
didn't you order lunch for everybody

00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:58,140
I didn't know I had a budget and so we

00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,350
started ordering lunch

00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:02,580
and but as I said it's a lot of work I'm

00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:04,320
doing the one hour presentation every

00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,030
two weeks I'm the only person doing

00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,640
these presentations I have to write the

00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:12,540
slide decks and pretty soon I'm gonna

00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:14,640
start running out of topics so I put out

00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:17,040
a call for speakers I asked for help and

00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,420
thankfully some of my peers responded

00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,130
some people reached out to me with a

00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:23,430
topic in hand if hey I would like to

00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:25,470
come and present whatever and others I

00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:28,650
had to chase down a subject experts I'd

00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:30,690
instead get a request for a talk but I

00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:35,630
still ended up doing a majority of these

00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:35,630
presentations and so things continued on

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:45,319
Wow that's out of work after the first

00:06:41,179 --> 00:06:48,409
year we done 23 webinars six of them had

00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:53,209
guest speakers which meant that I was

00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:55,610
doing way too much talking so I put out

00:06:53,209 --> 00:06:56,319
another call for help at our semi-annual

00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:58,999
Tech Talks

00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,279
that December I put another call for

00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:03,949
speakers but this time I had a track

00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:04,610
record I had a story to tell I had an

00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:08,509
audience

00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:13,009
I had brand awareness and thus far in

00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:15,080
2018 we now have 11 webinars nine of

00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:18,199
them had guest speakers which is what

00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:20,719
he's so much easier for me but it meant

00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:24,559
that my role changed I'm no longer

00:07:20,719 --> 00:07:26,949
presenting I simply facilitate I helped

00:07:24,559 --> 00:07:29,659
make the speakers life easier I

00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:32,209
evangelize so I'm out telling the story

00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:34,189
I'm out encouraging all the rest of our

00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:36,050
people to come and attend even if the

00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:38,689
topic is not about the language you are

00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:40,129
programming and you know come support

00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:43,550
you know if the person who's doing the

00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:47,629
talk and that's why I'm here today

00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:51,409
because through this we learned a whole

00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:53,329
bunch of lessons we learned that keeping

00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:56,509
your schedule consistent was really

00:07:53,329 --> 00:07:59,360
important we use the same conference

00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:02,360
room in the same timeslot on the same

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,789
day of week every two weeks everyone

00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:07,399
gets to understand the rhythm we know

00:08:04,789 --> 00:08:09,349
that it's every second Thursday and as

00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:10,729
we get closer we don't if they've missed

00:08:09,349 --> 00:08:12,349
the announcement that got sent out via

00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:13,490
email they're gonna like what did we

00:08:12,349 --> 00:08:15,349
have for lunch last week

00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:17,389
Oh last week we went out we did this

00:08:15,349 --> 00:08:19,669
stuff we went out with all the guys at

00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:22,159
work oh that must mean that this week is

00:08:19,669 --> 00:08:25,189
a Lunch and Learn so everyone gets into

00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:29,479
the rhythm and gets into the cycle we

00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:29,959
learned ordering food was important free

00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:33,819
food

00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:36,229
draws far more people than a cool topic

00:08:33,819 --> 00:08:38,000
yeah who would have thought I'm a tech

00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:39,409
guy so I'm thinking like oh we've got

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,459
these really cool topics people will

00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:43,729
come and they're interested about

00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:44,880
finding out about the topic no people

00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:47,970
come for the food

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,410
because you get and with an interesting

00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:51,269
topic you get the people who want to

00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:53,430
know about that topic when you have free

00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:55,290
food you get everybody else you get

00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:57,389
people who have no idea what the topics

00:08:55,290 --> 00:09:03,509
about I get free lunch I am in

00:08:57,389 --> 00:09:04,829
I completely agree being remote myself I

00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:08,399
would love to have free food for the

00:09:04,829 --> 00:09:13,079
remotes I also learned that I needed to

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:17,420
enlist help if someone offers help say

00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:19,949
yes and when you need help ask I

00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:22,139
facilitate but thankfully all I'm really

00:09:19,949 --> 00:09:23,880
doing is coordinating I now have a team

00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:27,060
of people that work with me to help make

00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:29,819
sure that we have the room we have food

00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:31,259
the announcement has been sent out we

00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:33,060
have you know a handful of people that

00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:34,529
come and help do the technology and get

00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:40,440
it up on the big screen like we have

00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:42,630
here today and really important we learn

00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:45,050
to spread thanks you know sprinkle that

00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:49,009
stuff everywhere all of our talks and

00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:51,720
saying thank you to everyone who helped

00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:54,600
no matter how small their peace of

00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:59,399
participation everyone who helps ends up

00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:00,899
in a final slide with thanks because

00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,819
that's part of you know how we're going

00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:04,800
to support our speakers and support

00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:07,110
everyone who's coming

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,199
my role change to be one of facilitation

00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:12,420
and so I'm trying to make the speakers

00:10:10,199 --> 00:10:13,889
life easier if the speaker has to show

00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,899
up and arrange the room and arrange the

00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:17,310
food like no nobody wants to come to the

00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:19,860
talk if you're supposed to do all that

00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:21,779
work my job is to make sure that the

00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,699
speaker just needs to show up with his

00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:25,680
slide deck someone will take care of the

00:10:23,699 --> 00:10:27,209
recording someone will take care of the

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,040
food someone will take care of the room

00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:31,920
someone will help them get it set up on

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:35,699
the big screen lowers the barrier for of

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:39,230
entry for your speakers thus you get

00:10:35,699 --> 00:10:39,230
more people that want to come speak

00:10:40,229 --> 00:10:44,499
we learned was also important to connect

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,989
our remote workers Roxy I'm remote

00:10:44,499 --> 00:10:47,499
myself so whatever we chose wasn't going

00:10:46,989 --> 00:10:50,559
to work

00:10:47,499 --> 00:10:52,959
unless I could be connected that also

00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:56,249
helped make it easier for me because I

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:58,239
don't like standing in front of crowds

00:10:56,249 --> 00:11:00,399
but connecting your remote workers

00:10:58,239 --> 00:11:02,470
becomes really important we use slack

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,939
consume ourselves but whether you use

00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:06,999
Google Hangouts or any other type of

00:11:03,939 --> 00:11:08,499
technology becomes really important if

00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:11,289
you have people that are super busy they

00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:12,849
can't attend the talk directly they

00:11:11,289 --> 00:11:14,859
could listen in and tune in from their

00:11:12,849 --> 00:11:18,970
desk obviously you can get all your

00:11:14,859 --> 00:11:22,720
remotes connected also ties to record

00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:25,979
and archive every presentation as we are

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:28,539
here today the video and the slide deck

00:11:25,979 --> 00:11:30,099
and when I asked my presenters to come I

00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:31,479
asked them to provide their slide deck

00:11:30,099 --> 00:11:36,099
in whichever format they're using

00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:37,299
whether it's Google Doc PDF HTML a bunch

00:11:36,099 --> 00:11:40,059
of text files that they're just going to

00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:43,479
page through send me a copy of it as it

00:11:40,059 --> 00:11:44,589
is when you present it not the copy that

00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:47,169
you're going to keep online which you

00:11:44,589 --> 00:11:49,059
will edit later but the copy that you

00:11:47,169 --> 00:11:51,399
presented so that is someone's watching

00:11:49,059 --> 00:11:53,109
the video they can refer to and see the

00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:55,989
slides exactly as they were in the video

00:11:53,109 --> 00:11:59,169
and follow along it maintains history

00:11:55,989 --> 00:12:00,759
and obviously new hires and new people

00:11:59,169 --> 00:12:02,769
that your organization get to have that

00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:04,059
benefit they can look back through all

00:12:02,769 --> 00:12:06,429
of the things that have been talked

00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:08,669
about before and you get that corporate

00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:11,739
history you know what cultural history

00:12:08,669 --> 00:12:13,629
the added benefit when you speak is that

00:12:11,739 --> 00:12:16,329
you also get to go back and refer to

00:12:13,629 --> 00:12:18,399
your previous talks now as we work

00:12:16,329 --> 00:12:20,529
through our first year and we got close

00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,419
to the end I was thrilled when people

00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:24,129
could ask me questions about well how do

00:12:22,419 --> 00:12:26,949
we do this and I'd like to test it like

00:12:24,129 --> 00:12:29,409
this and I was like oh actually we

00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:31,449
covered that in talk number three back

00:12:29,409 --> 00:12:32,979
in March and you'll find a link and we'd

00:12:31,449 --> 00:12:34,539
paste it into the slack channel if

00:12:32,979 --> 00:12:35,979
here's where we had it in the wiki if

00:12:34,539 --> 00:12:38,169
you refer to that there's a whole

00:12:35,979 --> 00:12:43,349
section on exactly answering that

00:12:38,169 --> 00:12:43,349
question which just becomes added value

00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:49,640
venturing off theme don't our talk

00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:52,520
series for lunch and learns is

00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:55,930
predominately a technical talk series so

00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:59,720
we need to keep them technical as with

00:12:55,930 --> 00:13:02,780
being consistent in what time and where

00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,580
your location is having consistency in

00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:07,280
your theme makes it easier to keep your

00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:09,890
audience coming back and we also found I

00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:12,950
also found makes it a far easier sell

00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:14,930
upwards through the company fact the

00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:17,240
only time I encountered any resistance

00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:19,010
whatsoever was the only time that we

00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,890
ventured off theme and did a

00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:23,540
non-technical talk we did get it proved

00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:25,490
but it was the only time I actually had

00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:27,140
to have someone look at read through the

00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:32,720
slide deck and check off that yeah yeah

00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:38,930
we can do that yes it was a really good

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:42,680
talk I agree yeah yeah there weren't any

00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:47,270
computers involved was a talk about beer

00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:50,390
cheese fermentation which although many

00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:55,910
of us would enjoy was not considered a

00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:58,550
strictly technical talk doing enough of

00:13:55,910 --> 00:14:00,260
these presentations you know what I

00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:02,000
found important not just for myself but

00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:04,130
I also remind everyone who comes to

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,510
speak in our series is to avoid

00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:08,150
presenting topics you don't know about

00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:11,450
if you really don't know a lot about it

00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:13,010
why are you talking but if you want to

00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:15,680
come do that kind of talk

00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:18,740
simply reframe it it's not I'm here to

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:21,020
tell you about this subject because now

00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:23,840
you've framed the discussion as you are

00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:26,210
the subject expert instead if you frame

00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,710
it as I wanted to learn more about this

00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:29,660
subject so I went and did some research

00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:33,310
and here's what I learned

00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:37,510
you've now completely reframed the

00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:40,460
expectation that your audience has and

00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:42,110
of course expect the unexpected there

00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:44,330
will always be technical issues there

00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:46,370
will always be glitches the food will

00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:47,990
arrive late the previous meeting will

00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:48,370
run over and you won't get the room on

00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:50,890
time

00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:53,830
someone will do a live demo and we all

00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:57,390
know how well those go so plan time for

00:14:53,830 --> 00:15:00,430
things to go sideways we do a one-hour a

00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:02,110
webinar I tell my speakers to plan for

00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:05,020
between 40 and 45 minutes

00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:07,360
I expect that we're going to start five

00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:09,339
minutes late because that gives us

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,980
opportunity for the previous meeting to

00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:13,839
end for everyone to get settled for food

00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,920
to arrive for everyone to get food so

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,750
they're not standing in line and

00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:20,320
crinkling bags of paper plates and all

00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:22,450
sorts of things and then we can begin we

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,640
have our talk and then at the end we

00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:26,670
actually have some extra minutes for Q&A

00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:29,040
we have time to clean up the room

00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:33,250
because that's going to be important

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:35,380
don't run over time respect people's

00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:37,960
time someone else is going to have that

00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:39,580
conference room booked after you and you

00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,380
very much appreciated it when they

00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:44,950
closed their meeting on time and you

00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:46,990
could begin so respect their time and on

00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:49,450
time and if it looks like you're going

00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:51,850
to run late that's okay just wrap it up

00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:54,730
and reschedule you know stay tuned for

00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:57,220
part two you can come back and have that

00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:59,770
talk again and you can finish it up and

00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:02,500
if you get done early fabulous you can

00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:04,900
celebrate because who here does not like

00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:07,320
getting 15 minutes back in their

00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:09,810
schedule that they haven't planned for

00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:15,279
everyone loves getting free time back

00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:18,100
and it's okay to be nervous we're now

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:21,250
twenty webinars in or I'm twenty

00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:24,550
webinars in I still get nervous every

00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:25,930
time it's like right now which is part

00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:28,240
of why I still do them at home I'm just

00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:31,060
I'm monologue to a black screen I have

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:34,510
no idea who's in the room whether we

00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:35,980
have two people or 22 people I simply

00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:39,040
get a count of how many people we have

00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:42,510
connected to the call and for me that

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,510
made a huge difference

00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:49,029
so when I want to wrap up I have thanks

00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:51,610
I want to give I want to give thanks to

00:16:49,029 --> 00:16:52,839
Gregor for poking me and suggesting that

00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,260
I do these lunch and learns in the first

00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:55,300
place

00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:57,910
everyone at zip recruiter who has

00:16:55,300 --> 00:17:00,100
attended Andrew grand guard who actually

00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:02,860
suggested that I do this talk obviously

00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:04,990
TBC for accepting the talk and I'd like

00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:07,079
to thank all of you here for joining me

00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:35,290
today

00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:37,150
questions okay okay we're actually

00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:40,840
considering doing something similar the

00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:42,700
question is you know finding that if we

00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,559
split between technical and

00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,880
non-technical talks you know do we

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,220
continue to get the type of attendance

00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:50,919
that's actually how we're looking to

00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:52,179
increase from by weekly - weekly this

00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:55,270
year is we're going to stay on a

00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:57,910
two-week schedule but we will for each

00:17:55,270 --> 00:18:00,790
theme so we go weekly so we'll do a

00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:05,230
technical talk a non-technical or a

00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:06,940
business technical business and that we

00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:09,550
are lucky enough we have enough speakers

00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:11,470
we can kind of have that done but we've

00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:13,270
also considered filling in some of the

00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:16,419
empty space in the event we don't have a

00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:22,140
speaker with pre-recorded sessions such

00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:22,140
as past Yap see recordings Amazon Google

00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:33,640
has when she learns frequently often two

00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:33,640
or even three times in one week Wow

00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:40,910
remote is that there's almost never any

00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:43,730
type of facility for me to view let

00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:49,130
alone the present so two questions

00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:51,350
number one what's the best for remotes

00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:56,680
to use for both viewing and presenting

00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:56,680
and two what stops me from getting oh

00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:10,910
okay we'll address your first question

00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:12,050
regarding what software have we found as

00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:15,140
useful

00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:17,150
I found slack is useful for doing a

00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:20,690
webinar which is you know predominantly

00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:23,720
one way so I can present from my

00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:26,930
location to an audience of almost any

00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:28,190
size Google Hangouts also works but

00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:30,890
obviously there are limits to how many

00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:32,240
people you can get connected if you have

00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:34,510
a conference room where you can put it

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,920
up on the big screen that counts as one

00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:38,930
which is helpful but depending on the

00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:41,270
size of how many remotes you have that

00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:44,450
you'd like to connect may or may not be

00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:47,360
a problem now as for your second

00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:49,010
question about creating a good you know

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:54,290
how do you develop a slide deck I'm

00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:56,030
using Google Docs Google Docs there's

00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:57,350
some great templates in there one of the

00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:58,670
nice things is you can create your

00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:01,130
slides and then you can come back and

00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:05,030
just change the theme which is kind of

00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:07,220
nice I would hope that your company

00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:10,990
probably has a theme that they're

00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:14,150
already using obviously I've stolen ours

00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:16,090
if not Google Docs comes with about a

00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:18,470
dozen built in and you can just pick one

00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:20,870
and I think the benefit then is also

00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:21,760
that you can view it anywhere it's

00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:24,230
already online

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,940
and I found that much easier than using

00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:27,680
any sort of desktop presentation

00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:31,690
software

00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:31,690
if I talk about something it's just oh

00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:39,860
yes and you know creating a good slide

00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:42,260
deck can simply be a key word on each

00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:44,930
slide you know it's going to show the

00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:47,180
audience I think this is the topic and

00:20:44,930 --> 00:21:12,650
you can then discuss that and elaborate

00:20:47,180 --> 00:21:15,770
it as you go yes we have had that

00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:18,530
discussion questions we have we had

00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:20,990
discussions about opening up our

00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:23,480
internal history of our recordings and

00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:25,340
history of our slides and that has been

00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,680
discussed not only in the sense of can

00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:31,250
we open up the ones that we have already

00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:34,610
done but also looking forward to see can

00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:37,010
we use our regular scheduled lunch and

00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:38,780
learn not just as an internal event but

00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:40,610
can we actually connect that via Meetup

00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:42,290
and the local pearl mongers group and

00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:45,290
get a larger audience and get more

00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:50,390
people to attend I think it's a fabulous

00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:55,820
idea yes yes we discussed it and we will

00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:58,210
be doing that this year yes one last

00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,210
question

00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:09,590
yes we do we'll use the zoom marbles

00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:09,590
