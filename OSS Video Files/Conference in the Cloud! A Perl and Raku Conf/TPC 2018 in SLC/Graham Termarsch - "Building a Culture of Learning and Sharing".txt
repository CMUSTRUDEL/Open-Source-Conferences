Title: Graham Termarsch - "Building a Culture of Learning and Sharing"
Publication date: 2018-06-19
Playlist: TPC 2018 in SLC
Description: 
	At ZipRecruiter, we still believe that “you learn something new every day”.

In early 2017, Graham started a casual “brown bag lunch” webinar series at ZipRecruiter, to share some of his experiences and knowledge with the team. Twenty-three talks later, we’ve had a ton of fun, discussed a wide range of topics, and learned a lot (not just about software development, but about how to run a successful discussion series).

Come listen to Graham talk about how it started, what worked, what didn’t work, and how you can start one up in your own organization.
