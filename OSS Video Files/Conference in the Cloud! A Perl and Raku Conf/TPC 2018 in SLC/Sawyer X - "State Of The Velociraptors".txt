okay so this is the state of the

00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:11,460
velociraptor hi Chad

00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:14,690
I like your haircut and so just a quick

00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:21,449
introduction for me if you don't know me

00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:22,710
lucky I'm Sawyer and the state of the

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:24,840
velociraptor if you're not familiar with

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,480
it was actually a keynote and the idea

00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,160
was to give a specific talk instead of

00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,970
just about the language to actually talk

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,970
about the community

00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:38,920
the language is the community it's it's

00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:40,570
all of us so there is there used to be a

00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:44,320
state of the velociter given by Matt

00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:49,739
trout MST and he passed it on to me

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:52,329
which was a wise decision for him and

00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:53,649
and then we realized you know what

00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:55,720
there's actually more than one

00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:58,809
philosoraptor in that sense our

00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:01,510
communities built out of several smaller

00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:03,129
communities and it would be nice for all

00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:05,470
of them to get representation so

00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:07,479
nowadays what we try to do is bring

00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:09,330
people from those communities to talk

00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:12,130
about them to give you kind of like a

00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:14,170
better view of all of the smaller

00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:16,960
communities that make up this one big

00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:21,880
community that we're all part of so I

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:24,039
hope this makes sense and I'm basically

00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,569
going to present each person and they

00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:29,050
will talk to you about what they do and

00:01:25,569 --> 00:01:31,060
they're part of the world what I'm

00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:32,789
actually gonna start with is is

00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:35,649
something that I'm involved with

00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:38,770
involved in which is a p5p it's short

00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:42,280
for profile porters and that's the group

00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:45,940
that maintains Perl the language and it

00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:48,539
is a community of its own it's it's a

00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:52,090
bit of an odd community I have to say

00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:54,840
for several reasons so first there

00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:56,950
really isn't any official way to join

00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,289
there's there's a channel there's a

00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,030
mailing list but there's no official way

00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:04,509
like there's no first contribution

00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:07,629
there's no there's no core people who

00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:09,250
accept don't accept other projects I

00:02:07,629 --> 00:02:11,500
worked on there was like a list of the

00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:13,569
core members and after a while of

00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,790
contributions you would get you would

00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:20,319
become part of that but we don't really

00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:23,739
have that so it's kind of you know it's

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:26,920
sort of if you show up it's you and that

00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:29,650
seems to work for us it can get

00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,030
confusing I mean we have a list of core

00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,430
committers it's the people who actually

00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:35,830
commit there's a list of the people who

00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:38,080
contributed patches which is roughly the

00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:41,290
same there's people who have a commit

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,209
bit but there are also people who just

00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:44,069
hang out on the channel or the mailing

00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:46,409
list and they

00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:48,420
just provide comments and critique and

00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:50,280
there are people who are just you know

00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:53,400
they just observe and and you know

00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,139
spectators and it's it's it's kind of

00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,969
confusing sometimes and sometimes it

00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:59,249
could also be frustrating because you

00:02:56,969 --> 00:03:01,019
know it it could feel like peanut

00:02:59,249 --> 00:03:02,099
gallery kind of thing where a lot of

00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:03,599
people are putting out work and there

00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:05,909
are some people there just commenting on

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,290
things and it feels like it's it you

00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:09,719
know it's easy to criticize without

00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:12,060
helping but I think the best sentiment

00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:13,709
for us to maintain is just that even

00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,629
people who just comment they actually

00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:16,650
care about it they care a lot about it

00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:18,389
they're not doing it because they're

00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,799
bored you know they're not sitting at

00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:21,719
home thinking what could I do

00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:24,150
and I'm just gonna go and criticize some

00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:25,889
other people no they actually give you

00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:28,650
know they care a lot about this and it's

00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:31,230
I mean I know I sometimes forget that if

00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:33,659
I had offended anyone for their critique

00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:35,010
and making them feel as if you know you

00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:37,590
don't really care about this you're just

00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,430
bored then I want to apologize because I

00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,730
think it's something that we forget

00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:43,349
sometimes and that that does happen for

00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:46,409
us as well because it's a it's a big

00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:48,239
list and emotions can get heated I don't

00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:50,129
know if any of you have ever worked in

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,810
an open-source community you have an

00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:53,699
experience that you know people are

00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:56,579
passionate and sometimes there's

00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:58,290
friction you know yeah it's a rare thing

00:03:56,579 --> 00:04:02,280
right none of us experience ed there

00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:04,319
this is just me now okay so so yeah the

00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,720
biggest part is our mailing list p5p and

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,459
it includes like all the committers and

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,169
all the commentator and spectators and

00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:13,139
everyone in anyone anyone can join

00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:16,229
everyone can comment it's great but it

00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:17,669
does include moderators and this is the

00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:20,459
big part that I actually want to mention

00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:21,959
because sometimes I'm one of the

00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:23,880
moderators and it was sometimes we screw

00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,820
up when we moderate it's not always

00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,080
smooth I know that for me it's a

00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,940
challenge because oftentimes the

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,650
moderation happens over something that I

00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:33,419
experienced it's someone directed

00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:37,860
towards me and then I cannot moderate

00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:40,380
that and I mean sometimes we do screw up

00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,960
it's not always perfect but we do make

00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,940
an honest job of trying to make it a

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,919
good environment you know because none

00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:49,349
of us get paid to do it and no one wants

00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:51,509
to moderate no one enjoys moderating no

00:04:49,349 --> 00:04:54,479
one's thinking you know what I really

00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:56,190
want to get into a discussion now on how

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:59,600
someone treated someone else on

00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:02,370
this is fun let's do it over 15 emails

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,990
so yeah but and also doesn't work for

00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:06,060
everyone because sometimes when you want

00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,350
to say something you want to say what

00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:09,210
you wanted to say and you want to say

00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,020
the way you intended to and you can't

00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:12,150
always do that

00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:14,610
like you can't always say what you want

00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:16,830
to say you know sometimes often times

00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:18,150
you can't say the way you want it to you

00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,890
can't say this is stupid

00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:21,570
you can't say you're an idiot that

00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:23,700
doesn't work so if that's what you

00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:26,340
wanted to say you can't say that or if

00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:28,140
you want to say I disagree with this you

00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,800
can't say you're stupid that's not the

00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,470
way you say it

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,970
so we oftentimes want to say what we

00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:36,780
want the way we want and that doesn't

00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:39,350
work on a public list so I want to

00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:43,410
demonstrate why this doesn't work and

00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:45,210
I'm going to ask you to raise your hand

00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:47,910
if you feel comfortable you don't have

00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:49,500
to so that my first question is have you

00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,870
ever worked at a job where the boss made

00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:55,070
fun of you and that I know that happened

00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:58,170
to me I have you ever been belittled

00:05:55,070 --> 00:06:01,440
ridiculed were you ever offended on a

00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:05,130
personal or professional level you know

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:08,730
I know I experienced that and I want to

00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:10,760
ask you did that did I hope that did you

00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:13,640
enjoy your job did you do a better job

00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:16,740
were you happy in your life that I

00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:19,610
contribute in any kind of way to to your

00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:22,310
performance was the code documentation

00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:24,750
everything around it was it better

00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:27,210
because someone yelled at you or mocked

00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,600
you know it wasn't right it didn't

00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:30,480
really work

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:33,990
it was never advantageous for you or for

00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:38,460
your work never it never helped it never

00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:39,780
did a single thing to improve and we

00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:42,419
realized that our best work is in a

00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:44,070
supportive helpful environment and this

00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:45,960
is what we want to have in p5p as well

00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:48,000
this is why we have moderators this is

00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:51,990
why we push hard on the way people

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,430
express themselves and you know like I

00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:55,020
said it could conflict with why you want

00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:58,230
to say it could conflict with how you

00:06:55,020 --> 00:07:01,050
want to say it but we intend to continue

00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:03,540
with this because we want to have the

00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:06,180
list as any other community in Perl a

00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:07,950
place where you do your best work where

00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,690
you have a helpful supportive

00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:14,140
environment

00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:17,500
so while we do screw up sometimes I'll

00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:19,780
admit to that I do assure you that we

00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:22,870
will remain relentless in providing a

00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:24,370
this positive supportive environment for

00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:27,460
us and for you if you ever choose to

00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:29,470
participate so if you've heard about p5p

00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:32,950
as a place that has some rough edges

00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:35,950
around it I can assure you that we are

00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:39,460
diligently working on not making that a

00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:44,890
reality for anyone so that's that's what

00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:46,330
I want to say now I want to introduce

00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:50,560
someone else

00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:53,110
DL J David David Adler he's one of the

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:58,210
funniest sweetest and kindest person I

00:07:53,110 --> 00:08:00,010
know in the pro community and he's

00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:01,780
actually one of the quieter people you

00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:04,630
might not have seen him you might not

00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:06,460
have talked to him maybe online probably

00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:09,370
you have seen him online but not in

00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:10,930
person so he's he's fairly quiet but I

00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:13,000
can tell you that every conference that

00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:15,130
I attend that I think that that David

00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,150
attend oh it ends up with I really

00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:20,860
should have spent more time with David

00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:23,170
and I didn't so lucky for us I get to

00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:26,040
present David to come up to the stage

00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:34,230
and say a few words David

00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:34,230
[Applause]

00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:38,599
okay now do I get to go and not only do

00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:43,520
I get to go on early but I get to be

00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:46,670
embarrassed so thank you hi everyone I'm

00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,680
I am here for some reason because I'm

00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:52,310
the leader of the New York pearl mongers

00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:57,050
the first row mongers group and thank

00:08:52,310 --> 00:09:00,380
you and I'd so just a bit of history to

00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:02,950
start just shy of 21 years ago was the

00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:05,480
first ever conference devoted to pearl

00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:08,480
in San Jose California put on by

00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:11,840
O'Reilly and a bunch of us were sitting

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,130
around a table having lunch and suddenly

00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:16,850
we all realized oh we're all from New

00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:18,590
York well that's great and this guy Ryan

00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:21,200
had just moved to New York and he said

00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:23,390
oh we should all get together when we

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,010
get back to New York and so in these

00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:26,930
more innocent days we just handed over

00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:29,320
all our contact information to this guy

00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:32,150
who legally look like John Malkovich and

00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:36,110
so in retrospect there were warning

00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:37,760
signs but when we got back Ryan did get

00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:39,740
us all together and we went to some

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,410
coffee place that no longer exists and

00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:45,350
that was the first meeting of the New

00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:47,830
York pro mongers Brian of course would

00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:50,180
go on to found Pro mongers Inc

00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:53,300
corporation devoted to helping other

00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:54,800
people start user groups and that of

00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:58,790
course became very successful we wound

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,120
up with prolonged respondent in the

00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:02,600
world

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,220
we even had we had Antarctica p.m. at

00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,990
some point some scientist up at

00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:12,710
Antarctica was using Perl and he decided

00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:15,050
I am Antarctica p.m. and but so we

00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:17,870
started we had meetings and it was

00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:20,780
actually explicitly started as a social

00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:24,290
group a little unusual in technical

00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:26,480
communities at that time and we

00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:29,360
basically the idea was get people away

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,700
from their computers and actually see

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,860
other humans in person other programmers

00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:36,170
in our world that we could see in person

00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:38,330
and over the years we have kept up that

00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:41,510
mission we quickly switch from coffee to

00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:43,520
beer leaving us to have a reputation as

00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:44,220
a drinking group with a programming

00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:50,690
problem

00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:53,370
and and we kind of stuck to that mission

00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:55,860
some years in and occasionally we would

00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:57,690
have some some luminary of the pearl of

00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,910
pearl would come into town and we

00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:02,190
scramble to get a talk together because

00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:04,920
we didn't do technical talks that wasn't

00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:06,210
what we did but we managed to have all

00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,220
kinds of people in all kinds of venues

00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:09,420
from mark Jason Dominus at the Oxford

00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,530
University Press

00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:15,120
Damien Conway in the Conway room at the

00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:18,540
Museum of Natural History and we even

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:23,220
hosted we Dovan Rossum once which was

00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:27,240
Vito Vito himself was lovely I have

00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:29,250
stories but anyway eventually a fellow

00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,770
named Jim Keenan who I see in the back

00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:34,140
of the room came to me and said why

00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:37,620
don't you have technical meetings I said

00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:40,140
because that's not what we do and he

00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:44,190
said well why don't you do that because

00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:47,430
that's not what we do and so Jim did the

00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:50,310
smart thing and kind of routed around me

00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:52,920
and started his own technical group Perl

00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:55,920
seminar New York with the wonderful

00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:58,680
portmanteau Perl cemani as our sister

00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,120
group because it's some for some reason

00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:03,120
at that point I was really married to it

00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:06,710
being a social group and so we had

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:09,300
concurrently running technical and and

00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:11,520
social meetings and then eventually

00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:13,890
meetup started being a thing and some

00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:16,200
guy started a New York pearl meetup

00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:18,930
group and we decided this is way too

00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,940
much duplication of effort and we

00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:21,570
consolidated everything under the New

00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,840
York Pro man

00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:28,470
mongers there and so start organizing

00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:30,000
our meetings on meetup started doing

00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:32,580
technical meetings under the New York

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,530
Pro mongor's banner Jim at that point

00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:37,500
had been doing it watch him about ten

00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:39,870
years at that point and so he was a

00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:42,780
little burned out from doing all the

00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:45,600
technical work so we got a five person

00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:46,740
committee together to take turns to do

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,450
technical means and we started having

00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,130
regular technical meetings which was

00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:53,460
kind of strange for a while but we got

00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:57,269
used to it and and we'd had our ups and

00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:59,160
downs of with what we do it

00:12:57,269 --> 00:13:00,630
and when I was asked to get this talk to

00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,339
sort of they're like well tell us about

00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:05,160
the state of things where you think

00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:07,410
you're going and at the moment we've

00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:10,350
we've hit a point where in New York it's

00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:12,660
a little harder to find rooms to get

00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:14,430
from purl talks in because some pearl

00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:18,959
shops have turned in not pearl shops or

00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:20,190
just going away completely and also

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,570
harder to get speakers because we've

00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:23,700
burned through all the people who want

00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:24,779
to give talks and that's of course a

00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,790
problem so at the moment we're not

00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:29,250
having regular technical meetings every

00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:30,600
once in a while we'll have one but so

00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:34,350
we're bad may say mainly back to

00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,610
drinking at the moment and and we have

00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:39,060
in fact if you're gonna be in New York

00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:40,350
on is the 27th gen Wednesday the

00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:43,050
Wednesday following the conference if

00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:45,959
you're in New York come on by look at

00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:47,850
meetup calm for New York row mongers and

00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:51,470
we are having a meeting you're all

00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:53,970
welcome to join us please everyone come

00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:56,100
we are we we often have emergency

00:13:53,970 --> 00:14:01,410
meetings if people are coming to town we

00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:05,070
and so I think it's been a circuitous

00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:06,720
Road we the social meetings are not not

00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:09,690
really going to go away those are gonna

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,149
keep happening and and we'll probably

00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:13,440
have technical meetings again when we've

00:14:12,149 --> 00:14:16,890
built up some more people who want to

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,720
give talks and more companies decide oh

00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:22,459
right this Perl thing actually works so

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,510
we should use that and support Perl and

00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:28,380
that's kind of where we stand at this

00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:31,199
point and I am very just very proud to

00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:34,380
be part of the beginning of of the pro

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:37,589
mongers organization as it were it's not

00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:39,120
that organized I suppose but I hope many

00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:42,390
of you are members of pro mongers

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,339
organizations and if you aren't and

00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:46,320
there isn't one where you are you'll

00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:48,630
start one that's that's how these all

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,320
started people just said oh let's get

00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:55,740
together and do things and different

00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:57,209
groups have different different ways of

00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,250
doing things some people insist on

00:14:57,209 --> 00:15:03,660
technical meetings again we always found

00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:05,399
that strange but it's basically there's

00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:09,060
more than one way to do it as we all

00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:10,089
know so anyway that's where we stand

00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:12,759
today and there will be

00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:14,470
other prohm longer leaders up here

00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:17,319
talking later about what they're doing

00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:20,330
and anyway I hope you have a wonderful

00:15:17,319 --> 00:15:23,779
conference and thank you for your time

00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:23,779
[Applause]

00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:32,559
thank you David one of my fondest

00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:35,670
memories of women - we had a dance for

00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:39,459
conference and it was in New York and

00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:41,170
the New York p.m. group heard that reba

00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:42,610
sushi and myself are in town I can

00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:46,180
already see Reba sushi kind of hide

00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:48,339
behind his hand because he remembers it

00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:51,009
so we actually went down there to to

00:15:48,339 --> 00:15:53,470
have a meeting and I think was in at

00:15:51,009 --> 00:15:56,920
Shutterstock headquarters was it yeah

00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:58,779
and it did not go as planned

00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,209
because they basically said well how

00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:04,209
about you to sit down and we'll just

00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:09,149
talk about stuff and Reba sushi and I

00:16:04,209 --> 00:16:11,410
will not shut up and we had a blast but

00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:14,529
we were told to shut up numerous times

00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:15,879
because we wouldn't say yeah I Love New

00:16:14,529 --> 00:16:20,949
York all right

00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:23,110
so so yeah there's there is another

00:16:20,949 --> 00:16:23,949
David who's actually coming in now thank

00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:26,079
you

00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:27,429
and the first actually when I think of

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,529
David the first thing comes to mind is

00:16:27,429 --> 00:16:32,199
that I ought to use this word a lot but

00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:33,240
David this David also that one but this

00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:35,860
one especially

00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:38,769
he's very industrious and hard-working

00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:41,230
David has been I mean he's he's working

00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:43,809
on encode a lot he completed TPF grant

00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:45,490
just so a while ago amongst other things

00:16:43,809 --> 00:16:47,620
but he's also working hard in the

00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:50,319
community organizing multiple

00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:51,999
conferences and kind of gaining his hand

00:16:50,319 --> 00:16:53,920
in a lot of other stuff helping a lot

00:16:51,999 --> 00:16:55,870
luckily he's going to talk to us about

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,089
Salt Lake City p.m. what I'm wondering

00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:01,059
is are you gonna have an offshoot of

00:16:58,089 --> 00:17:04,659
this of a Salt Lake City Punk p.m. Salt

00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:07,179
Lake City Punk p.m. no okay all right so

00:17:04,659 --> 00:17:09,500
please welcome David Oswald talk to us

00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:14,440
about Salt Lake City p.m.

[Applause]

00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:20,420
welcome everybody

00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:22,790
so Salt Lake City pearl mongers must

00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:25,870
have started up about fifteen years ago

00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:30,350
but I moved here from Los Angeles in

00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:32,960
2013 yeah and had been an active member

00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:34,370
of the LA Pro mongers and also Thousand

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,590
Oaks pearl mongers when I was living

00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:39,500
down there and when I got here there was

00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:42,290
not a functioning Pro mongers group and

00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:44,000
I not knowing that there had been one at

00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:46,910
one point I went and went ahead and

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,860
started one up and met some some

00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:50,510
wonderful people through that Doren in

00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:54,260
the back who does our video and Jason

00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:58,430
Novak I met through pearl mongers and a

00:17:54,260 --> 00:18:00,260
number of other people the to me the

00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:02,450
most important thing about the pearl

00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:04,220
mongers types of organizations are the

00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:06,110
the way that they are able to kind of

00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:09,590
build a local community and a local

00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:12,290
initiative for for Pearl that the

00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:14,690
benefits not just the not just pearl as

00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:18,650
a language but also benefits every

00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:20,900
member of the of the organization

00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:22,760
we've had people including myself and I

00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,500
see another person here that that have

00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,120
found jobs through people through

00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,620
connections they made at Pearl mongers

00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:30,020
and I'm sure that there are many people

00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:31,220
in this audience who have been in that

00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:33,260
same situation

00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:35,600
their employers thus that who have been

00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:36,890
connected with good employees through

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,140
Pearl mongers employees who are

00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:41,360
passionate about what they about their

00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:45,380
craft essentially and so I want to

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:47,180
encourage other groups out there to find

00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:48,440
ways to be active or if you happen to

00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:50,480
move to an area where there's not an

00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:53,930
active pearl mongers group it doesn't

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:58,460
take much to form one start one up go on

00:18:53,930 --> 00:19:01,670
go on the drawn are see and talk to the

00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:04,970
PM channel they can help you get started

00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:06,410
start up a group and find a couple of

00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:08,090
other interested people who are willing

00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:11,420
to help out and willing to participate

00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:13,910
and present and just do it and look what

00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:16,190
will happen it really is a wonderful

00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:19,240
thing so thank you everybody and I'm

00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:19,240
glad that you're here in Salt Lake

00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:29,280
thanks David

00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:33,250
hmm all right I think I'm doing better

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:35,140
mm-hmm a quick shout-out to Stephen

00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:37,540
thank you he's been like a dad to me

00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:39,090
taking care of my making sure that I'm

00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:43,930
alive

00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:46,060
so um yeah we have a few people a few

00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:48,180
additional people so I don't know if you

00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:53,650
can see this well can anyone recognize

00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:57,100
cuz he doesn't look that way now so mmm

00:19:53,650 --> 00:20:00,730
Chad so when Chad doesn't go toe to toe

00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:03,190
with Conway which he did he likes to

00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:06,520
work on the test to testing framework

00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:08,260
and I also think that correct me if I'm

00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:11,440
wrong but you think you'll hold the

00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:15,670
title the record for the quickest bug to

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,950
fix to release of reporting a bug and

00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:23,350
have any fixed and released right away

00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:26,640
so we'll see if anyone during Chad's

00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:28,390
talk finds a bug in test two we could

00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,600
see how that plays out

00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:33,880
all right so please welcome Chad Renan

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,460
Exodus to talk to us about the new

00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:41,769
testing platform framework for Perl

00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:41,769
[Applause]

00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:47,800
hey so I was asked to talk about the

00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:49,210
Perl toolchain community and I realized

00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,920
a lot of people here probably don't even

00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:53,410
know what that is so I'm gonna go

00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:55,690
through the five W's with that so first

00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:57,520
of all who the Perl toolchain group

00:20:55,690 --> 00:21:00,400
specifically for the Perl toolchains

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:03,970
summit that I'm talking about is made up

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:06,360
of five to ten core developers of not

00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:08,500
Perl core but course you Sipan

00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:11,200
developers who work on things where if

00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:13,720
they break everything breaks things like

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,240
what I work on test builder things like

00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,950
dis Zilla module build really the things

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,470
that would cause major headaches for

00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:22,420
everyone on Sipan if they failed and so

00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:24,430
initially that core group is picked once

00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:25,750
again five to ten people and then they

00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:27,790
pick who else gets to come to this

00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:29,940
summit usually up to about 30 people

00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:35,670
Sawyer is usually there

00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:38,100
and so that's the who the what is we

00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:42,450
work on things to make the toolchain

00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:44,580
better and things like a lot of bugs

00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:47,820
that are in Sipan were recently fixed or

00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:50,610
medicean pause all these things have

00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:54,900
been revitalized and had bugs fixed at

00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:57,150
the summit so then where the summit is

00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:59,670
always somewhere in Europe that's been

00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:01,650
in Berlin it's been in the UK most

00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:07,410
recently it was in Norway that was a lot

00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:09,270
of fun it's the next w-why once again

00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:11,330
because we want to fix these things and

00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:15,330
make Sipan a better place for everybody

00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:17,430
and why do we all get together because

00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:19,890
it makes it a lot easier to solve a lot

00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:21,660
of these problems like if I have a

00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:23,280
question about plaque I can just walk

00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:26,040
across the room and talk to me a gala

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:28,410
which I did at the last summit and

00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:30,240
everyone in this community can do this

00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:32,610
and so when we're all together in one

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,950
room we can really tackle problems that

00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:37,650
otherwise might take a week as emails go

00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:40,890
back and forth if they're even seen so

00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:42,960
it is a very productive week and a lot

00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:45,870
of great people there who really achieve

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,670
a lot of great things that's the pearl

00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:50,060
toolchain summit group and the community

00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:50,060
are ended

00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:54,140
[Applause]

00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:03,360
thank you

00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:06,590
so I'd like to shame Mickey for not

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,590
giving the next talk

00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:16,650
shaming as a service of Dave thank you

00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:22,370
just take div with me the places and

00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:24,780
pointed people delegate yeah so so yeah

00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:26,760
so the next one is on medicean

00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:28,470
and last year it was a máquina

00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,340
acessories work who works on medicine

00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:32,010
and there were a bunch of people working

00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:34,170
- a pan and we'll make it was busy this

00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:37,530
year with his talk this time we get to

00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:38,760
hear Nicola and I I got to say a few

00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:42,230
words about him

00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:44,880
sorry so first he speaks really fast

00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:47,130
okay and he has a very thick French

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,730
accent which you might notice try to

00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:52,800
pick it up when he talks but the thing

00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:56,520
is that as fast as he talks that's

00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:58,440
that's how fast he works I remember when

00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,360
he so one of things that Nicola was

00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:03,960
working on it was the new crap medicine

00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:07,290
pan and it went from I have an idea - I

00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:09,240
finished check it out I didn't get I

00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:11,940
wasn't able to get coffee like it was it

00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:13,770
was too too fast and he also helped

00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:16,440
organize a lot of stuff I got to work

00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:18,270
with him on the court hackathons that we

00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,790
did which was really nice he also

00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:23,130
organized this with Todd so it's really

00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:24,720
really great to work with Nicola and

00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:27,210
everything he does and he's gonna talk

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,230
to us about meta Sipan which is only

00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:32,420
some of what he does

00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:36,809
so please welcome Nicole on atomic

00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:36,809
[Applause]

00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:43,140
I'm not gonna even try to pronounce your

00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:44,670
last name yeah neither its French she

00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:48,630
would not be able to so I will try to

00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:50,160
speak slower much slower than usual so

00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:53,250
you're probably all heard about Mehta

00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:55,590
Japan or use it but do you know the

00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:58,200
story behind like many good project it

00:24:55,590 --> 00:25:03,990
started or one or few drinks somewhere

00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:06,870
at the end of 2010 they were working a

00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:08,850
web app on there they quickly realized

00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:12,120
that they need one API to finish that

00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:15,150
web app and for that purpose and then

00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:17,790
they came with the idea of building the

00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:22,410
meta Japan which had been what many one

00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:24,930
API some parent longer which mean like

00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:27,450
the community gives some few bugs to

00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:30,990
provide the Austin environment for that

00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:33,960
first project after a few weeks on many

00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:37,860
weekend more than week the project was

00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:40,140
alive on meta steep and started but the

00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:42,930
experience and meta Japan will not be

00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:45,870
what it is today without a grant bar

00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:47,700
contribution on it and solo on behalf of

00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:50,430
all the meta Japan community

00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:53,550
I want to thank Graham bar for every

00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:54,840
contribution he made on how awesome the

00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:58,260
project became today

00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:01,680
so one thing you are probably aware or

00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:04,380
not is since next Monday the surfs

00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:07,320
cPanel Prague traffic is going to be

00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:09,560
resurrected to meta Japan so which mean

00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:12,780
the project is now mature enough and

00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:15,810
under there was the search engine

00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:18,000
optimization also that that was making

00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:21,510
cos if I'm not Prague also great but we

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,030
use it when I start developing on Perl

00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:25,830
metasoma does not exist on such a steep

00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:27,840
and not ogress from either place to go

00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:29,790
and that's what makes tail great for me

00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:34,020
pair will not be what it is without

00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:35,520
cpanel all these modules so meta sipping

00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:38,550
now if you have a look at their github

00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:41,850
page you will see it's about 50 and

00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:44,430
different project all working together

00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:47,170
there's a core group about 10 developers

00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:49,300
more contributors of course but the

00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:51,340
then the rebirth are working pretty hard

00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:53,710
together to make these things happen and

00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:55,690
it's pretty easy very smooth to set a

00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:58,300
development environment on your son box

00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:59,800
to submit any pull request and that's a

00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:02,440
very nice guide about it you have a

00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:05,920
grantee major you can contribute only

00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:07,990
try to do it so meta steep and as I

00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:09,910
mentioned it's one API on Nora right now

00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:14,560
it's consumed by many order services

00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:17,050
Japan minis CPM and many other data part

00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:18,760
of the community

00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:20,680
I'm not going to mention all of them you

00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:26,830
can get there but that's that's a big

00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:29,080
family so meta AK is a Catan event

00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:33,640
organized around the meta supplant

00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:36,280
project last year in 2017 was the second

00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:39,820
event of their meta hack that happened

00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:42,190
in Chicago with the rock core developers

00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:45,190
from all around the world Europe us many

00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:48,220
and that event could not happen without

00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:50,890
the sponsors that make this possible

00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:54,760
under I also need to mention several

00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:56,440
zones while which osted which gave some

00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,890
space in their office to make this event

00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:02,590
happen

00:27:56,890 --> 00:28:04,870
I probably miss one or two day reporter

00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:07,060
so I was able to join and not a curl

00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:09,600
made a skip and a rocker but I joined

00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:14,140
them to work on that grab meta Sipan

00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:19,420
which is kind of working progress it's

00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:22,620
well it's well anyway so I think that's

00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:22,620
all I have on meta Sipan

00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,559
[Applause]

00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:37,810
that everyone spot the French accent

00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:39,850
just checking know right barely I don't

00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:41,680
know I also I was making a joke about

00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:48,760
the last name but I don't know if you

00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:55,660
noticed that Nicola just put our okay so

00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:58,660
okay so we'll Caleta coke is the current

00:28:55,660 --> 00:29:02,170
TPF grant committee head he tends to be

00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:04,210
one of the more hidden voices in the pro

00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:08,110
community I'm actually very happy he's

00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:11,650
here I never met well in person I'm

00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:14,050
excited and I'm happy I'm happy he's

00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:16,030
also speaking this year and I want to

00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:20,080
invite him to the stage to talk about

00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:37,770
the TPF grants so please welcome will

00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:39,640
Caleta koch pick me out of the crowd no

00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:41,110
and I think it's funny that you were

00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:43,660
talking about the unpronounceable last

00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:50,650
name and you got mine wrong so close

00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:54,100
it's it's cahuita long II I can do this

00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:56,380
there we go alright so there were a

00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:59,800
couple of things that I wanted to talk

00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:01,240
about today I wasn't sure what the focus

00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,400
of this talk was going to be and I'm

00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:05,650
really glad that you started out by

00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,820
talking about community because there's

00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:11,020
a couple of different communities I

00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:14,590
think that are involved here let's talk

00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:17,560
about the sort of work we do Jim touched

00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:19,210
on this earlier all the donations you

00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:21,730
see the all the companies here all that

00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:24,490
money that comes in two of the things

00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:27,720
that that gets put back out into the

00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:30,970
community through our grants and funds

00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:32,200
there is a there's a difference there

00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:34,360
the funds tend to be for more

00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:37,480
long-running projects for example the

00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:40,570
Perl 5 core maintenance fund Tony Cook

00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:42,580
has been doing some stellar work there

00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:44,830
for the funds this might be work that as

00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:45,970
a community as a bunch of volunteers

00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:47,860
there's there's some work that isn't

00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:51,070
really very exciting that needs to get

00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:54,460
done and part of that fund gives us a

00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:57,580
way to make sure that that gets done the

00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:59,559
grants are more short-term we are

00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:01,510
accepting grant proposals all the time

00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:04,090
every two months or so the committee

00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:05,620
goes through them reviews them tries to

00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:08,559
figure out which of those grants are

00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:12,850
going to have the biggest impact the

00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:15,100
best dollar to benefit ratio what's

00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:19,600
going to impact the community and

00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:21,190
speaking of communities so there's we

00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,900
take we take proposals for everything

00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:26,049
for a long time it was it was considered

00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:28,030
Perl five only but the past years

00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:29,230
there's been a lot of Perl six grants

00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:30,940
and actually if you look at the recent

00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:33,309
number of grants I think the the Perl

00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:35,020
six grants have started to outweigh the

00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:36,100
Perl five grants so if you have

00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:38,200
something that you've been working on

00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:39,400
you think that if you think it's going

00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,150
to be a big impact to the community if

00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,070
it's something that you need a little

00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:44,289
funding to help you carve out some time

00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:49,260
like Jim was talking about before please

00:31:44,289 --> 00:31:51,580
consider submitting a grant there is a

00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:52,750
we there were some talk about websites

00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,860
here one of the ones unfortunately which

00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:56,409
I did not hear was getting an upgrade

00:31:53,860 --> 00:32:02,500
was the news site news Pro foundation

00:31:56,409 --> 00:32:04,809
org all of you older members of the

00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:07,630
community will know what an RSS feed is

00:32:04,809 --> 00:32:09,850
so you can subscribe to that and look at

00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:12,789
all of the proposals that are coming in

00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:14,940
every two months we post those proposals

00:32:12,789 --> 00:32:17,110
there's a chance for community feedback

00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:19,150
if there's something that you really are

00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:20,260
excited about comment on the proposal

00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:21,360
and let us know that really helps the

00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:24,070
people on the committee to figure out

00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:27,789
what sort of impact these grants are

00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:30,010
gonna have if you're interested in

00:32:27,789 --> 00:32:31,870
donating there's links on the main site

00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:35,530
hopefully all those links will still

00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:37,990
work on the new site and you can target

00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:39,640
your donations if you're interested like

00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:42,100
if you really want your money to go to

00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:43,240
the pro five core fund absolutely if

00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:46,929
you're more interestin pro six there's a

00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:50,140
fund for that if if you're okay with it

00:32:46,929 --> 00:32:51,990
going into the general pool that money

00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:53,580
some of that money gets allocated every

00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:55,710
in the budget for grants and we are

00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:59,280
happy to allocate that back out to the

00:32:55,710 --> 00:33:01,740
teams to the individuals and I think one

00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:03,990
one big thing I don't hopefully your

00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:06,270
employers will match your donations if

00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:08,360
you make a personal donation make sure

00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:11,190
you get set up in your in your company's

00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:14,790
system make sure you get us set up so

00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:26,240
that they will match that donation all

00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:31,940
right all right

00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:36,030
only a few more people all right so uh

00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:37,400
Chris Doug so yeah a few years ago Doug

00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:41,040
was bored

00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:44,730
he decided that well so Barbie was

00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:47,070
working on the CP n testers and Barbie

00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:49,920
decided like am i I'm done

00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:51,750
I'm good I'm gonna step down and I think

00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:54,300
Doug had some spare time he said see pen

00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:55,890
testers I can handle that I got I got

00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:59,580
like a good weekend every once in a

00:33:55,890 --> 00:34:03,960
while and it was one of the actually one

00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:07,490
of the more critical times so if you've

00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:11,850
ever met Doug he's also in Chicago p.m.

00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:16,020
and he's also in the Pearl toolchain

00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:18,180
summit group as well and basically helps

00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:20,370
with anything that you need somehow

00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:24,390
because he Gabriel gets roped into due

00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:25,320
to his a charm and politeness so this

00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:27,690
time is actually going to talk about

00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:30,450
check out p.m. so I want to introduce

00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:33,060
and welcome in a Doug Bell pre action

00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:35,570
you might know him from online he's

00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,570
welcomed him

00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:43,310
what did I ever do that

00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:55,080
hello actually prepared some slides so

00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:58,140
that I could oh hey look at that and

00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:59,490
then go to the full screen because I'm a

00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:02,400
programmer therefore I don't know how to

00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:04,260
use computers Hey

00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:07,350
so I guess to be the odd person out I

00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:10,770
prepared some slides I'm going to talk

00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:12,690
about the Chicago pro mongers we are one

00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:16,530
of one of the older groups I've been

00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:18,750
organizing it since about 2012 ish since

00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:22,650
the world stubbornly refuses not to be

00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:24,830
destroyed we're presently sponsored by a

00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:28,560
server central which means we get a nice

00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:32,460
office in downtown Chicago to hold all

00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:35,720
of our meetings at we have for the last

00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:38,040
six years been able to do monthly talks

00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:40,110
so that's a monthly technical

00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:44,070
presentation it's depended by a few

00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:46,080
people and my my guideline for this has

00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:49,920
been at least tangentially related to

00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:55,290
Perl which effectively turns into it has

00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:56,670
something to do with computers so some

00:35:55,290 --> 00:36:00,390
of our for example some of our recent

00:35:56,670 --> 00:36:02,730
talks have included I didn't talk on T

00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:06,030
MUX techniques how to how to maximize

00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:08,520
your use of T MUX we had a talk last

00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:10,650
month about how ICP works and some of

00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:14,790
their some of the problems that TCP

00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:19,170
solves there was talk about smoking

00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:21,500
Sipan modules as the maintainer of C pen

00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:25,020
testers I found that very interesting

00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:29,160
and I gave a talk about a CMS for

00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:30,870
mojolicious but a dish in addition to

00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,090
our technical talks every month we also

00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:36,420
get together and do kind of an office

00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:38,430
hours kind of thing where just generally

00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:40,830
we get a bunch of people together and

00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:43,260
some people bring questions and other

00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:46,410
people bring answers and we we connect

00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:47,190
those people nobody has yet taken me up

00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:49,470
on my offer

00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:54,079
to actually teach them pearl from

00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:56,700
scratch so hopefully someday they will

00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:58,790
this is actually kind of morphed into

00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:01,170
sort of an office hours project nights

00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:03,450
where a couple of the Chicago pearl

00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:05,240
mongers we all get together and we do

00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:07,710
where we work on a project together

00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:08,700
seeing as I'm the maintainer of Sipan

00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:12,089
testers

00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:15,839
what this ended up being is a tester web

00:37:12,089 --> 00:37:18,150
application which Raymond or Ellie and

00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:19,980
Bill Lindley are very close to releasing

00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:22,740
this so I don't want to steal their

00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:24,810
thunder by getting too much into detail

00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:26,190
but I'm really excited I've been

00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:27,930
mentoring them for a couple years now

00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:32,520
and hopefully they'll be able to release

00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:35,150
this relatively soon so that's what

00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:54,420
we've been doing in Chicago for huggers

00:37:35,150 --> 00:38:00,030
thank you all right okay so so yeah LA

00:37:54,420 --> 00:38:02,339
p.m. it's a really nice group so Andrew

00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:04,859
who's about to talk to us about LA p.m.

00:38:02,339 --> 00:38:08,119
is actually one of the he's by far one

00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:10,260
of the most energetic people I know I

00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:12,540
can tell you that the first time I met

00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:17,130
Andrew is three years ago it was right

00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:19,230
here and he led a wave across everyone

00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:21,510
just running to get everyone to do the

00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:24,990
wave and I was saying who the hell is

00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:27,450
this magnificent person so that was him

00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:30,480
he's also the reason behind my outfit

00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:32,700
last year that was also spaz he was

00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,760
thinking this looks cool would you wear

00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:37,050
it I thought he was kidding I won't make

00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,780
that joke I won't make that mistake

00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:42,690
again

00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:44,190
so Andrew I'm also not going to I also I

00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:47,609
already screwed up one last name so

00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:50,010
you're gonna have to say spaz please

00:38:47,609 --> 00:38:52,430
come and talk about LA p.m. and invite

00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:52,430
everyone over

00:38:53,110 --> 00:39:00,550
[Applause]

00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:11,700
all right I've no idea if my slides made

00:39:08,819 --> 00:39:14,789
it I assume they didn't oh my goodness

00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:17,839
they kind of made it all right because I

00:39:14,789 --> 00:39:19,979
forgot the JavaScript all right

00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:22,349
but they were mostly notes for me anyway

00:39:19,979 --> 00:39:24,089
so it works out so hello everybody who's

00:39:22,349 --> 00:39:28,999
was awake who's doing this

00:39:24,089 --> 00:39:32,099
all right who it's all an act by the way

00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:35,819
I'm actually have crushing social

00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:38,789
anxiety and but I do this as service for

00:39:35,819 --> 00:39:41,819
you guys which is sort of the message

00:39:38,789 --> 00:39:44,509
behind LA p.m. is you can do this I can

00:39:41,819 --> 00:39:48,180
do this you can do this

00:39:44,509 --> 00:39:49,709
yeah the whole thing grew up with this

00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:51,599
is this how I give to the community and

00:39:49,709 --> 00:39:53,640
we all have to find our ways because the

00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:58,979
community without us doing stuff is

00:39:53,640 --> 00:40:00,569
nothing so Los Angeles peril listening

00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:03,900
to those presentations I realized all

00:40:00,569 --> 00:40:08,160
the memos we did not get so we started

00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:11,069
as a technical monthly two presentations

00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,979
per ridiculousness

00:40:11,069 --> 00:40:17,549
I was like I'm gonna start like that

00:40:12,979 --> 00:40:19,979
until you know we we run out of tops and

00:40:17,549 --> 00:40:23,249
it took a few years to run out of talks

00:40:19,979 --> 00:40:24,809
I was in New York with the New York

00:40:23,249 --> 00:40:28,829
whoremongers and was too intimidated to

00:40:24,809 --> 00:40:31,650
go never ever went and I went when I

00:40:28,829 --> 00:40:33,869
moved out to California the value click

00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:36,779
was hosting Thousand Oaks and I made it

00:40:33,869 --> 00:40:39,569
a couple times and Aaron did a great job

00:40:36,779 --> 00:40:43,589
running that and when I switched jobs

00:40:39,569 --> 00:40:46,019
and down to the river grant project I

00:40:43,589 --> 00:40:50,849
asked him so you know how hard is this

00:40:46,019 --> 00:40:52,799
this gig and he's like totally good the

00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:55,319
the biggest problem is you know you have

00:40:52,799 --> 00:40:58,709
to be prepared to present when nobody

00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:59,789
else shows up I was like how much which

00:40:58,709 --> 00:41:03,680
would that be and it would be good

00:40:59,789 --> 00:41:07,920
practice for me so I restarted the LA

00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:11,039
pro mongers nine years ago yesterday

00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:13,619
so which was a long run I tried about

00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:15,660
two years ago to try and I did a little

00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:19,500
experiment to see if I stopped doing it

00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:20,760
if someone else would step up I think I

00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:24,690
need to be more explicit on that because

00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:30,269
that did not work did not work at all we

00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:32,250
are still going we are LA p.m. gorg and

00:41:30,269 --> 00:41:35,190
we were one of the last users of WebDAV

00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:37,470
to push to the posted p.m. if you go you

00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:40,140
can see our snapshot of our website from

00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:42,480
a year ago and we're now on Meetup as of

00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:44,940
this last fall's last spring so that's

00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:49,410
been kind of exciting we got a new

00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:52,559
person so very nice so yeah we started

00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:57,029
this in 2009 since then we've had 62

00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:59,849
meetings and 114 presentations where at

00:41:57,029 --> 00:42:02,160
least 26 of them or me so I apologize to

00:41:59,849 --> 00:42:05,490
most of you for those possibly the 10

00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:09,660
other that are labeled as you which

00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:12,569
generally meant me we've had 38 total

00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:14,900
presenters many of them who are not

00:42:12,569 --> 00:42:18,779
local who were swinging through town and

00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:21,150
had to present because I asked them and

00:42:18,779 --> 00:42:26,220
we've had 10 different hosts to sponsor

00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:29,369
locations getting more and more official

00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:30,779
as we got better at asking like when I

00:42:29,369 --> 00:42:33,599
started the Rubicon project we sort of

00:42:30,779 --> 00:42:35,220
just snuck in at night and like well

00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:38,700
they already had free beers so it kind

00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:40,289
of worked out and this really helped me

00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:44,609
during my five years in the wilderness

00:42:40,289 --> 00:42:46,140
when I was at Python shops for two

00:42:44,609 --> 00:42:48,059
reasons one you know it sort of kept me

00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:51,509
connected I would still read a module

00:42:48,059 --> 00:42:53,220
and have to do a presentation and found

00:42:51,509 --> 00:42:57,869
that you can force them to host your

00:42:53,220 --> 00:43:00,569
meetings as well so I had over 42 and

00:42:57,869 --> 00:43:03,089
man media both sort of got suckered into

00:43:00,569 --> 00:43:05,160
hosting and then they actually had

00:43:03,089 --> 00:43:07,890
marketing people so we've got pizzas and

00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:09,630
beers and that's a regular feature of

00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:14,490
our events now so come for a beverage

00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:17,759
some pizza our website is driven by one

00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:20,430
handcrafted occasional demo file and

00:43:17,759 --> 00:43:22,559
it's how I went and got these numbers

00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:25,170
although when I started pulling them out

00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:27,269
at midnight I found out mmm some of the

00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:28,200
old records were not in there and so of

00:43:27,269 --> 00:43:30,779
course I had to bring it all up to date

00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:32,789
so that I could run my tools

00:43:30,779 --> 00:43:37,049
we were one of the first ones to have

00:43:32,789 --> 00:43:39,210
restarted to we're like second third row

00:43:37,049 --> 00:43:41,009
mongers but I don't know anything about

00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:43,410
the mists of time it was just kind of

00:43:41,009 --> 00:43:46,710
dead I took two or three years to get

00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:49,740
the handle of the email address handed

00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:52,829
over before they thought I was real and

00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:55,410
four or five for some of the other

00:43:52,829 --> 00:43:58,950
things but we have a lot of fun I'd like

00:43:55,410 --> 00:44:01,470
to we've got our top presenters a couple

00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:04,650
I want to shout out to Aaron who was

00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:06,869
running to you and then when he came

00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:08,369
down and was like phew I'm done I gave

00:44:06,869 --> 00:44:13,470
that away and then I made him present

00:44:08,369 --> 00:44:16,009
down in Los Angeles Randall has not

00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:18,539
surprisingly been been prolific and

00:44:25,109 --> 00:44:31,460

you can tell from the tone of our

00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:50,890
presentation here this is what we aim

00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:55,840
for

00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:57,520
it's a sociable technical meeting when

00:46:55,840 --> 00:47:01,540
I'm talking at least that's one fewer

00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:04,390
heckler so that is good but we try to be

00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:07,180
welcoming to well-established presenters

00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:09,940
and first-timers and you guys are in

00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:11,410
luck we we ran through a bunch of the ab

00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:14,170
c-- talks that are gonna be here the

00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:16,540
last three months and they've gone from

00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:19,320
great to phenomenal so you should go

00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:23,469
watch this so thank you very much

00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:23,469
[Applause]

00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:29,580
so yeah I don't know how many people

00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:32,040
here actually worked on a pro mongrel

00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:33,869
like organizing a pro monger group and

00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:37,350
one of the thing is what used to be to

00:47:33,869 --> 00:47:40,290
get the WebDAV account so you could have

00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:42,030
the the group itself and it included the

00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:44,430
web hosting and included like a bunch of

00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:46,430
stuff and this was all handled by Robert

00:47:44,430 --> 00:47:50,910
and he deserves a lot of things for it

00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:52,290
yes but that's that's now why I

00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:55,950
mentioned this I have a short anecdote

00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:58,619
I'm sorry so so I remember when in

00:47:55,950 --> 00:48:00,210
Amsterdam there's MCM X there's m7 p.m.

00:47:58,619 --> 00:48:02,010
which is the am Sam Pro mongrels group

00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:05,490
which doesn't mean in Amsterdam exactly

00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:07,020
and then I started one called MCM X and

00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:08,850
the idea was to have it like like

00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:10,950
optimized for expats with like it's

00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:13,109
English instead of Dutch its earliest of

00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:15,150
later you know different stuff it

00:48:13,109 --> 00:48:16,710
doesn't really matter nowadays but when

00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:18,600
it started I remember Robert rejecting

00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:25,080
it basically saying you cannot start a

00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:28,619
group named after you so so yeah okay so

00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:30,270
we have only 17 more speakers it's fine

00:48:28,619 --> 00:48:34,800
everyone's alive okay

00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:37,590
so actually our last one so talk Ronaldo

00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:39,600
he's one of the co-organizers helping

00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:42,510
with this he's the one organizing this

00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:44,010
one and he's in p5p he worked on the

00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:47,820
grab medicine man he's like a bunch of

00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:48,900
stuff and he also works on use NPM I

00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:51,270
don't know if you notice this theme

00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:52,920
where you're a person that just likes to

00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:55,500
do stuff and then you kind of get roped

00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:58,980
into organizing a pro mangers meeting or

00:48:55,500 --> 00:49:00,960
group so it's a lot of fun I want to

00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:03,500
invite Todd to come and talk about

00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:06,160
euston p.m. close this off where is Todd

00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:12,100
there it is all right hey

00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:15,740
[Applause]

00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:17,150
so we specifically picked this slide

00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:19,940
because I was speaking with somebody

00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:23,120
yesterday about the Yap see that was

00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:25,340
held in Houston way back when and I was

00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:28,370
informed that Houston was a swamp it was

00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:32,180
a hundred 20 percent humidity at all

00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:37,310
times yeah so the I think this is for

00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:39,770
you right so it's already been covered

00:49:37,310 --> 00:49:43,040
but the pearl mongers was started by

00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:44,780
Brian Foy the excuse he gave me when I

00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:48,020
talked to him about this one time was

00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:50,360
that it was his excuse to find a group

00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:57,200
to go drinking with in whatever city he

00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:59,510
happened to visit really okay so he did

00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:07,580
so it was just a vote that's what he

00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:10,340
told me yep it's true so our group got

00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:12,410
started by Wade Johnson and this is the

00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:15,610
only picture of Wade on the internet but

00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:18,560
it's actually a decent likeness of him

00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:21,740
the list the mailing list if you go back

00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:24,650
and look start in like 2002 but in truth

00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:27,940
it really didn't start till 2005 when

00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:33,440
Wade came came along and said hey

00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:37,310
anybody here and Wade started monthly

00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:40,430
meetings back in 2005 and we've pretty

00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:44,720
much had a monthly meeting every month

00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:49,820
since 2005 probably we averaged 11

00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:53,870
meetings a year and we very early on ran

00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:55,520
out of very purl specific topics or some

00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:58,400
months we wouldn't have anything to say

00:50:55,520 --> 00:51:01,730
and so we decided to make it a lot more

00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:03,920
generic and just say well basically

00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:07,010
we'll meet about anything any Perl

00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:09,710
programmer might be interested in it's

00:51:07,010 --> 00:51:11,290
really just a chance for us to sit and

00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:15,440
talk about things that we're all

00:51:11,290 --> 00:51:18,290
interested in unfortunately because of

00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:20,880
the layout of Houston the the social

00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:23,850
option isn't always the best thing to

00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:25,680
bring people all into one location so we

00:51:23,850 --> 00:51:27,270
we meet and we call it a technical

00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:29,250
meeting but sometimes the technical

00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:31,020
meeting is thirty minutes and then we

00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:35,100
spend an hour and a half just talking

00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:41,790
about random topics so I actually got

00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:43,800
started I think it was 2006 and it

00:51:41,790 --> 00:51:45,960
wasn't Wade it was actually Jeremy had

00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:49,950
volunteered to do yamp see in Houston

00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:51,510
and Wade started chipping in and we

00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:54,450
actually did some Yap sea planning

00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:56,640
meetings at our pearl mongers meeting

00:51:54,450 --> 00:52:00,000
monthly meeting Wade

00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:02,280
actually adopted device USB to do a

00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:05,700
project that we were working on and so

00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:10,740
we actually sat in the room and did pure

00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:11,580
coding on a device USB we've had talks

00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:19,350
about DBI

00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:21,510
catalyst mousse DB IX class we've had

00:52:19,350 --> 00:52:24,060
meetings where we say come bring your

00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:27,690
perl issue and will help you whatever

00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:30,630
the problem is we had our CEO Nick

00:52:27,690 --> 00:52:33,740
Causton come and tell us about develop

00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:38,730
my T prof. that is his obsession is

00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:43,050
optimizing all things Perl Wade turns

00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:45,600
out to be a active developer for SVG so

00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:48,540
he has given us multiple presentations

00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:52,470
actually on SVG talking about the SVG

00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:55,710
community and more about that we've had

00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:59,400
JD Lightsey who got involved in Bitcoin

00:52:55,710 --> 00:53:04,230
and came and told us more about the

00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:07,010
Bitcoin world we had an intro to Erlang

00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:10,020
but I'm really trying to block this out

00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:13,080
he basically threw us in the deep end

00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:15,120
and didn't give us a lot of explanation

00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:20,160
of how the language worked and said okay

00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:24,600
here's a problem go solve it and it it

00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:28,410
definitely was a difficult meeting Ruth

00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:30,540
was a former developer on cohosh she may

00:53:28,410 --> 00:53:34,180
actually still be in active developer

00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:37,090
which is a library application

00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:40,780
open source so she came and told us

00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:44,860
about how Quahog works we've had bioperl

00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:45,970
talks and sometimes we just talk about

00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:48,640
general pearl

00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:50,800
we've also tried lightning talks at our

00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:53,710
meetings without the gong of course

00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:55,540
where people just come and talk and and

00:53:53,710 --> 00:53:59,320
have their you know maybe they don't

00:53:55,540 --> 00:54:01,210
have a hour-long talk on the topic but

00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:03,280
they can come and tell you about

00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:05,890
something they're interested in for five

00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:09,100
minutes and that's gone really well too

00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:12,340
much for the same reason that we do it

00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:14,350
at Pearl conference to get first time

00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:17,640
speakers involved that's actually you've

00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:21,070
gotten some future talks out of it too

00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:23,440
so we also do a social meeting once or

00:54:21,070 --> 00:54:27,190
twice a year except it doesn't look like

00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:33,220
this it doesn't look like this it looks

00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:35,980
a lot more like that but it's again it's

00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:38,260
a chance for like-minded people to come

00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:44,230
come and get together and just talk

00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:47,740
about geek topics that interest them so

00:54:44,230 --> 00:54:50,950
where do we meet and this is Houston

00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:55,900
proper that's the 610 loop going around

00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:57,220
Houston and that's that's probably bad

00:54:55,900 --> 00:55:00,520
with distance but let's say it's about

00:54:57,220 --> 00:55:02,790
20 miles from top to bottom there the

00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:09,280
problem is nobody actually lives there

00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:12,120
everybody lives here and and so the

00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:17,250
problem that we have is Houston actually

00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:20,380
some people work from 6:00 to 6:00 to

00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:24,730
was at 6:00 to 2:00 and then others will

00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:26,980
work from 10:00 to 6:00 and so the

00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:28,930
problem is is some people have already

00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:33,460
gone home when we have our perl mongers

00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:36,190
meetings and others or in some cases

00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:40,080
still working so that's been a challenge

00:55:36,190 --> 00:55:42,370
for us in getting attendance is is

00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:45,340
finding a time that works right for

00:55:42,370 --> 00:55:46,560
everybody when people get home and they

00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:49,170
get settled in

00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:51,690
they don't want to go drive another two

00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:55,380
hours across town to go to the pearl

00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:57,390
mongers meeting we experimented with a

00:55:55,380 --> 00:56:00,120
group that that really didn't take off

00:55:57,390 --> 00:56:02,280
actually Toronto PM did a better job

00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:04,800
with it than we did which is called

00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:06,870
hangouts p.m. and the idea was to use

00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:09,840
Google Hangouts to just present whatever

00:56:06,870 --> 00:56:11,840
your meeting was the list is actually

00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:15,740
still active but it's it's almost all

00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:19,230
Toronto pearl mongers that posts on it

00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:20,670
and I wanted to give a shout out to the

00:56:19,230 --> 00:56:22,940
people that have helped us over the

00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:26,880
years by providing a meeting space

00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:28,560
actively right now we meet at cPanel one

00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:31,470
month and Hostgator than the next month

00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:34,620
in the past we met at JP Morgan and how

00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:36,390
PC it's all we've got

00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:44,410
thank you very much

00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:48,710
[Applause]

00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:51,680
I'm gonna let you finish but sterling I

00:56:48,710 --> 00:56:54,050
see you back there has also presented a

00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:56,720
tell a p.m. and would like would like me

00:56:54,050 --> 00:56:58,850
to fix that so Thank You sterling you're

00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:01,250
important to me I don't know why you're

00:56:58,850 --> 00:57:02,450
not in the official record it's as if

00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:05,450
you didn't do it but you just said that

00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:08,150
you did so it must be true and now in

00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:10,160

this language so yeah so like I said the

beginning I just want you to remember

00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:57,530
this this conference is not about the

00:57:55,310 --> 00:58:01,340
language as much as is about everyone

00:57:57,530 --> 00:58:03,350

different roles and jobs that I do but a

00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:44,540
big part of that is thanking people for

00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:45,920
