all right so my name is David Farrell I

00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:07,950
work at zip recruiter comm or zip

00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:10,050
recruiter we're currently hiring but

00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:14,759
today I want to talk about relaunching

00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:17,730
Paul calm past present and future so

00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:19,949
just a brief history of Paul calm tom

00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,740
kristensen registered the domain in the

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:25,500
early 90s and if you'd visited the page

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,650
around 1996 you'd have found something

00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,910
that looks like this

00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:33,329
sorry it's a picture you'll have to

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:36,239
squint at the very top of the page it

00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:38,820
says urgent security announcement in big

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,460
red letters which is good because if

00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,680
it's urgent you want it at the top and

00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:47,940
then there's a nice welcome to moxie

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,770
I'll calm a UNIX quote and then somewhat

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,989
down the page under the subtitle pearl

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,510
there's a link to visit the Perl

00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:57,410
language homepage and beneath that

00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:01,649
there's a Magic the Gathering entry and

00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:04,320
Tom tells me that at this point this

00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:06,960
website was the only online database of

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:10,650
Magic the Gathering cards and the owner

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,290
had no web presence so he would sponsor

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,420
Tom by sending him boxes and boxes of

00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,520
magic cards to keep this thing up to

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,729
date so that's where the tie-in with

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,560
mocks and pearl calm comes in now if he

00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:24,710
clicked that pearl language link you'd

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,759
have seen a page that looks much more

00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:29,640
familiar I think there's some

00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:33,000
iconography we all recognize and under

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,369
important news it says register before

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,159
July 18th for a discount for the

00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:40,979
first-ever Perl conference which sounds

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:45,390
pretty great immediately beneath that it

00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:48,170
says version 504 of Perl is now released

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:53,939
and there's a link to download it there

00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:57,240
ok fast-forwarding to 2002 we now see

00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:59,520
pearl calm is O'Reilly pearl calm the

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,200
source for Pearl hahaha

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,180
and it looks like a much more

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,060
professional media website there are

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,670
clearly articles being published and

00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:12,750
things about like spam filtering and

00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:13,810
Oracle and stuff like that by 2011 the

00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,670
site had a reader

00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:19,270
it looked more like a traditional blog

00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:23,380
site and by 2014 it went to another

00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:26,319
minor redesign and like this now at this

00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:29,380
point there are over 700 articles

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:32,290
published on pearl calm and the author

00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:35,410
list reads like a who's who of famous

00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:39,880
pearl people you know Larry Damien

00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:42,459
Allison Randall Bryan Warnock published

00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:45,940
an article on pearl calm he's famous for

00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:48,160
the term war nacht so yeah there's a lot

00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:50,620
of good stuff on there the original

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,950
transcripts of Larry's state of the

00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:57,880
onion talks the original pearl six

00:02:53,950 --> 00:03:01,090
design documents pearl six weekly was a

00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:04,330
newsletter published on Pearl calm so a

00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:07,930
lot of history but by this point

00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:11,410
February 2014 chromatic left as the site

00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:15,489
editor and no one replaced him so the

00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:21,820
website grew stale and that made me very

00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:24,310
sad so in the present time which is June

00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:28,120
last year obviously date/time Methos

00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:30,640
hard at the last pearl conference I

00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,609
approached Jim Brandt and I said hey

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,400
Paul comms really stale here's a really

00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:39,010
easy way we can keep it up to date let's

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,590
just publish the pearly Bob feed of

00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:43,450
pearl community articles and we won't

00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:46,450
need an site editor or anyone to write

00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:48,480
anything new and Jim said mmm that's an

00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:53,380
interesting idea let me think about that

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,819
so we kept in touch and over the ensuing

00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:57,430
few weeks we realized that that was

00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:59,859
actually a pretty bad idea and what we

00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:02,920
really wanted to do was convert pearl

00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:03,489
calm sauce to be marked down based so at

00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:07,000
this point

00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:09,420
Paul calms assets were all HTML and

00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,660
images and media files there was no

00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:15,130
movable type code creating the site we

00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:18,340
also wanted to merge it with pearl

00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:21,340
tricks calm we needed a new editor and

00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:23,860
writer of articles we needed to improve

00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:26,080
the contributing docs to get new authors

00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,980
and we needed to contact pearl comp

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,010
companies

00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:32,710
sponsored posts and Jim is such a great

00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:35,200
leader that he not only got me to agree

00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:40,540
to do this but he convinced me that it

00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:44,380
was my idea so what did I get handed I

00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:47,290
got a table all of the web server assets

00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:51,610
basically HTML files images that kind of

00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:54,580
thing in a huge directory I looked for

00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:56,260
an article index and there was a CSV

00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:59,170
file but it only covered articles

00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:01,330
published until the mid-2000s so many

00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:04,920
articles weren't covered the newer

00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:07,540
articles they had embedded XML which

00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:10,150
defined the metadata of the article you

00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:13,530
know the author the date of publication

00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:13,530
and the title of the article

00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:19,240
pokum had this feature where if you went

00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:21,370
to a year and then slash month it would

00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:24,640
list all the articles published in that

00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:26,920
month but if you went to slash day after

00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,140
that path it would list the articles

00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,240
published on that day so there were

00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:33,370
duplicate files throughout the

00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,870
directories where we had you know an

00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:36,250
article published on a certain day was

00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:38,320
also in the directory published on a

00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,430
certain month and they didn't always

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:44,860
have the same chars

00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:47,170
so deduplication wasn't easy so that

00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:49,240
sounds like quite a massive text to be

00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:52,390
working with and it sounds like quite a

00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,870
hard job but actually if you speak

00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:57,430
chainsaw it's not that hard a job

00:05:54,870 --> 00:06:01,600
basically I just created a new article

00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:04,360
index discovering content in the tarball

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,300
and then I wrote some code to take an

00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:09,580
index entry and extract the article

00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:12,180
content and calculate the metadata and

00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:16,420
print it to a new file and that was it

00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:20,290
so that left us with 712 pearl calm

00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:22,810
articles converted to markdown 266 poll

00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:26,980
tricks articles ported and that covered

00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:28,840
the period 2013 to 2017 so conveniently

00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:33,700
we now have a continuous history of

00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:36,190
articles going back to 1996 all the new

00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:38,920
articles were categorized and given tags

00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:39,430
most of them have tags we added a search

00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,870
box

00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:44,800
powered by DuckDuckGo

00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:46,810
and a new design I took the colors of

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,400
pearl calm and the layout of pearl

00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:50,919
tricks calm

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,449
it's a bootstrap based design I think it

00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:55,330
looks a lot better than it did it's not

00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:59,229
great the mobile handling is rather

00:06:55,330 --> 00:07:01,240
rudimentary but it's it works we've also

00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:04,180
got social media integration so if you

00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:06,570
post a link to pearl calm on Facebook or

00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:10,240
on Twitter you'll see a nicely formatted

00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:12,970
card where it shows the article image

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:16,600
the title the author and the article

00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:18,430
description probably the biggest change

00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:21,160
though is that the whole thing is hosted

00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:24,970
on github in a public repo which is

00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:28,240
under t PF / pearl calm so now everyone

00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:33,520
is free to submit pull requests fix

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:36,450
typos and articles and so on so we

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,590
relaunched the site in mid-december and

00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:41,380
it wouldn't have been possible without

00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:43,060
asking Robert's help there the pearl dot

00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:45,840
org system administrators and they

00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:47,320
provided hosting and github integration

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,320
Brian Foy

00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:53,200
also helped out he's been working

00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:56,110
effectively as a co-editor editing new

00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:58,210
articles fixing bugs suggesting new

00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:00,400
improvements and finding people to write

00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:04,060
for the site as well so thank you to all

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:07,090
of those guys we managed to publish 35

00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:10,479
new articles and I'm really happy that

00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:13,570
of those articles 9 were written by

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:15,610
first-time authors on Perl calm so

00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:17,530
thanks to these people we were able to

00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:21,430
publish more articles than we would have

00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:24,460
otherwise we also got repo contributions

00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:27,250
people that opened Perl requests merge

00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:29,470
requests and we pull requests and we

00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:31,570
merge them into master so thanks to

00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:36,279
these people for submitting fixes to

00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:38,200
Paul calm so with all that activity you

00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:40,779
might be curious as to how we've done in

00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:43,779
terms of page views on the site so this

00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:46,120
chart shows the 6-month period

00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:49,270
immediately before relaunching the site

00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:53,380
and the six months after the orange line

00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:55,740
is the period before we relaunched

00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:58,450
and basically what this shows is that

00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:02,950
all of our analytics metrics have

00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:05,050
improved pageviews are up about 47% so

00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:09,130
in six months we had two hundred and

00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:12,760
seventy-one thousand pages users are up

00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:15,010
17% or a hundred and forty thousand

00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:17,560
different users came to the site since

00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:19,870
we relaunched and our bounce rate is

00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,700
down about five percent so people are

00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:26,320
slightly more likely to stay on the site

00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:28,210
once they get there so I thought those

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,010
were good numbers but not great numbers

00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:33,220
and I was curious to see why that was

00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:36,180
the case so for the last six months

00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:39,070
our most popular articles have been B's

00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:41,740
and what you'll notice about these is

00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:45,970
that of the top five articles only one

00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:51,190
was written this year looking at our

00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:54,070
source traffic we can see that 64% of

00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:56,140
our traffic source is organic search so

00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:58,150
those are people entering terms into

00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:00,760
Google they have something they want to

00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:04,420
discover about pearl pearl calm comes up

00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:06,730
and they click the link about 18% of our

00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:10,240
traffic is direct I think that's coming

00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:13,720
from places like Pearl Weekly and RSS

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:16,270
readers and 14% of our traffic is

00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:21,870
referral traffic from pearl tricks calm

00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:24,250
which has a redirect to poll calm now so

00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:27,700
if we compare one of those popular

00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:29,890
legacy articles with that popular new

00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:32,500
article we see completely different

00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:35,470
behavior in terms of pageviews the

00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,160
legacy article averages about 800 page

00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:38,890
views a week

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:41,440
the modern article the week it was

00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:44,140
published got almost three thousand page

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:47,290
views and that quickly declined to about

00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:50,860
1800 500 and then about a hundred a day

00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:53,920
a hundred a week thereafter so the top

00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:55,900
chart is organic search traffic and the

00:10:53,920 --> 00:11:00,970
bottom chart represents the purl

00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:02,560
community like us the modern article is

00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:04,300
interesting to us at the time it's

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,790
published because it's community news it

00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:10,120
was rather controversial

00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:11,710
but as time moves on it's increasingly

00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:13,660
less interesting to us and if you've

00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:18,880
read it once you probably don't go back

00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:19,780
and read it again so in the future what

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,170
can we do about that

00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:25,330
well my objective is to get more page

00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:28,000
views for Paul calm

00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:31,900
I think page views are a proxy for the

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,520
popularity of Perl and I think more

00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,440
people coming to the site means more

00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:38,310
people reading about Perl thinking about

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,930
Perl talking about Perl and hopefully

00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:43,300
linking to pearl comm on social media

00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:45,460
that kind of thing I also think the new

00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:48,520
version of Perl comm does a better job

00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:50,590
of supporting the community for the past

00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:53,230
two months we've run a banner ad for

00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:56,350
this conference and that's shown on

00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:58,330
almost every page on the website so if

00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:01,630
you think we had a hundred and forty

00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:05,440
thousand users in six months and that

00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:07,270
banner ad ran for about two months it's

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,280
not unreasonable to think that around

00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:13,060
about forty five thousand people saw

00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:15,970
that ad we also have links to the Perl

00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:18,790
Foundation Twitter account the Perl

00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:21,910
subreddit and other community articles

00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:24,940
like things posted on blog spell dot org

00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:28,000
so what I'm trying to say is more

00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:31,030
popular / calm is better for all of us

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,330
and all of our assets connected to pearl

00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:37,000
calm as well so how do we get more page

00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:39,790
views well we need to publish more

00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,100
popular articles we need to publish more

00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:46,750
frequently and we need to keep visitors

00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:49,720
for longer so more popular articles well

00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:53,230
we need more beginner topics it's

00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:55,810
telling that in the of the top 10 most

00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:59,920
popular articles three of them have the

00:12:55,810 --> 00:13:01,930
word beginning in the title and I think

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:05,200
one way we can do that is we can mine ad

00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:07,800
words to find out what our popular

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,660
search topics that we're not currently

00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:13,270
supporting on the site and potentially

00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:17,560
we could create bounties for articles to

00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:19,810
be written publishing more frequently I

00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,529
need to do a better job of asking for

00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:22,720
help and

00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:25,600
reaching out more and this talk is part

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,879
of that we need better contributing Docs

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,879
I have a open issue that I'm working on

00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:32,259
and about a third of the way through I

00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:34,870
think we could do a better job of

00:13:32,259 --> 00:13:37,569
recognizing and rewarding people that do

00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:40,480
contribute to the site Bryan suggested

00:13:37,569 --> 00:13:42,730
adding a list of authors and

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,699
contributors to the about page for

00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:48,610
instance which seems like an easy win we

00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:50,949
could also send authors a thank-you note

00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:53,319
and maybe a pearl calm sticker which is

00:13:50,949 --> 00:13:55,660
pretty low cost or potentially we could

00:13:53,319 --> 00:13:58,360
pay authors for writing articles for

00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:00,490
pearl calm that gets a little bit more

00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,959
complicated with employment more and

00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:04,480
things like that I'm not sure if that's

00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:06,970
possible but potentially it's something

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,970
we could look at so coming back to the

00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:11,649
idea of article bounties one thing that

00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:14,589
Jim and I talked about was having

00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:16,360
corporate sponsorship and what I did was

00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:19,269
reach out to about twenty different

00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:22,149
companies saying if you write an article

00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:23,980
for Pearl calm we will include an ad for

00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:26,339
your company on the site you can say

00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:28,930
something like and we're hiring and

00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:31,689
every company said that's a great idea

00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:35,370
we'd love to help but only one company

00:14:31,689 --> 00:14:38,379
actually sent an article thank you even

00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:41,350
and I don't blame the companies for that

00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:43,240
I think it was probably a bad proposal

00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:45,670
if you think about it if you're working

00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,500
at a company you've got to then find

00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:50,410
someone who wants to write an article

00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:52,420
has the time to write an article knows

00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:54,519
what they want to write about right and

00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:56,170
then you've got to have to review what

00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:59,079
they wrote before you send it back to us

00:14:56,170 --> 00:15:01,480
for publication if you're a busy company

00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:04,509
like writing an article for Pearl comm

00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:07,990
is not on your list of priorities no one

00:15:04,509 --> 00:15:12,279
is getting reviewed on how well they did

00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:13,929
writing articles for us so I think maybe

00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:16,889
a better model is to come up with

00:15:13,929 --> 00:15:21,399
article bounties where companies can say

00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:24,069
pay us several thousand dollars for an

00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:27,459
article series on whatever beginner

00:15:24,069 --> 00:15:28,870
topic we've identified and it's easy for

00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:31,629
them because they give us the money and

00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:34,240
they tell us what ad they want to run

00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:36,730
and we can take that money and donate it

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,500
- the TPF or potentially pay authors or

00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:43,089
something else so I think that's a

00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:45,370
better model but we'll see in terms of

00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:47,740
keeping visitors for longer an obvious

00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:50,589
thing we can do is add a you may also

00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:53,709
like widget to the bottom of every

00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:56,260
article the other thing that's been

00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:58,750
mentioned is adding an archive page -

00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:01,810
pearl calm this would be like an index

00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:05,260
by year and month of every article now

00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:06,610
personally I don't browse websites that

00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:09,100
way so I didn't think that was a

00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:10,810
particularly useful thing to do but more

00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:13,089
than one person has suggested it to me

00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:15,850
and I think it's a really easy thing to

00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:18,250
do so even if it only helps a little bit

00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:23,529
like there's no real cost to doing it so

00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:25,510
we should do that - okay so that's

00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:28,089
pretty much everything I wanted to say

00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:30,670
about pearl calm those are some of our

00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:33,880
plans for the future of what we're going

00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:36,490
to work on if you have some suggestions

00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:38,680
I'd love to hear them if you'd like to

00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:41,920
write an article for pearl calm even

00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,370
better my email address is on the

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,760
website

00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:49,140
I'm also on Sipan or just come talk to

00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,140
me at the conference thank you

00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,730
various opposed to companies like Lindo

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,160
paid for articles on how to do things

00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:09,290
with painting services people always

00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:11,329
looking for how to get the interns going

00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:14,569
and I know that I've talked to Sawyer

00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:16,730
about to the dance or two and might be

00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:19,189
useful to start creating some best

00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:20,990
practices with Perl and the lamp stack

00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:24,400
it comes it sort of the sort of saying

00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:26,430
here's how you here's how you build and

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:30,420
host the

00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:34,020
a REST API using the answer to or just

00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:38,540
something that would put together in the

00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:38,540
context of the tools that are available

00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:47,159
but my mashing try to do something

00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:49,350
yeah thanks I think it can be hard to

00:17:47,159 --> 00:17:51,090
come up with article topics after a

00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:52,980
while like it feels like almost

00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:56,460
everything has been said about Pearl

00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:59,510
that's possible to say but it's not true

00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:03,390
like if you scratch the surface there's

00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:06,059
you know there's for instance what's new

00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:08,580
on Sipan right there are 30 new

00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:10,830
good-quality modules uploaded to Sipan

00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:12,570
every month that's one source another

00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:14,610
one is looking at things like that we're

00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:17,029
just an angle that we haven't considered

00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:17,029
before

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:42,330
show some some water use cases yeah yeah

00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:56,380
sounds good to me

00:18:42,330 --> 00:19:21,309
yep you did all right thank you

00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:28,799
Thanks that could be a source yeah yeah

00:19:21,309 --> 00:19:28,799
okay thanks all right well

00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:50,429
yeah yeah okay yep yeah that's a good

00:19:46,169 --> 00:19:54,690
question I don't know rejection such a

00:19:50,429 --> 00:19:58,440
hard word I think we can always nearly

00:19:54,690 --> 00:20:01,049
always finesse an article actually Liz's

00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:06,450
article which was the most popular one

00:20:01,049 --> 00:20:09,629
published this year yeah that was

00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:12,149
probably the most contentious editorial

00:20:09,629 --> 00:20:13,980
cycle we went through where I took what

00:20:12,149 --> 00:20:16,200
lizzard written and I thought oh my god

00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:19,700
I've got to go to soften this a little

00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:23,730
bit and we went back and forth but I

00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:27,299
think we were both good at respecting

00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:30,359
what we were trying to accomplish and it

00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:31,559
was important to me to not remove Liz's

00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:33,929
message and what she was trying to say

00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:36,179
and I probably went a little bit far and

00:20:33,929 --> 00:20:44,960
then she came back and you know we ended

00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:44,960
up with a really great article so I yeah

00:20:51,120 --> 00:21:10,559
Paige started yeah do you know that

00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:13,650
pearl calm used to publish lightning

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:31,620
articles so maybe we need to go back to

00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:33,570
that 10 watt yeah yeah no I think it's a

00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:35,450
good idea and the other thing that's

00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:38,220
good about that is we could have

00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:40,590
regularly repeating series of articles

00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:42,929
and that makes it so much easier because

00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:45,300
you know what you need to write you just

00:21:42,929 --> 00:21:51,890
need to find the particular content that

00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:51,890
matches the article topic oh yeah

00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:14,530
yeah I mean yeah look at those most

00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:18,910
popular articles like em JD's article

00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:21,700
from 1999 on DB I like a DB is great I

00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:23,620
still use it but I'm sure there are more

00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:27,280
things we can say about DB I now than we

00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:29,830
could you know 19 years ago yeah I even

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,450
go so far it's just a duplicate contents

00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:33,520
not really a problem these days is this

00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:37,919
gonna be the next you actually more

00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,919
topic you have two similar topics

00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:53,340
okay so yeah that is worth saying this

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:58,020
so that's right there's no comments on

00:22:53,340 --> 00:23:01,559
pearl calm and though I don't believe

00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:06,740
there were before maybe there has been

00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:10,730
at some point but I think comments are

00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:12,870
if you manage a site comments are a risk

00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:15,990
comments need to be managed and that's

00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:18,600
more work so what we try to do is post

00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:20,520
every article to read it and people post

00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:23,160
there and we have a pretty good

00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:25,590
community on reddit of about eight or

00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:30,000
nine mods who are online a lot of the

00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:31,620
time so we tend to point people to read

00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,169
it we think that's a good platform for

00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:36,240
discussing it but it's not because we

00:23:34,169 --> 00:23:38,640
hate commentary about pearl calm it's

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,410
just we already have a place for

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,049
comments and managing it on their own

00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:55,290
site is just more work and we got more

00:23:43,049 --> 00:24:00,750
priorities yeah but he he didn't do it

00:23:55,290 --> 00:24:03,540
he did it on his own dime right yeah he

00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:05,730
I when he submitted that article I said

00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:12,960
oh did so-and-so reach out to you and

00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:14,669
he's like no I just wanted to do it but

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,530
that's a good distinction to make of

00:24:14,669 --> 00:24:18,480
those companies it's not like we haven't

00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:20,490
had submissions from people working at

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:25,320
those companies we have yeah that's fair

00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:27,380
so thank you see panel all right thank

00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,380
you

00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,930
